Maharaja Nabakrishna Deb (1737–97), founder of the Shobhabazar Rajbari (at 35), started life as a modest aristocrat but soon amassed considerable wealth in his service to the British, in particular by his role in assisting to topple Siraj ud-Daulah. During his lifetime Raja Nabakrishna Deb built two houses. The building at 35 Raja Nabakrishna Street (known as Shobhabazar Rajbari or \\"Baag ola Bari - House with the lions\\"), on the northern side of the road, was the one first constructed by him, subsequently inherited by his adopted son from his elder brother Gopimohan and his descendants including his son Radhakanta Deb. The house at 33 Raja Nabakrishna Street (known as Choto Rajbari) was built by him when a son was born to him later in life, and was left to his biological son Rajkrishna and his descendants. ==Role in Cultural and Social life of Bengal== * Raja Nabakrishna Deb celebrated Durga Puja in 1757 on a grand scale after the British defeated Siraj-ud-Daulah at the battle of Plassey.

The film earned a moderate profit. The second production was Vaazhvile Oru Naal (1956) with Sivaji Ganesan and G. Varalakshmi in the lead roles. The third attempt was a film titled, Sirikkum Silai with MGR with the expectation of recovering the money that were lost in their previous films, but the production had to be given up within a few days of shooting. They tried a fourth attempt in the film Adichathu Yoham with Ravichandran which unfortunately had also to be shelved in the middle. They incurred heavy losses due to these two films. She was also a playback singer. She sang for N. S. Saroja in Kannagi (1942), T. D. Kusalakumari in Pona Machan Thirumbi Vanthaan (1954) and G.

Filur released four studio albums: Exciting Comfort (2000), Deeply Superficial (2002), Into the Wasteland (2006), Faces (2011) and the “Best Of compilation” In Retrospect (2009). They are known for the hits „Its Alright“, \\"I Want You\\" and later for \\"The Con\\" and \\"Concentrate!\\" and for working with guest vocalists such as Stina Nordenstam, Pernille Rosendahl, Magnum Coltrane Price, Simon Kvamm (Nephew), Daniel Agust (GusGus), Josephine Philip (Darkness Falls), Nellie Ettison and many more. They frequently toured the United States, Europe and Japan where they also reached the top of Tokyo Hot 100 chart and sold 40.000 albums. Filur played Arena Stage at Roskilde Festival as their final liveshow in 2003. After that they only performed as DJs. Filur won two DMA Awards for \\"Best Producers\\" and \\"Best Dance Album\\" and several other awards incl. a DR P3 Guld award for Best Hit. Filur stopped in 2012. Solo and production Since 2007 Kasper Bjørke has been producing and releasing music under his own name. His first solo album In Gumbo (2007) released on NYC label Plant Music, is drawing on elements from rave-rock, disco, kraut, house, techno and electro. Two singles from the album, \\"Back and Spine\\" and \\"Doesn't Matter\\", both appeared on heavy rotation on Danish National Radio DR P3. That was followed by a second album Standing on Top of Utopia (2010). The first single from the album \\"Young Again\\" became another hit and featured the vocals of Jacob Bellens, the singer of I Got You On Tape and Murder. Kaspers cover version of “Heaven” (The Rolling Stones) featured Louise Foo (Giana Factory) and got a remix by Nicolas Jaar, which received great attention from DJs around the globe. Other collaborators on the album included Dennis Young (Liquid Liquid) and the Italian string composer Davide Rossi (Goldfrapp, Coldplay, Jon Hopkins, The Verve). Fool, the “tongue in cheek” self-ironic entitled third album, is another tour de force in Kasper Bjørke’s signature production style – this time wrapped up as a concept album and released on Fool’s day, 1 April 2012. Like a vinyl record, the track list has been split into two sides: The pop infused vocal-based bittersweet love songs of the “Hungry side” is halfway through taken over by an Overture that leads into the darker and mainly instrumental “Foolish side”, containing spaced out psychedelic trips and no- wave disco voyages. Bjørke continues his close collaboration with Jacob Bellens who is featured on 4 songs on the album (five on the digital version), including the first single „Lose Yourself to Jenny“. The other guest-artists are Emma Acs and one of Kaspers main inspirations: Laid Back. On the visual side, the album is perfectly complemented by the artwork of the British producer and designer Trevor Jackson. Kaspers fourth studio album is scheduled for an autumn 2014 release on German hfn music Sideprojects Together with Tomas Barfod Kasper formed the DJ/party project Superbacon and released an EP on Mirau Musik in 2010 and performed at Roskilde Festival as well as venues around Europe. From 2009 to 2010 Kasper Bjørke also released under the moniker Kasper Bjørke & His Friendly Ghost on Compost Black Records et.al. Since 2012 Kasper Bjørke is teaming up with Jón Atli Helgason (aka Sexy Lazer) for the camp project The Mansisters. They so far released EPs on My Favorite Robot and Correspondant Records while performing at venues and festivals around Europe. Kasper is also producing a full album for Jacob Bellens and constantly is working on new, other projects. Remixes Remixes are a vital part from the beginning of Kasper Bjørkes career. He has been remixing artists like Moby, Trentemøller, Ilya Santana, Wareika, Michoacan, Gluteus Maximus, WhoMadeWho, Darkness Falls, Laid Back, Martin Brodin, Human Woman, Reptile Youth, etc.. In return Kasper Bjørke also curated a string of remixes of his music by artists like Nicolas Jaar, Trentemøller, Kenton Slash Demon, Mano Le Tough, Wareika, Catz’n’Dogz et.al. A selection of the best remix works has been released on the digital album Remix Crusades 2007–2013. DJ As a DJ Kasper Bjørke is travelling the world, playing legendary venues like Le Bain, Output (New York), Fabric (London), Rex Club, Social Club (Paris), Electric Pickle (Miami), Panorama Bar, Kater Holzig, Watergate, (Berlin), D Edge (São Paulo), Gewölbe (Cologne), Kong, Charlie (Münich), Hive (Zurich), Culture Box (Copenhagen), and festivals like Sonar Reykjavik, Roskilde Festival, Calvi On The Rocks, Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival, Trailer Park Festival, Montreaux Jazz Festival, Iceland Airwaves Festival and many more. For two years (2012–2013), Kasper hosted his own radio show “4/4” on Danish national radio DR P6 Beat, playing everything from techno to disco and New Wave classics. Management Right from the beginning of his musical career Kasper Bjørke has also been working in various positions behind the scenes as A&R;, artist manager and all around music entrepreneur. He discovered, developed and signed the artist Oh Land during the 4 years he built the label roster of indie label Fake Diamond (where he also signed artists like Complicated Universal Cum, The Late Great Fitzcarraldos, Darkness Falls, Peder, Kim LAS, Bon Homme etc.), but in 2011 Kasper decided to focus fully on artist management and his own studio releases.

On September 16, 1939 the Swiss Socialist Party expelled Léon Nicole and the party branches loyal to him, citing Nicole's defense of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The majority of the Socialist Party members in Geneva sided with Nicole. In Vaud the Socialist Party was also divided, as the majority led by Jeanneret-Minkine sided with Nicole. In October 1939 Nicole began building a new inter-cantonal organization, mobilizing the organizations supporting him.Jeanneret, Pierre. Popistes: histoire du Parti ouvrier et populaire vaudois, 1943–2001. Lausanne: Éd. d'en Bas, 2002. pp. 34–36 The FSS was founded at a meeting at the Maison du Peuple in Renens on December 3, 1939.Lang, Karl. Solidarité, débats, mouvement: cent ans de Parti socialiste suisse, 1888–1988. Lausanne: Editions d'en bas, 1988. pp. 267–268 Léon Nicole was elected chairman of FSS. An executive committee, with eight members, was also elected. Other committee members included Eugène Masson, Ernest Gloor, Maurice Jeanneret and Albert Karlen. FSS had two press organs, Le Travail and Le Droit du Peuple.Cantini, Claude, and Charles Heimberg. Pour une histoire sociale et antifasciste: contributions d'un autodidacte. Lausanne: Ed. d'En Bas [u.a.], 1999. p. 146 ==Profile== The programme of FSS was almost identical to that of the Swiss Socialist Party. The only key differences between the parties were their views on the international situation, the war and the Soviet Union. As implied by its name, FSS had a federal structure in which the affiliated organizations remained autonomous. The underground Communist Party of Switzerland began working within the FSS.Jeanneret, Pierre. Popistes: histoire du Parti ouvrier et populaire vaudois, 1943–2001. Lausanne: Éd. d'en Bas, 2002. p. 44 ==Ban== On July 5, Le Travail and Le Droit du Peuple were banned by the Swiss government. The government also wished to ban the FSS as such, but found it legally complicated as the party had four members of parliament (Léon Nicole, Jacques Dicker, Ernest Gloor and Eugène Masson). However the Vitznau Commission came up with a compromise solution. At its meeting on April 28, 1941 it decided to equate the activities of the FSS with those of the banned Communist Party, thus paving the way for a ban on the FSS. The FSS was banned on May 27, 1941. Later, its parliamentarians were expelled from the National Council. The Swiss Socialist Party actively supported the banning of the FSS. The FSS continued to exist as an underground movement, though. It supported electoral candidatures of politicians wanting to repeal the ban on the party (such as Florian Delhorbe in Vaud in July 1942 and Professor William Rappard in Geneva in September 1941), and sought an alliance with the German-speaking Landesring of Gottlieb Duttweiler. In the 1943 parliamentary election, the FSS called for a boycott. ==New party== After the dissolution of the Communist International in 1943, a unification process between the FSS and the Communist Party was initiated (within a 'Browderist' framework). There was a hope that the Socialist Party would join the merger, but this proposal was rejected at by the Socialist Party. The FSS and the Communist Party dissolved themselves.

It was opened in 1997 to house objects, pictures and archive material representing Busto Arsizio's industrial history. == Purpose == The museum aims to: *Provide for the collection, preservation and promotion of objects coming from the local textile industry *Promote cultural activities and information to help scientific research, historical and artistic information available in the different areas of expertise around the Museum. ==Ottolini’s Cotton Mill== The museum is located in one of the town's oldest industrial districts; Ottolini's Cotton Mill is, in fact, one of the first industrial settlements that was built outside the ancient centre of the former village of Busto Arsizio, in the immediate vicinity of St. Michael's. The first project can be found in the National Archives of Varese in 1857. This building represents one of the best examples of the town's industrial archaeology, wisely maintaining its original features. In 1896, the building was designed with the characteristics of a brick-built medieval castle, with lancet windows, towers and battlements. ==Recent history== On 19 January 1978, the Cotton Mill ceased production because of its outdated equipment. The town of Busto Arsizio acquired the entire area and started the creation of a public park. In 1994, reconstruction of the main building was started. These works led to the establishment of the museum as a reaction to the economic transformation in the area, to preserve objects and memories of everyday life and work as a cultural memory of the region. On 30 January 1997, after some years of restoration, the museum was officially reopened. The museum has three floors as well as two towers and gives the opportunity to follow a wide itinerary, connected with the textile production that was for a long period of time the pride of the local economy. The ground floor and the first floor are equipped with an alternative route which has been specially designed for the visually challenged. ==Exhibits== Ground floor On the ground floor, in addition to a cafeteria and a conference room, there is also early spinning machinery, the large machines for weaving and finishing, and the first 19th-century systems for avoiding industrial accidents, such as fire exstinguishers from the 19th century..

On the walls there are paintings illustrating the textile manufacturing process. Weaving In the weaving department, there is the oldest and most important machine which deserves special attention as it originated from the old wood framing industry from 1813. This is a domestic hand loom used by peasant families. Finally, there is a department dedicated to the life of the workers, plus the two towers one of which is devoted to photography whilst the other explores the myths of the industrial factory in Busto Arsizio. First floor The first floor is dedicated to the history of Jacquard manufacturing, from the original machinery to computers. This level is important for \\"the room of experiences\\", where you can touch the different stages of cotton preparation and you can also see the packaging and delivery of the products.

The ministry was the second one of three occasions when the Government was led by Stevens, as Premier; and second of four occasions where Bruxner served as Deputy Premier. Stevens was first elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1927 and served continuously until 1940. Having served as a senior minister in the Bavin ministry, following the defeat of the Nationalist coalition led by Bavin, who was in poor health, at the 1932 state election, Stevens was elected leader of the newly formed United Australia Party (UAP) in New South Wales and became Opposition Leader. Bruxner was first elected to the Assembly in 1920 and served continuously until 1962. Initially a member of the Progressive Party, he served as party leader in opposition between 1922 and 1925; and resumed leadership in 1932, following the resignation of his successor, Ernest Buttenshaw. By this stage, the party was renamed as the Country Party. The Stevens–Bruxner coalition came to power as a result of the Lang Dismissal Crisis, when the Governor of New South Wales, Philip Game used the reserve power of The Crown to remove Jack Lang as Premier, asking Stevens to form government. Going to the polls a month later, Stevens/Bruxner won a landslide victory at the 1932 state election and were re-elected at the 1935 state election, albeit with a reduced margin.

It is found in Lapland and boreal Asia.\\"Erebia Dalman, 1816\\" at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms The habitat consists of damp grasslands, but this butterfly also occurs on dry grasslands and in waste places, often where shelter is provided by birches or juniper bushes. ==Description== The Arctic woodland ringlet is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of between . Females tend to be a little larger than males. The upperside of both the forewings and hindwings are dark brown with black eyespots with red margins in a row near the edge. In the male the eyespots are small and do not usually have a white centre except possibly the front one. In the female they may be no bigger but many of them have white centres and they may be more numerous forming a continuous line. The underside of the wings is similar to the upperside. This butterfly can be distinguished from the rather similar Lapland ringlet (Erebia embla) and the Arran brown (Erebia ligea) by the fact that it has no white blotches on the under surfaces of the wings. It can be distinguished from the Arctic ringlet (Erebia disa) by the fact that it always has eyespots on its hindwings. ==Distribution and habitat== The Arctic woodland ringlet is native to northern Europe, occurring in northern Norway, Finland and Lapland, up to a height of above sea level. It is typically found on sandy river banks, on damp grassland, at the edges of meadows that are prone to flooding and in drier places with shelter provided by trees and bushes. ==Biology== These butterflies are on the wing in July. Females lay their eggs on grasses such as Festuca ovina, Milium effusum and Poa palustris, the larval host plants. The larvae take nearly two years to develop and are a light tan or pale green with longitudinal stripes including a medial dark stripe. ==Status== The IUCN lists this species as being of \\"least concern\\" as it is not believed to be facing any major threats. ==References== Category:Erebia Category:Butterflies described in 1871 Category:Insects of the Arctic Category:Butterflies of Europe Category:Butterflies of Asia Category:Taxa named by Otto Staudinger ","title":"Erebia polaris"},{"id":"35193021","text":"Dr. Jennifer Crocker is a professor and Ohio Eminent Scholar in Social Psychology at Ohio State University. She is also a former president of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology.

She came to Ohio State in June 2010. ==Awards== She is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association, the American Psychological Society, the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, and the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues. She is President-elect of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, and has received the Lifetime Career Award from the International Society for Self and Identity. She was American Academy of Arts and Sciences Fellow of 2019. ==Research== Crocker studies self-esteem, contingencies of self-worth, and the costs of pursuing self- esteem. She also emphasizes interpersonal goals that are often involved in relationships. Self-esteem and self-worth Crocker is particularly notable for her research on contingencies of self-worth or contingent self- esteem. She created a scale called the Contingencies of Self-Worth Scale. This scale, made up of 65 items, evaluates these contingencies of self-worth and places them in two major categories. She argues that contingencies of self- worth are domains in which self-worth was either externally or internally validated. Contingencies that were considered externally validated included domains such as appearance, competition, and the approval of others. Contingencies that were considered internally validated were family support, virtue, and religious faith. Crocker surmised that it was these contingencies that defined a person's perception of their own self-worth. Because of this emphasis on contingency, level of self-esteem was no longer the issue of concern. Rather, where a person decides to stake his/her self-worth will influence his/her behavior, and depending on where the validation is placed, this behavior could either have costs or benefits. Furthermore, Crocker has studied the effects of contingent self-worth on psychological vulnerability and negative behavior. She is especially interested in how people search for self-esteem by pursuing success in certain areas of life, and how this search affects other human needs such as learning, relationships, self-regulation, and mental and physical health. Crocker has also studied how these variables of self-esteem relate to a person's ability to receive criticism. Through this line of research, she has gone on to research how self-worth defines a person's goals and the kind of motivation that in turn allows for a person to achieve these goals. Crocker acknowledges the benefits of pursuing self- esteem, but her research focuses mainly on the costs because she believes people are often oblivious to the negative effects. She believes that an optimal level of self-esteem may only be achieved in the complete eradication, or absence of, the pursuit itself. Crocker further stipulates that anyone who forms goals based on their own inner values, without any external validation, possesses the kind of motivation that will successfully drive them to achieve these goals, without any costs to the self. Crocker's research also includes applications for her hypothesis on self-esteem and contingencies of self- worth. This research addresses depressive symptoms and alcohol use in college students and the correlation (if any) between the negative behavior and one's self-esteem. The first application is a study on depression in which first- year college students were given assessments during new student orientation and then again during second semester. This study showed that students who pursued self-esteem based on external contingencies (appearance, competition, and the approval of others) showed a significantly higher probability of developing symptoms of depression. According to the research found in this study, low self-esteem is most likely not the cause, but yet a very important symptom relating to the depressive symptoms of college freshmen. A second application of self-esteem gave promising results to pursuing self-esteem, although most of Crocker's research emphasizes the costs to pursuit of self- esteem. Crocker's study of the alcohol use of students uncovered that low self-esteem is not a predictor of alcohol use, but contingencies of self-worth correlated with internal validation (family support, virtue, and religious faith) did predict drinking behavior This shows that some of the contingencies common with the pursuit of self-esteem influence drinking, but levels of self- esteem itself does not. More recently, her research has looked into egosystem and ecosystem goals and their effects on goal achievement, support, responsiveness, and mental health including stress, anxiety, and depression. Egosystem goals are when people only focus on their own needs and desires and ecosystem goals are when people realize they have a connection with others. Crocker found that having an ecosystem could improve relations between different groups. Intergroup relationships are challenging because of the different social identities, but having ecosystem goals can greatly improve these relations. Egosystem goals can cause destructive interactions, while ecosystem goals can create positive relations because they support, understand, and care for them and have better communication skills. Her current research seeks to examine how interpersonal goals shape physiological processes and how they affect other people. She is also studying the effects of interpersonal goals for cross-race relationships.  Interpersonal goals  In recognizing the importance of self-image, Crocker has dedicated a great majority of her research to this idea as it relates to interpersonal goals, which are goals meant to attain, maintain, or avoid a specific end state for the partner or the relationship, such as to help the partner, maintain closeness, or avoid rejection. She relates this to the self by classifying interpersonal goals according to two different outlooks. Those who adopt a narrowly self-interested egosystem perspective tend to prioritize their own needs and desires even at the expense of others. Other people are only deemed to be important if they are able to potentially satisfy or stand in the way of one's own needs and desires. In this perspective, people have what she calls self-image goals. Crocker suggests this perspective causes people to be concerned with the impressions others hold of them. Job interviews, college applications, and the initial stages of a relationship require people to convey an accurate yet glorified conception of self because they want to be seen as having desirable qualities when engaging with others. People with self-image goals are only concerned with others because they withhold the ability to give approval, inclusion, and validation. Her research emphasizes the cost of self-image goals because they lead people to feel competitive, fearful, confused, depressed, and anxious. In contrast, when people have a broader ecosystem perspective, they tend to give priority to the needs of the self and others. Other people are important because the well-being of one person may indirectly affect the well-being of all in a biological ecosystem. People who have an ecosystem perspective have what Crocker calls compassionate goals. These individuals are equally concerned with the well-being of others and see their own needs and desires as a part of a greater system. An individual's need to belong can be satisfied by being in close relation with others. When people shift their focus to be supportive of close others rather than focus on the image others have of them, they are more responsive. People are more responsive when they have compassionate goals because these goals are motivated by a genuine concern for the well-being of others. As a result, the increase in responsiveness increases others' regard and the individual's own self-esteem. An increase in responsiveness enables people to make a difference in others' lives, which in return increases their self-esteem and relational value. == Notable publications Publications== Her most widely cited publication \\"Social stigma and self-esteem: The self-protective properties of stigma.\\",Crocker, Jennifer; Major, Brenda Psychological Review, Vol 96(4), Oct 1989, 608-630. doi: 10.1037/0033-295X.96.4.608 accessible copy published when she was at the University of Buffalo, has been cited 3378 times Her second most cited paper, A collective self-esteem scale: Self-evaluation of one's social identity has been cited 1721 times.

The Dean Bridge is difficult to view as a whole, but Telford's Lothian Bridge on the A68, also from 1831, is a smaller five-arched version of the same design. The Dean Bridge spans the Water of Leith in the city of Edinburgh on the A90 road to Queensferry on the Firth of Forth. It carries the roadway, long and broad, on four arches rising above the river.H Coghill, Discovering The Water of Leith, John Donald 1988, The bridge was one of the last major works before retirement of the bridge designer, civil engineer Thomas Telford, and was completed in 1831 when he was seventy- three years old. Before the bridge was built the river had been crossed since medieval times at a ford, later by a single-arch stone bridge near the same spot, at the foot of Bell's Brae in the Dean Village. The private Dean Gardens lie under the east side of the bridge on the north bank of the Water of Leith. ==History== The original proposal for a new bridge came from John Learmonth, a former Edinburgh Lord Provost and owner of the Dean estate on the north bank of the river. Following the successful expansion of the New Town on Lord Moray's estate on the south bank, Learmonth wanted to feu his land on the north side to create a further extension, but needed a more convenient link to the town over the gorge at Randolph Cliff, while also providing an impressive approach to his development. Learmonth was prepared to meet the cost himself, estimated at £18,556, but in 1828 the Cramond Road Trustees, responsible for public roads in the district, agreed to part-fund a new bridge on condition that it would be designed by Britain’s foremost bridge builder and be toll- free.E F Catford, Edinburgh, The story of a city, Hutchinson 1975, The contract was given to Aberdeen builder, John Gibb, with whom Telford had worked on the building of Aberdeen harbour. Work began in 1829 and was completed by the end of 1831. The stone was brought from Craigleith quarry near the village of Blackhall. Weight and cost were saved by building hollow piers, a feature which facilitates their effective inspection today. The footway was carried on outer segmental arches, the wooden supports of which had to be carefully removed, slowly and evenly, to allow the finished bridge to settle uniformly into its final position. The resident engineer for the Works was Charles Athertonhttps://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Charles_Atherton, who later acted as resident engineer on Telford's Broomielaw Bridge in Glasgow The bridge was completed at the end of 1831.A Kersting and M Lindsay, The Buildings of Edinburgh, 1987 Between completion and the contract hand-over date, Gibb had a toll-gate erected at each end of the bridge and charged pedestrians one penny per head to enjoy the view from the structure. The opening date was early in 1832, though the bridge was not opened to horse and cart traffic until May 1834. Learmonth died in 1858 before completion of most of his envisaged residential development. Owing to a sudden lull in building, Clarendon Crescent was not built until the 1850s, and Buckingham Terrace, Learmonth Terrace and Belgrave Crescent appeared only in the next decade. In 1888, the Edinburgh Corporation asked the Burgh Engineer John Cooper to recommend measures designed to deter suicides which were occurring from the bridge. As a result, the height of the parapet was raised.C Mckean, Edinburgh, An Illustrated Architectural Guide, Edinburgh 1992, In 1957 the Institution of Civil Engineers, of which Telford was first President, installed a plaque on the east parapet to commemorate his bicentenary. This was subsequently stolen but replaced in 1982.M Cant, Villages of Edinburgh Vol 1, John Donald 1989, The bridge is an important location in the novel \\"The Lewis Man\\" by Peter May. ==References== Category:Bridges by Thomas Telford Category:Road bridges in Scotland Category:Viaducts in Scotland Category:Bridges in Edinburgh Category:Former toll bridges in Scotland Category:New Town, Edinburgh Category:Bridges across the Water of Leith Category:Bridges completed in 1831 Category:1831 establishments in Scotland ","title":"Dean Bridge"},{"id":"35193356","text":"46,XX/46,XY is an exceptionally rare chimeric genetic condition characterized by the presence of some cells that express a 46,XX karyotype and some cells that express a 46,XY karyotype in a single human being. The cause of the condition lies in utero with the aggregation of two distinct blastocysts or zygotes (one of which expresses 46,XX and the other of which expresses 46,XY) into a single embryo, which subsequently leads to the development of a single individual with two distinct cell lines, instead of a pair of fraternal twins. 46,XX/46,XY chimeras are the result of the merging of two non-identical twins. This is not to be confused with mosaicism or hybridism, neither of which are chimeric conditions. Since individuals with the condition have two cell lines of the opposite sex, it can also be considered an intersex condition. In humans, sexual dimorphism is a consequence of the XY sex-determination system. In normal prenatal sex differentiation, the male and female embryo is anatomically identical until week 7 of the pregnancy, when the presence or the absence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome causes the undetermined gonadal tissue to undergo differentiation and eventually become a pair of testes or ovaries respectively. The cells of the developing testes produce anti- müllerian hormone (AMH) and androgens, causing the reproductive tract and the genitals of the fetus to differentiate. As individuals with 46,XX/46,XY partially express the SRY gene, the normal process by which an embryo normally develops into a phenotypic male or phenotypic female may be significantly affected causing variation in the gonads, the reproductive tract and the genitals. Despite this, there have been cases of completely normal sex differentiation occurring in 46,XX/ 46,XY individuals reported in the medical literature. 46,XX/46,XY chimerism can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening or in early childhood through genetic testing and direct observation. The rate of incidence is difficult to determine as the majority of diagnoses go unreported in the literature. == Signs & Symptoms ==  Physical  46,XX/ 46,XY is associated with a wide spectrum of different physical presentations, ranging from what was formerly known as \\"true hermaphroditism\\" to a completely normal male or female phenotype. Due to this variation, genetic testing is the only way to reliably make a diagnosis. 46,XX/46,XY is possible if there is direct observation of one or more of the following: # Small phallus midway in size between a clitoris and a penis # Incompletely closed urogenital opening (shallow vagina) # Abnormal urethra opening on the perineum As individuals with 46,XX/46,XY possess both ovarian tissue and testicular tissue, depending on the individual, gonads (ovaries or testes) may function fully, partly or not at all. At puberty, a mix of male and female characteristics may emerge. Some individuals will experience deepening of the voice and secondary hair development, while others may experience breast tissue development. Segmentation of skin (distinct patches of skin) has also been observed. However, this trait is not unique to 46,XX/46,XY chimerism. It has also been observed in other types of chimerism.  Cognitive  Individuals afflicted with the condition do not experience cognitive impairment. == Genetic Mechanism == 46,XX/46,XY is an example of tetragametic chimerism because it requires four gametes – two sperm and two ova. * 46,XX/46,XY is most commonly explained by the in utero combination of two fertilized zygotes. Two ova from the mother are fertilized by two sperm from the father. One sperm contains an X chromosome; the other contains a Y chromosome. The result is that a zygote with an XY genotype and a zygote with an XX genotype are produced. Under normal circumstances, the two resulting zygotes would have gone on to become fraternal twins. However, in 46,XX/46,XY, the two zygotes fuse shortly following fertilization to become a two-cell zygote made up of two different nuclei. The zygotes fuse early enough that there is no risk of them developing into conjoined twins. Variations of this mechanism include fertilization of an ovum and its first or second polar body by two sperm. * 46,XX/46,XY can also be explained by a mosaic-based mechanism. A single zygote is formed from the fertilization of a normal X ovum by an aneuploid XY sperm. The resulting XXY zygote divides to give three cell lines: 46,XX/46,XY/47,XXY. The aneuploid 47,XXY cell line is eliminated during early embryogenesis. The 46,XX/46,XY cell lines remain and go on to become a chimeric individual. * 46,XX/46,XY can also arise when a haploid ovum undergoes a round of mitosis, and the subsequent daughter cells are fertilized by an X and a Y sperm, respectively. == Diagnosis == Diagnosing a chimera is particularly difficult due to the random distribution of 46,XX and 46,XY cells within the body. An organ might be made up of a mix of 46,XX and 46,XY, but it may also be made up entirely of one genotype only. When that is the case, no abnormalities are noted and other types of tissues need to be analyzed.

The city of Boulogne-sur-Mer became the centre of the county of Boulogne during the ninth century. Little is known of the early counts, but the first holder of the title is recorded in the 11th century. Eustace II of Boulogne accompanied William I of England (the Conqueror) during the Norman Conquest in 1066 and fought on his side at the Battle of Hastings. His son, Eustace III, was a major participant in the First Crusade with his younger brothers, Geoffrey and Baldwin (who later became king of Jerusalem). After Baldwin's death the throne was offered to Eustace, who was reluctant and declined; the throne was then offered to Geoffrey. Afonso (also King of Portugal) 1235-1253 from Dammartin became Count of Boulogne. Count Renaud of Boulogne obtained the title by abducting and marrying Countess Ida in 1190, and later gained title to Dammartin and Aumale. An early friend of King Philippe II Augustus, he turned against the king by joining the forces of the Holy Roman Empire at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214 (where he was defeated, captured, imprisoned and committed suicide). Boulogne came under nominal royal control in 1223, when it passed to Philippe Hurepel (\\"spiked hair\\", the son of Philippe II). Hurepel participated in the Albigensian Crusade in 1226 and later revolted in 1229 against Blanche of Castile. He was slain by Count Dietrich V of Cleaves in 1234, according to sources, after accidentally killing Count Florent IV of Holland in a tournament. The county reverted to the crown and was passed to Adelaide of Brabant, wife of William III of Auvergne. Boulogne was attacked and besieged a number of times during the Hundred Years' War, repeatedly passing between the English and French. In 1477 Bertrand VI of La Tour gave the county to Louis XI, who incorporated the county into France. Boulogne remained part of France, except for a brief period of English rule under Henry VIII. William I of Blois (c. 1137 – 11 October 1159) was Count of Boulogne (1153–1159) and Earl of Surrey jure uxoris (1153–1159). He was the third son of King Stephen of England and Countess Matilda I of Boulogne. ==List of counts== Uncertain * ?–882? : Hernequin * ?–?: Odakar V (the Great) * ?–?: Inglebert I * ?–?: Odakar VI * ?–?: Arnoul II House of Flanders Coat of arms of Flanders after about 1200 Coat of arms of Courtenay after about 1200 * 896–918: Baldwin I (also count of Flanders) * 918–933: Adelolf (son) * 933–964: Arnulf I (brother; also count of Flanders) * 964–971: Arnulf II (nephew; son of Adelolf) * 971–990: Arnulf III (son) * 990–1025: Baldwin II (son) * 1025–1049: Eustace I (son) * 1049–1087: Eustace II (son) * 1087–1125: Eustace III (son) * 1125–1151: Matilda I (daughter) House of Blois Coat of arms of Blois after about 1200 * 1125-1151: Stephen (husband; also Count of Mortain, Duke of Normandy and King of England) * 1151–1153: Eustace IV (son; also Count of Mortain) * 1153–1159: William I (brother; also Count of Mortain and Earl of Surrey) * 1159–1170: Mary I (sister; married Matthew of Alsace) House of Metz House of Alsace coat of arms * 1170–1173: Matthew * 1173–1216: Ida (daughter; married Renaud of Dammartin, Count of Dammartine and Count of Aumale) ** 1173–1180: Matthew II ** 1181–1182: Gerard ** 1183–1186: Berthold House of Dammartin Dammartin coat of arms * 1216–1260: Matilda II (also Queen of Portugal, Countess of Mortain, Countess of Aumale and Countess of Dammartin) ** 1223–1235: Philip I (also Count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis) ** 1235–1253: Afonso (also King of Portugal) House of Auvergne Auvergne coat of arms * 1260–1261: Adelaide (cousin; married William III, Count of Auvergne) * 1261–1277: Robert I (son; also Count of Auvergne) * 1277–1314: Robert II (son; also Count of Auvergne) * 1314–1325: Robert III (son; also Count of Auvergne) * 1325–1332: William II (son; also Count of Auvergne) * 1332–1360: Joanna I (daughter; also Countess of Auvergne); married: ** 1338–1346: Philip of Burgundy ** 1350–1360: John II of France House of Burgundy Burgundy coat of arms * 1360–1361: Philip III (son; also Duke of Burgundy, Count of Auvergne, Count of Artois and Count of Franche-Comté) House of Auvergne * 1361–1386: John II (cousin; also Count of Auvergne) * 1386–1404: John III (son; also Count of Auvergne) * 1404–1424: Joanna II (daughter; also Countess of Auvergne); married: ** 1404–1416: John IV (also Duke of Berry) ** 1416–1424: George * 1424–1437: Mary II (cousin; also Countess of Auvergne) House of La Tour d'Auvergne La Tour d'Auvergne coat of arms * 1437–1461: Bertrand I (son; also Count of Auvergne) * 1461–1497: Bertrand II (son; also Count of Auvergne) * 1497–1501: John V (son; also Count of Auvergne) After the death of John V, the County of Boulogne was integrated into the royal domain. ==See also== *Sieges of Boulogne (1544–1546) ==References== Counts of Boulogne Boulogne Boulogne be:Графства Булонь bg:Булон (графство) ca:Comtat de Boulogne de:Grafschaft Boulogne es:Condado de Boulogne eo:Boulogne (graflando) fr:Comté de Boulogne id:Pangeran Boulogne it:Contea di Boulogne nl:Graafschap Boulogne pl:Władcy Boulogne pt:Condado de Bolonha ru:Булонь (графство) ","title":"Count of Boulogne"},{"id":"35193424","text":"Mecyna flavalis is a species of moth in the family Crambidae.

Accompanied by his wife Susanna, son Resolved and two servants, he travelled in 1620 on the historic voyage. He was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact and perished early in the history of Plymouth Colony.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and Her Passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., copyright 2006 Caleb Johnson), pp. 246-247Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 25, 405, 412Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking, 2006), p. 104A genealogical profile of William White == English Origin == The commonness of William White's name has made genealogical research on him difficult. According to genealogist Charles Edward Banks, his surname is one of the dozen most common in England and his baptismal name one of the four most frequently bestowed in that period. As a result, \\"Little is known about Pilgrim William White.\\"Ruth Wilder Sherman, CG, FASG and Robert Moody Sherman, CG, FASG. Re-edited by Robert S. Wakefield, FASG, Mayflower Families through Five Generations: Descendants of the Pilgrims who landed at Plymouth, Mass. December 1620. Vol. 13: Family of William White (Pub. General Society of Mayflower Descendants 2006 3rd Ed.), pp. 2-4.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers (Boston: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006), p. 94 Further, there is confusion about William White in Leiden. Records reveal that there were two men of that name living there, other than Mayflower William White about 1620 and both appear to have been still there after the Mayflower departed. Aside from the William Whites in Leiden confusion, an additional contributing factor was the name of the wife of one of the William Whites – Ann – which erroneously has connected the Whites with the Fuller family. Other evidence of the William White family coming to the Mayflower from England and not Holland comes from William Bradford's passenger list which has \\"Mr. William White\\" in his section for London merchants along with Mr. Christopher Martin, Mr. William Mullins, Mr. Stephen Hopkins, Mr. Richard Warren, and John Billington. It is believed that if William White had been a member of the Leiden congregation, his name would have appeared in Bradford's work for that section, but it does not. There is no evidence to associate the William White of the Mayflower with Leiden, Holland. == The Mayflower Voyage == William White came on board the Mayflower with his pregnant wife Susanna, son Resolved, then about five years in age and two servants. Susanna gave birth to their son Peregrine on board the Mayflower several weeks after White signed the Mayflower Compact.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and Her Passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., copyright 2006 Caleb Johnson), p. 247Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking, 2006), p. 69 The White family, as recalled by William Bradford in 1651, per their Mayflower voyage, and the birth of Peregrine: \\"Mr. William White, and Susana, his wife, and one sone, called Resolved, and one borne a ship-bord, called Peregriene; and *2* servants, named William Holbeck and Edward Thomson.\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 406 Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620, a painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris 1899 The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England, September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter. On November 9/19, 1620, after about 3 months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers, (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920), Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document, pp. 7-19 William White was the eleventh signatory to the Mayflower Compact. His servants William Holbeck and Edward Thompson were not of age and could not sign the Compact. == In Plymouth Colony == William White died late in the first winter on February 21, 1621. With the death of her husband, Susanna White, with newborn Peregrine and five-year-old Resolved, became the only surviving widow out of the many families who perished that winter. By the Spring of 1621, 52 of the 102 persons who originally had arrived on the Mayflower at Cape Cod would be dead.Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking, 2006), pp. 89-90 In May 1621, Susanna White became the first Plymouth colony bride, marrying Edward Winslow, a fellow Mayflower passenger whose wife had perished on March 24, 1621.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 25 At least five children were born to Edward Winslow and his wife Susanna. Pilgrim Village Family Sketch: Edward WinslowWilliam Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation by William Bradford, the second Governor of Plymouth, (Boston: 1856), p. 101 And though deceased, in the 1623 Division of Land, White received five acres (akers) \\"lyeth behind the forte to the little ponde.\\" (lying behind the fort to the little pond). Edward Winslow, his wife Susanna's husband since May 12, 1621, received four acres in the same section. White's sons Resolved and Peregrine were both listed with their step-father Edward Winslow and mother Susanna in the 1627 Division of Cattle, and moved with their parents to Marshfield in 1632.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 416 About 1638, the Winslows moved with Susanna's sons Resolved and Peregrine White, to Green Harbor, now called Marshfield, Massachusetts. Edward Winslow later became Governor of Plymouth County, and was also the colony agent in England. In England, his diplomatic skills soon came to the attention of Oliver Cromwell, the new Puritan leader of the country. Cromwell required Winslow head a joint award reparations commission to assess damage caused by Danish ships.Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War, (New York: Viking 2006), p. 184 Edward Winslow lived in England the last six years of his life, serving the government there. When his will was written in 1654 as resident of London, the document stated that he left his New England property to his son Josiah \\"hee (sic) allowing to my wife a full third parte thereof for her life also\\" so it is probable that his wife did not follow him to London. Edward Winslow died of fever May 7/8, 1655 while on a British military expedition in the Caribbean.David Lindsay, PhD., Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims, (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p. 137Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking 2006), p. 184.David Lindsay, PhD., Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p. 137 There is no trace of Susanna's death beyond a sales record in 1647, and no further record of Susanna has been found. Though she was the wife of one colony governor and the mother of another, the first bride in the colony and the mother of the famed Peregrine White, she seems forgotten in the records. The Mayflower Society has refuted the reported maiden surname of 'Fuller' for Susanna White and has determined that the maiden name of Susanna White is unknown. Further, Susanna ____ (White) Winslow, was not the sister of Dr. Samuel Fuller as is often stated. The Samuel and Edward Fuller who traveled on the Mayflower were sons of Robert Fuller of Redenhall, England. Robert had a daughter Anna, born about 1578, far too old a bride for Winslow who was not born until 1595. The 1615 will of Robert Fuller mentions no daughter named Susanna, nor a daughter married to William White. It does mention Alice Bradford, a sister-in-law. In a letter that Edward Winslow wrote in 1623 to \\"Uncle Robert Jackson\\", he provided news of Susanna, her late husband William White, and her children. He also sends his regards to his father-in-law in England, obviously not Robert Fuller who had been dead for nine years. Another misrepresentation is that William White once lived in Holland. For many years genealogists assumed that William White spent his early married years in Holland, marrying and burying children, but no proof that they apply to the Pilgrim William White, but rather they probably apply to the William White who was still living there in 1621. == Family of William White and Susanna == William White married Susanna ca 1612 (a marriage to Anna Fuller was disproven years ago) Leiden Pilgrim Archives and had two sons. White died on February 21, 1621. Susanna remarried on May 12, 1621 to Edward Winslow and had five children with him. The death date of Susanna is uncertain – sometime between 1654 and 1675. She was buried in Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield where her sons Resolved and Peregrine White and their wives were buried. Edward Winslow died on a British military expedition in the Caribbean in 1655 and was buried at sea. Children of William White and his wife Susanna: * Resolved White was born in England, about 1615. He died sometime after September 19, 1687. He and his first wife Judith were buried in Winslow Cemetery, Marshfield.Memorial for Resolved White :He married: :1. Judith Vassall, daughter of William Vassall, on November 5, 1640 in Scituate. She was born in England ca. 1619, and was buried in the Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield on April 3, 1670. They had eight children born in Scituate between 1642 and 1656. :2. Abigail (____) Lord, widow of William Lord, on October 5, 1674 in Salem. She was born in England ca. 1606 and died in Salem between June 15 and 27, 1682. * Peregrine White was born aboard the ship Mayflower late in November 1620 and died in Marshfield on July 20, 1704. He married Sarah Bassett, daughter of William Bassett, by March 6, 1648/9 and had seven children. She died in Marshfield on January 22, 1711.Memorial for Peregrine White The fate of the White family as recalled by William Bradford in 1651: \\"Mr. White dyed soon after ther landing. His wife married with Mr. Winslow (as is before noted). His *2* sons are married, and Resolved had *5* children, Peregrine tow (sic), all living. So their increase are now *7*.\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 408 == Death of William White == William White died on February 21, 1621. He was buried in Coles Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth, likely in an unmarked grave as with most from the Mayflower who died that first winter. His name appears on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb (sarcophagus) on Coles Hill. The date of death of his wife Susanna, who became the second wife of Edward Winslow, is uncertain. She was buried in the Winslow Cemetery, Marshfield, as were her sons Resolved and Peregrine and their families. Edward Winslow died on a British military expedition in the Caribbean in 1655 and was buried at sea.Memorial for William White == Servants traveling with White family== William Holbeck. He boarded the Mayflower as an indentured servant. He did not sign the Mayflower Compact so it may be presumed he was under the age of 21, possibly in his teens. His surname was not especially a common one. It may be assumed that he came from the same region of England as the White family, but the origins of this family have not been located. William Holbeck died during the first winter at Plymouth. William Bradford reporting that \\"Mr. White and his two servants died soon after landing.\\" Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and Her Passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., copyright 2006 Caleb Johnson), p. 158Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers (Boston: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006), p. 59 Edward Thomson (or Thompson). He boarded the Mayflower as a servant to William White. He did not sign the Mayflower Compact which indicates he was not yet 21 years of age, and was probably in his teens. His English origins are unknown and due to his very common name, difficult to research. He may have come from the same area of England as the White family, whose origins are also unknown. Edward Thompson was the first Mayflower passenger to die, as reported by William Bradford, after the ship's arrival at Cape Cod, probably on December 4, 1620. This was several weeks before the Pilgrims located and decided to settle at Plymouth. Several memorials to him and others from the Mayflower who were the earliest to die exist today at Provincetown on Cape Cod.Caleb H.

As a policy it is an animal welfare policy. Its allocated place is between agricultural policy and food labelling. Although linked to the overall theme of sustainability, animal welfare labels are, however, not to be confused with ecolabels. Claims about animal welfare are commercial communications that inform the consumer (and also commercial purchasers in the supply chain) about the welfare conditions under which a farm animal has been raised. Animal welfare statements essentially carry the message that the way farm animals have been reared, transported and slaughtered exceeds the animal welfare standards required by law. ==Reasoning== There is both an ethical and a commercial element to this. The ethical factor is the wellbeing of the animal. The commercial factor is the upstream market product that is produced observing enhanced welfare standards. Examples are Label Rouge in France (also see Freedom Ranger chickens),Beter Leven in the Netherlands,www.krav.se in Sweden and Freedom Food in the United Kingdom. ==Consumer response and Concerns== Welfare products are attracting a growing number of welfare- conscious consumers. However, there is potential for consumers to be misled by false, exaggerated or unsubstantiated statements about the welfare standards observed in the rearing of farm animals. The lack of legal recognition of animal welfare labels in most countries, as well as the multitude of private labels and government-sponsored schemes and the resulting lack of transparency and comparability, make animal welfare labelling vulnerable to abuse. Without comparable data on the welfare of farm animals it is difficult to ascertain, and to compare claims made about, a product’s production method. Initiatives undertaken by the Global Food Safety Initiativehttp://www.mygfsi.com issue guidance on the topic. For Europe, the Animal Welfare Strategy 2012-2015http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/actionplan/actionplan_en.htm(COM(2012) 6 final of 19 January 2012) provides impetus for further developments.

Piloo Reporter is a Parsi and is known as \\"PD\\" in the cricketing fraternity. The method by which Reporter signaled a boundary has been called \\"Milkshake\\" by cricket commentator Henry Blofeld. In 1986, Reporter and VK Ramaswamy became the first neutral umpires from India when they stood in a Test match featuring Pakistan and West Indies in Lahore. This was the first time neutral umpires had officiated in a Test since 1912. They were invited by the Pakistan captain, Imran Khan after allegations of bias by Pakistani umpires. Reporter was the only Indian umpire to officiate in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. A biography has been written on him, An Umpire Remembers. In 1993, Reporter was allegedly paid to give his assessment of the pitch prior to a test in Calcutta to bookie Mukesh Gupta. Umpire Reporter's sister, Madhumati, was an actress in Bollywood movies.

She was an associate of La Voisin and one of the accused in the famous Poison Affair. Lepère was a licensed midwife who had delivered La Voisin's own children. She performed abortions for clients remitted to her by La Voisin. Lepère was arrested in 1679, as were many other associates of La Voisin, after having been pointed out by Marie Bosse. She admitted having performed abortions, which were illegal at the time, but pointed out that she had prevented many scandals involving upper class ladies by doing so, and that she considered that she had performed a community service. She received her clients from La Voisin, who took almost all the profit. Marie Bosse claimed that fetuses who had been aborted late in the pregnancy were burned in an oven at La Voisin or buried in the garden of La Voisin, but this was never investigated and therefore unconfirmed, as Louis XIV had given the order that the part of La Voisin's enterprise which had to do with abortions should not be pursued further. Lepère was sentenced to death for abortion on 11 August 1679. She was also sentenced to be tortured, but because of her advanced age, she was merely fastened in the torture device without it being put to actual use, as there was a fear that she would die of the torture rather than the execution if the torture was actually applied. She was executed by hanging. == In fiction == Catherine Lepère is portrayed in a novel by Judith Merkle Riley: The Oracle Glass (1994). ==References== Category:1601 births Category:1679 deaths Category:French midwives Category:Executed French people Category:17th-century executions by France Category:Executed French women Category:French abortion providers Category:People executed by France by hanging Category:17th-century French criminals Category:17th-century French businesspeople ","title":"Catherine Lepère"},{"id":"35193694","text":"Samuel Kaylin (18 January 1892 – 7 July 1983) was a film composer who scored Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto movies for Fox Film and 20th Century Fox. ==Early years== Kaylin was born in the Ukraine and emigrated to the United States on January 16, 1907 aboard the Norddeutscher Lloyd steamship Neckarhttps://search.ancestry.com/cgi- bin/sse.dll?_phsrc=cDE2672&_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs;=true&indiv;=1&dbid;=7488&gsln;=Kalinowsky&gsfn;_x=1&msbdy;=1892&msbpn;__ftp=russia&msbpn;=5189&msady;=1907&msady;_x=1&msadm;=1&msadm;_x=1&msapn;__ftp=new%20york%20city,%20new%20york,%20usa&msapn;=1652382&msepn;__ftp=bremerhaven,%20bremen,%20germany&msepn;=31720&_F0005959=Neckar&_F0005959_x=1&new;=1&rank;=1&uidh;=2q1&redir;=false&gss;=angs-d&pcat;=40&fh;=0&h;=4040581186&recoff;=&ml;_rpos=1&queryId;=957464c05a0ea006211551fe88b77dfe He worked as a musician at the Chinese Theater in Los Angeles.1917 Draft Registration Card ==Hollywood== Kaylin joined Fox Film in 1930 and composed more than 80 film scores.

He was sent to Harrow School in 1718, and then Eton College in 1721. In 1731 he became a scholar, and in 1734 a Fellow, of King's College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1735. Soon after graduating Cooke became an assistant-master at Eton. In May 1743 he was unanimously elected head-master, but found his health too weak for the place, and in 1745 took the college living of Sturminster-Marshall, Dorset. In 1748 he was elected fellow of Eton College, and resigned Sturminster on being presented to the rectory of Denham, Buckinghamshire; he was also bursar of Eton. In 1765 he proceeded D.D., and was appointed chaplain to George Montagu- Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax. In 1768 he accepted the rectory of Stoke Newington. On 25 March 1772 Cooke was unanimously elected Provost of King's College, Cambridge. He was vice-chancellor of the university in 1773. In April 1780 he received a prebend in Ely Cathedral, and on 9 August was appointed to the deanery. Cooke died at Bath 20 October 1797. ==Works== Cooke published some sermons, and in 1732 a small (anonymous) collection of poems called Musæ Juveniles, including a Greek tragedy on King Solomon, called Sophia Theēlatos. In one of the sermons (1750), on the meaning of the expression in the second Epistle of St. Peter, \\"a more sure word of prophecy\\", he contributed to the Middletonian Controversy, defending Thomas Sherlock against Conyers Middleton. Cooke composed an epitaph for himself in a south vestry of King's College Chapel, attributing whatever he had done to the munificence of Henry VI. ==Family== Cooke married Catherine, daughter of Richard Sleech, canon of Windsor, in January 1746, and had by her twelve children. The eldest daughter Elizabeth Anne married Benjamin Way; the second daughter, Catherine, married Samuel Hallifax, whose epitaph was written by Cooke. One of his sons, Edward Cooke, became secretary at war in Ireland. Another son, William Cooke, was fellow of King's College, Cambridge, professor of Greek at Cambridge from 1780 to 1792, and rector of Hempstead-with-Lessingham, Norfolk, from 1785 till his death, 3 May 1824. ==References== ;Attribution Category:1711 births Category:1797 deaths Category:People educated at Eton College Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:Alumni of King's College, Cambridge Category:Fellows of King's College, Cambridge Category:18th-century English Anglican priests Category:Provosts of King's College, Cambridge Category:Deans of Ely Category:Head Masters of Eton College ","title":"William Cooke (Provost of King's College)"},{"id":"35193764","text":"Glyptolenoides is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species: * Glyptolenoides azureipennis (Chaudoir, 1859) * Glyptolenoides azureus (Chaudoir, 1859) * Glyptolenoides balli Moret, 2005 * Glyptolenoides cyclothorax (Chaudoir, 1879) * Glyptolenoides elegantulus (Chaudoir, 1878) * Glyptolenoides germaini Perrault, 1991 * Glyptolenoides purpuripennis (Chaudoir, 1879) * Glyptolenoides siemeradskii Perrault, 1991 * Glyptolenoides sulcipennis (Chaudoir, 1879) * Glyptolenoides sulcitarsis (Chaudoir, 1878) ==References== Category:Platyninae ","title":"Glyptolenoides"},{"id":"35193768","text":"==Preliminary round== Format The five group winners along with the four best second-place teams will be placed into three groups hosted by Guadeloupe, Cuba and Trinidad & Tobago from 11 October - 9 November.

For some years, he and his son, David, have run a recording studio and production company specialising in the genre: Thane Productions. == Early life == An only child, David was born in the village of Kettlebridge, Fife, the son of William Cunningham, a joiner, and Christina (Chris) Ireland. Shortly before he was born, his father was sent to serve in Burma so they did not meet until the Second World War was over in 1945. William played the melodeon and seven-year- old David began to play it too but secretly, for fear of getting into trouble. Christina heard him although she said nothing to him and, when he was eight, his parents presented him with a small second-hand piano accordion. They had also arranged for him to have lessons from local teacher James C Cook. These ceased when his teacher died four years later but, following a further year under the guidance of Bill Wilkie MBE, David had no need for further tuition. == Professional life == By the time he was thirteen, David had auditioned for the BBC and performed for them on \\"Children's Hour\\". He appeared on various programmes over the following years - all live in those days - including taking regular spots on BBC Radio Scotland's longest-running programme: \\"Take the Floor\\". He began teaching the accordion at the age of 16, with several pupils later becoming professional musicians and teachers in their own right. David attended Bell Baxter High School, Cupar, and embarked on a degree course at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, Dundee, in 1960 with the aim of going into teaching. However, the pull of music and the theatre was too strong and he left, after a very successful first year, to pursue a career on the Scottish variety theatre circuit. Signed up to a top Scottish theatrical agency, he played in variety shows throughout Scotland from 1960-1962. In 1962, he was invited by the prominent Scottish dance band leader, David Findlay (later a presenter on Good Morning Scotland), to join his popular and well-established band \\"The Olympians\\". For the next 16 years the band broadcast regularly, recorded several albums, and played at dances in their spare time travelling to functions the length and breadth of Britain. At the suggestion of a BBC producer, David formed the \\"David Cunningham Trio\\" in 1963 primarily to be able to perform and record music from outside the Scottish traditional style. However, public pressure soon forced the style's inclusion and the Trio broadcast regularly on BBC programmes throughout the network until 1979. But he was also working full-time and, in 1981, David retired from playing professionally due to the pressure of work and family commitments. David has also been involved in transcribing and restoring rare archive recordings of many of the major Scottish musicians for commercial release by international record labels. These include performances by Sir Jimmy Shand; Will Starr; Bobby McLeod; and Jim Cameron. == Awards == In 2002, David was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Association of Accordion and Fiddle Clubs. In 2007, the Earl of Mansfield presented him with the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society's prestigious \\"Scroll of Honour\\" in recognition of his services to the Society. == Works == From an extensive repertoire, his published works include: *Agnes Laing's Fancy *Benvie House *Bessie & Lawrie Kemp *The Claybraes Two Step *Frank & Maureen Robb *John Crawford of Freuchie *Ma Petite Chérie *Master David R Cunningham *Miss Alison Frew *Miss Christina Ireland *Miss Diane Cunningham *Miss Jean Ritchie *Mr & Mrs Bob Galloway *Mrs Agnes Ritchie - the original title tune for the country dance \\"Starlight\\" *Saint Magnus Bay *William B Cunningham *William Ritchie Esq Many of David’s compositions have been recorded by prominent bands and groups and they feature regularly on the play lists of BBC radio broadcasts. ==References External links == *David Cunningham (Box and Fiddle) *BBC Radio Scotland - Take the Floor *National Association of Accordion and Fiddle Clubs (Box and Fiddle) *David Cunningham & His Scottish Dance Band – David Cunningham Jnr *Royal Scottish Country Dance Society *Thane Productions *Thane Records Category:Scottish folk musicians Category:Scottish composers Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Dundee ","title":"David Cunningham Snr"},{"id":"35193785","text":"Habragonum amamioshimense is a species of beetle in the family Carabidae, the only species in the genus Habragonum. ==References== Category:Platyninae ","title":"Habragonum"},{"id":"35193787","text":"Mesocrambus candiellus is a species of moth in the family Crambidae described by Gottlieb August Wilhelm Herrich-Schäffer in 1848.

The leopards' faces, referred to as \\"loggerheads\\" locally, are a traditional emblem for Shropshire and several of its towns. It is believed that the loggerheads derive from the Royal Arms of England and that the blue and yellow colours represent those of Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury. Loggerheads also appeared on the Shrewsbury town arms, themselves first recorded in 1623, solidifying their connections to the local area. The name is thought to have originated from the practice of carving such a design on the head of the log used as a battering ram.

Also that year, in Wimbledon, Felgate won his first Grand Slam doubles match. Felgate and Nick Brown, wild card entrants, upset third seeds Ken Flach and Robert Seguso in the first round, before losing in the second round. He also reached the second round at Wimbledon in 1986, with Shaw, and in 1988, with Nick Fulwood. He made his first Grand Slam singles appearance in 1988. After going through qualifying, Felgate played against Eddie Edwards in the first round of the 1988 Australian Open. He lost heavily to the South African, only winning three games during the match. He had previously only played singles on the Challenger circuit, and never in a Grand Prix event. When he did debut at a Grand Prix tournament, in the 1988 Stella Artois Championships, Felgate defeated world number 72 Jérôme Potier. He was given a wild card at Wimbledon that year, but had to play top seed Ivan Lendl in the first round, and lost in straight sets. In 1992, Felgate started coaching Tim Henman and remained with him for nine years. During this time Henman made two Wimbledon semi-finals and won seven ATP titles.

Although the Dutch managed to eventually control the situation, the events marked the end of Dutch involvement in the Gold Coast. Without a profit for almost a century, the escalation finally made the political balance shift in favour of the liberal faction, which wanted to sell the colony to Britain, and away from the nationalist faction, which wanted to retain the colony for reasons of national prestige. == Background == On 5 March 1867, the Convention between Great Britain and the Netherlands for an Interchange of Territory on the Gold Coast of Africa was signed, which stipulated that all forts on the Gold Coast to the east of Elmina were to be handed over to Britain, while all forts to west of the town were to be handed over to the Netherlands. This meant that the formerly British forts at Beyin (British name: Fort Apollonia, new Dutch name: Fort Willem III), Dixcove (British name: Fort Dixcove, new Dutch name: Fort Metalen Kruis), Komenda (British name: Fort Komenda, same in Dutch), and Sekondi (British name: Fort Sekondi, same in Dutch) were to become Dutch. To this effect, the Dutch steam ship Het Metalen Kruis departed from the Dutch harbour at Texel on 6 November 1867, arriving in the Gold Coast on 26 November of the same year. To give effect to the treaty, the ship first departed to Accra, to hand over Fort Crèvecoeur to the British. Afterwards, the ship sailed to Elmina; the other Dutch forts were handed over by officers. Then, the ship sailed to Dixcove to assist in the transfer of Fort Metal Cross to the Dutch. Both this transfer and the transfer of Fort Apollonia were without problems. Things changed when the ship set sail for Komenda. The Dutch flag was not raised there, as the local rulers resisted the handing over of the fort, which was not much more than a ruin, to the Dutch. At Sekondi, all went more or less according to plan, leaving the Dutch with only one fort to resist their rule. Joint Anglo-Dutch negotiations with the locals did not bear fruit, and when the local king finally approved the hand-over, he was deposed later the same day. Dutch forces then entered the fort by force, and on 2 February 1868, Het Metalen Kruis left for Elmina, leaving 20 soldiers behind to keep the peace. Skirmishes ensued throughout February, but at the end of the month peace seemed to have returned. == Komenda hostage crisis and the Dutch punitive expedition == Matters took a turn for the worse on 26 May 1869, twelve days after the arrival of the new governor Cornelis Nagtglas, when several Dutch able seamen from the war ship Amstel, which had taken over the duties of Het Metalen Kruis, were taken hostage by the people of Komenda. One of the hostages was killed, while the rest were kept prisoner in the village of Kwassie in the interior. British negotiators managed to buy the hostages out for 15.000 Dutch guilders of ransom, but the public outcry in the Netherlands over the affair was so great that the minister felt obliged to send a military expedition to \\"chastise\\" the people of Komenda and Kwassie. Yet another war ship, the vice-admiraal Koopman, was sent to the Gold Coast with to punish Komenda. An expeditionary force of 9 officers, 18 European soldiers, and 17 Africans was then assembled in Elmina, and the king of Equaffo joined in with a force of 32 Africans and 80 coolies. In December 1869 and January 1870, this force laid the villages of Komenda, Anoema and Kwassie in ashes. The inhabitants of those villages mostly fled to Cape Coast. The Dutch government instituted the Medal for Courage and Loyalty Guinea 1869/1870 for seven native soldiers that were deemed to have fought courageously during the expedition. == See also == *Dutch–Ahanta War (1837-1839) *Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870–1871 == Notes  References == * * Category:Wars involving the Netherlands Category:Dutch Gold Coast Category:1869 in Africa Category:1870 in Africa Category:1869 in military history Category:1870 in military history ","title":"Dutch Gold Coast expedition of 1869–70"},{"id":"35193948","text":"Hemiplatynus chihuahuae is a species of beetle in the family Carabidae, the only species in the genus Hemiplatynus. ==References== Category:Platyninae ","title":"Hemiplatynus"},{"id":"35193955","text":"Henvelik kalchhigenn is a species of beetle in the family Carabidae, the only species in the genus Henvelik. ==References== Category:Platyninae Category:Monotypic Carabidae genera ","title":"Henvelik"},{"id":"35193960","text":"Christopher Festarini (born June 3, 1993) is a Canadian ice hockey goaltender.

In March 2012, the cast was finalised with Shaam, Raju Sundaram and Vaibhav Reddy. Kamna Jethmalani, Neelam Upadhyaya and Sneha Ullal were also selected to play leading female roles in the film. Bappa Lahiri, son of Bappi Lahiri, was signed on to compose the film's songs while Sunny M.R. composed the film's background score. The film will be shot in 3D with the Red One camera system by Sarvesh Murari, with technicians brought in from the USA to guide production. Sunil and Posani Krishna Murali made guest appearances. The Tamil version of the film was titled as Aasu Raja Rani Jackie Matrum Joker and the Telugu version was titled as Action, with both versions being launched at Karnataka School located in T Nagar, Chennai on 22 March 2012, with Tamil Nadu Governor K. Rosaiah gracing the event as chief guest. The film is expected to be shot across the USA and Thailand. Since 3D Camera does not support Zoom-in, Naresh had to use 78 retakes to complete a fight shot jumping six feet in the air to land a punch which should end exactly 3 feet from the camera from 8 PM to 6 AM. Also, Naresh and Neelam Upadhyay shot the remix of the song \\"Swati Mutyapu Jallulo\\", from Nagarjuna's Prema Yuddham, which gained a cult status in those days. The film's filming and post-production activities were wrapped up on 8 June 2013 and a function was held in regard of this fact. However, apart from Multiplexes and A Centers, the film is releasing in 3D even in C Centers using Anaglyph 3D technology to overcome poor infrastructure in C centers for which special glasses were imported from China. After getting feedback from the audience on the day of release, 15 minutes of film were edited out of the second half. ==Reception== The Times of India gave the film a rating of two-and-a-half out of five stars and stated that \\" The movie does pack a few gags, but there’s plenty that can make you cringe as well. Watch it purely to get a taste of the extra dimension\\". The Hindu wrote that \\"Watch this only if your idea of having fun is watching crude humour on 3D\\". Oneindia Entertainment gave a review of rating 3/5 stating \\"Watch it for the fun of it. Enjoy a 3D Telugu film with good enough acting, Action 3D\\". The film's poor performance at the box office meant that the Tamil version, Aasu Raja Rani Jackie Matrum Joker, did not have a release. ==Soundtrack== Bappi Lahari and his son Bappa Lahari composed the songs for this film.

He was implicated in the Poison Affair. It was owing to the connection between him and Magdelaine de La Grange that the Paris police came to suspect the existence of an illegal organization of poisoners in Paris. ==Activity== Vanens came from Arles and called himself Chevalier de Vanens. He was arrested by the direct orders of Louvois on 5 December 1677, after having declared that he was able to make gold and had been observed with a banknote of 200,000 livres. In connection to his arrest, his valet La Chaboissiere and the banker Pierre Cadelan, who signed the banknote, were taken into custody. In 1678, La Chaboissiere's lover, Jeanne Leroy, was arrested along with chemist Dalmas and his lover, Louise Duscoulcye. Leroy testified that Chaboissiere and Vanens were commissioned poisoners and that Cadelan sold their poisons abroad. She further confessed that she and Duscoulcye had committed murder. It was known that Chaboissiere had visited Abbé Nail, an accomplice of the poisoner Magdelaine de La Grange, in prison. This formed a link between Vanens and de La Grange and caused the Paris police suspect Vanens of being the leader of an international organization of assassins, and part of a network of poisoners in Paris. ==Implication== On May 17, 1678, the nobleman Robert de Bachimont and his wife, Marie, were arrested in Lyon for their connection to Vanens. They claimed that they had become acquainted with Vanens in Paris in 1674, where they witnessed him transform metal into gold. Vanens reportedly told them that he had learned alchemy from Francois Galaup de Chasteuil. The Bachimonts testified that in June 1675, they accompanied Vanens to visit Chasteuil in Turin to acquire an alchemical ingredient which Vanens required. Vanens and Chasteuil met alone. Upon their return to France, Vanens disappeared in Paris. The couple later returned to Turin where they again met with Chasteuil to engage in alchemical experiments. By the time the Bachimonts had returned to Lyon, the Police suspected that Vanens and the Bachimonts had poisoned Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy, who had died two days after their departure from Turin, and that the Bachimonts had returned to Turin the second time to fetch their reward. The official report of the death of the Duke of Savoy was brought to France by the Count de Saint Maurice, lover of the late Duke's widow, Marie Jeanne of Savoy. Saint Maurice visited La Chaubossiere during his stay in Paris. ==Investigation== Vanens was imprisoned in the Bastille for several years without trial during the Poison Affair while the police waited for evidence to incriminate him. Although he was connected to many of the accused, no charges were brought against him. He was put on trial in April 1682. By this time, he was described as being severely mentally deteriorated, perhaps mentally ill. He was accused of having sold mixtures to prolong love, affect marriages, and find lost treasures. The suspicion that he may have murdered the Duke of Savoy was not mentioned as it was deemed internationally sensitive. Although he was initially sentenced to the galleys, the fear that he would talk about the murder of the Duke of Savoy caused the sentenced to be changed to life imprisonment at St Andre de Salines in France-Comte, where he was joined by Roger and Marie de Bachimont. Pierre Cadelan also received the same sentence. Leroy and Chaubossiere were executed, while Dalmas was sent to a work house. == References == * Anne Somerset - The Affair of the Poisons: Murder, Infanticide, and Satanism at the Court of Louis XIV (St. Martin's Press (October 12, 2003) ) Category:1691 deaths Category:1647 births Category:French alchemists Category:Poisoners Category:Prisoners of the Bastille Category:French people who died in prison custody Category:17th- century French businesspeople Category:17th-century occultists Category:17th- century alchemists ","title":"Louis de Vanens"},{"id":"35194007","text":"Howard Storm may refer to: *Howard Storm (author) (born 1946), American author, best known for the book My Descent Into Death *Howard Storm (director) (born 1939), American film, television director and actor ","title":"Howard Storm"},{"id":"35194037","text":"Skaters on the ice outside the gates of a Dutch city Thomas Heeremans (1641-1694) was a Dutch painter and art dealer.

He was in the past sometimes erroneously referred to as Frederik Hendrik Mans, likely because he signed his name \\"THMANS\\" with the \\"THM\\" together, leading dealers to assume his name was F.H. Mans.Thomas Heeremans at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Heeremans was baptized in the Reformed Church of Haarlem on 29 May 1641. He became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1664. He may have been a pupil of Caesar van Everdingen. Heeremans married Trijntje Claesdr (who was originally from Leiden) on 4 December 1663 in Haarlem. The couple had five children between 1664 and 1673, who were baptized in the Reformed Church. His first wife was buried on 26 September 1680. The artist then married Sibilla Juriaensdr., a woman from Marck county in Germany, with whom he had a son, Gijsbert. The exact date of death of the artist is not known. It is recorded he was buried at the Noorderkerkhof on 24 January 1694. ==Work== He is primarily known for his winter landscapes, cityscapes, harbor scenes, beach views, river views and village scenes. He frequently returned to painting the beach at Scheveningen and the village, beach and ruins of Egmond. His pictures frequently go in pairs. His earliest dated work is from 1660 while last dated work is from 1695. View of the beach at Scheveningen No influence of his presumed master Caesar van Everdingen is visible in the work of Heeremans as he was purely a landscape artist and not a figure painter. His style was rather influenced by Klaes Molenaer particularly in his depiction of winter landscapes and river scenes. Heeremans' works are distinguished from the rather melancholic scenes of Molenaer by the use of a brighter palette and the introduction of more lively movement in the scenes, which are populated by many villagers engaged in various activities such as skating, sledging, fishing and talking. Heeremans sometimes collaborated with specialist figure painters who would add the staffage in his landscapes. One of his collaborators was Abraham Storck, who painted the figures in the Winter landscape with the Montelbaanstoren, Amsterdam (Christie's New York sale of 14 April 2016, lot 247).Thomas Heeremans and Abraham Storck - Winter landscape with the Montelbaanstoren, Amsterdam at Christie's ==References Category:1641 births Category:1694 deaths Category:Dutch Golden Age painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:Artists from Haarlem Category:Members of the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Thomas Heeremans"},{"id":"35194042","text":"In mathematics, Raynaud's isogeny theorem, proved by , relates the Faltings heights of two isogeneous elliptic curves. ==References== * Category:Elliptic curves Category:Theorems in algebraic geometry ","title":"Raynaud's isogeny theorem"},{"id":"35194044","text":"Santa Cruz Airport or Santacruz Airport may refer to: * Santa Cruz Airport (Argentina), serving Santa Cruz and Puerto Santa Cruz * Santa Cruz Airport (Belize), an airport in Belize * Santa Cruz Airport (Chile), serving Santa Cruz * Santa Cruz Airfield (Portugal), an aerodrome in Torres Vedras * Santa Cruz Island Airport, in Santa Barbara, California, US * Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, located in Santacruz, a suburb of Mumbai, India ","title":"Santa Cruz Airport"},{"id":"35194059","text":"Metasia albicostalis is a species of moth in the family Crambidae.

It is celebrated by the Mising or Mishing an indigenous tribe of Assam, India. The festival marks onset of sowing seeds. The name of the festival is made up of three terms, 'Ali', legumes, 'Aye', seed and 'Ligang', to sow. ==Time of the festival== The festival begins on 'Ligange lange', the first Wednesday of 'Gimur Polo', which occurs in February in the Gregorian calendar or on Wednesday of the month of Fagun of the Assamese calendar and in the month of February in English calendar which lasts for five days. Its 2016 date was 2 February. ==Activities== In this festival young people of the community in particular participate 'GUMRAAG SOMAN' and dance to the tune of folk songs and melodious 'oi: nitom'. The first day of the festival is marked by the ceremonial start of paddy sowing and throughout the festival many others activities such as ploughing and tree cutting are forbidden. Feast The last day of festival called as ‘Lilen’ is observed with a grand community feast. During this festival, Misings indulge in great banquet with Poro Apong or Nogin Apong (homemade Rice wine) with various dishes, especially made with pork meat. ‘Purang Apin’ (packed boiled rice) is cooked in water with special leaves. This is a special dish prepared by Misings which is cooked only during Ali Aye Ligang. ==Dance forms & songs== In this festival a popular dance is performed by the young Mising people which is known as Gumrag.

This dance is performed by encircling the courtyard of the house of the villagers. ==Songs & music== The songs of Ali-Aye-Ligang do not remain restricted to the songs of youth alone. The subjects and themes of the songs are varied. They include the life of a man, his sufferings in this life and his death. Apart from them, the songs describe the matters of individual love and affection including joy and pain. Mainly the songs of the festival speak of the various experiences of the Misings in their day-to-day life.

His mother was a freed slave of Cape ancestry, and his father was a farm labourer of German ancestry. While he kept strong connections with German family and friends, he also seems to have identified primarily with the local Khoikhoi people, possibly through his mother's influence. He is first recorded as a wealthy Khoikhoi businessman, land-owner and community leader among the Gonaqua Khoi people of the Kat River Settlements, near the Eastern Cape frontier. Kat River was a large, successful and predominantly Khoi region of the Cape, that subsisted more or less autonomously. Aside from the Afrikaans- speaking Gonaqua Khoi, the settlement had also attracted large numbers of other Khoi, Xhosa and mixed-race groups of the Cape.Elizabeth Elbourne: Race, Warfare and Religion in mid-nineteenth century Southern Africa: The Khoikhoi Rebellion. Journal of African Cultural Studies, 2000. In 1834, the Surveyor General of the Cape Colony, W.F.Hertzog, recorded a \\"Christiaan Groepe\\" as being a wealthy, highly educated and \\"respectable\\" Khoi, who had originally arrived from Baviaans River with a large number of followers, and had settled them in the central \\"Tamboekiesvallei\\" area of Kat River.E.L.Nel: An evaluation of community-driven economic development, land tenure, and sustainable environmental development in the Kat River Valley. HSRC Press, 2000. The Kat River Khoi, situated near the frontier and renowned as excellent marksmen, were frequently and gratuitously recruited by the Cape Colony in its frontier wars with the neighboring Xhosa. == Military service on the frontier == Commandant Groepe fought in the frontier wars alongside Andries Stockenstrom, John Molteno and Andries Botha. In the Amatola War they led the local Cape Commandos that – vastly outnumbered – defeated Sandile's gunmen and fought their way into the Amatola fastnesses. They then rode deep into the Xhosa heartland of the Transkei and met Sarhili, the paramount Chief of all the Xhosa, to negotiate a peace treaty. All this while, the British Imperial Troops had largely retreated to their forts further west. Commandant Groepe was noted as repeatedly distinguishing himself by his bravery and leadership, as were many of his colleagues.C. W. Hutton (ed.), The autobiography of the late Sir Andries Stockenström, bart., sometime lieutenant-governor of the eastern province of the Cape of Good Hope. C.T., 1887, Volume 2. C.T., 1964 Consequently, he returned to the Kat River Settlements as a celebrated war hero. == The Kat River Rebellion and treason trials == In spite of his status as a respected war veteran and a well-educated gentleman, Groepe nonetheless faced the prejudice that pervaded many sectors of colonial society. Thomas Pringle records Groepe's difficulties with the colonial clergy who refused to conduct his marriage on the excuse that his bride could not recite the Catechism correctly in English. A wide range of similar such grievances eventually led him and his colleague Andries Botha to openly sympathize with those of the \\"Kat River\\" Khoi who joined the rebellion of 1850. In a controversial and much-publicized trial, he and several of his fellow Khoi leaders were tried for high treason for the rebellion. The trial was immensely controversial at the time. Opponents accused it of being a prejudiced witch- hunt, and several powerful Cape figures such as Andries Stockenstrom declared strong public support for Groepe and his co-accused.Kirk, T: Progress and Decline in the Kat River Settlement, 1829–1854. Journal of African History 14: Cape Town. 1973. Although the Khoi community leaders were found guilty, the trial was widely acknowledged to be a biased and vindictive political show- trial, and the sentences were repealed.\\"Answers to an Address of the House of Assembly to the Lieutenant Governor\\", 20 July 1854, Reports of the Commissioners Appointed for Investigating into the Causes of the Kat River Rebellion.

While large sections of the Kat River Settlement were later broken up due to the rebellion and frontier conflicts with the Xhosa, in 1920 Groepe's descendants were still recorded as land-owners in the original Kat River region, and as managers of estates in nearby Bellvale and Readsdale.

The series of twelve children's books based on the character was published between 1939 and 1972. The first eleven books were illustrated by Lucie Lundberg. The books about Pelle are seen as a protest against the ever more overt support seen for Nazism in Sweden during the 1930s, and as such constitute a satire on contemporaneous society. The books have been translated to several European languages. ==Characters and story== The stories take place in Uppsala, Sweden. The characters of the books are cats; however, they are often based on real people. Knutsson studied at Uppsala University and was involved with the student societies Stockholms nation and Uppsala Student Union, and many of the characters are modelled on real-life people from this environment.Sevelin, A.R., \\"Verklighetens Pelle Svanslös\\" , Holmensis: Stockholms Nations Tidning no.4/2011, pp. 16–18, accessed 16 May 2012. Pelle is a kindhearted and gullible cat who is constantly being tricked and bullied by Elaka Måns (\\"Mean Mike\\") and his dim-witted helpers Bill and Bull, who always echo Måns while slightly misunderstanding him. However, good always prevails over evil, and Pelle even gets to experience true love together with Maja Gräddnos (\\"Maya Cream-nose\\"). In the first books Pelle is a house cat in the home of the children Olle and Birgitta, but as he grows he enters a relationship with cohabitant Maja in a basement peep-hole. After a while, the book series become more and more anthropomorphized, with less and less mention of the human world around Pelle. Unlike the other cats in the series, Pelle has no tail (his name Svanslös \\"without a tail\\" reflects this). A large rat bit off Pelle's tail when he was only a few days old. Pelle was born in the countryside, but a family from Uppsala adopted him when he was a kitten. Some of the other cats bully Pelle because his lack of a tail.

This production was subsequently presented each following year until 2001. In 1990 the stage production was filmed and shown by Sveriges Television. It featured Mark Bartholdsson as Pelle Svanslös, Iwa Sörenson as Maja Gräddnos and Magnus Lindén as elaka Måns. The series has been adapted for film multiple times. In 1981 the feature animated film Peter-No-Tail was released, starring Mats Åhlfeldt as Peter and Ernst-Hugo Järegård as Elaka Måns. A sequel, Peter-No-Tail in Americat, followed in 1985, with much of the same cast but Erik Lindgren voicing Peter. In 1997, Sveriges Television produced the Nordic Christmas calendar live action TV series Peter-No-Tail with Björn Kjellman portraying Peter. This was followed in 2000 by the live action feature Peter-No-Tail and the Great Treasure Hunt. Picture books as well as two editions as a comics series have also been published; one comic magazine ran between 1965 and 1972. A new 2D animated feature-length film musical will be released by SF Studios in January 2020, with the art style largely based on the 1980s films. ==Eponymous asteroids== An asteroid that was discovered in March 1993 is eponymously named 8535 Pellesvanslös. Similarly the asteroids 8534 Knutsson, 8536 Måns, 8537 Billochbull, 8538 Gammelmaja and 8539 Laban were discovered at about the same time. 8534 was named after Gösta Knutsson and asteroids 8535-8539 after various characters in the series. They were all named by Swedish astronomer Claes-Ingvar Lagerkvist. ==See also== * Peter-No-Tail (1981 film) * Peter-No-Tail in Americat * Peter-No-Tail (1997 film) * Peter-No-Tail and the Great Treasure Hunt ==References== Category:Literary characters introduced in 1939 Category:Fictional cats Category:Anthropomorphic cats Category:Swedish children's literature Category:Anti-fascist books Category:Sweden in fiction Category:Uppsala in fiction Category:Nazism in Sweden Category:Political history of Sweden Category:Satirical books Category:Swedish comics titles Category:1965 comics debuts Category:1972 comics endings Category:Cats in literature Category:Novels adapted into comics Category:Novels adapted into operas Category:Swedish novels adapted into films Category:Sveriges Television original programming Category:Book series introduced in 1939 ","title":"Pelle Svanslös"},{"id":"35194226","text":"Metasia cuencalis is a species of moth in the family Crambidae.

East wall of north chancel aisle. Lower stage: Sir Edward Littleton (d. 1610) and his wife, Margaret Devereux. Upper stage: Sir Edward (d. 1629), and his wife, Mary Fisher. Their son, also Sir Edward, became the first baronet in 1627. Sir Edward Littleton, who succeeded in 1574 and died in 1610, as portrayed on a double tomb in St. Michael's church, Penkridge. Sir Edward Littleton (ca. 15551610) was a Staffordshire landowner, politician and rebel from the extended Littleton/Lyttelton family. A supporter of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, he was the victim of a notorious electoral fraud in 1597 and a participant in the Essex Rebellion, although he escaped with his life. In the reign of James I he was elected a member of the parliament of England. ==Background== Tomb of Littleton's parents, Sir Edward Littleton (died 1574) and Alice Cockayne, in St. Michael's church, Penkridge. Littleton's father was Edward Littleton (died 1574) of Pillaton Hall, near Penkridge. His mother was Alice Cockayne (1535–1602), the daughter of Francis Cockayne of Ashbourne Hall, Derbyshire. The Littletons had been based at Pillaton since the early years of the century. Littleton's grandfather, Sir Edward Littleton, had skilfully and aggressively expanded the estates of his family during the turbulent years of the English Reformation and had represented Staffordshire in five parliaments. His father had consolidated the family's holdings but had been content mainly to live the life of a country gentleman. ==Landowner== Penkridge parish church today. Littleton bought its property outright, acquiring numerous rights of the former royal peculiar. Remains of Pillaton Old Hall, near Penkridge, Staffordshire. Littleton succeeded to the family estates in 1574, on the death of his father. He had married Margaret Devereux only recently, the marriage settlement dated 23 March 1573.The History of Parliament: Members 1604–1629 – LITTLETON, Sir Edward I (c.1548–1610) (Author: Ben Coates) Littleton inherited 16,000 acres in the Penkridge area and another 600 elsewhere in Staffordshire, 1,400 acres in Warwickshire, 900 acres in Shropshire and 940 acres in Worcestershire. His mother survived until 1602 and her jointure, a third of the estate, was, he later claimed, a major drain on his wealth, as was the property held in tail by his siblings.Cecil Papers, 1–15 June 1601 His mother's jointure was certainly large: it included all of the Warwickshire and Shropshire estates, as well as lands in Staffordhire. However, the death of his father-in-law, Sir William Devereux, in 1579 probably eased matters considerably, as Devereux left considerable legacies to his daughters.The History of Parliament: Members 1558–1603 – Devereux, Sir william (c.1525–79) (Author: W.J.J.) Certainly Littleton was sufficiently prominent and wealthy to serve two terms as High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1581 and 1593. His subsidy assessment rose from only £5 in 1576 to £20 in 1590 and he could afford to settle an allowance of £100 on his eldest son, also Edward, at his marriage in 1599. By any standards, he was actually a large and wealthy landowner, of considerable regional importance. Whatever the calls on his wealth, Littleton was able to find the money to make strategic investments when the opportunity arose. One of the most important sources of the Littletons' wealth were the leases they held, particularly that on the lands of the former college of St. Michael, Penkridge. Littleton's grandfather had taken out an 80-year lease on the lands of the deanery in 1543 – four years before the collegiate church was turned into a local parish church by the dissolution of chantries in 1547. The reversion was held briefly by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland during his period of power in the reign of Edward VI, but it returned to the Crown after his execution under Mary I in 1553. In 1581 the college, \\"with all its rights, members, lands, tithes, and appurtenances\\" was sold by the Crown to a pair of speculators: Edmund Downynge, a former MP with close Exchequer links,The History of Parliament: Members 1558–1603 – Downing, Edmund (Author: P. W. Hasler) and Peter Aysheton. The sale of reversions and monopolies were essential forms of patronage exercised by the Crown in Elizabeth's reign, giving the government a stream of revenue outside parliamentary control. In 1583 the estate was sold to John Morley, another MP involved in the Exchequer,The History of Parliament: Members 1558–1603 – Morley, John I (d.1587) (Author: W.J.J.) and a Thomas Crompton – probably the Thomas Crompton (died 1609) who was a London businessman and academic and had family land at Stafford.The History of Parliament: Members 1558–1603 – Crompton, Thomas I (c.1558–1609) (Author: P. W. Hasler) In 1585 Edward Littleton was able to buy the college property from John Morley, Elizabeth his wife, and Thomas Crompton. This land, described as the liberty of the deanery in 1598 and later as the deanery manor, was part of the Littleton estates until at least the 19th century. With it came many of the rights and duties of the college itself, including the jurisdiction of the royal peculiar. This gave the Littletons advowson of the church and kept the parish out of the Diocese of Lichfield until 1858.Victoria County History: Staffordshire: Volume 3, 34: The College of St. Michael, Penkridge. Many of the Littleton's estates were still held by feudal land tenure. The fundamental bond of feudal society, the fief in return for military service, was obsolete, but the Littletons still paid 16 shillings a year to their overlord, Baron Paget, for Pillaton manor.Victoria County History: Staffordshire: Volume 5, chapter 16, Penkridge, section 2, Manors ==Political career== The Paget connection In the decade following his succession, Littleton seems to have been in the political camp of his overlord, Thomas Paget, 3rd Baron Paget, a prominent Catholic nobleman. However, in the 1580s Lord Paget, together with his brother Charles took refuge in France under the protection of the Catholic League. They were implicated in the Babington Plot, a conspiracy to assassinate Elizabeth I. Lord Paget was attainted, losing all his estates, and took refuge in Spain. Littleton had supported Paget locally but had never sympathised with his religious views and seems not to have been harmed by Paget's demise. Amias Paulet, unimpeachably puritan and the gaoler of Mary, Queen of Scots, regarded Littleton as one of the few trustworthy Staffordshire gentry and described him as \\"a very honest religious gentleman\\". The Devereux faction in Staffordshire Littleton and his wife, Margaret Devereux, from the double tomb. Margaret was the cousin of the Earl of Essex. Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger. Littleton assiduously supported the cause of Essex to the point of open rebellion. Lettice Knollys, mother of Essex, painted as Countess of Leicester. She and Sir Christopher Blount, her third husband, were an important force in the county. From the late 1580s, Edward Littleton and most of his relatives were closely allied to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Even while Essex was at university, Edward Littleton, looking to the future had presented a horse to him. Edward Littleton's wife, Margaret Devereux, was a cousin of the earl. Essex regarded Staffordshire as his own county and power base.Hammer, Paul E. J. (1999): The Polarisation of Elizabethan Politics: The Political Career of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, 1585–1597, Cambridge university Press, . Essex's main seat, Chartley Castle, was in Staffordshire, between the county town of Stafford and Uttoxeter, and Littleton's brother, James, managed it for him. Essex was Staffordshire's senior civic official, the Custos Rotulorum, for several years. His mother Lettice Knollys lived at Drayton Bassett with her third husband, Sir Christopher Blount. Knollys became godmother to Edward Littleton's daughter Laetitia or Lettice. Essex is still often portrayed primarily as a suitor of the ageing Queen ElizabethA good example is Ross, Josephine (1975): The Men Who would be King (also published as Suitors to the Queen), London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, . Other historians prefer to see his career as both part of and contributory factor in a revival of factional politics in Elizabeth's court and administration after a relatively collegial period in the 1570s and 1580s. The primary causes of this were the unsettled question of the succession to Elizabeth's throne and the often-related foreign policy and military issues of the period. After the death of his step-father, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, in 1588, Essex emerged as the new figurehead for most of his main causes: moderately puritan but aggressively anti-Spanish. A group of Staffordshire landowners formed a local Essex faction – mainly members of the Littleton, Bagot, Chetwynd, Trew and Aston families. However, the alliance was not confined to the Littletons of Pillaton, who were a cadet branch of the family. The Worcestershire Lytteltons (as their version of the name is generally spelt) were also closely involved with Essex, although they were motivated equally strongly by a detestation of Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley, his and their main enemy in the region. In the 1590s Gilbert Lyttelton was conducting a bitter dispute with Dudley over Prestwood, a small estate near Kinver.The History of Parliament: Members 1558–1603 – Dudley, alias Sutton, Edward (1567–1643) (Author: J.E.M.) This sometimes degenerated into raiding and street skirmishes.The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1558–1603 – Staffordshire Essex was considered a Puritan sympathiser, and the Staffordshire Littletons decidedly Protestant, while their Worcestershire cousins leaned toward Catholicism, but local interests overcame ideological differences. In the 1590s Edward Littleton's duties to Essex included promoting his cause in parliamentary elections. The county seats had been controlled by the Harcourt family of Ellenhall and Ranton Abbey, part of a group of Catholic sympathisers that included for a time the Astons. With the death of Simon Harcourt in 1577, their grip slackened, and into the power vacuum moved the Dudleys. Edward Sutton took a seat in 1584 while still only 17 years of age. He did not stand in 1586, after he succeeded to his father's barony. From this point, however, Essex began to take a real interest. The members elected in 1588, Walter Harcourt and Thomas Gerard, were both in 1591 recruited into the army Essex led to aid Henry IV of France and knighted by Essex at Rouen. The 1593 election Attempts by Essex to dictate the course of the 1593 election proved demoralising, partly because of the insistent tone of his instructions to Sir Edward Littleton, Sir Edward Aston and Richard Bagot, his agents on the ground. On 2 January 1593 Essex wrote urging them to secure the election of his step-father Christopher Blount.Digital image of copy at Folger Shakespeare Library A week later he wrote again, this time asking them to support Gerard as second member.Digital image of copy at Folger Shakespeare Library He added in a postscript: :\\"I should think my credit little in my own country, if it should not afford so small a matter as this, especially the men being so fit.\\" However, Sir William Harcourt had also given notice of his intention to stand for election, and he too could be counted a supporter of Essex. Then Gerard accepted a nomination in his native Lancashire, putting his weight behind Harcourt. However, Essex did not revise his instructions, leaving Bagot and Littleton, who were afraid of offending their patron, perplexed as how to proceed.Jeremy Crick (2007): A contested election This gives a slightly different interpretation of the switch in candidates. As Essex had made this a test of authority, were they to pursue his express wishes, or were they to secure the best result for him? Littleton wrote to Bagot in exasperation: :\\"If Sir Thomas release us (as by his letter it seemeth he hath) and willeth that those procured for him should give their voices for Sir Walter Harcourt, and he would accept of it as to himself, I know not what more is to be required at our hands.\\" Blount and Harcourt were duly elected for Staffordshire, despite the confusion, while Gerard was returned as one of the Lancashire members. The 1597 election scandal The 1597 election ended in a simple, transparent fraud that deprived Littleton of the seat. This time the election turned into a direct contest between the Devereux faction and the Dudleys, probably encouraged by Essex's absence on the abortive Islands Voyage. Lord Dudley promoted his own brother, John, as candidate for a county seat. Essex had left written instructions to return Blount: it is possible, but not certain, that he left similar instructions relating to Littleton, who also stood for election. Littleton's candidature merely provoked the Dudleys, who were at the height of their dispute with his Worcestershire kinsmen: Lord Dudley had recently been fined for his riotous conduct by the Star Chamber. John Dudley, alias Sutton, was approaching 28 years old, inexperienced in public affairs, and not a property holder – hence technically disqualified. However, the Dudleys had the immense advantage of a sympathetic returning officer: the Sheriff, Thomas Whorwood of Compton Hallows (near Kinver), John Dudley's father-in-law, at whose home he resided throughout the election. The Dudley faction began with a vigorous canvass, trying to persuade the freeholders not to divide their 2 votes but to vote solely for Sutton. It was later alleged that Whorwood, a Catholic sympathiser, improved their chances by drafting in at least five recusants from the county gaol and allowing even their wives to raise their voices in favour of Sutton, while Dudley brought in at least a hundred voters, most of them not qualified. About 800 voters came to Stafford for the election on 6 October and Whorwood rallied the Dudley supporters on one side of the market square. The vote was by voices and it immediately became apparent that Blount and Littleton were the most popular candidates, at least 200 ahead of Sutton. To confirm the result, Littleton demanded a poll. Whorwood started it but was warned off by Lord Dudley, who promised to protect him from the consequences. He then went off for dinner. The election indenture had been written out earlier by one of Whorwood's servants, leaving the names of the successful candidates blank. They were filled in later in order of precedence: Sutton and Blount. Littleton filed a complaint to the Star Chamber against Dudley, Whorwood and Sutton. Dudley was called before the Privy Council twice in the next year, probably on this matter, although it is likely that Littleton dropped the case against the Dudleys and proceeded with Whorwood's. The feuding continued outside court, with two Worcestershire Littletons indicted by the Council in July 1598 for attacking John Sutton. The outcome of Littleton's Star Chamber action is not known. The parliament was wound up in very quickly, in February 1598, so Littleton was never able to sit as an MP, and the Dudleys were protected by parliamentary privilege until it was over. The Essex rebellion After disgracing himself over the Irish war, Essex found himself largely excluded from influence by the Queen's close advisers – particularly Cecil. He decided on a coup d'état, planned for 8 February 1601, intending to resolve the succession issue in favour of James VI of Scotland. Sir Edward Littleton was accused of being part of the armed group that prepared for the coup, and that was forced to act prematurely when the plot was discovered. The Essex Rebellion turned into a fiasco, with the earl's supporters marching ineffectively through London. The plotters were soon rounded up. By 12 February, with the action over, Littleton was included on a list of known conspirators,Cecil Papers, 11–15 February 1601 along with his kinsman John, son of Gilbert, and one of those indicted for fighting the Dudleys in Worcestershire. Littleton's part in the events seems to have been particularly farcical, whichever version of events one accepts. An intelligence report to Cecil,Cecil Papers, 1–10 February 1601 headed \\"An information concerning some gentlemen in Staffordshire, frequenters to the Earl of Essex,\\" portrays Littleton as a key figure in the conspiracy. It claims that, on the day of the rising, Littleton walked with Essex and Sir Christopher Blount, with his sword drawn, until they reached the River Thames. They had been turned away from St Paul's Cathedral by Richard Bancroft, the Bishop of London. Allegedly, Littleton was accompanied by his brother James, who looked after Chartley Castle for Essex. However, he was then arrested by a sergeant of the City of London – not for rebellion, but because of a bad debt. After settling the debt, Edward and James then allegedly set off to rejoin the insurgents, who had returned to Essex's House, getting as far as Temple Bar. The report sought to incriminate Edward Littleton further by accusing him of distributing arms in the countryside on the pretext of aiding the English forces in Ireland, and of plotting while at Blount's home in Drayton Bassett. His brother-in-law, John Lane of Bentley Hall is also mentioned as a companion of Littleton who regularly visits Essex's House. Other Staffordshire notables implicated in the same report are William Skeffington, a justice of the peace, and William Paget, the decidedly Protestant heir to the attainted Catholic Thomas Paget, 3rd Baron Paget. It is possible that the anonymous informant was Sir Gilbert Wakering, who was pursuing property disputes against Littleton in Staffordshire. Littleton's own version,Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1598–1601, page 577. as told on 18 February to John Popham (Lord Chief Justice) and Edward Coke, the Attorney General, had features in common but was incompatible. He claimed that he had visited Essex House only to hear a sermon. Finding there was none, he left and then encountered the Lord Chief Justice, with whom he conversed briefly. Shortly afterwards, he was arrested for debt, but was released by arrangement Mrs Vernon, his sister. He and James then set off for Blackfriars in search of a sermon. They were overtaken by Essex and his armed demonstration and forced to go along with it for fear of death. As soon as they heard that Thomas Gerard, a former ally of Essex, had proscribed the earl and his supporters, the Littletons got away and took refuge in a wool draper's shop near St Paul's. Sir Edward explained that he failed to report to the authorities on the following day, as instructed, because he was tired and lame. His only reason for visiting Drayton Bassett had been that he had a daughter working in the service of Lettice Knollys, whom he liked to see about once every six weeks. After his interrogation, Littleton's case was processed quickly: it seems that Sir Walter Raleigh was asked to expedite the cases of the Littletons, with a degree of success. By 26 February Edward's name had been added to a list of those \\"fit to be forborne from being indicted, but yet to be fined\\", with the proviso that he was \\"to be delivered upon good bonds.\\"Cecil Papers, 21–28 February 1601 In June Sir Edward again appeared on a list, this time of those to be fined, although it was not yet decided to which of her faithful servants the Queen would grant the fine, specified as £400. He wrote to Cecil, asking for easy terms: :\\"As I have great cause to bemoan the bitterness of my fortune so ignorantly and suddenly to be thrown into so disloyal an action, so do I acknowledge her Majesty' commiseration and your Honour's in the fine imposed upon me, accounting the same not as a compensation for my offence (having learned of your Honour that between loyalty and disloyalty there is no pecuniary proportion) but as a remembrance to posterity of her Majesty's mercy. Far be it from me to seek any further mitigation, yet humbly crave I pardon to unfold my estate which may move your Lordships to give me some convenient 'stalment. My living is divided into three parts, of which my mother has one, my brethren and sisters another, and the third, which amounteth not to two hundred pounds per annum, must suffice for the maintenance of myself and thirteen children. The more time I have by instalment, the better I shall be able to satisfy the fine. —London, this 13 June 1601.\\" Essex himself and Christopher Blount, his step-father and Staffordshire MP, were executed, together with other leaders. John Littleton was accused of storing arms at Prestwood, indicted, escaped execution, but died in prison in July. Edward Littlewood was lucky to escape with his life, although he lost his position on the Staffordshire bench, as well as facing a steep fine. His mother's death in 1602 must have improved his financial position, and he was restored to the bench in June of that year. This makes it likely that his explanations were considered at least plausible and that the more lurid accusations against him were discredited. Member of Parliament With the accession of James I in 1603, the political turbulence of Elizabeth's last years was forgotten. Among those who benefited most from James's accession were William Paget, 4th Baron Paget, Protestant scion of the formerly Catholic dynasty, and Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, both of whom were promised restoration of their family lands and titles. Another beneficiary was Thomas Gerard, a former Essex supporter, who was soon elevated to the peerage. In the Staffordshire election of March 1604, even before these improvements in their situation were formally ratified, the powerful aristocratic families reasserted themselves. The Devereux faction, essentially the Puritan minority among the local gentry, were able to reorganise and to pursue a coherent policy, informed by previous mistakes. In order not to split the vote, they put up only one candidate, Edward Littleton of Pillaton. They conceded the other seat to the Paget faction.The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1604–1629 – Staffordshire (Author: Ben Coates) Paget's nominee was Sir Robert Stanford of Perry Hall, Staffordshire. A Protestant head of a Catholic family, like Paget himself, Stanford was widely acceptable to the recusant gentry and to the much larger number of conforming Catholics. The Catholic basis of Stanford's nomination was recognised by Littleton, who later commented: \\"the common speech is that the assembly at Stafford on Thursday was rather to choose a pope then a knight for the Parliament because they were all of that tribe.\\" Walter Bagot, the sheriff, was informed by his legal adviser that \\"if Sir Edward Littleton and Sir Robert Stanford carry off the election [it] will be well enough liked of and is least trouble.\\" However, the informal plan for a balanced ticket of Littleton and Stanford ran into the enmity of Sir Walter Harcourt, an Essex supporter who had sat for the county twice. Formerly a good friend, Harcourt was deeply in debt and had convinced himself that Littleton was conspiring with his creditors. He launched a campaign of disruption, including an attempt to get Littleton outlawed. Bagot kept Littleton fully informed of Harcourt's manoeuvres. He interceded unsuccessfully with Harcourt to desist and subsequently he was forced to drop his suits by increasing debts. Littleton thanked Bagot by sending him two horses – clearly a favourite Littleton touch. As a result, he was returned unopposed alongside Stanford, probably on 15 March. Littleton was made a member of eight committees. One of these handled the restoration of the earls of Essex, Southampton and Arundel, all executed after the Essex rebellion. In April he was also appointed to a conference with the House of Lords about a proposed Union with Scotland. He served at the trinity quarter sessions in Stafford during June and then went back to Parliament, where he was appointed to a committee on poaching. However, after a vigorous start, Littleton's involvement in parliamentary work quickly tailed off. He is not mentioned in parliamentary records after 1604. This may be due partly to involvement in his property disputes. He was fined by the Star Chamber in 1609 for disturbances during his feud with Wakering. However, faltering health was another likely factor. The parliament lasted for seven years, outliving both Stanford and Littleton. Stanford was replaced by Sir John Egerton on his death in 1607. In 1610 the local magnates sent a certificate to Parliament averring that Littleton was dying. A by-election was ordered on 19 October. On 15 November, Francis Trentham was elected to replace Litteton as knight of the shire for Staffordshire. ==Death== Sir Edward Littleton died on 17 December 1610. He was interred at the church of St Michael and All Angels in Penkridge on the following day. Subsequently, a large and imposing tomb was built for himself and for his wife, Margaret Devereux, who survived until 1627. Margaret Devereux proved his will on 14 February 1611. Daughters of Sir Edward Littleton and Margaret Devereux, from the double tomb in St. Michael's church, Penkridge. Sons of Sir Edward Littleton and Margaret Devereux, from the double tomb in St. Michael's church, Penkridge. ==Marriage and family== Edward Littleton married Margaret Devereux. She was the daughter of Sir William Devereux of Merevale Hall, Warwickshire, and Jane Scudamore. Sir William's father was Walter Devereux, 1st Viscount Hereford, who was the great- grandfather of the Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Hence Essex was Margaret Devereux's first cousin once removed. Devereux was used by the Littletons for several generations as a given name for younger sons. Littleton and Margaret had 14 children, many of whom did not survive childhood. The fifth child, and third son, Edward Littleton, succeeded him in his estates. All of the children, six sons and eight daughters, were represented on the front of their tomb in St. Michael's church, Penkridge, which also bears the effigies of the successor Edward and his wife, Mary Fisher, on an upper tier. ==ReferencesSee also== *History of Penkridge *Littleton Baronets Category:English MPs 1604–1611 Category:High Sheriffs of Staffordshire Category:English landowners Category:English rebels Edward Category:1550s births Category:1610 deaths Category:16th-century English politicians ","title":"Edward Littleton (died 1610)"},{"id":"35194251","text":"Kaszabellus formosanus is a species of beetle in the family Carabidae, the only species in the genus Kaszabellus. ==References== Category:Platyninae ","title":"Kaszabellus"},{"id":"35194252","text":"Metasia cyrnealis is a species of moth in the family Crambidae.

It was also known as The Comeback. Although the movie was not completed, eleven minutes of footage from it survive today.The Throwback at National Film and Sound Archive ==Background== Shirley spent 1914 to 1920 working in Hollywood before returning to Australia. He announced he was going to form Arthur Shirley Productions, a company worth £100,000, to make movies for worldwide distribution and had bought a building in Rose Bay to use as a studio. Their first production was to be The Throwback, written by Pat O'Cotter, a writer for the Saturday Evening Post. Shirley also intended to make two other films, set in Tasmania – an adaptation of The Captive Singer by Marie Bjelke-Petersen, and an unnamed story set on the west coast. ==Production== The Throwback started filming, with Shirley having hired Ernest Higgins as cinematographer and brought over Lawson Harris from the US to assist as production manager. However, the company went into liquidation before the film was completed. Shirley and Higgins attempted to complete the film with financing from the latter. However Higgins and Shirley began to have artistic disagreements: in particular, the religious Higgins objected to semi- nudes of a mural that had been painted for a cabaret scene and had concerns over the emphasis on dancing girls who appeared in the movie. Shirley and an actress, Vera Remee, sued Higgins for salary; he refused to pay and kept the reels of film.Graham Shirley, 'Arthur Shirley of Sydney Australia', Shirley Family Association ==Lawsuit== Shirley ended up suing Higgins for £1,000 in damages for alleged breach of contract and for the detention of certain films and plates in connection with the movie. Shirley claimed that Higgins had promised to pay money for the preparation and production of the movie to a maximum of £600. Higgins argued that Shirley had departed from the arrangement between them without his consent, and that he had disagreed with Shirley during filming over scenes that were shot, including the substitution of the female actors. The jury eventually found for Higgins, and awarded him costs. As a result, Shirley declared bankruptcy for the second time in his life, claiming he was the victim of Higgins' \\"hate, spleen and malice\\". ==References *Documentation relating to copyright of film at National Archives of Australia Category:1920s unfinished films ","title":"The Throwback (unfinished film)"},{"id":"35194290","text":"Laevagonum is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species: * Laevagonum cistelum Darlington, 1952 * Laevagonum citum Darlington, 1952 * Laevagonum frustum Darlington, 1971 * Laevagonum giluwe Darlington, 1971 * Laevagonum pertenue Darlington, 1971 * Laevagonum subcistelum Darlington, 1952 * Laevagonum subcitum Darlington, 1952 ==References== Category:Platyninae ","title":"Laevagonum"},{"id":"35194304","text":"Metasia ibericalis is a species of moth in the family Crambidae.

Her directorial debut, the digital feature, Pretend, premiered at the Lincoln Center’s New York Video Festival in 2003. The film uses an array of multiple frames and complex graphics to tell the story of a troubled family living in upstate New York. \\"The collage of images evokes the memories, fantasies and fears of the characters, bridging the distance between the objective reality of what the camera sees and the inner worlds that are ordinarily left to actors to convey,’’ wrote A.O. Scott of The New York Times, who also called Pretend a “harrowing, dazzling feature.” In Sixty Cameras Against the War (2004), Talen unearthed unexpected synchronicity among random digital videos taken in a massive but little-seen anti-war rally held in New York City on Feb 15, 2003, just days before the invasion of Iraq. The film was shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art among other locations. Talen has also written for such publications as the Village Voice, American Film and the Los Angeles Weekly, and was a contributing editor to Channels Magazine. She assistant-edited an award-winning Merchant/Ivory documentary and worked as a researcher and assistant producer on the original reality series, Unsolved Mysteries. Her studio screenwriting assignments began in 1991, on the strength of a spec script – A Simple Wedding – which was eventually sold to Douglas Wick at Columbia Pictures and was selected by the LA Reader as one of the ten best unproduced scripts of 1992. She has since written adaptations and original screenplays and worked with such directors as Gillian Armstrong, Paul Verhoeven and Robert Altman.

(English translation: Listen to My Question!) is a Marathi Indian black and white film released in 1964. The film is produced and directed by Anant Govind Mane under his own banner \\"Chetana Chitra\\". The storyline of the film is based on a traditional theatre form called Tamasha. The film has many popular songs sung by Sulochana Chavan. The film won the Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film at the 12th National Film Awards ceremony held on 31 May 1965. Anant Mane's previous two film Dhakti Jau (1958) and Manini (1961) also won National Film Awards at the 6th and 9th ceremony respectively. ==Plot== Jyotiba, a tamasha conductor of a popular group enters in a competition against another group led by Raghoo. The competition is a musical Question-Answer, with the looser having to wear lugada for the rest of his life. Jyotiba loses the competition and has to face humiliation due to which he and his wife succumb to death. To avenge the death of her parents, their little daughter Anu decides to excel in the art form. She takes the vow to defeat Raghoo and make him wear lugada. Anu trains in dance and singing under guidance of Kulkarni master. After 12 years, she grows into a young attractive woman (now played by Jayshree Gadkar) and finally decides to enter the competition with her troupe. Jayawanta (played by Arun Sarnaik), who is the star of another competitor group starts falling for her. Impressed by his poetry, Anu hires him to be part of her troupe. But it turns out that Jayawanta is son of Raghoo. With her broken heart, Anu decides to give up on the competition. But she is encouraged by her aunt to not give up. She hence stands up again. Other troupe members of Jayawanta take this as a threat for their own troupe. One night in middle of the performance, they break the lights in the theatre and kidnap Anu in the darkness. Anu is then made to believe that it was Jayawanta itself who had sent men to do this. But then Raghoo comes and frees her. A day before the competition, Anu meets her teacher to take his blessing. Kulkarni master wishes her good luck to win. Raghoo who is also a close friend of Kulkarni master becomes disappointed in master for this. But master explains him how the win is important for Anu. After few rounds of Question-Answer in the competition Anu is not able to give answer to one of the questions asked by Jayawanta. She hence requests time for thinking and answer him the next evening.

Its main purpose is to provide access to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) from the metropolitan area. Part of the Parkway from its southern end at State Highway 183 (SH 183, Airport Freeway) and SH 360 to the South Toll Plaza for DFW Airport is designated as State Highway Spur 97\\\\. International Parkway is a de facto toll road, though the toll booths also handle parking fees for the airport. ==Route description== The International Parkway starts at an interchange with SH 183 and SH 360 southwest of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. From there it runs eastward on ramps parallel to SH 183 (Airport Freeway) before turning northward as Spur 97\\\\. The Spur 97 designation ends on the south side of the airport property before the parkway passes through a toll booth. The parkway runs across the airport property between the various terminal buildings. North of the terminals, the parkway passes through another toll booth before reaching an interchange with I-635, SH 114, and SH 121. ==History== Spur 97 was designated on May 9, 1940 on a route from SH 77 to Marietta in Cass County as a renumbering of SH 245. This route was cancelled and became a portion of FM 250 on September 26, 1945. Spur 97 was redesignated on March 31, 1965 on a route from IH 610 and SH 225 to Lawndale Ave in Houston. The route became a portion of SH 225 on April 2, 1969 when it was extended westward, as old SH 225 to SH 35 became part of I-610. The International Parkway opened to traffic on September 21, 1973; the current Spur 97 designation dates to July 30, 1974. == Tolls == All vehicles traveling on International Parkway, including those destined for the airport terminals, are required to pay a toll. The tolls operate on a ticket-based system and are payable by cash, credit or debit card, or TollTag upon exiting. Toll rates mirror the fees for Terminal Parking and are based on time spent between the toll plazas. {  +International Parkway Toll Rates (as of March 2020) !Time !Rate - Less than 8 minutes $6.00 - 8 minutes to 30 minutes $2.00 - 30 minutes to 2 hours $3.00 - 2 hours to 4 hours $9.00 - 4 hours to 6 hours $10.00 - 6 hours to 24 hours $24.00 } The high toll rate for vehicles spending less than 8 minutes on airport property is targeted at commuters using the highway as a shortcut. It was raised from $4 to $6 on October 1, 2019. The at-grade service roads parallel to International Parkway provide a free alternative for vehicles passing through the airport property.

Mpophomeni (which means the place of the waterfall in isiZulu) derives its name from the well known Howick waterfall. Zulu - Mpophomeni Tourism Experience - Brief History of Mpophomeni In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a fight between the people of Mpophomeni and the people living in the rural areas of Kwa Shifu, Haza and Mahlangeni. The community of Mpophomeni were ANC (African National Congress)supporters and the rural areas were strongly behind the opposing IFP (Inkatha Freedom Party). The death of Nokulunga Gumede, a five-year-old girl who was run down by a military vehicle (Casper) during the violence taking place in the township at the time was a catalyst for change – no-one stopped the violence when they had the chance. Reconciliation only truly started between the township and the rural occupants in 1993 and 1994. A memorial was built in remembrance of this and named after Nokulunga Gumede - the youngest victim of the violence as well as commemorating the 120 people that died.Zulu - Mpophomeni Tourism Experience - Brief History of Mpophomeni There are three high schools, Mpophomeni High, Asibemunye and Umthombo as well as five primary schools namely, Sifisesihle, Zamuthule, Qhamukile, Isibongo and Nhlanhleni.

He was born and died in Bologna, where he was active in a late- Baroque style. His surname is also spelled Tórri. He initially trained with his father, Giovanni Battista. On 30 March 1697 he was appointed architect to the Senate of Bologna. He worked on the designs used to reconstruct the Collegio Germanico-Ungarico (1700), now a seminary. He helped design the building's interior courtyard. In 1703, he designed the present building for the parish church of San Tommaso dal Mercate, which was completed by Giovanni Antonio Taruffi. He is said to have invented machinery (trafila, 1710) for the mint at Bologna; and helped with the building of the astronomical observatory at the University of Bologna. Other buildings in Bologna to which he contributed include the church of San Gabriele (begun 1700, finished 1720), the palazzo San Giorgio (1709), the church of San Domenico in Modena (1708). He contributed some designs for the church of the Santissima Trinita that had been begun by F. Martini in 1662. He also contributed some plans, at a distance, for a palazzo that William III of England contemplated. The building presently housing the Court of Appeals in Bologna, the Palazzo Baciocchi, previously Ranuzzi, has a grand staircase designed by Torri. He also contributed to reconstructions and modernizations at Palazzo Scarani, Palazzo Isolani de San Stefano, and Palazzo Pepoli Campogrande.

During the course of Mrs Harris' evidence, she stated that she and her 37-year-old husband had departed Liverpool on board the Mona on the 10:30hrs sailing the previous morning, at which time her husband appeared well. However, he soon became unwell and an appeal was made on board for a Doctor.

Established by the U.S. Department of State at the request of the U.S. Congress (Public Law 106-553) and administered by the Bureau’s Cultural Heritage Center since 2001, the U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP) supports the preservation of cultural sites, cultural objects, and forms of traditional cultural expression in eligible countries. In requesting the establishment of AFCP, Congress noted that “Cultural preservation offers an opportunity to show a different American face to other countries, one that is non-commercial, non-political, and non- military. By taking a leading role in efforts to preserve cultural heritage, we show our respect for other cultures…” The AFCP supports a wide range of projects to preserve cultural heritage, such as the restoration of historic buildings, archaeological site preservation, assessment and conservation of museum collections, improved storage conditions for archives and manuscripts, and the documentation of vanishing indigenous languages. Since 2008, the AFCP has also supported a limited number of large-scale projects to preserve globally important ancient and historic sites. ==See also== * Kuruhinna Tharaagandu ==References * Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation * Bureau for Educational and Cultural Affairs Category:Cultural exchange Category:United States Department of State Category:Heritage organizations Category:History organizations based in the United States ","title":"Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation"},{"id":"35194643","text":"Ode Ojowu (born August 16, 1948) is a Nigerian economics professorF.G accused of diverting farmers money, Prof Ojowu - Vanguard News and a Former Chief Executive of the National Planning Commission / Chief Economic Adviser to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria between 2004 and 2005.\\"Nigeria: The Sack of Prof Ode Ojowu\\".

The coaster features a small vehicle, holding two people, that climbs vertically inside a hollow steel tower then spirals back down around the same tower. There is a small section of track at the base of the tower with a few small dips and two turns to bring the ride vehicle back to the station. Each vehicle has a single rubber tire with a hydraulic clutch braking system that governs the speed of the vehicle as it descends the tower. The rubber tire engages a center rail that begins halfway through the first spiral. The ride stands 45 feet tall with a track length of 450 feet. A typical ride lasts approximately 70 seconds. ==History== The coaster was invented by Walter House of Amarillo, Texas, and Chance acquired the manufacturing rights and started producing it in 1969. The coaster was designed to be a carnival ride, fitting on two trailers, but several units were purchased by amusement parks where they were set up as permanent attractions. When the ride was first offered in 1969 it had a price tag of $35,000. Chance built 32 of these units, two of which still operate at a permanent park. Many can also be found at carnivals all over the world. ==Park installations== The following is a list of parks that are known to have operated a Chance Toboggan. * Adventureland (New York) * Aérocity Parc (France) * Arnolds Park * AstroWorld * Boblo Island Amusement Park * Clacton Pier * Conneaut Lake Park (closed) * Dog Patch USA (Arkansas) * Enchanted Forest (Indiana) * Grand Prix Amusements (Manitoba) * Grand Strand Amusement Park (Myrtle Beach, South Carolina) * Great Adventure Amusement Park (Flushing, N.Y.) * Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach * Hersheypark (two) * Jenkinson's Boardwalk * Lakemont Park * Little Amerricka (still in operation) * Old Chicago * Parc Belmont * Playland Park (Illinois) * Santa's Village * Shaheen's Fun-O-Rama Park (Mass.) * Sportland Pier (N.J.) * Stewart Beach Park (Texas) * Trimper's Rides * Xingqinggong (China) * Magic Mountain -Merimbula-(Australia) ==Traveling carnival providers== * Skerbeck Family Carnival (Escanaba, Michigan) ==References * Listing of Chance Toboggan coasters at RCDB.com Category:Types of roller coasters ","title":"Toboggan (roller coaster)"},{"id":"35194691","text":"Kliprand is a town in West Coast District Municipality in the Western Cape province of South Africa.

The film is written by Sai and Kankurō Kudō, starring Kenichi Matsuyama in the titular role. It premiered at Toronto International Film Festival on September 16, 2009, to mixed reviews. ==Plot== The young Kamui is a runaway ninja who has abandoned his clan, now constantly pursued by assassins. His travels bring him to a seashore village where he meets Hanbei, a fisherman who shares the former ninja's sense of honor. Though Hanbei's wife is wary of the stranger, the fisherman and Kamui become good friends. Life at the seaside seems idyllic but Kamui does not get to enjoy the peace for very long when his past life is catching up on him, and everything and everyone is not as it seems.

The film was released as Kamui in the English version, and as Kamui: The Lone Ninja for the 2010 UK DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases by Manga Entertainment; it was also re-titled as Kamui - The Last Ninja by Cine-Asia in Germany. ==Reception== English-language critical reception of the film was generally mixed. Rob Nelson of Variety wrote that \\"this would-be epic needs more show and less tell\\" as it \\"comes to a crawl too often over its two-hour running time,\\" but applauded Matsuyama as \\"perfect as the brooding title character.\\" Alternatively, DVD Talk's David Johnson said \\"it makes Scott Pilgrim vs. The World look like The Pianist\\" and \\"if you can get past the laughably bad effects work, there's ridiculous fun to be had with Kamui.\\" Eye for Film gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, applauding its \\"immense visual beauty\\" which helps to \\"keep the viewer entertained and enthralled.\\" Tony Rayns even called it \\"probably the best ninja movie ever made.\\" However, EasternKicks.com, which gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, commented on Rayns' opinion by saying this would be true only if \\"your reference point is Ninja Assassin or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,\\" but called the film enjoyable. Kurt Halfyard of Twitch Film wrote that \\"function and value of art is a pretty high minded premise for a simple, populist action-melodrama\\" and \\"the collection of underwater, tree- top and sea-side ninja battles are not enough to enliven the whole turgid affair,\\" adding that \\"Shinobi offers a more compelling scenario and characters and that is not saying much.\\" Heroic Cinema, rating the film 6/10, stated that \\"when it comes to a movie that could have been great —should have been great— that’s a whole new level of disappointment.\\" Cinema Verdict reviewer rated it 5/10, also finding Kamui to be a disappointment, \\"built upon a story and characters who didn’t capture my attention with its overall fake look.\\" Nevertheless, James Mudge of BeyondHollywood.com wrote that Kamui \\"stands out as one of the better examples of the ninja genre,\\" stating that Sai brought \\"Sanpei Shirato’s vision to life without too much grand standing, and the film is all the more enjoyable for paying equal amounts of attention to character and excitement.\\" ==See also== *Kamui the Ninja (Ninpu Kamui Gaiden), an anime adaptation of the manga series. ==References * *Kamui Gaiden at the Internet Movie Database Category:2009 films Category:Live-action films based on manga Category:Films set in Japan Category:Films set in the 17th century Category:Funimation Category:Japanese action films Category:Japanese drama films Category:Japanese films Category:Ninja films Category:Films scored by Taro Iwashiro ","title":"Kamui Gaiden"},{"id":"35194728","text":"\\"Hell on Earth\\" is the ninth episode of the American television series, Smash.

When Frank confronts Michael, Michael tells Frank about the original affair, and Frank punches Michael. Frank moves out of the apartment. Julia runs into Michael, and explains how she has to take responsibility for the mess she created. Meanwhile, Tom (Christian Borle) finds out the man he's dating, John (Neal Bledsoe), is a Republican, and has a hard time reconciling how much he likes his boyfriend with how much he hates Republicans.

It aimed to determine whether and how social media can be used to accomplish a realistic, time-sensitive, international law enforcement objective. The challenge was won by a team that located 3 of the 5 suspects. ==Challenge description== The objective of the challenge was to be the first to locate and photograph five volunteer \\"suspects\\" in five different cities: Washington DC, New York City, London, Stockholm and Bratislava in Slovakia. At 8:00am local time, the organizers posted on their website a mug shot of each suspect on the day of the event. Each suspect wore a shirt bearing the event logo. The suspect’s face, dress, and the contest logo were clearly visible in each of the mug shots. Contestants used only this photograph and a brief description provided on the event website to identify each suspect. The photos would be verified through a unique code on both the front and back of the shirt, which was not revealed in a suspect’s mug shot but known only to the organizers. Participants had to make sure that the code phrase is clearly visible in each submission. The winning team or individual would receive up to US$5,000 in reward. The challenge was created by an international group of graduate students from six countries, led by George Washington University graduate student J.R. deLara. The challenge is advertised as an \\"independent, nonprofit event,\\" but it is being sponsored by the US State Department and the US Embassy in Prague.Challenge Web Site \\"Tag Challenge\\" , FAQ, March 1, 2012 Role of Social Media The scale of the challenge means that no single person or group of friends can tackle it on their own. Instead, winning was likely to rely on the ability to assemble a very large, ad hoc team of spotters. As such, the Tag Challenge is an example of crowdsourcing, an approach to accomplishing tasks by opening them to the public. It is similar to the DARPA Network Challenge, in which teams competed to locate 10 red weather balloons placed at random locations all over the United States. However, the Tag Challenge was expected to be significantly harder, due to the international distribution of the targets over so many countries and, more importantly, the fact that they were mobile. ==Teams== Given the scale and geographical distribution of the challenge, the most likely winner was going to be a team rather than an individual. * CrowdScanner: Organized by computer scientists from UCSD, Masdar Institute, and University of Southampton and led by Iyad Rahwan, this team included one of the winners of the DARPA Network Challenge. The strategy, based on the DARPA Network Challenge winning strategy, was as follows: > \\"You receive $500 if you upload an image of a suspect that is accepted by > the challenge organizers. If a friend you invited using your individualized > referral link uploads an acceptable image of a suspect, YOU also get $100. > Furthermore, recruiters of the first 2000 recruits who signed up by referral > get $1 for each recruit they refer to sign up with us (using the > individualized referral link).\\"CrowdScanner \\"CrowdScanner\\", March 23, 2012 * TagTeam_: The Tag TeamTag Team \\"Tag Team\\"], March 26, 2012group was run by a diverse group of individuals with backgrounds including international relations from the University of Chicago, statistics from Georgetown University, and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and George Washington University.About Tag Team \\"About Tag Team\\", March 26, 2012 Their strategy was to promise to distribute whatever winnings they receive to local charities, the individuals who locate the suspects, and those who provide a reference to a person to locates the suspects.Tag You're It \\"Tag You're It\\", March 26, 2012 ==Outcome== The challenge took place on March 31, 2012.

It was found that during the challenge, people were \\"able to consistently route information in a targeted fashion even under increasing time pressure.\\" Using a model of social-media fueled global mobilization, the authors estimated that during the most time-critical portion of the challenge, one in three social messages were geographically targeted. A blog on MIT Technology Review dubbed this ability \\"12 hours of separation\\" in homage to the Six degrees of separation theory. ==References * Tag Challenge Official Website * GreenTagTeam Website * Team Rave Website * Tag Team Website * Crowdscanner Team Website Category:Crowdsourcing ","title":"Tag Challenge"},{"id":"35194734","text":"Ildar Amirovich Abdrazakov (; , Abdrazaqov İldar Ämir ulı; born 26 September 1976) is a Russian bass opera singer.\\"Mariinsky soloists win Grammies\\" , Mariinsky Theater, 14 February 2012 ==Early life and career== Abdrazakov was born in Ufa, the capital of the Republic of Bashkortostan within Russia.

However, trouble starts when Surendra's brainchild, a virtual reality program on temples of South India is sabotaged, and he is accused of selling out to a rival company. Disillusioned by the sudden turn of events, he crashes into a truck and sustains a serious head injury that requires a major operation. Savitri finds herself deserted by all her well- wishers when it comes to financial help, and her husband's life hangs in the balance. A lady doctor suggests that she become pregnant through artificial insemination for a rich man, whose wife is impotent, in exchange for monetary remuneration. Savitri agrees and the rest of the film is based on the social stigma attached to artificial insemination and surrogate motherhood. ==Cast== * Soundarya as Savitri * Vikram as Surendra * Nutan Prasad as Judge * Tanikella Bharani as Lawyer * Narra Venkateswara Rao * M.

Rahman was initially signed on to score the film's music, but he later opted out owing to the film's small budget. Soundarya dubbed her own voice for her character in the movie. ==Release== The film opened to very positive reviews with a critic noting that \\"in short, this is cinema at its best\\" and that \\"the script is smooth flowing and engrossing\\" and that \\"it leaves you with a thought and a sense of pride in Indian cinema. Whether it will go down well with the masses is doubtful as there are no songs, action or cheap comedy, which might be a bitter pill to swallow for most\\". In regard to performances, the critic notes that Soundarya \\"excels in her role and that her expressions, body language and dialogue delivery fit her role like a glove\\" and that \\"Vikram has given a controlled performance as the troubled, confused, yet loving husband.\\" The film was later re-shot and released in Tamil as Kanden Seethaiyai with a comedy track separately shot with Vivek, Chaplin Balu, Kullamani, and Mayilsamy added in. ==References * Category:2001 films Category:Indian films Category:2000s Telugu-language films Category:Indian pregnancy films Category:Indian drama films Category:Indian films without songs Category:2001 drama films Category:Films directed by Kranthi Kumar ","title":"9 Nelalu"},{"id":"35194759","text":"The 2012–13 Long Island Blackbirds men's basketball team represented The Brooklyn Campus of Long Island University during the 2012–13 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

He was a founding member of the British Ecological Society. ==Early life and education== Smith was born in Dundee, Scotland, and educated at the University College of Dundee, where he obtained a BSc in botany and zoology, and at the University of Munich, where he obtained a PhD. At Munich, Smith studied plant pathology and translated Carl von Tubeuf's Pflanzenkrankheiten. ==Professional career== After graduating from university, Smith taught at the Morgan Academy in Dundee until 1891, when he took a demonstrator's position at the University of Edinburgh working with Isaac Bayley Balfour. From 1892 to 1893 he served as lecturer in agriculture for the County of Forfar. In 1893 he began doctoral work at Munich and in 1894 he returned to the University of Edinburgh, where he lectured in plant physiology. In 1897 he took up a position at the Yorkshire College (which became the University of Leeds in 1904) and then moved to the Edinburgh and East of Scotland College of Agriculture in 1908, where he spent the remainder of his career. ==Major contributions== Smith's major contributions came as a consequence of the death of his brother, Robert. Like his brother, Robert Smith had studied at Dundee, but then went on to the University of Montpellier, where he had studied under Charles Flahault, a pioneer of phytogeography and phytosociology. Robert Smith adapted Flahault's sampling method to better suit Scottish vegetation and went on to pioneer vegetation mapping in the British Isles. When he died suddenly in 1900, William Smith completed his brother's unfinished manuscript and took up his own surveys of the vegetation of Yorkshire. In 1903, together with Charles Edward Moss and W. Munn Rankin, he published the first vegetation maps of England. In 1904, together Arthur Tansley, Moss, Rankin and others, Smith established the Central Committee for the Survey and Study of British Vegetation, later renamed the British Vegetation Committee. The group set about coordinating ongoing vegetation surveys and standardising methodology between them. In 1906 the committee produced a pamphlet entitled Suggestions for Beginning Survey Work on Vegetation. In 1913, the committee organised the British Ecological Society, the first ever professional body of ecologists. Smith served as president of the society in 1918 and 1919. After returning to Scotland in 1908, Smith worked on agricultural problems, applying an ecological approach to the management of hill pastures. ==References== Category:1866 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Scottish botanists Category:Scottish ecologists Category:Alumni of the University of Dundee Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni Category:People from Dundee Category:People associated with Edinburgh Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh Category:Academics of the University of Leeds ","title":"William Gardner Smith (botanist)"},{"id":"35194951","text":"At Daggers Drawn may refer to: *At Daggers Drawn (album), debut album by metalcore band Sea of Treachery *At Daggers Drawn (novel), fifth novel by Russian author Nikolai Leskov ","title":"At Daggers Drawn"},{"id":"35194961","text":"Mand is a small village of Mandla district, Madhya Pradesh, India.

It was described by Francis Walker in 1859. It is one of 20 moths in the genus Ostrinia and is of Eurasian origin. The larvae have a gray mid-dorsal line and can be light pink or beige. The adult adzuki bean borer has a yellowish-brown forewing with jagged lines and variable darker shading, with a wingspan that ranges from 20 to 32 mm. The moths of this species are nocturnal and tend to be attracted to light. The larvae mainly feed on Artemisia vulgaris, but may also feed on maize. Before boring the stalks of their host plant, early instar larvae graze on young plant tissues that are mostly apical.Divergence in behaviour between the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, and its sibling species Ostrinia scapulalis: adaptation to human harvesting? They are typically found in corn fields, gardens, and commercial crop plantations and they are usually active from April to October. They are primarily found in Japan, although they can be found in other regions of Asia and Europe as well. == Distribution == O. scapulalis is most commonly found in the western (from western Europe to Russia) and eastern (from eastern China to Japan) Palearctic regions. However, this species' distribution may be wider than that, and may even be continuous from Europe to Japan. Japan has a significantly large concentration of moths, and the bulk of studies performed there are conducted on the adzuki bean borer. The moth thrives in the habitats and the natural resources found in both the western and eastern Palearctic regions.Reconsidering the taxomony of several Ostrinia species in the light of reproductive isolation: a tale for Ernst Mayr == Enemies ==  Diseases  Wolbachia bacteria is responsible for one of the most prevalent diseases for O. scapulalis. These bacteria are maternally transmitted and their presence can cause many reproductive abnormalities in arthropods such as the adzuki bean borer. Namely, the bacteria can convert genetic males into functional females in a process known as feminization. This can skew the sex ratio of a population, which may in turn lower reproductive rates.  Predators  Predators of O. scapulalis include: * Lizards (Lacertilia) * Cats (Felis catus) * Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) * Rodents (Rodentia) * Insectivores: birds, owls, and bats * Humans, specifically farmers (Homo sapiens)  Parasites  The Ostrinia species are victim to many natural parasites: * Lydella thompsoni * Pseudoperichaeta nigrolineata * Macrocentrus cingulum * Microsporidia (fungus) While Lydella thompsoni and Pseudoperichaeta nigrolineata both are known to parasitize other hosts, Macrocentrus cingulum is primarily associated with Ostrinia. Certain parasites such as Trichogramma brassicae are also used for biological control.  Defense mechanisms  The adzuki bean borer is able to emit ultrasonic pulses at 40 kHz. This can be used in the context of mating, but it can also be used to fend off predators that use ultrasound as a locating mechanism. The adzuki bean borer generates these pulses and flies erratically to confuse and escape predation, specifically from bats. == Parental care ==  Oviposition  The life cycle of O. scapulalis begins during oviposition. Oviposition behavior has been found to be influenced by oviposition-deterring pheromones (ODPs), also known as host-marking pheromones (MPs), that emanate from egg masses laid by other conspecific females. A female that is ready to oviposit tends to reject hosts that are marked with MPs to favor unmarked hosts. == Life history ==  Sex ratio distorters  Multiple studies have shown that there is a significant amount of sex ratio distortion that occurs in O. scapulalis. There are predicted to be two mechanisms of sex ratio distortion in this moth. One involves the bacteria Wolbachia (SRw+ trait) and another does not (SRw– trait). These traits may have been inherited from a common ancestor between O. furnicalis and O. scapulalis. The physiological reason as to why these traits induce a female biased sex ratio is unknown. It is suggested that the trait appearance is due to feminization, male killing at the larval stage, or meiotic drive. == Genetics ==  Subspecies  O. scapulalis is one of eight Ostrinia species that are found in Japan. There is an unusually low level of divergence between the adzuki bean borer and the other seven Ostrinia species. Specifically, O. orientalis and O. nubilalis have a low level of divergence from O. scapulalis. However, the adzuki bean borer is morphologically distinct from the other two. A recent study showed that there are major QTLs (quantitative trait loci) that are associated with the mating isolation between O. nubilalis and O. scapulalis. Specifically, the QTLs associated with pheromone characteristics were present on distinct linkage groups. Additional studies are required to target other aspects of the moths' genetic architectures which may explain their reproductive isolation. Other genetic differences may serve as the basis for other behavioral differences between the moths, such as the fact that O. scapulalis, a mugwort-race moth, emerges from the pupa 10 days earlier than maize-race moths. == Mating == Ultrasound emission by Ostrinia Scapulalis  Mate searching behavior  In most species, females are viewed as the more choosy sex with regards to the attributes of a given male due to a larger investment in a single gamete (the ova) by the female. However, evidence shows that O. scapulalis demonstrates behavior that would indicate the opposite being true. Females may pursue males (using species-specific pheromones) and males vary their investment in females of varying quality due to a significant cost of copulation to the male. This cost includes activities such as the production of sperm, territorial guarding, and parental care. Males were found to invest less in females that were older, smaller, or water deprived, indicating that the adzuki bean borer does change its reproductive investment due to the quality of the mate. This alteration in reproductive investment also changes with respect to the age of the males. More modulation occurs with older males, demonstrating that mate-searching behavior is influenced by female condition and male age. While older males were found to have higher rates of mating success than younger males, this was merely found to be due to a higher frequency of courtship and not reflective of female preference.  Female/male interactions   Female pheremones  Recently, gas chromatography has been used in order to identify the female sex chromosomes of O. scapulalis. The pheromone cocktail has been identified as a combination of the following compounds: (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (Z11–14:OAc) and (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate (E11–14:OAc) in a ratio of 100:3. In any single sex pheromone gland of the female moth, there is approximately 6.6 ng of Z11–14: OAc and 2.4 ng of E11–14:OAc present on average though it varies significantly. It has been shown that variations in the ratio of one chemical to the other is largely influenced by genetic factors. Wind tunnel bioassays have shown that the binary blend of the two pheromones impact male behavior in the same way that a virgin female does, thus linking male behavior to the pheromones released by virgin females.  Male ultrasound courtship  The male adzuki bean borer is primarily known to produce ultrasounds during courtship. This helps with courtship since the ultrasound renders the female motionless making copulation easier. These emitted pulses continue for an extended period time at a frequency of 40 kHz. However, the amplitude of this modulation is significantly altered between different populations which has been especially correlated to the surrounding geography of the population.  Other courtship behavior  Outside of using ultrasound, there are other courtship behaviors observed. The male adzuki bean borer generally approaches from the rear of the female. As it does so, he fans his wings to appear larger. The male then vibrates the raised wings and extends his genital claspers. His abdomen is also extended at the targeted female. If the display is successful, the female accepts the male. If the display is not successful, the female may walk or fly away.  Nuptial gifts  The male adzuki bean borer provides nuptial gifts to the female in the form of proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, and sugars that are included in the spermatophore. These nuptial gifts are known to significantly improve the female's reproductive output. For example, the protein is thought to help with egg production. The resources that are required of the male to do this generally are derived from larval sources. This proves to be at a substantial cost to the male. Since there is a trade off between investment in current reproduction and future reproduction, more investment in reproduction should be made towards the end of the moth's lifespan. As this idea predicts, older males were found to produce significantly larger spermatophores than younger males, thus indicating a greater reproductive effort. In contrast, neither female fecundity nor longevity and longevity was affected by age.  Multiple mating  Polygyny is common in the adzuki bean borer. Males of the species mate multiply and are polygynous although the females of the species mate only once and are monandrous. Males follow the many traces of female pheromones and land close to females before performing a courtship ritual and mating (transferring spermatophores to the female). This results in the majority of parental care being provided by the female of the species since male desertion is common. == Physiology ==  Hearing   Sound generation  O. scapulalis is able to produce ultrasonic sounds. The moth does so by rubbing the rough scales of its wings against other rough scales that are found in the midsection of its thorax. This action is key to producing sounds at various frequencies depending on how fast or slow the moth takes this action. The average frequency of sound generated is 40 kHz.  Hearing organs  These moths have tympanal ears sensitive to ultrasound. Tympanal organs consist of a chordotonal organ wrapped in tracheal epithelial tissue. The tympanum is a thin piece of transparent tissue that vibrates in response to ultrasonic sound. The tympanal organ is tuned to the sounds that bat calls make. Additionally, this kind of hearing is less prevalent in bat free areas. This suggests that the ears of these moths have evolved to fend off insectivores including bats that emit ultrasonic sounds.  Olfaction  Olfaction is primarily observed as a key factor in males. This is because males must be able to distinguish the female pheromones of its own species from those of other similar species. Male odorant receptors consist of olfactory sensilla. These sensilla are small sensory organs that may protrude or lie under the cuticle of the moth. In the adzuki bean borer, they are specifically sensitive to pheromones.  Diapause  Diapause is considered as a delay in animal development due to multiple environmental factors. O. scapulalis is known to partake in this behavior. The larvae of this species diapause throughout winter in the upper portion of the stem of their host plant. The moth's main host plant in which they diapause is the mugwort although they also are found in the maize and hop stems. The reason for the preference for the location of diapause is the identity of parasitoids found in both. Their prevalences differ between maize and mugwort resulting in differing benefits during diapause. ==References== Category:Moths described in 1859 Category:Pyraustinae Category:Moths of Japan Category:Palearctic Lepidoptera ","title":"Ostrinia scapulalis"},{"id":"35195015","text":"Mpumalanga also widely known as Hammarsdale is a town in eThekwini in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.

Colchester United Football Club is an English football club based in Colchester, Essex. Formed in 1937, the club competed in the Southern Football League from their foundation until 1950, when they were elected to the Football League. The club spent eleven years in the Third Division South and Third Division following the league's reorganisation in 1958, with a best finish of third place in 1957, one point behind rivals Ipswich Town and Torquay United. Colchester suffered their first relegation in 1961 as they finished 23rd in the Third Division, but spent just one season in the Fourth Division as they were promoted in second position, behind Millwall by just one point. This trend of relegation followed by promotion continued over the next few decades, before the club were eventually relegated from the Football League to the Conference in 1990. Player-manager Roy McDonough guided the club back to the Football League in 1992, winning the non-league double of the Conference title and the FA Trophy. The club then won promotion to the Second Division in 1998 with a 1–0 Third Division play-off Final win at Wembley against Torquay United. The club were again promoted in the 2005–06 season under the stewardship of Phil Parkinson, gaining the opportunity to play second tier football for the first time in their history. After two seasons in the Championship, Colchester were relegated back to League One. Colchester were relegated to the fourth tier for the first time in 18-years at the end of the 2015–16 season. Colchester United's first team have competed in a number of professional competitions, and all players who have played between 25 and 99 of these matches, either as a member of the starting line-up or as a substitute, are listed below.

He came to London about 1747, and some of his early plates bear the address \\"near Drummond's at Charing Cross\\". In debt to Robert Sayer the print-seller, he was arrested and confined to the Fleet prison; according to Sayer this in order that he might know where to find the dissipated Houston. He was released in 1760, on the accession of George III. As a free agent he was commissioned by Carington Bowles. Houston died in Hetton Street, London, on 4 August 1775, aged 54. ==Works== Houston's major works are engravings after Sir Joshua Reynolds, which include portraits of: * Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland, full-length; * Caroline, Duchess of Marlborough, and child; * Mary, Duchess of Ancaster; * Maria, Countess Waldegrave, later Duchess of Gloucester, with her daughter; * Elisabeth, Duchess of Argyll, and her son; * Lady Selina Hastings; * Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough; * Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield; and * Richard Robinson, archbishop of Armagh.

Written in 1103, it was the earliest comprehensive book of monastic rules for Chan Buddhist monasteries. The short essay Zuochan yi, also attributed to Zongze, is the earliest guide to seated meditation in the Chan tradition. Little is known about him, but the influence of his work was significant and he is exalted in the Pure Land documents as one of the patriarchs of the Pure Land lineage. He was raised by his mother, having lost his father (whose surname was Sun) at an early age. After studying Confucius at an early age he turned to Buddhism. He was ordained at the age of 29 by Fayun Faxiu, but later studied with Changlu Yingfu. Years later, he experienced a sudden awakening which he recorded in a poem, after which he was declared a Cijue Dashi (Master of Compassion and Enlightenment). ==References== Category:History of Buddhism Category:Pure Land Buddhism Category:Buddhist ethics Category:1107 deaths ","title":"Changlu Zongze"},{"id":"35195080","text":"Sarmad Tariq (17 December 1975 – 30 April 2014), also known as \\"the chairman\\", was a storyteller and motivational speaker from Islamabad, Pakistan.

He was Bishop of Halberstadt and later Bishop of Bamberg, then Archbishop of Mainz and finally Archbishop of Magdeburg. == Life == He was the fourth son of Margrave Frederick II of Meissen and his wife Matilda, the daughter of emperor Ludwig IV. On 1357, at the age of 17, Louis was appointed -- probably because of his membership of the powerful House of Wettin -- as Bishop of Halberstadt. In 1366 he resigned from this post when he was appointed Bishop of Bamberg by the King. In 1374, he resigned in Bamberg when he was appointed as Archbishop of Mainz. In 1381, he resigned in Mainz and was appointed Archbishop of Magdeburg. After the death of Archbishop John of Mainz in 1373, the cathedral chapter of Mainz elected Adolph I of Nassau as administrator of the archbishopric. However, at the request of Emperor Charles IV, pope Gregory XI refused to confirm his election and appointed Louis of Meissen instead. This led to an armed conflict, known as the Schism of Mainz. Battles were fought in Thuringia and the Eichsfeld. Louis was supported by the Emperor and his son Wenceslaus, by his three brothers and by Landgrave Henry II of Hesse. Adolph of Nassau was supported by Duke Otto I of Brunswick-Göttingen, Count John I of Nassau, Count Henry VI of Waldeck and Count Gottfried VIII of Ziegenhain. Neither side was strong enough to force a victory, and the conflict lasted until 1381. After Gregory XI died in 1378, the Western church was divided by two rival popes, a conflict known as the Western Schism. The Antipope Clement VII confirmed the election of Adolph as administrator of Mainz in 1379 and appointed Adolph as administrator of Speyer in 1380. When King Wenceslaus subsequently confirmed Adolph's appointment, Louis abdicated as Archbishop of Mainz, and was given the Archbishopric of Magdeburg as compensation. He travelled to Magdeburg. However, he died in February 1382 and was buried in the Cathedral of Magdeburg. == References == * * == External links == * The year 1374 at erfurt-web.de Category:14th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:14th-century German people Category:Prince-Bishops of Bamberg Category:Roman Catholic Prince-Bishops of Halberstadt Category:Archbishops of Magdeburg Category:Archbishop-Electors of Mainz Category:House of Wettin Category:1341 births Category:1382 deaths ","title":"Louis of Meissen"},{"id":"35195177","text":"The 2013–14 UEFA Champions League was the 59th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 22nd season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. The final was played between Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal, marking it the fifth final to feature two teams from the same association (after the finals of 2000, 2003, 2008, and 2013) and the first time in tournament history that both finalists were from the same city. Real Madrid, who eliminated the title holders, Bayern Munich, in the semi- finals, won in extra time, giving them a record-extending 10th title in the competition. Real equalized late in the second half through Sergio Ramos and then pulled away during extra time to win 4–1. For the first time, the clubs who qualified for the group stage also qualified for the newly formed 2013–14 UEFA Youth League, a competition available to players aged 19 or under. ==Association team allocation== A total of 76 teams from 52 of the 54 UEFA member associations participated in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein, which do not organise a domestic league, and Gibraltar, which started participating in the 2014–15 season after being admitted as a UEFA member in May 2013). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: *Associations 1–3 each have four teams qualify. *Associations 4–6 each have three teams qualify. *Associations 7–15 each have two teams qualify. *Associations 16–53 (except Liechtenstein) each have one team qualify. The winners of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League were given an additional entry as title holders if they would not qualify for the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league (because of the restriction that no association can have more than four teams playing in the Champions League, if the title holders are from the top three associations and finish outside the top four in their domestic league, the title holders' entry comes at the expense of the fourth-placed team of their association). However, this additional entry was not necessary for this season since the title holders qualified for the tournament through their domestic league.

UEFA decided to replace Metalist Kharkiv in the Champions League play-off round with PAOK, who were eliminated by Metalist Kharkiv in the third qualifying round. Red Bull Salzburg lodged a protest after being defeated by Fenerbahçe in the third qualifying round, but it was rejected by UEFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport. ==Group stage== The draw for the group stage was held in Monaco on 29 August 2013. The 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on their 2013 UEFA club coefficients, with the title holders, Bayern Munich, being placed in Pot 1 automatically. They were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. In each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The matchdays were 17–18 September, 1–2 October, 22–23 October, 5–6 November, 26–27 November, and 10–11 December 2013.

It has a wide distribution and is found in India, Sri Lanka, South-East Asia, South Africa, South America, southern Europe (Spain and Greece), Russia and Australia (the Northern Territory and Queensland). ==Description== The life cycle is completed in about 35–40 days. The length of the forewings is 16 mm. Adult has whitish wings with pale brown wavy markings. There are two black comma-shaped marks on each forewing. Male can be identified by narrow and uniform abdomen, whereas female abdomen is widest at the middle but tapering posteriorly. Female usually lay 150 eggs and first instar larvae emerge after a week. Final larva emerge after 20 days, and reaches its maximum length of 10-12mm. The moth has six larval instars. Due to branched tubular gills, caterpillars can respire in aquatic media. Therefore, instar can disperse through water. Pupation occurs when the pupal case is attached to the leaf sheath above the water level. After a week of pupation, adult emerges. ==Ecology== As its common name implies, rice caseworm is one of the major pests of rice throughout the world.Australian Insects Larvae is the infective stage, where they cut leaf tips to make leaf cases. The infestation can be characterized by ladder-like skeletonized tissues in leaves. Larvae completely consume the leaf blade, where only mid rib is visible. Surrounding weeds are the secondary hosts for the moth.plantwise.org ==Control== Eggs of rice caseworm can be controlled by using snails. Larvae can be controlled by using many natural predators like water beetles of the families Hydrophilidae and Dytiscidae. Pupal stages can be eradicate by the introduction of Pediobius and Apsilops species. Adult moths are daily meal for many spiders, insect eating bird species and dragonflies. Other than biological methods, many traditional methods such as reducing the water level of paddy fields, crop rotation, crop sanitation, pruning, light traps and hand picking are also effective. Chemicals such as DDT, BHC or Carbaryl can be used in required concentrations. ==References *Yield loss in rice caused by the caseworm Nymphula depunctalis Guenee (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). *Natural Enemies of the Rice Caseworm Nymphula Depunctalis (Guenée) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) *Research on Nymphula depunctalis *Yield loss in rice caused by the caseworm Nymphula depunctalis *Effect of Stocked Fish on Rice Leaffolder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis and Rice Caseworm Nymphula depunctalis Populations in Intensive Rice Culture Category:Moths described in 1852 Category:Acentropinae Category:Moths of Madagascar Category:Moths of Japan Category:Insects of Mozambique Category:Lepidoptera of West Africa Category:Insects of Malawi Category:Moths of Europe Category:Moths of Africa ","title":"Parapoynx stagnalis"},{"id":"35195262","text":"Stelios Tsoukanis (, born 27 February 1990) is a Greek professional footballer who plays as a left back for Triglia. ==Career== Tsoukanis started his career in youth teams of Anagennisi Epanomi, and in summer 2011, after a trial, he joined Aris after a recommendation of then-coach Sakis Tsiolis.

It was formed as an amalgamation of the former St Columba's High School and St Andrew's High School. St Peter the Apostle High School is one of two Roman Catholic secondary schools in West Dunbartonshire. St Peter the Apostle High School is a Roman Catholic comprehensive school serving the northern part of Clydebank, the village of Duntocher, Faifley, Hardgate and the Drumchapel area of Glasgow. Students come in substantial numbers from Old Kilpatrick, Knightswood and Scotstoun. Five primary schools provide the great majority of the first year intake including; St Mary's Primary School, St Joseph's Primary School, St Eunan's Primary School, St Stephen's Primary School, and St Clare's Primary School, although a variety of others add to this number. ==History== In 2009, West Dunbartonshire Council started a project with Bam construction to create new schools in the area. The previous Catholic secondary schools in Clydebank, St Columba's High School and St Andrew's High School were to be merged to form the new school, the campus for which was built on the sports grounds of St Columba's to allow the existing school to operate during construction of the new building. After the opening of St Peter the Apostle High School, the former St Columba's High School building was demolished, with the new St Eunan's Primary School built on this site. The cost to build the new school was £35m. The school was shown on the 2012 BBC show Kevin Bridges: What's the Story? in the episode \\"School\\", in which comedian Kevin Bridges (a former pupil of St Columba's High School) visited and performed a gig before an audience of students and teachers. Michael Vassie retired as head teacher of the school in 2013 after being in that position since St Peter the Apostle High was created, having been the head at St Andrew's since 1995.Fond farewell given to Clydebank teacher, Clydebank Post, 26 October 2013 Former Deputy Linda Booth succeeded him and is the current head teacher of the school. ==Head Teachers== * Mr. Michael Vassie: 2009-2013 * Mrs. Linda Booth: 2013–Present ==Deputy Head Teachers== Each year group, years 1-6, has a deputy head teacher assigned to it.

Friel ==Departments== St Peter the Apostle High School currently comprises eighteen distinct departments each offering a variety of curricular subjects. The school is notable as it is the only high school currently in West Dunbartonshire to feature a Drama Department. The school takes a different and unique approach to Inter Disciplinary Learning (IDL) as it is a time tabled mandatory subject for years 1-4, opposed to being experienced throughout the year at individual school events as it is done throughout other schools in West Dunbartonshire. * Maths * English * Physics * Chemistry * Biology * Modern Studies * History * Geography * Computing * Business Management * Home Economics * Design and Engineering * Art, Design and Photography * Drama * Music * Modern Languages * Religious Education (RE) * Physical Education (PE) ==References * Official website Category:Catholic secondary schools in West Dunbartonshire Category:Clydebank Category:2009 establishments in Scotland Category:Educational institutions established in 2009 ","title":"St Peter the Apostle High School"},{"id":"35195267","text":"Geoffrey James (born 1942 in St. Asaph, Wales) is a Canadian photographer, living in Toronto.

The title was later changed to Maasi and the film's launch was held on 1 April 2009 at a private club in the presence of the members of the cast and crew. The film's audio launch was held on 26 May 2010 with actor Karthi and Hansraj Saxena of Sun Pictures releasing the disk in a grand scale function. At a press conference, Kicha announced that two of his police films Bhavani: The Real Police and Maasi would see back to back releases in July 2010, though the deadline passed without further news. The film was set to release in late August 2011 alongside Arjun's other film Mankatha, but ran into a legal tussle with the makers of Idhudhanda Police — 2. The team of that film claimed they bought the remake rights of the Hindi film, Risk and based their Idhudhanda Police — 2 on it. They appealed that Maasi had copied almost 75 per cent of the scenes from the Hindi film that they were remaking and obtained an order in Hyderabad City Civil Court to stay the release of the film, and subsequently caused a delay. The film was further delayed in early 2012, when the director was arrested for failing to return an advance payment he had received from another producer, hence Tamil Kumaran sought a stay on the film. == Soundtrack == Soundtrack was composed by Dhina, with lyrics written by Yugabharathi.https://www.raaga.com/tamil/movie/Maasi-songs-T0002473 *\\"Kandene\\" - Hariharan, Sadhana Sargam *\\"Ondikondi\\" - Rita *\\"Unakkaga\\" - Udit Narayan, Sowmya Raoh *\\"Singanadai\\" - Ananthu *\\"Naan Paartha\\" - Shankar Mahadevan, Saindhavi *\\"Kandene\\" - Hariharan, Anbulakshmi ==Release== The film opened after three years of production in a few screens across Tamil Nadu on 16 March 2012 to negative reviews.

Before his graduation, he started collaborating with the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, where he led the laboratory of clinical epidemiology for a dozen years. He spent postgraduate research periods at the Harvard School of Public Health and at the RAND Corporation. He was an advocate of the evidence-based medicine movement and one of the founders of the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of researchers established in 1993, producing a collection of systematic reviews of the medical literature, published in the Cochrane Library. In 1994 he started the Italian Cochrane Centre as the sixth Centre in the Cochrane Collaboration, which currently lists 31 centres and branches, and was its director for eighteen years. In 1998 Liberati moved to academia, becoming associate professor of Medical Statistics at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. The following year he also became director of CeVEAS, a regional evidence-based centre located in Modena aimed at supporting clinicians' and health-care policymakers' decisions. In 2002 he started a Research and Innovation Program at the Emilia-Romagna Regional Health Care Agency, aimed at promoting patient-oriented clinical research bringing together clinicians, researchers, health care institutions, patients and the industry. Later in the same year Liberati was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. In 2003 he underwent two bone marrow transplants. He continued his work in patient-oriented research, as vice-president of Italy's National Committee for Health Research, and as a member of the Research and Development Committee of the Italian Drug Agency. In late 2011 his clinical condition worsened until his death on 1 January 2012. In a press release, the Italian Minister of Health Renato Balduzzi described Liberati as one of the most insightful Italian researchers and a prominent member of the international scientific community.\\"Ministro Balduzzi, cordoglio per il prof. Alessandro Liberati.\\" Ministero della Salute. Accessed 21 March 2012 ==Career and international reputation== Several obituaries describe Liberati's professional experience, highlighting the main features of his work and the ideas he supported.Network Cochrane Italiano. Il ricordo di Alessandro Liberati. Un innovatore delle politiche di ricerca clinica nel servizio pubblico. Sole 24 Ore Sanità, 10–16 gennaio 2012 He believed that within a health system, research should be an integral part of its mission, especially where lack of commercial interests prevents the possibility of private investment, and that researchers should concentrate on what is relevant to patients, not to their careers or to drug companies. Moreover, he strongly believed that developing alliances with consumers is necessary for setting research priorities, and that research results should be easily accessible to people who need to make decisions about their own health. In keeping with Iain Chalmers, one of the founders of the Cochrane Collaboration, Liberati was one of the pioneers of evidence synthesis, specifically, analyzing controlled trials of treatments for early breast cancer and assessing the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients in intensive care. Chalmers mentions that he was pleased that Liberati and his colleagues' centre created \\"the first challenge to 'anglophone imperialism' within the evolving Collaboration\\". Liberati was on the editorial board of two international medical journals, the British Medical Journal and Annals of Internal Medicine. He was a member of groups of international researchers developing standards to improve the quality of reporting of medical evidence (such as PRISMA) and to grade recommendations within clinical guidelines for medical decision-making (such as GRADE). He was an author of 187 scientific publications in international peer-reviewed medical journals. During 2003 and 2008, Liberati led with Zadig, a scientific publisher, specialized in EBM communication, a program to disseminate independent and unbiased information to all Italian doctors. He did so by translating Clinical Evidence, a compendium of the best available evidence on treating a wide range of common conditions, into Italian and distributing it freely, supported by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). By 2008, six Italian editions were published, freely available to all 248,000 doctors in practice in Italy at that time. Again in collaboration with Zadig, to speed up the diffusion of EBM, Liberati launched a free-access continuous medical education e-learning system, based on Clinical Evidence, called ECCE (the Italian acronym for Continuing Education Clinical Evidence). At the end of 2008 almost 130,000 health professionals were using ECCE, considered contents relevant and appropriate for educational purposes and expressed their intention to apply the acquired information into clinical practice. This is considered a successful example of knowledge translation, making research findings more accessible and clinically relevant to increase their usefulness for practitioners and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes. Liberati often used his own experience as a patient as evidence of the need for collaborative strategies in healthcare research, such as in an interview published by the World Health Organization. Available at http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/88/8/10-030810/en/index.html (retrieved 12 April 2012)) and in medical journal articles. In his last months, Liberati kept a blog where he discussed and exchanged comments about his disease, health care and other themes. == References == Category:Italian public health doctors Category:1954 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Deaths from multiple myeloma ","title":"Alessandro Liberati"},{"id":"35195331","text":"Manan Vohra (born 18 July 1993) is a cricketer from India.

In the mid-1970s, he was the leader of the conservative and pro- military Social Justice Party. Thawit was an ally of the military rulers Thanom Kittikachorn and Praphas Charusathien who were deposed during the democratic uprising of October 1973.

Kukrit Pramoj.Assembly XXXVI , The Cabinet, retrieved on 23 March 2012 During the government participation, Thawit developed a conflict with defence minister Pramarn Adireksarn of the Thai Nation Party, whom he attacked for manipulating the list of appointments of high-rank officers. Thawit, representing the interests of General Krit Srivara, alleged that Pramarn tried to dominate the armed forces, hinted that an irritated army could be tempted to revolt, and demanded Pramarn's dismissal. Thawit was dismissed after he criticised the prime minister outspokenly for dissolving the parliament and for the government's price guarantee on rice. Before the elections in April 1976, he was replaced as Social Justice Party chairman by Air Marshal Dawee Chullasap, but took the post of secretary-general. In this election, Thawit was elected to parliament, after he had failed in the 1975 election. After 1976, the Social Justice Party fell into insignificance.

The book is an expansion of the author's novella \\"The Onslaught from Rigel,\\" originally published in the magazine Wonder Stories Quarterly in the issue for Winter 1932. Pratt reused the name of the protagonist, Benjamin Franklin Ruby, in the form B. F. Ruby as an authorial pseudonym for later stories.Bleiler, Everett F. Science-Fiction: The Gernsback Years, Kent, Ohio, Kent State University Press, c1998, pp. 331, 332, 351. ==Plot== Ben Ruby and Murray Lee awaken one morning to discover themselves transformed into metal beings. In this, they are actually fortunate, most other inhabitants of the western hemisphere having become unliving statues. They and the few other survivors they meet at first assume the phenomenon to have been caused by a comet that had been approaching Earth, which is, in a way, true—but the comet was, in fact, a spacecraft of the Lassans, a race of elephantoid aliens from a planet of Rigel, who have utilized \\"life-force\\" (a sort of radiation) from the interior of the Earth to effect the change. The militaristic Lassans believe it their destiny to destroy or enslave all \\"lesser\\" beings and accordingly plan to capture those who have survived their initial strike. Accordingly, Ruby and his companions are soon besieged by \\"dodos\\", strange bird-like creatures who are thought- controlled by the Lassans and carry light-bombs. Ruby's group is relieved by a warship from Australia, whose inhabitants have been less affected by the Lassan radiation—in their case, it has merely turned the iron in their blood to cobalt, rendering them blue-skinned. In combination, the Australians and remaining Americans in turn besiege the stronghold of the invaders in New Jersey. But while their aircraft are effective against the dodo squadrons, the armored vehicles making up the Lassan ground forces, manned by giant apemen also under the Lassans' control, seem invulnerable. The focus shifts to Herbert Sherman and Marta Lami, two metalized captives of the Lassans. Via \\"thought helmets\\" the invaders extract information from them about their fellow earthlings to further the war of conquest. However, the mental transfer works both ways, and through it Sherman learns as much about the aliens as they do about Earth, notably that they have much less knowledge of explosives. Escaping with this knowledge, he reveals it to the besieging forces, who use it to defeat and destroy the Lassans. Ultimately, the explosion of the \\"life force\\" generator results in the restoration of all the metalized humans to their normal forms. ==Reception== Everett F. Bleiler, commenting on the original novella in Science-Fiction: The Gernsback Years, called the story \\"almost parodic in main outline,\\" noting that \\"[t]he first part is interesting, but the story soon degenerates into routine work,\\" and scoring it for \\"[s]ome story inconsistencies.\\"Bleiler, Everett F. Science-Fiction: The Gernsback Years, Kent, Ohio, Kent State University Press, c1998, p. 331. Rating the book two stars out of five, Floyd C. Gale in Galaxy Science Fiction wrote in 1961 \\"[e]ven when I first read the magazine version as a lad back in '31, the story seemed utterly improbable. On rereading, I have to revise my estimate utterward\\". He felt \\"the Rigellians behave with unbelievable stupidity and the metal humans with their built-in stiff upper lips are too flip and glib,\\" concluding that \\"Pratt's reputation rests secure on much better ground than this bog.\\" The book was also reviewed by P.

The Flemish government established the institute in 1999 together with the province of West Flanders and the Fund for Scientific Research. VLIZ promotes the accumulation of knowledge and excellence in research with regard to the ocean, seas, coasts and tidal estuaries. The central focus is on the provision of services to the research community, educators, the general public, policymakers and the industry. VLIZ promotes and supports Flemish marine research. Within this scope, VLIZ focuses on open, useful networking and the promotion of an integrated and cross-disciplinary approach. VLIZ serves as a national and international point of contact in the field of marine research. In this respect, it supports the image of Flemish marine research in the four corners of the globe and can hold mandates to represent this research landscape. The institute also supports and accommodates international organisations on behalf of the Flemish government: the IOC Project Office for IODE, the European Marine Board secretariat and the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) secretariat in Ostend, and the Joint Programming Initiative on Healthy and Productive Seas and Oceans (JPI Oceans) secretariat in Brussels. VLIZ also manages RV Simon Stevin a marine research vessel. Making the research vessel Simon Stevin, marine robots as well as other research equipment and infrastructure available is one of the services provided to marine scientists in Flanders. Within a European context, VLIZ offers technical and operational expertise for the use of this infrastructure. It stimulates and initiates research based on these innovative technologies. VLIZ also develops data systems, products, technologies and infrastructure. It collects new data by means of innovative techniques and valorises the increasing volume of marine data for the benefit of researchers, policymakers and the industry. In partnership with Flemish research groups, it develops permanent measurement networks at sea and presents itself to the world as a high-quality oceanographic data centre. The institute has developed and hosted the World Register of Marine Species and associated taxonomic subregisters, and hosts the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera, and the Sea Level Monitoring Facility of the Global Sea Level Observing System. In November 2011 VLIZ was officially recognized as a World Data Center by the Paris-based International Council for Science (ICSU). VLIZ manages an extensive collection of marine scientific literature in Flanders and makes it publicly available to the broadest possible target group via its library. The Open Marine Archive makes it possible to remotely consult tens of thousands of publications free of charge. In addition, VLIZ initiates and conducts innovative and multidisciplinary research in collaboration with and complementary to the Flemish and international marine research groups. By identifying needs and opportunities, it provides oxygen to the Flemish marine knowledge economy of the future. VLIZ develops policy-relevant products and services for the marine research community and policymakers as well as to support the blue economy. The ‘Compendium for Coast and Sea’ is a reliable guide listing who does what within this field in Flanders. VLIZ initiates, promotes and supports multidisciplinary research to fill knowledge gaps and provide a basis for marine policy. It does so in close cooperation with the Flemish marine research community. Finally, VLIZ reaches out to the public at large, the press, educators and coastal guides. The information desk offers knowledge presented in innovative formats and contributes to increasing ocean literacy by means of science popularisation, thus improving the image of the research conducted in Flanders and beyond. ==References== Category:Organizations established in 1999 Category:Research institutes in Belgium Category:Flanders Category:Oceanography Category:Ostend Category:1999 establishments in Belgium ","title":"Flanders Marine Institute"},{"id":"35195705","text":"Charles Spooner (died 1767) was an Irish mezzotint engraver, who worked in London towards the end of his life. ==Life== He was born in County Wexford, and became a pupil of John Brooks.

Glazer founded North American Systems with his business partner, Vincent Marotta Sr. and the two also co- developed Mr. Coffee, one of the first automatic drip coffee makers to be introduced to the American consumer market. Through their firm, Glazer and Marotta hired the engineers, Edmund Abel and Erwin Schulze of Westinghouse, whose research produced the first Mr. Coffee machines. Introduced in 1972, Mr. Coffee proved wildly popular with consumers and revolutionized the way Americans made and consumed coffee in their homes. By 1975, just three years after its introduction, Mr. Coffee was the top selling coffee maker in the United States. The industry trade publication Home Furnishings News listed Mr. Coffee as one of the most important household consumer products introduced in the previous seventy-five years in a list published in 2002. ==Early life== Glazer was born to a Jewish family,Cleveland Jewish News: \\"Samuel Glazer, Mr. Coffee co-owner, was 89\\" by sarah Reymend March 14, 2012 the son of Isador and Yetta Gross Glazer, on February 24, 1923, in Cleveland, Ohio as his family's fourth child. His father died when he was six years old. Glazer supported his family by selling boots and delivering newspapers. He delivered the newspapers for the Cleveland Plain Dealer from the age of 7 until he was 18 years old, when the paper offered him a position as a district manager. Glazer served in the United States Army, stationed in the U.S. during World War II. ==Career== Real estate development Following World War II, Glazer teamed with Vincent Marotta Sr., whom he had known since both were students at Shaker Heights High School, to embark on numerous business ventures spanning more than sixty years. Glazer and Marotta began by selling dog food in New York and Pennsylvania. They created a new company which initially sold garage doors, then expanded to real estate, constructing new shopping malls and homes nationwide, including the Great Lakes Mall in Mentor, Ohio. Mr. Coffee During the late 1960s, Glazer and Marotta purchased a coffee delivery company in the Cleveland metropolitan area. Included in the sale were the coffee company's trucks, which brewed coffee in giant, stainless steel coffee dispensers which were not portable. According to Glazer's son, customers would ask if there were household coffee makers available, giving Glazer and Marotta the idea for a new home drip brew coffee maker. Glazer and Marotta sold off much of their real estate holdings to finance research and development for their coffee making venture. Before Glazer and Marotta developed Mr. Coffee, there were only two main ways that consumers could make coffee at home: a coffee percolator or instant coffee. The partners hired away two engineers from Westinghouse, Edmund Abel and Erwin Schulze, to develop a consumer coffee maker that could fit in any kitchen. The engineers developed the Mr. Coffee machine, which used a heating element to drip brew coffee through grounds into a glass coffee pot. The machine was designed to not heat the water over , which lessened the chances of brewing bitter coffee. Glazer and Marotta's company, North American Systems, introduced Mr. Coffee in 1972. The company sold approximately one million coffee machines by 1975, making Mr. Coffee the top selling coffee maker in the country. By the late 1970s, Mr. Coffee had more than half the coffeemaker market share in the United States. The partners sold North American Systems to a securities firm in 1987 for $182 million. As of 2012, Mr. Coffee is a brand owned by the Sunbeam Corporation. Glazer developed a habit of sending Mr. Coffee coffeemakers to friends, who included notable figures in entertainment and business. Glazer developed a long friendship with comedian Johnny Carson. According to Glazer's wife, Jeanne, he sent so many coffeemakers to Carson that the late night television host told him, \\"Please, Sam, no more coffee machines!\\" ==Philanthropy== Glazer was a supporter of the Cedar Sinai Synagogue, Suburban Temple-Kol Ami, and the Jewish Federation of Cleveland. ==Personal life== Samuel Glazer died from leukemia at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 21, 2012, at the age of 89. A resident of Beachwood, Ohio, he was survived by his wife, Jeanne, and his son. Glazer wintered in Florida for twenty-five years, where he owned a home in Pelican Bay, an exclusive community developed by Westinghouse. Glazer's longtime business partner Vincent Marotta told the Cleveland Plain Dealer, \\"Sam Glazer and I were business partners for 60-some years and close friends longer than that...He was a true and faithful friend and a wonderful partner.\\" ==References== Category:1923 births Category:2012 deaths Category:American chief executives of food industry companies Category:American food company founders Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from Florida Category:Jewish American philanthropists Category:Businesspeople from Cleveland Category:People from Naples, Florida Category:People from Shaker Heights, Ohio Category:People from Beachwood, Ohio ","title":"Samuel Glazer"},{"id":"35195828","text":"USA Powerlifting (USAPL) is the national affiliate for the International Powerlifting Federation (IPF) in the United States.

Murray Lender served as the chief executive officer of Lender's, while his brother, Marvin, served as the company's president. Under Murray Lender, Lender's Bagels began selling frozen bagels to supermarkets in 1960, introducing many American consumers to the bagel for the first time. The Washington Post called Lender \\"the most important man in the modern history of bagels.\\" Murray Lender also became known to the public for appearing in a series of television commercials for Lender's Bagels. Murray Lender's father, Harry Lender, immigrated from Lublin, Poland, to the United States in 1927. That same year, Harry opened a small bagel bakery in New Haven, Connecticut, which catered to the city's Eastern European Jewish community. His wife, Rose Braiter Lender, and their two oldest children, Hyman and Sam, followed Harry Lender to the United States in 1929. Murray Lender was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on October 29, 1930. He graduated from Junior College of Commerce, which is now known as Quinnipiac University. Later, as chairman of Quinnipiac's Board of Trustees, he heard Quinnipiac President John L. Lahey give talks on the history of the Great Hunger in Ireland, and as a result donated funds to create the Ireland’s Great Hunger Museum at Quinnipiac. \\"A lot of Irish and Irish American artists and supporters helped to make this day possible, but without the support of a son of a Jewish immigrant from Poland who saw parallels in our experience we wouldn't be ...(able to).. dedicate this new facility. That's a proof of how important this story is to all immigrants,\\" Lahey said.\\"Cahir O'Doherty 'First ever Great Hunger museum opens next month in the US' Irish Central' 26 Sept 2012\\" http://www.irishcentral.com/news/first-ever-great-hunger-museum-opens- next-month-in-the-us-171316181-237753711.html All four brothers - Hyman, Sam, Harry and Marvin - entered the family's bagel business, called H. Lender's and Sons. Harry Lender died in 1958 and the brothers began freezing bagels for sale in 1960. Murray also came up with the idea of pre-slicing bagels. Murray Lender and his family sold Lender's Bagels to Kraft Foods in 1984. The brand was acquired by the Pinnacle Foods Group in 2003. Murray Lender died at a hospital in Miami, Florida, on March 21, 2012, at the age of 81. He had suffered injuries in a fall ten weeks earlier at his home in Aventura, Florida. He was survived by his children Carl Lender, Haris Lender and Jay Lender and 6 grandchildren. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:2012 deaths Category:American chief executives of food industry companies Category:Quinnipiac University alumni Category:Businesspeople from New Haven, Connecticut Category:People from Aventura, Florida Category:Accidental deaths in Florida Category:Accidental deaths from falls ","title":"Murray Lender"},{"id":"35195835","text":"Starlite Lotulelei Jr. ( ; born December 20, 1989) is a Tongan professional American football defensive tackle for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL).

He played college football at University of Utah, and shared the Morris Trophy for the best lineman in the Pac-12 Conference. ==High school and junior college career== A native of Tonga, Lotulelei attended Bingham High School in South Jordan, Utah. Playing defensive lineman at 240 pounds, he helped the football team to a 14–0 record and a state title in 2006.

In preseason mock drafts from May 2012, Lotulelei was listed as a late first-rounder for the 2013 NFL Draft as well. By mid-season, he had moved up to a top-3 spot. After the season concluded, Lotulelei was still projected to be picked among the first five selections. Utah had not seen one of their defensive linemen selected in the first round since Luther Elliss went 20th overall to the Detroit Lions in 1995. Lotulelei's rare combination of power, snap count anticipation, instincts, quickness, and athleticism frequently drew parallels to Haloti Ngata.http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1284270-a-star-is-born- breaking-down-elite-2013-nfl-draft-dt-star-lotulelei-from-utah Lotulelei was declared ineligible to participate in the 2013 NFL Scouting Combine after an echocardiogram revealed an abnormally low ejection fraction. While a normal heart will pump between 55 and 70 percent of the blood out of the left ventricle of the heart and into the body, Lotulelei's left ventricle was found to be pumping at only 44 percent. After further tests by cardiologists at the University of Utah, Lotulelei's condition found to be caused by a viral infection and eventually disappeared, showing \\"complete normalization of the heart muscle function.\\" Lotulelei has been cleared \\"to participate in professional athletics without restrictions.\\"Star Lotulelei cleared by doctor A month after the combine, Lotulelei worked out in front of NFL personnel at Utah's Pro Day. He reportedly \\"looked strong in all the position drills,\\" and registered 38 repetitions in the 225-pound bench press, which would have tied him with Margus Hunt and Brandon Williams for the top mark at the combine. But despite being medically cleared, Lotulelei's falsely assumed heart condition tarnished his draft prospects. Early April mock drafts projected him to fall out of the top-10. However, Lotulelei and Sharrif Floyd were \\"generally viewed as the top two [defensive tackles] in this class.\\" Only a week before the draft, Lotulelei moved up to the No. 4 spot, right behind Floyd, in Sports Illustrated's' mock draft.

The village is above sea level, from Gropparello and from Piacenza. ==History== For centuries, the feudal lords of the Nicelli family ruled much of the Val Nure. However, Montechino and its defensive fortress castle were controlled by the Confalonieri family, vassals of the Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti. Visconti had guaranteed the autonomy of the \\"Magnificent University of Val Nure\\", located near Montechino, in an effort to offset the power of the Nicelli. Further measures were implemented by the Duke in the form of tax relief, administrative autonomy and the power to appoint local judges. In 1492, the Confalonieri Family sold the castle of Montechino and its lands to Bartolino Nicelli, along with the title of Count and all attendant feudal rights. ==Economy== Montechino possessed natural gas and oil deposits that were used by local industry from 1866 to 1950. Peak production was reached in the early-20th century, when a pipeline was built to carry the oil to refineries in Fiorenzuola d'Arda. The oil-fields were among the targets attacked by fighters and fighter-bombers of the XXII Tactical Air Command on 7 April 1945 during the Spring 1945 offensive of the Liberation of Italy. Every year in mid-August, the \\"Feast of Mines & Oil Rigs\\" is held to commemorate the hamlet's history, with music, local food and produce, wine tasting, popular games, and an exhibit of art and historic photographs. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Stefano Pronti, Gropparello e la Val Vezzeno, TIP.LE.CO.

Born in South Bend, Indiana, Janet was one of six children born to Adam and Lucy (née Lawton) Wiley. She was called ״Pee Wee״, a nickname that she acquired at an early age while playing sandlot ball with her three brothers and the boys of her neighborhood.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League She grew up watching her hometown South Bend Blue Sox play at Playland Park. Then she had an inside track on the league when she became a bat girl for her home team in the 1945 season. Her duties varied from collecting the bats to keeping ice water ready for the players during games. She alternated with her fellow bat girl in working for the visiting teams as well.Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball – Leslie A. Heaphy, Mel Anthony May. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2006. Format: Softcover, 438pp. Language: English. Wiley also participated in summer training camps sponsored by the Blue Sox. The team developed these camps to encourage South Bend girls who wished to play baseball but had no opportunities at their schools. She had many chances to play first base and decided she would do that rather than pitch as she had originally planned. When she turned 16, she was invited to a tryout and made the Blue Sox roster, even though she was still in high school.Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball In 1950, Wiley was allocated to the Chicago Colleens rookie training team to acquire more experience and better professional quality.1950 Chicago Colleens She hit a .289 average for them before joining South Bend midway through the season.1950 South Bend Blue Sox Best known for her fielding skills, she shared duties at first base with Dorothy Mueller.

She also posted career numbers in games played (70), at-bats (181) and hits (40), while driving in 13 runs and scoring 11 times. With Karl Winsch at the helm, South Bend won both the pennant and the champion title for the first time in league history.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book Early in the 1952 season, Wiley suffered a knee injury that sidelined her for most of the year. She was used sparingly after recovering, until she had a clash with manager Winsch toward the end of the season when he disciplined her teammate Charlene Pryer for not going in to pinch-run quickly when asked. Winsch felt Wiley was insubordinate and suspended her for 30 days. Then Janet decided she would not go back to the team. I was so angry, I wouldn't play for him anyway, she explained. The league gave her an all-out release from her contract and she returned home to South Bend. A short time later, five other players walked out in protest, leaving Winsch's team short-handed for the rest of the season.SABR Biography Project – Elizabeth Mahon article by Jim Sargent Nevertheless, Wiley was signed by the Rockford Peaches before the 1953 season. She played in just 33 games because recurrent knee ailments.1953 Rockford Peaches Wiley left the league behind and married Donald L. Sears in 1955. The couple raised six children, three boys and three girls in the Michiana area centered on South Bend. She always thought that her experience in the league helped her as a mother. It helped me to encourage our girls to be whatever they wanted to be and the boys to respect them for it, she proudly explained. After her baseball days, Janet coached junior softball for ten years, attended AAGPBL Players Association reunions, and enjoyed woodworking and gardening. Besides this, she stayed in her hometown and watched over her nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Since 1988 she is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

This investment model is similar in principle to an Energy Performance Contract (EPC) but with the exception that no guarantees are made as to the level of energy savings. Instead under the EPI the financial value of the proven and verified energy savings from the invested solution are shared between the end beneficiary and the investor at a predefined ratio. The third party investment is not a loan or a lease. One of the key benefits of the EPI investment mechanism to the end beneficiary is that they only pay a proportion of the value achieved resulting in a reduction in their energy costs. Should no financial saving be achieved then the end beneficiary has nothing to pay i.e. they make no capital investment and will never be worse off. Typically the measurement of the financial savings achieved is performed by a party unrelated to all other parties involved in the arrangement in order to ensure independence.

Located in Deonar, an eastern suburb of the city, it is India's oldest and largest dumping ground, set up in 1927. The dumping ground is managed by the city's civic body, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (also known as Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai), which also manages two other dumping ground in the city; one in the neighbourhood of Mulund and one recently opened in Kanjurmarg. == Geography == The dumping ground extends over 132 hectares and receives 5,500 metric tonnes of waste, 600 metric tonnes of silt and 25 tonnes of bio-medical waste daily. Between March and June the daily amount of silt rises to more than 9,000 metric tonnes because of drain cleaning in advance of the monsoon season. The dump rises to around 114 ft. high. However, in February 2012, Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai sought permission from the Airport Authority of India (AAI) to increase this to around 164 ft. As of December 2014, the waste had reached the height of an 18-storeyed tower. There is another old dumping ground in Mulund in the north-eastern part of the city, where about 2,000 metric tonnes of garbage are dumped daily. In March 2015, a new dumping site was opened in the city by the city's civic body in Kanjurmarg which happens to be the first dumping site which is processed scientifically. == Health issues == NASA Image: Smoke from the fire which broke out on 28 Jan 2016 at the Deonar dumping ground, Mumbai The Deonar dumping ground has caused health issues for the residents from Mumbai's neighbourhood of Chembur, Govandi and Mankhurd. Recurrent fires at the dump have caused conditions unfit for habitation for residents of the adjacent area. In 2008, around 40 residents of Chembur went on a hunger strike to protest against the frequent fires and smoke. Again in 2012, Chembur residents complained to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai about the smoke coming out of the dumping ground, which has been affecting asthma patients. In 2015, neighbourhood surrounding to the dumping ground was identified as the city's most polluted area. Another fire broke out at the Deonar dumping ground in January 2016 causing the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to shut down 74 schools run by it for two days, as the smoke from the ground veiled the area causing breathing difficulties. Infant mortality has also been a concern in the nearby areas; as the rate stands at 60-80 per 1000 live births, which is double the average of 35.2 for the entire city. == Potential closure == In August 2008, it was reported that after receiving complaints from and pollution from the dump, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had decided to close down a section of the dumping ground and use it to generate 7 to 8 MW of power by methane extraction, adding to BMC’s revenue. A few months later, BMC granted a contract for the scientific partial closure of the dumping ground for . Partial closing was to take place in two phases, 65 hectares in the first phase, and in the second phase construction of a processing plant and sanitary landfill on the remaining 55 hectares. == References == Category:Environment of Maharashtra Category:Landfills in India Category:Waste management in India ","title":"Deonar dumping ground"},{"id":"35196392","text":"Chemical structure of NOSH-Aspirin, with highlighted aspirin (green), sulfide- releasing (yellow), and nitric oxide-releasing (blue) groups.

The Way of the Cross takes place on Good Friday and follows the passion of Christ through the heart of the city. Through choral music, Gospel passages, reflections, and silent procession, the hope is to enter more deeply into the events of Good Friday and their meaning today. It is an entreaty to experience the exceptional presence of Christ as a real answer to the needs of the heart.The Way of the Cross Downtown Chicago Website ==History== The Way of the Cross (Via Crucis or Via Dolorosa) is the act of devotion commemorating Christ’s Passion. For centuries this tradition has accompanied Christians during Lent and particularly on Good Friday. In 1970, Fr. Luigi Giussani, a teacher and the founder of Communion and Liberation, started proposing this gesture of the Christian faith to his college students, gathering them by the thousands in Caravaggio, a Sanctuary near Milan, Italy. Together with the traditional readings from the Gospel, Giussani introduced short passages from some of the greatest contemporary Catholic writers, like Claudel and Peguy. The choir accompanied the procession singing at every station to reawaken the awareness of the faithful with the beauty and sorrow which choral music can express. An ancient tradition was brought to new life. In 1996 a handful of friends belonging to the movement of Communion and Liberation asked for permission to walk the Way of the Cross on the Brooklyn Bridge. Permission was granted by the authorities and the gesture blessed by the then Bishop of Brooklyn, H.E. Thomas V. Daily. Accompanied by Fr. Ronald Marino less than thirty people followed the Cross along the Brooklyn Bridge pathway on a cloudy and rainy day on Good Friday 1996. Year after year the Way of the Cross over the Brooklyn Bridge started growing. Thirty people became a hundred, two, three, four hundred, a thousand until, on Good Friday 2002, almost three thousand New Yorkers followed the Cross all the way to Ground Zero.

From 1965 through 1980 she taught at Occidental College in the Dept. of English and Comparative Literature. With her colleague, William Moritz, Kinder introduced film studies into their curriculum. In 1980 she joined USC as a Professor of Critical Studies in the School of Cinematic Arts where she taught until 2012; Kinder's specialties included Spanish cinema, narrative theory, children's media culture, database documentaries, and digital culture. ==Published works== Kinder has published more than one hundred essays and ten books (including monographs and anthologies). Her first essay, titled, \\"Antonioni in Transit,\\" on the 1966 film Blow-up and its relationship to Michelangelo Antonioni's earlier films made in Italy, was published in the British film journal Sight & Sound in 1967. Kinder first two books, Close Up: A Critical Perspective on Film (1972) and Self and Cinema: A Transformalist Perspective (1980), were written in collaboration with Beverle Houston. She is best known for her works on Spanish cinema and culture, which include Blood Cinema: The Reconstruction of National Identity in Spain (1993), with a companion CD (the first interactive scholarly work in English language film studies), Refiguring Spain: Cinema, Media, Representation (1997), and Luis Buñuel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1998). Kinder's works on children's media culture include Playing with Power in Movies, Television and Video Games: From Muppet Babies to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1991), and Kids' Media Culture (1999). Kinder was founding editor of the journal Dreamworks (1980–87), a winner of a Pushcart Prize, and a contributor to The Spectator (1982–present). Since 1977, she has served on the editorial board of Film Quarterly. In 1995 Kinder received the USC Associates Award for Creativity in Scholarship, and in 2001 was named a University Professor for her innovative interdisciplinary research. ==Labyrinth projects== In 1997, Kinder founded The Labyrinth Project at USC, a research initiative on database narrative (a concept she introduced). At Labyrinth she produced database documentaries, archival cultural histories and other new models of digital scholarship in collaboration with media artists, filmmakers, writers, scholars, scientists, archivists, and cultural institutions. Combining cultural history and theory with the sensory language of the cinematic arts, these database documentaries are presented as transmedia networks (museum installations, DVD, digital archives, on-line courseware, print catalogues, books). One of Kinder's first projects was with filmmaker Nina Menkes, entitled THE CRAZY BLOODY FEMALE CENTER. Menkes was allegedly unhappy that Kinder took liberties with her work, for example, adding shots to her work without her permission. Menkes' CD-ROM premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Many Labyrinth projects have been featured at museums, film and new media festivals, and conferences worldwide and have won prestigious awards, including: the New Media Invision Award for best design; the British Academy Award for best interactive project in the learning category; and, the Jury Award at Sundance for New Narrative Forms. Three Labyrinth projects were featured in Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe's \\"Future Cinema\\" exhibition in Germany in 2002: Tracing the Decay of Fiction: Encounters with a Film by Pat O’Neill (2002); Bleeding Through Layers of Los Angeles, 1920 – 1986 (2002); and, The Danube Exodus: The Rippling Currents of the River (2002). The latter work was an installation made in collaboration with Hungarian artist Péter Forgács, which premiered at the Los Angeles Getty Center in 2002 and is still touring worldwide. Others projects have focused on science and health education: Three Winters in the Sun: Einstein in California (2005), which was exhibited at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, and A Tale of Two MAO Genes: Exploring the Biology and Culture of Aggression and Anxiety, a project produced in collaboration with noted molecular biologist Professor Jean Chen Shih. Labyrinth's most recent work is Jewish Homegrown History: Immigration, Identity and Intermarriage, which is a presented both as an on- line archive where users can upload stories and images of their family and a museum installation featuring large-scale projections of home movies. This installation had its premiere run at the Skirball Cultural Center (March 29 – September 2, 2012). Kinder is also a co-investigator with Mark Jonathan Harris on Interacting with Autism, a translational health-education website. These Labyrinth projects have been supported by grants from the Annenberg Foundation, the Alan Casden Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Getty Foundation, the Haas Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Righteous Persons Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Skirball Foundation; and from AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). ==References== Category:Living people Category:1940 births Category:University of Southern California faculty ","title":"Marsha Kinder"},{"id":"35196669","text":"Andrew Clark (born April 8, 1988) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player currently under contract with SC Langenthal of the Swiss League (SL). ==Playing career == He played for Acadia University in the Atlantic conference of Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS).

The building is part of the American Fork Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==Construction== Plans for the tabernacle began soon after the formation of the Alpine Stake and drawings were made by the architectural design firm Liljenberg & Maeser. Construction on the foundation began in 1909 and the cornerstone was dedicated in 1910 by Orson F. Whitney. The structure was completed in 1914 at a cost of $80,000 and dedicated the following year in 1915 by LDS Church President Joseph F. Smith. The exterior is built with stone, red sandstone and yellow brick and does not feature a tower or steeple. The interior seats about 2,000 and retains much original decoration. Like many LDS tabernacles, it houses a grand pipe organ. It also was built with a baptismal font. The tabernacle was extensively remodeled at a cost of $230,000 in 1962 and rededicated by Henry D. Moyle. It was remodeled again in 1982. In 1994, the tabernacle was closed for a period of time while renovations were undertaken, including an extensive asbestos abatement. The tabernacle was reopened in 1995 and continues to function as a tabernacle and hold various civic meetings. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Utah County, Utah ==References== * * * ==External links== Category:Churches completed in 1914 Category:20th-century Latter Day Saint church buildings Category:Religious buildings and structures in Utah County, Utah Category:Tabernacles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah Category:Buildings and structures in American Fork, Utah Category:Historic district contributing properties in Utah Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Utah ","title":"Alpine Stake Tabernacle"},{"id":"35196680","text":"Countess Palatine Irmengard of the Rhine, also known as Irmengard of Baden ( - 24 February 1260) was Margravine of Baden by her marriage to Herman V, Margrave of Baden-Baden. She brought the city of Pforzheim into the marriage. She was the daughter of Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine, who was also duke of Brunswick, and his wife Agnes of Hohenstaufen. Her paternal grandfather was Henry the Lion. She and her husband are known as patrons of the monasteries in Maulbronn, Tennenbach, Herrenalb, Selz, Salem and Backnang Abbey. In 1245, Irmengard founded Lichtenthal Abbey in Lichtental (now part of Baden-Baden, where later the Margraves of Baden would be buried. However, the construction of this abbey exceeded her financial resources and she had to request assistance from her sons. In March 1245, she was given several manors and rights. In this case, the brothers gave away more than they owned, because they had earlier enfeoffed Louis of Liebenzell with two parts of the tithes. This led to a lengthy dispute. ==Marriage and issue== Around 1217, Irmengard married Herman V, Margrave of Baden-Baden. They had the following children: *Herman VI (1225 - 4 October 1250), Margrave of Baden *Rudolf I (1230 - 19 November 1288), Margrave of Baden *Mechtild (died 1258) married on April 4, 1251 to Ulrich I, Count of Württemberg ( - 25 February 1265) *Elisabeth, who married firstly Count Eberhard of Eberstein, and secondly Louis II of Lichtenberg In 1248, Irmengard transferred her husband's body from Backnang Abbey to Lichtenthal Abbey. ==External links== *Entry at genealogie- mittelalter.de Category:House of Welf Category:Margravines of Baden Category:German countesses Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1200s births Category:1260 deaths Category:13th-century German people Category:13th- century German women ","title":"Countess Palatine Irmengard of the Rhine"},{"id":"35196681","text":"Onotokiba is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species: * Onotokiba guineensis Basilewsky, 1951 * Onotokiba katangana Basilewsky, 1953 * Onotokiba lomaensis Lecordier, 1966 * Onotokiba orbithorax Alluaud, 1927 * Onotokiba ruandana Basilewsky, 1956 * Onotokiba uluguruana Basilewsky, 1962 ==References== Category:Platyninae ","title":"Onotokiba"},{"id":"35196690","text":"Wolfram Klein (born 8 September 1968 in Nettetal-Breyell) is a former German footballer.

Keating served as United States Ambassador to Madagascar and Comoros from 1983 to 1986. Keating was born in Medford, Massachusetts to parents who emigrated to the United States from Ireland. Keating graduated from the United States Naval Academy of Annapolis in 1947, a year earlier than expected due to an accelerated degree. He served in the United States Navy during the Korean War, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. Keating later received his master's degree from George Washington University in 1961 (engineering administration).Biographical sketch Keating worked as a consultant for international development after completing his master's degree. He ran a technical cooperation program in Chile from 1964 to 1967. He also spearheaded the construction of roads in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) during the early 1970s. Keating was appointed as a delegate to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea during the 1980s, though the United States did not become a signatory to the treaty. Soon after, U.S. President Ronald Reagan nominated Keating as Ambassador to Madagascar and the Comoros. His nomination came with some controversy surrounding communications between Keating and several mining companies while he was a delegate to the Law of the Sea convention. However, Keating was confirmed by the U.S. Senate and served as ambassador accredited to both island nations from 1983 to 1986. Keating served as the U.S. executive director of the World Bank from 1986 to 1989. He later became the representative of the United States on the board of directors of the World Bank Group, retiring in 2008 to continue consultancy work. Robert Keating died in Washington, D.C. of pneumonia on March 4, 2012, at the age of 87. He was survived by his daughter, Anne B. Keating, while his wife, Virginia Wellborn Keating, whom he married in 1959, died in 2006. A longtime Washington resident, he had resided in the Residences at Thomas Circle. ==Notes== Category:1924 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Madagascar Category:Ambassadors of the United States to the Comoros Category:United States Naval Academy alumni Category:George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science alumni Category:American people of Irish descent Category:People from Washington, D.C.

Larson. The core of Knight Rider is its four television series: Knight Rider (1982–1986), Code of Vengeance (1985–1986), Team Knight Rider (1997–1998), and Knight Rider (2008–2009). The franchise also includes three television films, computer and video games, and novels, as well as KnightCon, a Knight Rider convention. Beginning with the original television series and continuing with the subsequent films and series, the franchise has developed a cult following and spawned many pop culture references. The original Knight Rider series followed the adventures of Michael Knight, a modern-day crime fighter who uses a technologically advanced, artificially intelligent automobile. This car, named KITT, is virtually indestructible, due to a high-tech coating applied to it. Knight Rider stories usually depict either average citizens, or ethical heads of corporations, being bullied into subservience to an overbearing or ruthless criminal organization. The protagonist(s) of each particular series is instructed by the Foundation for Law and Government (FLAG) to assist in some manner. The protagonist(s) has the assistance of a high-tech, self-aware, and nearly indestructible vehicle. ==Overview== The series debuted in 1982 and ran for four seasons on NBC. These adventures were continued with the television films Knight Rider 2000 and Knight Rider 2010 and the short-lived Team Knight Rider. One other television movie, Knight Rider, served as a pilot for the 2008 television series Knight Rider. In 1985, a spin-off series, Code of Vengeance, also premiered. {   width=99% ! rowspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"16%\\"  Characters ! colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\"  Television series ! colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\"  Television Films - ! align=\\"center\\" width=\\"14%\\"  Knight Rider ! align=\\"center\\" width=\\"14%\\"  Team Knight Rider ! align=\\"center\\" width=\\"14%\\"  Knight Rider ! align=\\"center\\" width=\\"14%\\"  Knight Rider 2000 ! align=\\"center\\" width=\\"14%\\"  Knight Rider 2010 ! align=\\"center\\" width=\\"14%\\"  Knight Rider - !Year of Release !colspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" 1982–1986 !colspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" 1997–1998 !colspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" 2008–2009 !colspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" 1991 !colspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" 1994 !colspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" 2008 - !

There also was a spin-off series, Code of Vengeance, that ran for one season (1985–1986). In total, 133 Knight Rider episodes have been produced across the seven seasons of the four various TV series. Knight Rider (1982–1986) The original Knight Rider series saw Michael Knight (David Hasselhoff), a crime fighter who uses a high tech, artificially intelligent automobile, the Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT).

Larson, and was originally broadcast on NBC from 1982 to 1986. The show has 90 episodes over four seasons, was highly popular with audiences.

The Dalton character was retooled for the planned spin-off series, whose pilot, Code of Vengeance, was a surprise ratings success in June 1985. A subsequent series, to be called Dalton, was ordered by NBC for midseason, then production was cancelled after just four episodes were completed.

Goodman, and was distributed by Universal Domestic Television. It ran for a single season of 22 one-hour episodes before it was canceled due to poor ratings.

Knight Rider: The Game (2002) Knight Rider: The Game is a video game based on the original television series of the same name. It was developed by Davilex Games and distributed by Tri Synergy, and was released on November 22, 2002. The game allows the player to take control of KITT – the Knight Industries Two Thousand, in a range of missions including, racing, exploring, chasing and others. The player also meets famous villains from the original series, including KARR and Garthe Knight. Knight Rider: The Game 2 (2004)  Knight Rider: The Game 2 is a video game sequel to Knight Rider: The Game, which was again developed by Davilex Games and was published by Koch Media on November 5, 2004, for PC and PlayStation 2. ==Merchandise== The Knight Rider franchise has a number of novels, video games, and other materials that cover many aspects of the various series and films. Various toy versions of KITT were released and produced solid profits. The more notable of the Knight Rider memorabilia includes the remote controlled KITT, the Knight Rider lunch box, and the deluxe version of KITT. This final model, sold by Kenner Toys and dubbed the \\"Knight Rider Voice Car\\", spoke electronically, using a recording of the voice of William Daniels, featured a detailed interior and a Michael Knight action figure as well. In the 1980s there was a Knight Rider toy vehicle for Germany's Darda system. Also in the 80s a Key Car of KITT was released. But it had no scanner and the windows were black with \\"Knight 2000\\" written in red letter on the doors. It included a key which was pushed into a hole below KITTs spoiler compressing a spring; then snaps into place. Squeezing the key releases it and the spring shoos the car forward. As with many popular series of the era (including The Dukes of Hazzard, The A-Team etc.), ERTL released die-cast toys of KITT in three different sizes – the common miniature model, a \\"medium\\" model, and a large model. These toys featured red reflective holograms on the nose to represent the scanner (however, they were located on the point of the nose, rather like the early mock-up of KITT seen in the pilot episode) as opposed to altering the basic model design to incorporate the scanner as commonly seen in the series. The toys also included round steering wheels as opposed to KITT's steering yoke. Also in late 2004, 1/18 scale die- cast models of KITT and KARR were produced from ERTL, complete with detailed interior and illuminated moving scanner, just like in the series. In September 2006, Hitari, a UK-based company that produces remote control toy cars, released the Knight Rider KITT remote control car in 1/15 scale, complete with the working red scanner lights, KITT's voice from the television show and the car's turbine engine sound with the \\"whoosh whoosh\\" scanner sound effect. In December 2012, Diamond Select Toys released a talking electronic 1/15 scale KITT that features an illuminated dashboard, scanner, fog lights and tail lights, along with the original voice of KITT, William Daniels, all at a push of a button. An Entertainment Earth exclusive version of that Diamond Select Toys 1/15 KITT, exclusive, as it will include an in scale figure of Michael Knight to go with the car, was released in February 2013 and was available exclusively at Entertainment Earth's Web site. Diamond Select Toys will also was to be releasing an 8-inch figure of Michael Knight with the likeness of David Hasselhoff, which was to be released in March 2013. In February 2013, Hot Wheels released a 1/18 die-cast of KITT as part of their die-cast Elite series of vehicles under their Cult Classics Collection. This one from Hot Wheels was an improvement over the one ERTL released back in 2004. With sharper attention to details on the dashboard, the model features an improved light up red scanner, opening doors and rear hatch, as well as an engine hood which opens up to reveal a detailed Knight 2000 turbine engine which is exclusive to the model and was never shown in the TV series. Additional features include pop up headlights, revolving license plates, ejector seats, removable t-tops and a foldable rear seat. A \\"Fun Pack\\" based on Knight Rider for the toys-to-life video game Lego Dimensions was released in February 2017. The pack includes a Michael Knight minifigure and constructible KITT, and unlocks additional Knight Rider-themed content in the game. In 2016, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfares \\"Zombies\\" mode features David Hasselhoff reprising his role as Michael Knight, appearing as the games map \\"Zombies in Spaceland\\"'s DJ. The Knight Rider theme plays in game and many references to the series and KITT are made. ==Film adaptation== In March 2002, Revolution Studios announced a partnership with Mayhem Pictures to create a film adaptation of the television series. The film would be re-designed to be similar to Revolution's previous project, XXX. Series creator Glen A. Larson was hired to write the first script draft, with the series' lead actor David Hasselhoff attached as an advisor and also have an onscreen role. In April 2003, Revolution Studios hired screenwriters David Elliott and Paul Lovett to pen the film's script. In April 2004, the premise of the film was described as having Hasselhoff reprise his role as Michael Knight, now the mentor to the protagonist as Devon Miles mentored Knight in the television series. The protagonist would be Knight's son, inheriting his father's role and driving the vehicle KITT. The producers' choice for the role was actor Ben Affleck. In May 2006, The Weinstein Company acquired film rights to adapt Knight Rider from series creator Larson. He expressed his interest in the film adaptation as a potential franchise property. The following September, Hasselhoff invited actor Orlando Bloom to portray Knight's son in the film adaptation, but Bloom turned down the offer. In April 2007, Hasselhoff said, that the film was in development at Miramax, and that he would at least have a cameo in the film. On June 26, 2013, Brad Copeland was writing a script for a Knight Rider film after beating out Travis Beacham, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. On February 13, 2014, Schmoes Know reports that actors Chris Pratt and Danny McBride are in talks for roles and may use a sort of action-comedy hybrid in the same vein as 21 Jump Street. In December 2015, a media report indicated that a new web series named Knight Rider Heroes was in the works and will include David Hasselhoff. This concept was never completed or released. The project is believed to be abandoned.\\"Knight Rider Heroes\\" . netzpropaganda.de. Retrieved May 26, 2016.

It is an alternative to surgical bone conduction prosthetic devices, which require surgical implantation into the skull to conduct sound. SoundBite uses the tooth instead of the implanted component and eliminates the need for surgery. It is therefore typically lower in complications and in cost than the prevalent surgical treatments. SoundBite Hearing System has two principal components: a behind-the-ear (BTE) microphone unit that is worn on the impaired ear and a removable, custom-made in-the- mouth (ITM) device worn on the upper, left or right back teeth. Both components have rechargeable batteries and a charger is included with the system. The BTE microphone captures and processes sound, and wirelessly transmits the sound signals to the ITM device. The ITM receives these signals and converts them into sound vibrations. These subtle sound vibrations travel via the teeth, through bones in the skull, to the functioning inner ear or cochlea, bypassing problems in the outer or middle ear entirely. Although the vibrations are strong enough to be picked up by the cochlea, they are so subtle as to not be felt by the wearer. In the United States, the device has FDA clearance to treat patients with single-sided deafness (SSD) or conductive hearing loss (CHL). SoundBite also has CE mark approval for SSD, CHL, and mixed hearing loss (MHL). SoundBite was developed and marketed by Sonitus Medical, Inc. The company filed for bankruptcy on Thursday, January 15, 2015, as a result of the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' decision not to cover the device.http://www.mddionline.com/blog/devicetalk/cms-coverage- decision-killed-my-80m-venture-backed-startup-04-02-15 ==History== Single- sided deafness (SSD) and conductive hearing loss (CHL) are life-altering conditions where patients often have anxiety, depression, social isolation, and reduced quality of life. SSD patients have one cochlea that is virtually non-functional. It does not hear sound even when using conventional hearing aids, which are amplification devices that simply “turn up the volume” on air- conducted sound. CHL patients have a problem with the ear (outer, middle or canal) that prohibits air conducted sound from reaching an otherwise functional cochlea. Conventional hearing aids which amplify sound can cause distortion for these patients. Therefore, the traditional treatment approach has been a prosthetic device called Baha, which replaces the function of the impaired ear by using a well-established principle called bone conduction to re-route sound through the skull bones to the functional cochlea. The Baha bone conduction prosthetic devices are used rather than hearing aids because conventional hearing aids are clinically inappropriate for these patients. The Baha surgery can cause complications that range from skin reaction to infection, to abscess, to complete re-implantation or revision of the Baha post. In the United States, the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual distinguishes between hearing aids and prosthetic devices, and indicates that certain devices (including Baha) are payable by Medicare as prosthetic devices when hearing aids are medically inappropriate. The principle of bone conduction has been used for many years to treat patients with single-sided deafness and conductive hearing loss. The principle is based on decades of research showing that bone conduction stimulation of the teeth initiates auditory sensations. Evidence shows that teeth vibrations lead to audio-frequency vibration transmissions via soft tissue. Those transmissions then travel through skull foramina into the skull cavity. From there, they channel into the inner ear fluids, stimulating the cochlea. Subsequently, Sonitus Medical developed SoundBite Hearing System to use those principles in a non-surgical, removable hearing system. ==Clinical trials== A multi-center clinical trial conducted in 2011 validated that SoundBite is safe and effective and provides substantial benefit for individuals with single-sided deafness (SSD). Trial participants wore SoundBite for 30 days, using the device an average of 8.2 hours per day. Based on the clinical trial results, SoundBite improves the ability of individuals with SSD to understand speech in an environment with background noise by an average of 25%. One-third of the trial participants found that the system improved their hearing ability by more than 30%. The results of this extensive clinical trial showed SoundBite to be as effective as surgically implanted bone conduction systems in improving the ability to understand speech in an environment with background noise. In 2013, another multi-center clinical study confirmed previous findings that SoundBite is safe, effective, and provides significant benefit for patients. Study participants wore SoundBite for 6 month. Benefit was determined through a standard audiological questionnaire called the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB), and a patient survey. Results from the APHAB questionnaire showed patients had significant improvement in Ease of Communication, Reverberation, Background Noise, and Global Benefit. Additionally, the patient survey showed strong satisfaction with the device: 100% would recommend SoundBite to a friend or family member with similar hearing loss. ==Description== Sound vibrations travel through a medium, and sound is heard when sound waves travel through the medium of air or bones/teeth to arrive at the inner ears. The SoundBite Hearing System uses sound waves travelling through bone, known as bone conduction to transmit subtle vibrations through bones to the inner ears. The SoundBite Hearing System is a non-surgical and removable bone conduction hearing prosthetic device that re-routes sound through the teeth and skull bone directly to the functioning inner ear or cochlea. By-passing problems in the outer and middle ears entirely. For patients suffering from single-sided deafness, SoundBite re-routes sound from the deaf side, to the functioning cochlea, by-passing the non-hearing side. SoundBite uses the same mechanism of action as Baha devices (bone conduction), however it places a transducer on the tooth --a “naturally osseointegrated” post -- and thereby eliminates the need for a surgical implant. SoundBite relies on two primary components to deliver sound: * The behind-the-ear (BTE) microphone unit is worn on the patient’s deaf ear. Using the natural acoustic benefits of the outer ear, sound is collected and channeled into the ear canal. A tiny microphone is placed within the canal of the impaired ear and is connected by a small tube to the BTE. The BTE uses a digital signal processor to process the sound and a wireless chip to transmit the sound signals to the in-the-mouth (ITM) device. * The ITM device is customized for each patient to fit around the upper, left or right, back teeth. The ITM picks up the signals from the BTE and converts them into subtle vibrations that travel via the teeth, through bone, and to the cochlea. Once these sound vibrations reach the inner ear, they are converted into auditory signals which are sent to the brain and are interpreted as sound. The BTE unit has a 12-to-15-hour operational life when fully charged. Each ITM hearing device has a 6-to-8 hour operational life when fully charged. The SoundBite Hearing System includes 1 BTE, 2 ITMs, and a system charger. The BTE unit delivers a broader frequency bandwidth (up to 18,000 Hz) as compared to existing devices for single-sided deafness. This broader bandwidth enhances spatial hearing ability, which is a key limitation for SSD patients. == Treatment process == The patient is evaluated by an audiologist to determine degree of hearing loss to determine if the patient is a candidate for SoundBite. A dentist then performs a dental screening and takes a partial impression of the patient's teeth, which is used to create a customized SoundBite ITM device. The ITM and BTE are fitted and adjusted, and the system is programmed by a hearing professional.  Candidates and indications  In the United States, SoundBite is appropriate for patients who are 18 years or older, with good oral health, with: * Single-sided deafness, defined as moderately severe, severe, or profound sensorineural hearing loss in one ear (problems with the inner ear), with normal hearing in the other ear * Conductive hearing loss (problems with the outer or middle ear) In Europe and Canada, SoundBite is appropriate for patients who are 18 years or older, with good oral health, with: * Single-sided deafness, defined as moderately severe, severe, or profound sensorineural hearing loss in one ear (problems with the inner ear), with normal hearing in the other ear * Conductive hearing loss (problems with the outer or middle ear) * Mixed hearing loss (problems with the inner and outer or middle ear) == Manufacturer == The SoundBite Hearing System was manufactured by Sonitus Medical Inc., a privately held medical device company based in San Mateo, California founded in June 2006. In addition to receiving FDA clearance for SoundBite, Sonitus Medical has received CE Mark certification. The company filed for bankruptcy in January 2015 leaving users with no service and many who paid for these expensive devices never received them. Other companies have looked into buying them out but to date nobody has. ==References== Category:Assistive technology Category:Otology Category:Hearing ","title":"SoundBite Hearing System"},{"id":"35196801","text":"Hajib (, also Romanized as Ḩajīb and Hejīb; also known as Jīb) is a village in Zahray-ye Pain Rural District, in the Central District of Buin Zahra County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

It was based primarily on the 1978 concept album Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds, but also draws from the original 1898 War of the Worlds novel by H. G. Wells. The game was developed by Pixelogic and released in Europe exclusively for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. The game was never released in North America. The game's visuals are based heavily on the album's artwork, which was created by Mike Trim, Geoff Taylor and Peter Goodfellow. Though it reuses audio and graphical elements of Rage Software's PC game of the same title, and is set during the same time period, it is not a port, remake or re-release of that game, but an entirely different adaptation of the same source material. ==Gameplay== Martian units. The game is played from a third-person perspective. The player must navigate three- dimensional environments while controlling various World War I-style military vehicles, such as armoured cars, mobile anti-aircraft platforms, tanks, cannons, motorbikes, and observation balloons. Each vehicle has its own unique mounted weapon (with the exception of the oil tanker, which can only self- destruct). These must be used to combat the Martian invaders, who pilot the fighting-machines, handling-machines, flying-machines and embankment-machines of the novel, in addition to various other advanced vehicles, many of which were created specifically for the PlayStation and PC games. The black smoke and red weed also appear as obstacles within the game. At any moment, the player can bring up the sidebar – a rudimentary map of the level, showing all human and Martian units currently in the area. From here the player can instantly switch to any human vehicle or turret currently in their control. The game features fourteen pre-set levels, with varied missions such as destroying a Martian base, stealing a Martian flying-machine, and managing the evacuation of a human village. Some levels are more focused on strategy than direct combat; the player is often required to transport civilians, engineers, or soldiers from place to place, escort armoured lorries, and collect scrap material to be used in the creation of new vehicles. The game is not compatible with the PlayStation memory card. In order to save their progress, the player must note the password given at the end of each level (excluding the final one). ==Synopsis== Setting The game takes place in 1890s Britain, and is faithful to the alternate-history setting of the source material. Throughout the game, the player gets the opportunity to explore numerous urban and rural locations, including London, Dover, Oxford, Glasgow, and the Scottish Highlands. The vehicles used by the human forces are generally appropriate to the setting, while the Martian war machines and installations are more fanciful and baroque, showing a steampunk influence. Plot The game features the same opening and closing cut-scenes as the PC game's human campaign. In the opening sequence, a group of military officials are taking part in an emergency conference. The previous morning, a bizarre craft had landed in Horsell Common near Woking. This cylinder contained the advance of an invading army; its occupants began to attack civilians and soldiers indiscriminately. The officials then listen to the testimony of a journalist who witnessed the attack. (The journalist's dialogue is an edited version of the narration Richard Burton recorded for the album between 1976 and 1977.) It quickly becomes apparent that the invaders are aliens from the planet Mars. The advance attack at Horsell Common was suppressed, and the four Martian war machines were defeated by human artillery, enabling the journalist to escape and give his testimony. The officials learn that several other Martian missiles are heading towards Britain, and prepare a military retaliation with the aid of their chief scientists and engineers, and the knowledge that, if Britain should fall, the rest of the world is sure to follow. In the game's first level, the player is given military training, and learns how to control vehicles and fire turrets and vehicular weaponry. At the end of the level, the next Martian cylinder arrives, and the invasion begins wholesale. Throughout the game, the player must take control of various vehicles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and use them strategically to fight their way through Martian settlements, free humans from Martian farms, protect human cities and villages, and carry out various other missions in aid of the resistance. The game's story resolution differs from that of the book and album in that the Martians do not succumb to the common cold virus. Instead they must be fought off with the use of military force and human ingenuity and cunning. Eventually the player reaches the Scottish Highlands, where the Martians have made their main base. (In the novel and album, the Martian base was instead located in London.) Once the player destroys the seven Martian Elders who are directing the invasion, the war ends, and peace is restored. The player's soldier character (now seen for the first time) escapes the destruction of the Martian base, and the journalist narrator wonders if the Martians might strike again some day. The album's NASA epilogue is omitted, leaving the game's conclusion closer to the open-ended ambiguity of the original novel. ==Soundtrack== The game features an instrumental techno/electronica soundtrack, consisting of seven remixes of music from Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds. These remixes were arranged, engineered, programmed and mixed by the musical group Max Mondo, along with Stephen Murphy, and were first heard in the War of the Worlds PC game released the previous year. Jeff Wayne oversaw the remixing process. The PlayStation game's score includes versions of \\"The Spirit of Man\\", \\"Brave New World\\", \\"Red Weed\\", \\"Horsell Common\\", \\"The Fighting Machine\\", and two versions of \\"The Eve of the War\\" (called the \\"Human\\" and \\"Martian\\" mixes). The player can pause the game and switch between any of the seven tracks at any time. The main menu of the game also features a music player. The remix of \\"Dead London\\" featured in the PC game is omitted. Part of the game's soundtrack was later re-released in the ullaDUBulla remix album. ==Reception== The game received generally positive reviews. In June 1998, PlayStation Pro published a review, giving the game a score of 91%. In December 1999, PlayStation Plus rated the game at 8/10. PlayStation Extreme reviewed it in their 24th issue, giving it a score of 83%. In January 2000, German magazine Video Games reviewed the game, praising its variety and selection of vehicles, but criticising its controls and \\"average\\" graphics; they awarded it a score of 70%. NowGamer gave the game a score of 48, saying that \\"[its] plausible tactical element and heavy dose of blasting just about saves it from extinction, but it was a close run thing\\". Others criticised the game's unusual mixture of the third-person shooter and strategy genres. ==External links== *Pixelogic's official website for the game *Official message board for the video games based on Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds ==References== Category:1999 video games Category:Alternate history video games Category:Europe-exclusive video games Category:Military science fiction video games Category:PlayStation (console)-only games Category:Steampunk video games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Vehicular combat games Category:Video games based on The War of the Worlds Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in England Category:Video games set in Glasgow Category:Video games set in Kent Category:Video games set in London Category:Video games set in Newcastle upon Tyne Category:Video games set in Oxford Category:Video games set in Nottinghamshire Category:Video games set in Scotland Category:Video games set in the 19th century Category:Video games set in Yorkshire Category:War video games set in Europe Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:GT Interactive Software games ","title":"Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds (1999 video game)"},{"id":"35196879","text":"Freshly made Doupi in Wuhan Doupi (豆皮 pinyin dὸu pί) is a breakfast dish from the city of Wuhan in Hubei province.

Penn at the event, but MacDonald pulled out of the bout after sustaining a cut to the forehead while training. The bout was rescheduled for UFC on Fox 5 on December 8, 2012. UFC newcomer Roger Hollett was expected to face Matt Hamill, who returned from retirement, at the event. However, Hollett was forced out of the bout due to a contract dispute and replaced by Vladimir Matyushenko. Then, on September 11, 2012, Matyushenko pulled out of the fight after suffering a torn Achilles tendon while training, and Hamill vs. Hollett was rebooked by UFC officials. A bout between Evan Dunham and TJ Grant was originally supposed to be contested on the main card but was instead fought on the FX prelims, for unknown reasons. As a result of the cancellation of UFC 151, a bout between Kyle Noke and Charlie Brenneman was rescheduled for this event. Dan Miller was expected to face Sean Pierson at the event. However, Miller pulled out of the bout after getting news about his son's kidney transplant operation. He was replaced by Lance Benoist. At the weigh-ins, Charles Oliveira failed to make weight by four tenths of pound on his first try. In the second, he was able to make 146.2 lb. However, his opponent signed to fight at a catchweight, and Oliveira was not fined. Main event The main event was UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones facing former champion Vitor Belfort. Originally, Jones was set to defend his title against Dan Henderson at UFC 151 on September 1, 2012 in Las Vegas, Nevada, but UFC President Dana White announced on August 23, 2012 that Henderson had a tear in his MCL and would not be able to compete. It was then revealed that Jones declined a fight against Chael Sonnen, who offered to take the fight on eight days notice. As a result, the event was cancelled. This marked the first time the UFC had cancelled an event, with the official fight card having been announced, in the organization's history. Following the cancellation of the event, White said that UFC 151 simply will not exist. Jones was set to face Lyoto Machida in a rematch at this event after the cancellation of that event, but Machida declined the fight. Subsequently, Belfort was chosen to take Machida's place. Jones was a massive favorite coming into the bout. It was later reported that Belfort fought Jones with a broken hand.

The test was originally developed by the \\"Academy of Ratzeburg rowing\\", Germany in 1971. It was employed by the Great Britain Junior rowing team selectors in the late 1970s and early 1980s. == Elements of the Test == Each element of the test was supervised by one of the GB junior rowing selection team. All parts of the test were completed in succession during an afternoon. The sequence was a timed 3,000 metre run on an athletic track, then a weight lifting test, followed by a gym circuit test. The weight lifting test consisted of successive power clean lifts at increasing weight until failure. At a given weight, recorded in pounds, a maximum of 3 failures were allowed. The circuit test counted the number of repetitions performed in one minute for each of the following exercises: :Number of Squat Thrusts. :Number of Sit ups with 20 lbs on chest. :Number of Squat jumps of 1 foot over maximum vertical reach. :Number of Sit ups with 20 lbs on chest (again). :Number of Squats with 20 lbs. :Number of Power Cleans of 90 lbs. If any repetition did not meet the standard required it would not be included in the circuit repetitions count. == Ratzburg Test Index Calculation == The subject’s height was measured in centimetres from the floor up to the clavicle (just below the neck) and the subjects weight in kilograms. Participants were required to score a minimum index value of 20.0 in order to pass to the next stage in the selection process. Each element of the test had a specific “constant value”. Each empirical value of an element taken for a subject had the respective constant value subtracted to emphasize better scores. :Subject_Height_Constant = 125 :Subject_Weight_Constant = 50 :Power_Clean_Constant = 25 :Circuit_Reps_Constant = 50 :Run_Time_Constant = 450 The calculation was performed as follows: Ratzburg Test Index Value = ( (Subject_Height_Value – Subject_Height_Constant) x (Subject_Weight_Value – Subject_Weight_Constant) x (Power_Clean_Value – Power_Clean_Contant) x (Circuit_Reps_Value – Circuit_Reps_Constant) ) Divided by ( Run_Time_Value – Run_Time_Constant) x 1,000 ==Critique== The test penalised lightweight rowers who would provide a lower weight value into the calculation. This encouraged participants to attempt to increase body weight during the winter season, only losing the weight again after the testing period had completed. It did however allow those who were physically appropriate for international rowing to be recognised, and created a focus on all round physical fitness in the winter training period rather than only specific rowing fitness. == External links == *Ruderwiki version of the test *Ruderakademie Ratzeburg *Training, 1983, Bernd Mühlfriedel, published by Diesterweg Sauerland No. 5121 Category:Rowing administration Category:Physical exercise ","title":"Ratzeburg Test"},{"id":"35197079","text":"Plicagonum is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species: * Plicagonum fulvum Darlington, 1952 * Plicagonum kaindi Darlington, 1971 * Plicagonum rugifrons Darlington, 1952 ==References== Category:Platyninae ","title":"Plicagonum"},{"id":"35197087","text":"Ponapagonum is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species: * Ponapagonum dybasi Darlington, 1970 * Ponapagonum pairoti Darlington, 1970 ==References== Category:Platyninae ","title":"Ponapagonum"},{"id":"35197088","text":"C.

View of the cemetery The chapel at New Southgate Cemetery designed by Alexander Spurr. New Southgate Cemetery is a 22-hectare cemetery in Brunswick Park in the London Borough of Barnet. It was established by the Colney Hatch Company in the 1850s and became the Great Northern London Cemetery, with a railway service running from near Kings Cross station to a dedicated station at the cemetery, similar to the service of the London Necropolis Company to Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey. The railway service to Great Northern London Cemetery soon closed, but the cemetery has remained open. ==Great Northern Cemetery== After the closure of burial grounds in central London in the 1850s, there was a movement to establish new cemeteries further from the centre of the city. The Cemeteries Clauses Act 1847 allowed for the creation of commercial cemeteries, expanded upon by the Burial Act 1852. The Colney Hatch Company acquired land for a cemetery near Colney Hatch (now known as New Southgate; the name was later changed to avoid association with the nearby Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum). Originally intended to cover 200 acres, the cemetery eventually reached covered 150 acres. The cemetery is located about north of Colney Hatch Station, now New Southgate railway station, which is about on the Great Northern Railway main line north of King's Cross station, which had opened in 1852, only a few years before the cemetery. The Great Northern London Cemetery Company was formed as a joint venture between the Great Northern Railway Company and the Colney Hatch Company under an 1855 local Act of Parliament.Acts of the Parliaments of the United Kingdom, Part 44 (1855), 18 & 19 Vic., c.clix with a view to providing cheap and convenient burial services to the residents of central London. A similar service was established in 1854 by the London Necropolis Company, running from London Necropolis railway station near Waterloo station to Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey, but the journey took around 45 minutes compared to 15 minutes between Kings Cross and Colney Hatch. The Great Northern London Cemetery Company aimed at the lower end of the market, charging 6 shillings to carry a coffin, and plus a return fare of 1s 6d for each mourner, plus another fee for burial, starting at 10s or 11s. The fees for burial at Brookwood Cemetery started at over £1. A siding was built next to the main line north of King's Cross station with a separate station building (Great Northern Cemetery Station) off of Maiden Lane (now York Way). The station included a wedge-shaped spire, and gothic arches, built above a retaining wall beside the railway line in a cutting below. It included a morgue - intended to avoid the unhygienic storage of cadavers at the deceased's family home - and facilities for mourners, with a lift to carry coffins down to the tracks. Rail services began in about 1861 and ran twice a week to Southgate & Colney Hatch (now New Southgate) station; north of the station, a single railway track ran to a terminus to the west of East Barnet Lane (later renamed Brunswick Park Road), beside the cemetery, where there were waiting rooms and chapels. The cemetery was laid out by Alexander Spurr in a concentric plan around a Gothic chapel with a high spire. Rail services ceased at some point after 1873, and the station with its chapel were demolished after 1912.https://maps.nls.uk/view/104202409 A Standard Telephones and Cables factory was built on the former location of the station in 1922; the site now forms part of North London Business Park. ==New Southgate Cemetery== Although the rail service ceased, the cemetery remained open for burials. It was later renamed New Southgate Cemetery. Later burials include the cemetery's architect and superintendent Alexander Spurr (died 1873) and Ross McWhirter (1925-1975). Perhaps the most famous person buried at the cemetery is Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957), a leader in the Baháʼí Faith, who died on a visit to London in 1957 and who, in accordance with the faith, was buried near the place of his death. In the latter year a crematorium was also opened here. Dorothy Lawrence, a woman who illicitly served as a male soldier on the Western Front in World War I and was institutionalised at the Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum where she died in 1964, was buried in a pauper's grave in the cemetery, where the site of her plot is no longer clear. Other interments include Richard Bethell and Alfred Baring Garrod. The cemetery was acquired by New Southgate Cemetery and Crematorium Company in 1993. It now includes sections for Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Caribbean burials. Parts of the land that once formed part of the cemetery grounds are now a modern housing estate. Since the 1950s, New Southgate cemetery has become the burial place for the North London Greek Cypriot community. The Greek Orthodox area was developed in 1998 and named after the Reverend Kyriacou Petrou, a local priest, who is also buried in this section. The cemetery is a Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade II. The Pymmes Brook Trail runs along the eastern boundary.New Southgate Cemetery and Crematorium, London Parks and Gardens Trust ==War graves== The cemetery contains war graves of 109 Commonwealth service personnel, two Belgian soldiers, and 51 German prisoners who were buried from the Alexandra Palace Internment Camp in World War I, besides 86 Commonwealth service war graves from World War II. A Cross of Sacrifice stands in front of the cemetery chapel. Those Commonwealth service personnel whose graves could not be marked by headstones are listed on a Screen Wall memorial for those of World War I and a Kerb Wall memorial for those of World War II.

He tells us that lands and houses on Italic soil, beasts of burden, slaves, and rustic and praedial servitudes are all res mancipi.

Lipases are secreted by the pancreas when fat is present. The primary role of lipase inhibitors is to decrease the gastrointestinal absorption of fats. Fats then tend to be excreted in feces rather than being absorbed to be used as a source of caloric energy, and this can result in weight loss in individuals. These inhibitors could be used for the treatment of obesity, which can subsequently lead to Type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases if not managed. An example of a lipase inhibitor is orlistat. ==Mechanism== Lipase inhibitors may affect the amount of fat absorbed, yet they do not block the absorption of a particular type of fat. Likewise, lipase inhibitors are not absorbed into the bloodstream. Lipase inhibitors bind to lipase enzymes in the intestine, thus preventing the hydrolysis of dietary triglycerides into monoglycerides and fatty acids. This then reduces the absorption of dietary fat. Lipase inhibitors covalently bond to the active serine site on lipases. This covalent bond is strong, meaning the lipase inhibitor tends to remain attached to the lipase. Studies have shown that lipase inhibitors work optimally when 40% of an individual's daily caloric intake is obtained from fat. Orlistat tends to block absorption of 30% of total fat intake from a meal, as orlistat passes out of the digestive tract more rapidly than fat does. ==Sources== Lipase inhibitors can be found naturally in plants and can also be produced as pharmaceutical drugs. Some lipase inhibitors have been identified in Panax ginseng. Some active compounds with chalcone scaffold found in Glycyrrhiza glabra, Cassia mimosoides, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Boesenbergia rotunda, apples and Morus alba also had strong effect against lipase. Caffeine, theobromine and theophylline were also supposed as lipase inhibitors although there was still controversial. ==Side effects== Lipase inhibitors can cause side effects, including oily spotting, fecal incontinence, flatus with discharge and abdominal cramping. Additionally, a raise in blood pressure, dry mouth, constipation, headache, and insomnia have been reported. Malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins may develop as a result of the impaired absorption of fat, which is required for the transportation of these vitamins across the intestine to reach the blood. Since lipase inhibitors are not absorbed in the intestine, and consequently not circulating in the blood, information about alternative side effects such as the modulation of the gastrointestinal tract is unobtainable. Generally, side effects can be controlled by reducing the consumption of dietary fats. Overall, orlistat has been considered to be safer than other anti-obesity drugs. == Cautions and Considerations == Because Lipase inhibitors interferes with the absorption of fat, it can also prevent the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. It is recommended that multi-vitamins are taken along with Lipase inhibitors, so vitamin-deficiency doesn't occur. ==See also== * Discovery and development of gastrointestinal lipase inhibitors ==References== Category:Obesity ","title":"Lipase inhibitors"},{"id":"35197197","text":"The Edinburgh and East of Scotland College of Agriculture carried out experimental work in agriculture and animal breeding in south-east Scotland.

Similar to policy uncertainty, tax uncertainty can impact both individuals and businesses and has been shown in some studies to slow rates of economic growth. ==In the United States== Temporary tax measures adopted in the 2000s, commonly referred to as Bush tax cuts, though extended in 2011, were scheduled to expire at the end of 2012. The uncertainty surrounding changes to tax rates, as well as the availability of certain tax deductions and credits, led to many businesses holding off on hiring and reducing spending. Honeywell CEO David Cote cited tax uncertainty as the reason why Honeywell has replaced only one quarter of departing employees in 2012 saying, \\"The last thing you want is to hire a lot of people and then have to lay them off.\\" According to a report published by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research financial and tax uncertainty played a significant role in the slow recovery of the U.S. economy because uncertainty had led to a more cautious approach to investments and hiring. In November 2012 the analysis firm Macroeconomic Advisers predicted that, in the absence of a resolution, unemployment would rise to 8.5 percent and the U.S. economy would grow only 1.1 percent in 2013. ==References== Category:Risk Category:Tax policy ","title":"Tax uncertainty"},{"id":"35197211","text":"Community integration, while diversely defined, is a term encompassing the full participation of all people in community life.

Rome, NY: Community and Policy Studies. Employment Employment integration was advocated during the 1970s for women, people with disabilities and racial groups, who were seen as discriminated against in employment (Racino for the Urban League of Onondaga County, Inc., 1978); for example, occupations and professions were constructed based upon gender: women's professions (nurses, teachers, secretaries) and men's professions (scientists, managers, administrators, police, firemen and construction).Boyd, M.

For those with severe disabilities employment-integration initiatives were often framed as supported employment, which allowed jobs at regular businesses and employment sites.Wehman, P. & Kregel, J.

Similar initiatives in the mental health field were often called transitional employment, and other forms of integration included competitive placements in businesses and industry, targeted positions, and even affirmative businesses in the hearts of business districts. A major success was the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, amended in 2008 (following the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, amended in 1978), which provided protection for men and women with disabilities in obtaining jobs, careers and positions with necessary workplace accommodations.Blanck, P.

In this context employment integration has been conceptualized, including social aspects of promotion, discriminatory hiring and termination practices, performance standards, job-sharing and modification, educational attainment, internships and volunteer experiences, workplace relationships, team-building, supervisory roles, workers' compensation, accommodations and supports (Urban League of Onondaga County, 1978). Competitive employment integration at the US workplace is expected by law, and categorical services have tended to be developed as segregated bases (e.g., sheltered facilities to supported employment). Employment integration is a worldwide issue, modified by approaches to multicultural groups (e.g. the growing Latino population in the US), the changing economy (e.g. from manufacturing to service) and increasing unemployment. ==Policies== Community integration has been most criticized for its inattention to gender, ethnic, cultural, racial, class and economic factorsTaylor, S., Bogdan, R. & Racino, J.

There are a number of Henry's works stored in the permanent collections of various provincial museums and art galleries including Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Worcester City Art Gallery and Museum and the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA) Gallery. As well as at the Birmingham Society of Arts (the precursor to the RBSA), Henry also exhibited at the Royal Academy, British Institution and Society of British Artists. The Wright family's patronage of the Lines family is also evident in William Rostill Lines's (Henry's younger brother) sculpture Bust of Mr. Thomas Wright Hill that was exhibited at the Birmingham Society of Arts Exhibition in 1829. ==Early life== He had four younger siblings: William Rostill Lines (1802–1846), Samuel Rostill Lines (1803–1833), Edward Ashcroft Lines (1807–1875) and Frederick Thomas Lines (1808–1898). The extent of Henry's early artistic education is uncertain, but it is highly likely that he was taught to draw by his father. Henry Harris also attended Thomas Wright Hill's Hilltop School, which was located in central Birmingham, a short distance from the family's home on Temple Row West. ==Career== Henry exhibited at the Royal Academy for the first time in 1818 (Caesar's Tower, Kenilworth Castle). Between 1818 and 1846, he exhibited eighteen works at the Royal Academy in total, exceeding in number those of Samuel (senior) and Frederick Thomas Lines (Henry's youngest brother) combined. All works were landscapes, spanning the Midlands to Cornwall and Yorkshire. He was also acquainted with celebrated landscapists such as the Birmingham artist David Cox. It is suggested in Cox's letters that they had visited Yorkshire together. Henry exhibited at the Birmingham Society of Arts in their first Exhibition of Modern Works in 1827. He joined their Committee of Artists in 1828, and became a full Member of the Society in 1830. He remained a Member until approximately 1856, and was listed as an annual subscriber from 1858 onwards, alongside his younger brothers, Frederick Thomas and Edward Ashcroft. He had sixteen works accepted in the first exhibition – all landscapes and topographical views of Yorkshire, North Wales and the Midlands. He later travelled to Switzerland in approximately 1846, returning to exhibit in Birmingham a series of Swiss- inspired landscapes. Worcester St Martin's Church, Holt Fleet, near Worcester, in 1879, by lines Henry Harris moved to Worcester in 1832 because of the cholera epidemic that was spreading across the Midlands. He lived at Bath Road but also retained his address in Birmingham until 1838. From that year onwards, his addresses remained in the Worcester area. Worcester was previously seen as lacking in intellectual activity, as highlighted by Henry Harris' school friend Edwin Lees who originally trained as a printer and stationer but later turned to the sciences and natural history. Geoffrey Potter notes in Henry's biography that Lees, upon visiting Worcester in 1828, noticed 'Worcester's lack of the societies and institutions necessary for a man of refined intellect', which 'was remedied by a Mr. Jackson, who delivered a course of lectures on the subject of Natural Philosophy'. From this emerged the Worcester Literary and Scientific Society, which became the exemplar for other societies within the region, such as the Worcestershire Natural Society and the Worcester Archaeological Club. Henry Harris thrived in this hub of activity and it was here that his work as both archaeologist and artist excelled. ==Personal life== Henry Harris married Emma Lacey and had three daughters: Elizabeth (b. 1825), Emma (b. 1828) and Catherine (b. 1829). It seems that all his daughters were given the opportunity to study art, with Elizabeth and Catherine being the two strongest contenders. Elizabeth was noted to have ‘a good knowledge of both art and music’ but Catherine was the only daughter to exhibit alongside her father at the Birmingham Society of Arts in 1860 and 1862, during a period where very few female artists exhibited their works. However, before her artistic career could be fulfilled, Catherine died shortly after her exhibition at the Birmingham Society of Artists in 1863, from a ‘visitation of God’ at her grandfather’s home. ==Archaeology== In Worcester, Henry Harris was also embarked upon a new career as an amateur archaeologist and antiquarian. He spent much of his later years surveying his local Malvern Hills, meticulously taking measurements and visually recording the ancient and physical features. Besides his surveys of the Malvern Hills, he was also known to travel alone to North Wales every summer to explore the ancient stone monuments. This was a practice that he continued throughout his seventies, relenting only in his early eighties because of his failing eyesight.

Shortly after this visit Georgia and the Holy See started working on a draft treaty, which became a subject of controversy in largely Orthodox Christian Georgia. The treaty, envisaging granting a Catholic church a legal status in Georgia, was to be ratified on September 20, 2003, and Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, then-Secretary for Relations with States, arrived in Tbilisi for this occasion. Conservative Orthodox elements responded with a mass protest rally and Ilia II, an influential Catholicos Patriarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, himself expressed skepticism regarding the treaty. The then-President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze, being absent at the CIS summit in Yalta, Ukraine, yielded to the pressure and made a last-minute decision not to sign the treaty, drawing criticism from the Holy See representatives, human rights activists, and liberal Orthodox clerics.

Founded in 1955 by Jürgen Jürgens and directed by him until 1994, it is one of Germany's most famous concert choirs. The choir is well known for its interpretations of Baroque and Renaissance music, but covers choral music from the Renaissance to contemporary music. Since 1994, the conductor has been . ==History== The choir was founded in 1955 as the \\"Chor am Italienischen Kulturinstitut\\" (Choir at the Italian Cultural Institute), but renamed the same year after Claudio Monteverdi, then a largely unknown composer. Since 1961 it has been the chamber choir of the University of Hamburg, where Jürgens worked as a director of music from 1961 to 1993. After four years of intensive preparation, the Monteverdi-Chor won first prize at the international choral competition Concorso Polifonico Internazionale \\"Guido d'Arezzo\\" in Arezzo, Italy, in 1959. In 1962, it won first prize also at the international competition in Lille, France. The choir became famous by collaboration with Gustav Leonhardt, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Frans Brüggen and Eduard Melkus, among others, recording for Teldec and Archiv Produktion. The choir recorded rarities. In the 1960s it recorded Bach cantatas, with soloists and players who later became famous in the field of historically informed performance, such as tenor Kurt Equiluz, bass Max van Egmond, violinist Jaap Schröder, recorder player Frans Brüggen and organist Gustav Leonhardt, among others. In 1990 works by Max Reger including his Requiem were recorded in collaboration with the choir of St. Michaelis, soloist Dietrich Fischer- Dieskau and the Philharmonisches Staatsorchester Hamburg, conducted by Gerd Albrecht. The choir was invited to music festivals at home and abroad, to almost all countries of Western and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the United States, Central and Latin America, Southeast Asia, China and Australia. After the sudden death of Jürgen Jürgens in August 1994, Gothart Stier from Leipzig, a former concert singer, became artistic director. The choir has about 60 singers. Stier has continued the tradition to focus on a cappella music. He also performed classical and romantic choral music including Verdi in cooperation with the Staatskapelle Halle, the Mitteldeutsches Kammerorchester, the Neues Bachisches Collegium Musicum, and members of the Gewandhausorchester. On 16 October 2010, the choir performed Monteverdi's Marienvesper in the Berlin Cathedral with the ensemble amarcord and the Lautten Compagney. In 2018, Antonius Adamske has been elected as new principal conductor. ==Recordings== * Felix Mendelssohn: Paulus, Stephanie Stiller, Christa Bonhoff, Christoph Genz, Siegfried Lorenz, Staatskapelle Halle, cond: Gothart Stier [1998], Ambitus 97942. * Felix Mendelssohn: Elias, Stephanie Stiller, Annette Markert, Martin Petzold, Siegfried Lorenz, Staatskapelle Halle, Gothart Stier [1996], Ambitus 97941. * Max Reger: Orchesterlieder, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, St. Michaelis-Chor, Philharmonisches Staatsorchester Hamburg, cond: Gerd Albrecht [1990], Orfeo 209901. * Claudio Monteverdi: Vespro della Beata Vergine, Barbara Schlick, Ine Kollecker, John Elwes, Wilfried Jochens, Holger Hampel, Christfried Biebrach, Gustav Hehring, Camerata Accademica Hamburg, cond: Jürgen Jürgens [1987], Ambitus 383826. * Marco da Gagliano: La Dafne, Norma Lerer, Barbara Schlick, Ine Kollecker, Nigel Rogers, Ian Partridge, David Thomas, Berthold Possemeyer, Camerata Accademica Hamburg, Jürgen Jürgens [1977], Deutsche Grammophon 437074-2. * Claudio Monteverdi: L'Orfeo, Ian Partridge, Nigel Rogers, John Elwes, Camerata Accademia Hamburg, Jürgen Jürgens [1974], Deutsche Grammophon 002894428723. * Henry Purcell: Dido and Aeneas, Tatiana Troyanos, Barry McDaniel, Sheila Armstrong, Patricia Johnson, Margaret Baker, Margaret Lensky, Paul Esswood, Nigel Rogers, chamber orchestra of the NDR, cond: Charles Mackerras [1967], Teldec 8573-81141-2. * Johann Sebastian Bach: Laß, Fürstin, laß noch einen Strahl, BWV 198, Der Friede sei mit dir, BWV 158, Wer weiß, wie nahe mir mein Ende?

He was sent to London and placed under the tuition of Thomas Hudson; later he went to Rome and studied under Marco Benefiale. He returned to England about 1748, and began his professional career by painting small whole-lengths; later he painted more demanding subjects. Penny appears to have joined the Incorporated Society of Artists in 1762; but with Benjamin West, Richard Wilson, and others, then withdrew because of internal frictions. In December 1768 he was nominated one of the foundation members of the Royal Academy of Arts, and its first professor of painting. He then ceased to exhibit, and was obliged by ill-health to resign the professorship of painting, in which he was succeeded by James Barry. Penny died at Chiswick on 16 November 1791, and was buried with his wife at Chessington, Surrey. ==Works== In 1762 Penny exhibited a small whole-length of a lady and a scene in Jane Shore. In 1763 he sent to the exhibition in Spring Gardens a scene from the Aminta of Tasso, and a small whole-length of George Edwards the ornithologist; in 1764, The Death of General Wolfe, which was engraved by Richard Houston, and a scene illustrating Jonathan Swift's Description of a City Shower; in 1765, The Marquess of Granby relieving a Sick Soldier, engraved by Richard Houston, and The Return from the Fair; in 1767, The Husbandman's Return from Work; and in 1768, The Generous Behaviour of the Chevalier Bayard, engraved by William Pether.

Their Duchy is not in the best of shape, the gameplay goal is to build up its population, land holdings, and grain reserves, ultimately hoping to become powerful enough to overthrow the High King. The player has to manage their duchy, while paying taxes and sending, on occasion, peasants to the King's service, undergoing epidemics, locusts and rival lords secretly helped by the High King; they can buy and sell land, itself divided in several categories depending on fertility, and engaging in offensive or defensive warfare, sending both subjects and mercenaries against the enemy and winning land and grain. == Development == Dukedom was written in PL/I D by Vince Talbot in 1976 as an expanded version of Kingdom, which itself is an expanded version of Hamurabi.

Duke Energy Corporation, 549 U.S. 561 (2007), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that while a term may be used more than once in a statute, an agency has the discretion to interpret each use of the term in a different way based on the context. In a unanimous decision, the Court held in favor of the plaintiff's (Environmental Defense) argument. This case addressed the Clean Air Act (CAA) and two of its programs, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and New Source Performance Standard (NSPS). PSD applies to regulating annual emissions; NSPS pertains to regulating hourly emissions. Each section of the Clean Air Act, that outlines the provisions of the PSD and the NSPS, defines \\"modification\\" differently. As a result, the inconsistency of the term \\"modification\\" in the CAA becomes the main debate of the case and the main argument for both the plaintiffs and defendants. ==Parties== Plaintiffs The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) is a nonprofit organization that works to reduce threats to the earth's environment that impact the climate, ocean, and ecosystems. The EDF was founded in 1967, in response to implications from usage of DDT. Today, with more than 2 million members, the EDF uses scientific support, economics, and environmental law to solve environmental problems. Additionally, the EDF develops \\"unlikely\\" partnerships to broaden support and expand reach for various issues. Defendants Duke Energy Corporation is a large-scale power company and utility in the United States that supplies and delivers electricity to nearly 7.4 million customers, covering a 50,000 square mile service territory. The company's electricity generation portfolio is composed predominantly of natural gas, nuclear, oil, and coal-fired power, as well as some renewable energy. The electrical generating capacity of Duke Energy totals 52,700 megawatts. The company has $133 billion in assets and approximately 28,800 employees. The company's mission is to provide electric services \\"in a sustainable way – affordable, reliable, clean\\". ==Background== Clean Air Act The US Clean Air Act was enacted in 1963 and was the federal government's first major step towards air pollution control. Currently the CAA regulates six criteria air contaminants from stationary sources: particulate matter, lead, ozone, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and sulfur oxides. Amendments have been added to the CAA, in 1970, 1977, and 1990. Objective of the regulation is to \\"protect human health, welfare and the environment by maintaining and improving the quality of the air through the development of standards\\". New Source Performance Standards The New Source Performance Standards, 42 U.S.C. 7411, was added to the CAA in 1970 and is a required permitting process in an attainment and nonattainment area. The NSPS imposes emission standards for pollutants in new or reconstructed stationary sources that undergo \\"modification.\\" The controls are technology based, as set by the EPA, but are delegated to the states to implement through their State Implementation Plan (SIP). The CAA defines \\"modification\\" under the NSPS as \\"any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the amount of any air emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollution not previously emitted.\\" If there is a \\"modification,\\" a physical change in the source's method of operation would increase the emission rate of pollution expressed in kilograms per hour (kg/h). Prevention of Significant Deterioration When a pollutant source is in an attainment area, it becomes subject to the PSD permitting process. The PSD is part of the New Source Review program and was added to the CAA in 1977 with the goal of not allowing the good air to deteriorate, since it is only required for areas of attainment. The PSD is focused on air quality in the region, in regards to health effects, as opposed to the emission technology. While some argue that the PSD is not needed as the public health is protected by National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), others may say that the PSD prevents the \\"flight of industry\\" from dirty to clean areas that are in attainment, as they would not have to comply with as strict of regulations. Before this program was implemented, there was nothing in place that addressed potential air quality deterioration. The CAA defines \\"modification\\" under the PSD as \\"net annual emissions increase\\". This is when the actual emissions from a pollutant source would increase the average for the two prior years; \\"any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that would result in: a significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant; and a significant net emissions increase of that pollutant from the major stationary source.\\" ==Case== In 1988, Duke Energy Corporation began a series of improvements to its eight power plants in order to modernize its facilities, taking twelve years to complete. The power generation plants were coal-fire powered and utilized \\"boilers and steam turbines\\". The improvements incorporated alterations to the boilers as well as portions of \\"waterwalls, superheaters, and reheaters\\". The work was costly but would allow Duke's facilities to run with full capability without having various units down. On December 22, 2000, the EPA filed suit against Duke Energy Corporation in District Court, for the 29 alterations to their power plants that had been performed. The EPA claimed they had lacked the proper PSD permits and in doing so, violated the CAA. Duke argued that their improvements did not fall within the scope of the PSD program because the power plants' hourly emissions rate would not be altered. Shortly thereafter, three other environmental groups, led by Environmental Defense, joined the EPA in the suit. Environmental Defense, on the other hand, believed that by improving the plants, Duke would be able to run for longer hours, causing the \\"total annual emissions\\" to increase. This they believed, constituted the need for PSD to apply. Arguments Environmental Defense argued that Duke Energy had violated the CAA under PSD by failing to receive permits to conduct modifications to their power plants. The modifications made would increase net emissions per year. The term \\"modification\\" in the PSD provision relates to an overall increase of \\"annual emissions\\" rather than an increase in \\"hourly emissions\\", as Environmental Defense argues. They also contended that the D.C. Circuit was the necessary court to handle this case and not the Fourth Circuit. They believed the Fourth Circuit did not have authority to make a decision on this case because the CAA is \\"statutorily delegated to the D.C. Circuit\\". Duke Energy Corporation argued that its improvements did not need a permit because the changes had not increased their hourly rate of emissions. The NSPS defines \\"modification\\" as an increase in emissions per hour and the same definition must be applied to the PSD. The renovations were needed as a result of physical deterioration and age of the plants and modernization was necessary to avoid replacement. Throughout their renovations, the hourly emission rates were kept constant and Duke argued they had not violated the PSD provisions. Concerning whether the Fourth District had authority to rule in this case, Duke believed they did since it was only an issue of interpreting provisions. Exclusive jurisdiction by the D.C. Circuit was according to Congress, only regarding \\"actions brought to enforce the PSD provisions.\\" Duke argued that if the Fourth Circuit could not interpret regulations in this manner, it would present \\"serious constitutional questions regarding the availability of judicial review\\" by keeping courts from carrying out their duty to assert the law. District Court opinion Knowing that analysis of the pertinent Clean Air Act amendments was difficult, the District Court allowed flexibility to the EPA in interpreting these amendments as well as their own regulations and should be given \\"controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\\" The court also acknowledged that this flexibility does not allow the EPA \\"unbridled discretion\\" to interpret the Clean Air Act amendments freely. The court is still responsible for deciphering if the EPA's analysis agrees with Congress's objective. On August 26, 2003 the District Court composed a \\"three- faceted holding\\" based on whether: 1.) the \\"modification\\" completed was a \\"routine maintenance, repair and replacement\\"; 2.) a \\"net emissions increase\\" occurs only when the \\"hourly rate of emission increases\\"; 3.) Duke's failure to obtain a PSD permit before performing its modifications represented an ongoing violation for statute of limitations purposes. The major finding at this court level was that in regards to the PSD regulation, a \\"net increase\\" of emissions can only occur when there is an increase in the hourly rate of emission. Although Duke had increased their hours of operation, they had not altered the hourly emission rate at its plants. Because of this, the District Court held that there had been no net increase of emission and Duke had not violated the PSD regulation and so, had not needed to acquire a permit for a major modification. Fourth Circuit opinion Environmental Defense appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which affirmed the District Court's ruling. The Fourth Circuit stated that different meanings of the word \\"modification\\" are not possible because Congress made clear that the legislative definition of \\"modification\\" were the same in both the PSD and NSPS regulations. And thus the EPA could not interpret \\"modification\\" differently in either regulation but must interpret the term \\"consistently and uniformly for the purposes of both sets of regulations\\". The Fourth Circuit decision depended on precedent set by the Rowan case. After the 4th Circuit decision, the plaintiff and intervenor environmental groups filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. Both Duke Energy and the United States objected this action, however, the Supreme Court granted the petition on May 15, 2006. Rowan Companies Inc. v. United States is a related case in that it also concerns interpreting the same single term in two different regulations. In this case, the word \\"wages\\" was interpreted differently in two tax provisions by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Supreme Court stated that the differing interpretations were impermissible because the IRS lacked the ability to interpret \\"wages\\" differently within the framework of this case. In this instance, the judgment affirms the general belief that \\"the same words, when repeated, carry the same meaning.\\" ==Supreme Court decision== The judgment of the Court of Appeals was vacated and remanded. Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court. It was found that the EPA did not have to interpret \\"modification\\" in PSD regulations the same way the term is interpreted in New Source Performance Standard regulations. The Court's opinion recognized that two uses of the same term, with the same definition, usually would mean the same thing. Yet in this instance, the term \\"modification\\" and its definition differ broadly. The Court concluded that \\"EPA's construction need do no more than fall within the limits of what is reasonable, as set by the Act's common definition.\\" Justice Thomas wrote separately to note that although he agrees with the substantive ruling on the matter, he did not agree with the dicta in Part III-A of the Court's opinion. Thomas believed that the EPA could not have different regulatory definitions of \\"modification\\" under PSD and NSPS. He also states that the Court should still apply its \\"usual presumption that the same words repeated in different parts of the same statute have the same meaning\\" and does not believe the Court's opinion overcame this presumption. ==Significance== The Supreme Court's decision demonstrates how discretion is given to the agency in interpreting regulations and definitions. Utilizing the Chevron test (Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.)), the agency can determine whether the statutory language is vague. For future implications, agencies may be able to alter regulatory requirements to make compliance more complex or costly. Conversely, the precedent set in this case could allow a more thorough Congress to limit this type of agency discretion in the future. This ruling was also significant because it provided a precedent that favored stronger regulation of stationary pollution sources. Even though the rate of emissions per hour would not have increased, the net emission per year would have due to increased hours of operation. As a result, the air quality was considered to be adversely impacted. The Duke decision may signify that the Court will take environmental policy into consideration more in the future. The decision shows that the Supreme Court is more likely to interpret environmental laws in line with the legislation's objective rather than following the order of constricted rules of \\"statutory construction\\". ==References * Category:2007 in the environment Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:2007 in United States case law ","title":"Environmental Defense v.

The term is used to reclaim the word slut and empower women and girls to have agency over their own sexuality. It may also be used in reference to gay men, who may face disapproval for sexual behaviors considered promiscuous. Slut-shaming rarely happens to heterosexual men. Examples of slut-shaming include being criticized or punished for violating dress code policies by dressing in perceived sexually provocative ways, requesting access to birth control, having premarital, casual, or promiscuous sex, engaging in prostitution, or when being victim blamed for being raped or otherwise sexually assaulted. == Definitions and characteristics == Slut-shaming involves criticizing women for their transgression of accepted codes of sexual conduct, i.e., admonishing them for behavior, attire or desires that are more sexual than society finds acceptable. in Emphasis in original. Author Jessalynn Keller stated, \\"The phrase [slut-shaming] became popularized alongside the SlutWalk marches and functions similarly to the 'War on Women,' producing affective connections while additionally working to reclaim the word 'slut' as a source of power and agency for girls and women.\\" Slut-shaming is used by men and women.Monica Lewinsky’s return and the sexism 2.0 of political scandals Slut-shaming functions among girls and women as a way of sublimating sexual jealousy \\"into a socially acceptable form of social critique of girls' or women's sexual expression.\\" The term is also used to describe victim blaming for rape and other sexual assault. This is done by stating the crime was caused (either in part or in full) by the woman wearing revealing clothing or acting in a sexually provocative manner, before refusing consent to sex, thereby absolving the perpetrator of guilt. Sexually lenient individuals can be at risk of social isolation. The action of slut-shaming can be considered to be a form of social punishment and is an aspect of sexism, as well as female intrasexual competition. The social movement falls into the category of feminism. This raises controversy because gender roles do have a significant role in the social movement. The topic of slut-shaming sheds light on the social issues that are associated with the double standard. This is because slut-shaming is usually toward girls and women, and boys and men usually do not get slut- shamed. Slut-shaming is common in America because it is such a high-context culture. Being in a high-context culture, it is easier to be victim blamed. Slut-shaming is strongly associated with victim-blaming. Researchers from Cornell University found that sentiments similar to slut-shaming appeared in nonsexual, same-sex friendship context as well. The researchers had college women read a vignette describing an imaginary female peer, \\"Joan\\", then rate their feelings about her personality. To one group of women, Joan was described as having two lifetime sexual partners; to another group, she had had 20 partners. The study found that women—even women who were more promiscuous themselves—rated the Joan with 20 partners as \\"less competent, emotionally stable, warm, and dominant than the Joan who'd only boasted two\\". == Society and culture ==  History  There is no documented date of origin for the term slut-shaming; nor the act of it. Rather, although the act of slut-shaming has existed for centuries, discussion of it has grown out of social and cultural relations and the trespassing of boundaries of what is considered normative and acceptable behavior. Second wave of feminism contributed significantly to the definition and act of slut-shaming. Tracing back to the Industrial Revolution and the second World War, men's gender roles were that of the breadwinner. Men made up a majority of the labor force while women were socialized and taught to embrace the cult of domesticity and homemaking.Poole, E. (2014) Hey girls, did you know? Slut-shaming on the internet needs to stop. University of San Francisco Law Review, 1, pp. 221-260 Author Emily Poole argues that the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s increased the rate of both birth control use, as well as rates of premarital sex.  Modern society  Slut-shaming is prevalent on social media platforms, including the most commonly used: YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. Slut-shaming has occurred on Facebook in controversial exchanges between users that have resulted in convictions to menace, harass and cause offense. It has been reported by The Pew Research Center that the most common targets of harassment on the Internet are often young women. Citing that 50% of young female respondents have been called offensive names and or shamed online. In particular, those who were 18 to 24 years of age experienced varying amounts of severe harassment at astoundingly high rates. Women who have been stalked online were at 26%, while the targets of online sexual harassment were at 25%. In the Women Studies International Forum, researcher Jessica Megarry argues that harassment conveyed in a case study of #mencallmethings hashtag found that it was a form of online sexual assault, on specifically Twitter. In this hashtag, women would collectively tweet examples of harassment they have received from men. This kind of harassment included anything from insults related to appearance, name calling, even rape, death threats, i.e., \\"slut shaming.\\" One example of a character in literature has been described as being a recipient of 'slut-shaming' is the character Lily Bart in Edith Wharton's House of Mirth.  Media  Two women protesting about victim-blaming and slut-shaming at New York City's SlutWalk in October 2011 The SlutWalk protest march had its origins in Toronto in response to an incident when a Toronto Police officer told a group of students that they could avoid sexual assault by not dressing like \\"'sluts'\\". Pdf.SlutWalk Rally Against Sexual Violence Draws Huge Crowd of Feminists , Rebecca Nathanson, The Village Voice, October 2, 2011 Amber Rose's second annual walk in Los Angeles in 2016 had \\"several hundred\\" participants. A similar event occurred in Washington DC in 2014. The Slut Walk movement has embraced the slut-shame label and has engaged in an act of resignification. Ringrose et al. call the Slut Walk a \\"collective movement\\" where the focus goes back to the perpetrator and no longer rests on the victim.Ringrose, J. & Renold, E (2011). Slut- shaming, girl power and ‘sexualisation’: thinking through the politics of international slutwalks with teen girls. Gender and Education, 24 (3), 333-343. This act of resignification comes from the work of feminist scholar Judith Butler. In her 1997 work, she argued that labels do not just name and marginalize individuals to particular categories but language also open up an opportunity for resistance.Butler, J. (1996). Excitable speech: Contemporary scenes of politics. New York: Routledge. Krystal Ball characterized the comments of Rush Limbaugh during the Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy as follows: \\"If you are a woman who stands up for your rights, you are a slut and your parents should be ashamed of you and we should all have the right to view your sex tapes online. This type of despicable behavior is part and parcel of a time-worn tradition of Slut-Shaming. When women step out line [sic], they are demeaned and degraded into silence. If you say Herman Cain sexually harassed you, you are a slut. If you say Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas sexually harassed you, you are a slut.\\" Slut-shaming has been used as a form of bullying on social media, with some people using revenge pornography tactics to spread intimate photos without consent. In 2012, a California teenager, Audrie Pott, was sexually assaulted by three boys at a party. She committed suicide eight days after photos of her being assaulted were distributed among her peer group. James Miller, editor-in-chief, for the Ludwig von Mises Institute of Canada wrote a controversial article defending slut shaming. The article was later taken down, but still received criticism from some libertarians, such as Gina Luttrell of Thoughts on Liberty, an all- female libertarian blog. Comedians Krystyna Hutchinson and Corinne Fischer of Sorry About Last Night host a podcast entitled Guys We Fucked, The Anti-slut shaming podcast. This podcast has over 200,000 listeners on each episode that is on SoundCloud. iTunes originally did not make the podcast available and \\"...would not comment on whether the show is subject to an official ban,\\" but has since been made available on iTunes. The podcast exists to de-stigmatize discussing sex so that slut-shaming becomes less of an issue, Hutchinson explains in an interview with The Huffington Post: “We want to make people feel more comfortable in their own skin. We just got a message from a girl from New Delhi, India, about how she loves the podcast because it makes her feel like it’s OK to be comfortable with your sexuality and enjoy sex. And that made me so happy.” == Activism == Activism against slut-shaming takes place worldwide. Participants have covered their bodies in messages reading \\"Don't Tell Me How to Dress\\" and \\"I am not a slut but I like having consensual sex\\" and march under a giant banner with the word slut on it. Activism has occurred in Vancouver, New York City, Rio, Jerusalem, Hong Kong and others. In 2008, hundreds of South African women protested the local taxi rank wearing miniskirts and t-shirts that read, \\"Pissed-Off Women\\" after a taxi driver and multiple hawkers confronted a young girl about wearing a short denim miniskirt and penetrated her with their fingers, calling her \\"slut\\" repeatedly. Protesters wanted to make their message clear; they wanted men to stop harassing women no matter how short their skirts were and that no matter how short it may be, it is never an invitation. After the gang rape of an unconscious 16-year-old girl in Steubenville, Ohio, August 2012, football players spread videos of the assault to other classmates whom some of which posted the videos to Twitter and Instagram. The pictures and video were later removed by authorities, however that did not stop people from hash-tagging \\"Whore status\\" or \\"I have no sympathy for whores\\" in their tweets. Members of the collective Anonymous reported names of the rapists and classmates who spread the footage to local authorities. They took to the streets and Internet requesting help from the community to bring justice to the Jane Doe who was raped. Members of The Arts Effect All-Girl Theater Company have developed a play, Slut: The Play, in which they address the damaging impact of slut- shaming and slut culture. The creators note that their play \\"is a call to action – a reminder\\" that slut-shaming is happening every day, almost everywhere. Slut is inspired by real-life experiences of 14- to 17-year-old girls from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. The play was shown at the 2013 New York Fringe Festival. In her statement on the production, and of slut-shaming in general, author of Slut! Growing Up Female with a Bad Reputation, Leora Tanenbaum writes: After experiencing slut-shaming firsthand, Olivia Melville, Paloma Brierly Newton and approximately a dozen other Australian women founded the organization, Sexual Violence Won’t Be Silenced, on August 25, 2015. The association seeks to raise awareness of cyber-bullying and online sexual violence. The founders also launched a petition to the Australian government, requesting that they better train and educate law enforcement officers on how to prevent and punish violent harassment on social media. == Among gay and bisexual men == Gay and bisexual men are also victimized for slut-shaming because of their sexual activity. There has been research supporting that LGBT students were more likely to be bullied and called sluts than heterosexual students. Researchers discussed how these negative experiences of victimization by peers, friends and strangers can lead to \\"physical harm, social shaming, and loss of friendships.\\" Unlike heterosexual people, LGBT people are more likely to learn about safe sex practices from friends. The group most highly at risk of HIV infection is young gay and bisexual men. Most of the education that young gay and bisexual men receive about safe sex practices is learned from friends, the Internet, hearsay or trial and error. Criticism of non-heterosexual men's sexual activity can either be said in a humorous context or not. Judgementalism happens when someone mentions gay men's sexual risk behavior or that they have multiple sex partners. This implies that their behavior is \\"slutty\\" and dirty. Street harassment includes cat-calling, victim blaming, and slut shaming. Judgmentalism is not a pejorative word compared to women, and slut-shaming may have a positive connotation with men depending on context and relationship. == See also == * Female intrasexual competition * Free the nipple * Honor killing * Madonna–whore complex * Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims * Sexual bullying * Victim blaming == References == Category:Bullying Category:Feminism and sexuality Category:Feminist terminology Category:Feminist theory Category:Misogyny Category:Sexuality and society Category:Prejudice and discrimination Category:Birth control ","title":"Slut-shaming"},{"id":"35197390","text":"Rhadine is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species: ==Species== These 56 species belong to the genus Rhadine: * Rhadine albamontana Dajoz, 1998 i c g * Rhadine anthicoides Casey, 1913 i c g * Rhadine araizai (Bolívar y Pieltain, 1944) i c g * Rhadine austinica Barr, 1974 i c g b * Rhadine babcocki (Barr, 1960) i b * Rhadine balesi (Gray, 1937) i c g * Rhadine bolivari Barr, 1982 c g * Rhadine bullis Reddell and Cokendolpher, 2004 i c g * Rhadine caudata (Leconte, 1863) * Rhadine chipinque Barr, 1982 c g * Rhadine constricta Casey, 1913 i c g * Rhadine dissecta (Leconte, 1863) * Rhadine elliotti Barr, 1982 c g * Rhadine euprepes (Bates, 1882) c g * Rhadine exilis (Barr and Lawrence, 1960) i c g * Rhadine gracilenta Casey, 1913 * Rhadine grubbsi Reddell and Dupérré, 2009 i c g * Rhadine hendrichsi Barr, 1982 c g * Rhadine howdeni (Barr & Lawrence, 1960) i c g b * Rhadine infernalis (Barr & Lawrence, 1960) i c g b * Rhadine insolita Barr, 1974 i c g * Rhadine ivyi Reddell and Cokendolpher, 2004 i c g * Rhadine jejuna (Leconte, 1878) * Rhadine koepkei (Barr, 1960) i c g * Rhadine lanei (Gray, 1937) i c g * Rhadine larvalis Leconte, 1848 * Rhadine leptodes (Bates, 1882) c g * Rhadine lindrothi Barr, 1965 i c g b * Rhadine longiceps Vandyke, 1949 * Rhadine longicollis Benedict, 1927 i c g * Rhadine longipes Casey, 1913 i c g * Rhadine medellini Bolivar, Pieltain & Hendrichs, 1964 * Rhadine myrmecodes (G.horn, 1892) * Rhadine nivalis (G.horn, 1881) * Rhadine noctivaga Barr, 1974 i c g * Rhadine ozarkensis Sanderson & Miller, 1941 i c g b * Rhadine pelaezi Bolivar, Pieltain & Hendrichs, 1964 * Rhadine perlevis Casey, 1913 i c g * Rhadine persephone Barr, 1974 i c g * Rhadine pertenuis Casey, 1920 i c g * Rhadine plumasensis Casey, 1920 * Rhadine pugetana Casey, 1920 c g * Rhadine reddelli Barr, 1982 c g * Rhadine reyesi Reddell and Cokendolpher, 2001 i c g * Rhadine rossi Vandyke, 1949 * Rhadine rotgeri Bolivar, Pieltain & Hendrichs, 1964 * Rhadine rubra (Barr, 1960) i c g * Rhadine russelli Barr, 1974 i c g * Rhadine specum (Barr, 1960) i c g * Rhadine sprousei Reddell and Cokendolpher, 2004 i c g * Rhadine sublustris Casey, 1913 i c g * Rhadine subterranea (Vandyke, 1918) * Rhadine tenebrosa (Barr, 1960) i c g * Rhadine tenuipes Casey, 1920 * Rhadine testacea Casey, 1920 i c g * Rhadine umbra Casey, 1913 i c g Data sources: i = ITIS, c = Catalogue of Life, g = GBIF, b = Bugguide.net ==References== Category:Platyninae Category:Carabidae genera ","title":"Rhadine (beetle)"},{"id":"35197394","text":"Lizzie Graham (1844–1927) was a late 19th-century Puerto Rican soprano singer from Ponce, Puerto Rico.Luis Fortuño Janeiro.

Two sisters, eleven- year-old Sharon and eight-year-old Chiara, were found dead by their mother and her partner at their home in Krailling, Bavaria (Germany). One week later, their uncle, Thomas Selmayr, was arrested on suspicion of their murder based on a DNA profile. On April 16, 2012, Thomas Selmayr was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. ==Background== Anette Selmayr, 41, and her daughters Sharon and Chiara lived separately from husband and father in a flat on Margaretenstraße 20 in Krailling, Bavaria. Her new partner Klaus Paulus ran a pub called Schabernack in the town where she regularly used to work. Despite the separation, the two girls saw their father regularly. Thomas Selmayr, who took his wife's name, was the husband of Anette's sister. He, his wife and their four children moved into an unfinished house in Peißenberg in 2010. They were not able to pay back the loans, so Thomas Selmayr tried to force his wife's sister Anette S. to sell a flat the two sisters owned together and give his family the money, which she denied. ==Murders== Thomas Selmayr wanted to kill his sister-in-law and his nieces so his wife would be the sole heir of the flat, another flat Annette S. owned, and the heritage of the 98-year-old grandmother. He hoped that this way the family would be able to pay back their loans and would be able to help one of their children who is disabled. On March 23, 2011, Anette S. left her two daughters Sharon and Chiara alone in their home in Krailling, to work in a nearby pub, only a few minutes away from her home, that was owned by her new partner. The door of the house was not locked because the mother feared the girls were not able to save themselves from fire if the door was locked. Thomas S. knew this and used it for his plan: he invaded the house and killed his nieces around 2:00 or 2:30 a.m. The investigators reconstructed that eight-year-old Chiara was first strangled with a rope. Sharon woke up and went to her sister's room. The murderer left the unconscious Chiara alone and chased Sharon through the house. In the kitchen, she was attacked with a barbell. After hitting her two times onto the head, the murderer took a knife from the kitchen and stabbed the girl; the autopsy later counted five wounds, as far as 17 centimeters (6,7 inches) deep. Chiara woke up from her unconsciousness and overheard the attack on her sister. She tried to block the door, but the murderer pushed her away, smashed her head with the barbell and cut her carotid artery. Both bodies also bore scattered hematomae. The autopsy was not able to determine which were the fatal wounds, as there were multiple potentially fatal wounds. Selmayr also planned to drown their mother in the bathtub, so it would have looked like an extended suicide of the mother; however, he changed this plan because she did not come home early enough and he feared that it would not be possible to cover the crime, because it was nearly dawn. At 5:00 a.m., Annette and her partner came back home and found the horribly mangled bodies of the two girls. ==Investigation== After the police arrived on the crime scene, the Bavarian police and the Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany (Bundeskriminalamt) started their investigation. The murderer wounded himself several times during his slaughter, so DNA-material was found. The crime shocked Bavaria and was topic of the German and Austrian medias for days, so the help of the local people was immense. After testing 91 saliva samples which had been given voluntarily from local people, Selmayr was arrested only nine days after the murders, meanwhile in Krailling the two girls were buried. ==Criminal trial== On January 17, 2012, the murder trial started in Munich. The accused first tried to explain his blood on the crime scene with a nose bleed he had during an earlier visit, which he cleaned up with Sharon, when the court asked him how such a large amount of his blood was found all over the house as a result of a nosebleed, Selmayr answered: \\"Da müssen sie Sharon schon selber fragen!\\" (\\"Ask Sharon if you want to know!\\"). At the last part of the trial, Selmayr claimed that his blood that was found on the crime scene was put there by criminal officers in order to frame him, which was refuted by the fact that the blood was found and analysed before Selmayr was under suspicion. At last, even his defense lawyers distanced themselves from their client. On April 16, 2012, Selmayr was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. ==References== Category:2011 murders in Germany Category:2010s in Bavaria Category:Murder in Bavaria Category:Murdered German children ","title":"Krailling double homicide"},{"id":"35197495","text":"Skouedhirraad is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species: * Skouedhirraad kucerai Morvan, 2004 * Skouedhirraad sikkimensis Morvan, 1999 ==References== Category:Platyninae ","title":"Skouedhirraad"},{"id":"35197499","text":"Aboriginal Memorial, a collection of hollow log coffins at the National Gallery of Australia A hollow log coffin is a type of coffin used by the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land, Australia.

Dionysus in 69 was directed and conceived by TPG's founder and long-time artistic director Richard Schechner. The stage play was an adaptation of Euripides' The Bacchae. Dionysus in 69 is an example of Richard Schechner's practice of site-specific theatre as described in his 1973 book Environmental Theater, utilizing space and the audience in such ways as to bring them in close contact with each other. Dionysus in 69 challenged notions of the orthodox theatre by deconstructing Euripides' text, interpolating text and action devised by the performers, and involving the spectators in an active and sensory artistic experience. Brian de Palma, Bruce Joel Rubin, and Robert Fiore made a film of Dionysus in 1970. The film records and merges the final two performances of the 1968 stage play. ==Cast== The cast of the play at the time of its filming was: *Remi Barclay *Samuel Blazer *Jason Bosseau *Richard Dia *William Finley *Joan MacIntosh *Vicki May *Patrick McDermott *Margaret Ryan *Richard Schechner *William Shephard *Ciel Smith ==The Bacchae== The Bacchae is a play written by the Greek playwright Euripides. The play opened at the City Dionysia Festival in Athens in 405 B.C. and won first prize. It follows the God Dionysus on his return to the city of Thebes to avenge his mother's reputation and the God's own rejection as the bastard child of Zeus. The title refers to the groups of female followers of the God, who serve as the chorus in the play, and would engage in ecstatic rituals to the point of euphoric delirium motivated by the God's association with wine, sexuality, celebration and the theater. The play deals with the themes of religion, sexuality, sacrifice and devotion. The translation which served as the basis for the TPG production was written by William Arrowsmith. ==Project details== Rehearsal and performance took place in a “performing garage” which was rather a small metal stamping factory, but Schechner found “garage a much jazzier title”. According to Schechner the group rehearsed for 5 months at least 6 days a week on average 6 hours a day including vocal training and psychophysical interactions (e.g. attack therapy, a controversial method at that time in use to treat drug addicts). Dionysus in 69 is an example of Richard Schechner's theories of Environmental Theater in terms of the uses of the performing space, deconstruction of classic texts, and audience participation. In his book, Schechner describes participation as the opening up of a play so that the audience/spectators can enter into the action—they are included in the world of the drama which is made all the more actual by their participation. As Schechner writes in Environmental Theater: “The transformation of an aesthetic event into a social eventor shifting the focus from art-and-illusion to the formation of a potential or actual solidarity among everyone in the theater, performers and spectators alike.” There were no seats, though the cast would chant \\"May I take you to your seat, sir?\\" The audience sat either on the floor, against a wall, or wooden scaffolds. Dionysus in 69 created an atmosphere in which participation ranged from clapping and singing to spectators stripping and joining in the ritual celebrations and dances. After working on Dionysus in 69, Schechner composed three rules regarding participation: # The audience is in a living space and a living situation. Things may happen to and with them as well as “in front” of them. # When a performer invites participation, he must be prepared to accept and deal with the spectator's reactions. # Participation should not be gratuitous. Schechner also notes that the key to participation is that it fundamentally changes the nature of the performance, its rhythms and outcomes. He states that, “Without this potential for change participation is just one more ornamental, illusionistic device.” Previous to Dionysus in 69, Schechner practiced and theorized \\"Six Axioms for Environmental Theater\\". These axioms were enacted in this play, as well as in other of Schechner's theatre pieces: # The theatrical event is a set of related transactions # All the space is used for performance; all the space is used for audience. # The theatrical event can take place either in a totally transformed space or in found space. # Focus is flexible and variable. # All production elements speak in their own language. # The text need be neither the starting point nor the goal of a production. There may be no text at all. ==Critical reception and influence== Dionysus in 69 was widely considered to be Schechner's seminal work. It is often looked to as the piece that broke ground on the movement of happenings in American theater and performance art. Jill Dolan, of Princeton University, says of Schechner's work on Dionysus: \\"Schechner [made environmental staging] famous, in which the audience is interspersed with the actors, in a way that refuses the conventional separation between spectators and performers.” The production also gained something of a cult following, with audiences who returned to see (or participate in) the show again and again. This was so much the case that when, during a performance in which the audience held a revolt of sorts and several students \\"rescued\\" the actor playing Pentheus, removing him from the performance over the objections of other cast members. Schechner then asked the audience for a volunteer to replace the actor playing Pentheus in order to complete the performance, and a spectator who had been many times before and was familiar with the piece volunteered to fill in the role. Although wrought with controversy, the New York Times called Dionysus in 69 \\"a production of extraordinary grace and power\\". ==References * Dionysus in 69 (digitally re-rendered) — Brian De Palma's film of the production, hosted by the Hemispheric Institute Digital Video Library Category:1968 plays Category:Works based on The Bacchae Category:Plays based on works by Euripides ","title":"Dionysus in 69 (play)"},{"id":"35197677","text":"Alessandro Noselli (born 1 September 1980) is an Italian footballer who plays as a forward. ==Club career== Early career Born in Udine, Friuli, Noselli started his career at hometown club Udinese Calcio. Noselli graduated from Primavera under-20 reserve team in 2000. That transfer window he left for Castel di Sangro of Serie C1. In mid-2001 he left for Avellino, but Noselli failed to play any game. South Tyrol In October 2001 Noselli went down to Serie C2 club South Tyrol. Noselli scored a double figure of 10 goals, the first time in his career. In Bolzano, he partnered with another Udine youth product Simone Motta. Udinese turned the deal to co-ownership on 30 August 2002. On that day Udinese bought back Noselli from South Tyrol and re-sold him back to South Tyrol, made South Tyrol was the \\"active\\" stakeholder and Udinese was the \\"passive\\" one. Triestina In June 2003 the co-ownership deal was renewed, and Udinese farmed Noselli to Serie B club Triestina in July 2003. The club was located in Trieste, the capital of Friuli – Venezia Giulia, where city of Udine is also located. Noselli picked no.32 as shirt number. However Noselli failed to enter the starting XI and scored once. Both South Tyrol and Udinese failed to agree a price before the deadline on 23 June, thus they had to submit a bid to Lega Calcio in a sealed envelop. On the next day the league committee announced that South Tyrol outbid Udinese. However the tiny Serie C2 club sold Noselli to Mantova, the champion of Serie C2 Group A. Mantova Noselli joined Mantova in mid-2004. Noselli yet to score regularly since leaving the fourth division. In 2004–05 Serie C1, Noselli only scored once. Mantua promoted as the promotion playoffs winner. However Noselli, scored 8 goals in 2005–06 Serie B, with only 18 starts. Noselli spent almost half appearances as substitute and as starter. Noselli also started 3 out of 4 games of the promotion playoffs, losing to Torino. Noselli became more importance in next season, with 28 starts and 7 goals. However, in the last season in 2007–08 Serie B, Noselli made 11 starts in 22 appearances. He also scored twice only. Noselli wore no.32 shirt in his 3 seasons in second division. Sassuolo Noselli joined second division newcomer Sassuolo in August 2008 for undisclosed fee, wearing no.18. Noselli also re-joined former team-mate Nicola Donazzan. Noselli scored an impressive 16 Serie B goals, his career high. His attacking partners, Riccardo Zampagna, Gaetano Masucci, Horacio Erpen, scored 11 goals, 4 goals and 3 goals respectively. Noselli also made Sanmarinese internationals Andy Selva became his backup. Coach Stefano Pioli used either 4–3–3 formation or 4–3–1–2 formation in 2009–10 Serie B. Noselli was the team top-scorer again with 18 goals. In the playoffs Noselli lost to Torino again. Coach used Quadrini – Martinetti – Noselli (Zampagna) in the formation against Turin. Noselli lost his starting place in 2010–11 Serie B. Neither Masucci nor Noselli were the favourite of the coach. Noselli only made 14 starts in half-season. Daniele Arrigoni (and later Angelo Gregucci) used Martinetti and Quadrini as the starting forwards, plus Masucci and Noselli compete the last place. In January 2011 Masucci left the club and Noselli did not play any more game for the club, (due to injury), instead Salvatore Bruno entered the starting XI. Under care-taker Paolo Mandelli, the coach used 4–4–2 formation, with Andrea Catellani as right winger. Noselli did not enter the starting XI either under new coach Fulvio Pea. Pea used 3–5–2 formation. Noselli also injured in November. New York Cosmos Noselli signed for NASL club New York Cosmos on 17 July 2013. ==International career== Noselli represented Italy internationally at youth level. He was capped for the Italy U-16 team in friendlies to prepare for the team's 1997 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship qualification campaign. However Noselli failed to play in the qualifier. ==Honours== Club ;New York Cosmos *NASL 2013 Fall Champions *NASL Soccer Bowl 2013 ==References * Football.it Profile * Lega Serie B Profile * FIGC Category:Italian footballers Category:Italian expatriate footballers Category:Italy youth international footballers Category:Serie B players Category:Serie C players Category:North American Soccer League players Category:Udinese Calcio players Category:A.S.D.

The selectors decided on a second race. The composite eight won the second race. The selectors decided that a third race should take place the following day. It was claimed that the headwind benefited the newer composite eight crew who were heavier. Therefore, the third race of 1,500 metres was rowed at Holme Pierrepont, Nottingham in the opposite direction in a tailwind. It was possible to race the course \\"backwards\\" as the National Championships had finished the day before. The composite eight again won, this time by 1/3 length. The first Junior composite eight raced at Villach, Austria, 1976. After this year all GB Junior eights were composites of schools and clubs. After 1982 all GB Junior crews were composite and selected as result of extensive national junior squad trials, overseen by an ARA appointed International chief Junior Coach . == Origins of the Concept == The concept of the junior composite system was taken from a conversation with a German rowing coach in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1975. == External links == *Natchamps website Winners Book 1976 showing Emanuel School as winners of the National Championships *Natchamps website Winners Book 1977 showing the second junior composite eight with 6 different schools / clubs winning at the National Championships Category:Rowing in the United Kingdom ","title":"History of the GB Junior Rowing Composite System"},{"id":"35197754","text":"Daniel T. Willingham (born 1961) is a psychologist at the University of Virginia, where he is a professor in the Department of Psychology. Willingham's research focuses on the application of findings from cognitive psychology and neuroscience to K–12 education. Willingham earned his BA from Duke University and his PhD under William Kaye Estes and Stephen Kosslyn in Cognitive Psychology from Harvard University. During the 1990s and into the early 2000s, his research focused on the brain mechanisms supporting learning, the question of whether different forms of memory are independent of one another and how these hypothetical systems might interact. Since 2002, Willingham has written the \\"Ask the Cognitive Scientist\\" column for the American Educator published by the American Federation of Teachers. In 2009, he published Why Don't Students Like School, which received positive coverage in The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Willingham is known as a proponent of the use of scientific knowledge in classroom teaching and in education policy. He has sharply criticized learning styles theories as unsupported and has cautioned against the empty application of neuroscience in education. He has advocated for teaching students scientifically proven study habits, and for a greater focus on the importance of knowledge in driving reading comprehension. In his book, \\"Why Don't Students Like School?\\" he provides nine fundamental principles than can effectively be applied to classroom use by teachers in an effort to help them understand how students' minds work, and to show how to use that knowledge to be a better teacher. He suggests it is more useful to view the human species as bad at thinking rather than as cognitively gifted. He argues the brain is not designed for thinking, it's designed to save you from having to think. He states in his book that this is because thinking is slow, effortful, and uncertain. Instead, we often rely on memory for the vast majority of decisions we make, and while memory is not always reliable, it is much more reliable than having to stop and think about every single step of every decision you need to make (for example, driving a car). He also suggests, despite the fact that our brains are not very good at thinking, we actually like to think. He reaffirms the well known idea that humans are naturally curious. However, the conditions have to be just right for curiosity to take hold (not too easy, not too hard) similar to Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development. For example, a joke is always funnier when you get it without needing it to be explained. He suggests this is because of the dopamine released by the brain's natural reward system whenever we solve a problem. In 2005 and 2007 , he published \\"Current Directions in Cognitive Science\\" and \\"Curr Dir&how; Thk Psychig\\" with Barbara Spellman. ==Books== *Cognition: The Thinking Animal (3 editions: 2001, 2004, 2007: Prentice Hall) *Current Directions in Cognitive Science (Ed., with Barbara Spellman: 2005: Prentice Hall) *Curr Dir&how; Thk Psychig (2007; Barbara Spellman) *Why Don't Students Like School?

Self-portrait. ==Life== He was born in Carlisle about 1738, and became a pupil of Thomas Frye, with whom he entered into partnership in 1761. Pether was a fellow of the Incorporated Society of Artists, and contributed to its exhibitions paintings, miniatures, and engravings from 1764 to 1777. He was also an occasional exhibitor with the Free Society and the Royal Academy. He had many pupils, including Henry Edridge and Edward Dayes. He often changed his residence from London to the provinces and back again; and gradually sank into obscurity and neglect. At the beginning of the 19th century Pether appears to have settled at Bristol, where he made a living as a drawing-master and picture-cleaner; and there he engraved portraits of Edward Colston the slave trader and Bristol benefactor, after Jonathan Richardson the Elder, and Samuel Syer, the historian of Bristol (1816). Pether died in Montague Street, Bristol, on 19 July 1821, aged 82 or 83, having long been forgotten in the art world. ==Works== Pether, 1762 portrait of George III, after Thomas Frye. In 1762 he engraved Frye's portrait of George III in three sizes, and during the following fifteen years executed engravings after English, Dutch, and Italian masters, especially Rembrandt and Joseph Wright of Derby, with strong effects of light and shade. His plates of The Jewish Bride, 1763, Jewish Rabbi, 1764, Officer of State, 1764, and Lord of the Vineyard, 1766, after Rembrandt, and A Lecture on the Orrery, 1768, Drawing from the Gladiator, 1769, The Hermit, 1770, and The Alchymist, 1775, after Wright, were noted as mezzotint work. Pether engraved altogether about fifty plates, some of which were published by John Boydell, but the majority by himself at various addresses in London. Pether was also a miniaturist, and painted some life-sized portraits in oil, three of which—Sarah Bates the singer, the brothers Smith of Chichester, and himself in Spanish dress—he also engraved. In 1777 he sent his own portrait with the disguised title, Don Mailliw Rehtep. His last plate published in London is dated 1793, and he exhibited at the Royal Academy for the last time in 1794. ==References== * ;Attribution Category:1738 births Category:1821 deaths Category:English engravers Category:People from Carlisle, Cumbria ","title":"William Pether"},{"id":"35197853","text":"The 2012 Virginia Tech Hokies football team represented Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in the 2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season.

The ministry was responsible for the foreign service, the country's international interests and foreign policy. Most of the ministry's portfolio is subordinate to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The prime operating agency for international development is the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. The position has been held by ten people representing five parties. The position was created with the appointment of Willoch's Second Cabinet on 8 June 1983, with Reidun Brusletten of the Christian Democratic Party appointed the first minister. From 1 January 1984 to 31 December 1989, the minister had their own ministry, the Ministry of Development Cooperation. Eleven people from four parties had held the position, with Hilde Frafjord Johnson of the Christian Democratic Party being the only to have held it twice. Erik Solheim of the Socialist Left Party has sat the longest, for six and a half years. Solheim also acted as Minister of the Environment from 18 October 2007 to his retirement. Heikki Holmås of the Socialist Left Party, who was appointed on 23 March 2012, became the last Minister of International Development when Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet resigned on 16 October 2013. In Solberg's Cabinet, issues related to international development were transferred to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The position was re-established in 2018 after the Liberal Party joined the Solberg Cabinet. ==Key== The following lists the minister, their party, date of assuming and leaving office, their tenure in years and days, and the cabinet they served in. ==Ministers== {class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" !

There are two coloration patterns found in this species, one uniformly reddish brown abdomen with a dark brown dorsal folium and the other grey abdomen bordered by a bright yellow band and a red dorsal folium. The holotype has the latter coloration pattern. This species is also noted for a highly variable genitalia, although differences do not appear to vary by collection site or coloration pattern. The continuous range of variation, together with genetic data, has led to all specimens being combined in one species. == Habitat == A. kohi builds basket webs in trees, generally at the tips of the branches.

Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision in which the Court upheld Congress' power to enact most provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly called Obamacare, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA), including a requirement for most Americans to have health insurance by 2014. The Acts represented a major set of changes to the American health care system that had been the subject of highly contentious debate, largely divided on political party lines. The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, upheld by a vote of 5 to 4 the individual mandate to buy health insurance as a constitutional exercise of Congress's taxing power. A majority of the justices, including Chief Justice Roberts, agreed that the individual mandate was not a proper use of Congress's Commerce Clause or Necessary and Proper Clause powers, though they did not join in a single opinion. A majority of the justices also agreed that another challenged provision of the Act, a significant expansion of Medicaid, was not a valid exercise of Congress's spending power as it would coerce states to either accept the expansion or risk losing existing Medicaid funding. ==Background== In March 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law. A number of parties sued, including the National Federation of Independent Business, claiming that the sweeping reform law was unconstitutional for various reasons. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to three cases, totaling 5½ hours of oral arguments: National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (which consolidated a part of Florida v. Dept. of Health and Human Services) on the issues of the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the severability of any unconstitutional provisions, Dept. of Health and Human Services v. Florida on the issue of whether review was barred by the Anti- Injunction Act, and Florida v. Dept. of Health and Human Services on the matter of the constitutionality of the Medicaid expansion. District Court proceedings The state of Florida filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Health and Human Services, challenging the constitutionality of the law. On January 31, 2011, Judge Roger Vinson ruled that the mandatory health insurance \\"individual mandate\\"—the provision of Internal Revenue Code section 5000A imposing a \\"shared responsibility penalty\\" on nearly all Americans who fail to purchase health insurance—was outside the power of Congress. Vinson also held that the mandate could not be severed from the rest of the Affordable Care Act and struck down the entire Act. Eleventh Circuit appeal thumbrightLawsuits Virginia and Oklahoma, also highlighted, were involved in similar lawsuits. The Department of Health and Human Services appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel issued a 2–1 ruling affirming Judge Vinson's findings in part and reversing in part. The court affirmed the District Court's holding that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but, contrary to the District Court's view, it held that the individual mandate could be severed, leaving the rest of the law intact.P. 15, slip op., National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, U.S. Sup. Ct. (June 28, 2012). The government decided to not seek en banc review from the full Circuit and instead petitioned the United States Supreme Court to review the Eleventh Circuit's rulings. Related cases Other federal courts heard cases related to the Affordable Care Act that were not directly reviewed by the Supreme Court, but caused a divide regarding the constitutionality of the law. Two federal judges appointed by President Bill Clinton upheld the individual mandate in 2010. Judge Jeffrey Sutton, a member of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals appointed by George W. Bush, was the first Republican-appointed judge to rule that the law is constitutional in June 2011, as part of a divided three-judge panel that upheld the constitutionality of the law.Thomas More Law Ctr. v. Obama, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 13265, 2011 WL 2556039 (6th Cir. Mich. 2011) ==Briefings and oral arguments== On November 14, 2011, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to portions of three cross-appeals of the Eleventh Circuit's opinion: one by the states (Florida v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Svcs.), one by the federal government (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Svcs. v. Florida); and one by the National Federation of Independent Business (Nat'l Fed. of Independent Bus. v. Sebelius). Oral arguments The Court announced in December 2011 that it would hear approximately six hours of oral argumentation over a three-day period, from Monday, March 26, to Wednesday, March 28, 2012, covering the various aspects being questioned by the principal parties involved in this and other related cases concerning the ACA. The court first heard argument on whether the Anti-Injunction Act, which limits suits \\"for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax\\", barred a decision before the ACA fully entered into force in 2014. Since neither the government, represented by Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, nor the states, represented that day by Gregory G. Katsas of the law firm Jones Day, were willing to defend that position (which had been accepted by three of the twelve appellate court judges that heard the cases)Think Progress: Ian Millhiser, \\"What The Heck Is The Tax Anti-Injunction Act?\\" March 23, 2012, accessed July 1, 2012, the Court appointed Robert Long of the law firm Covington & Burling as amicus curiae to defend that position. On the second day, the court heard arguments over whether the \\"individual mandate\\" component of the ACA fell under the constitutional powers of Congress. The states (Florida et al.) were represented during the hearings by former Bush administration Solicitor General Paul Clement while the government was represented by current Solicitor General Donald Verrilli. On the morning of the third day, the Court considered the issue of severability—whether the Affordable Care Act could survive if the Court struck down the individual mandate. Paul Clement, Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler, and Court-appointed amicus curiae H. Bartow Farr, III of the law firm Farr & Taranto argued their various positions before the Court. On the afternoon of the third day, the Court considered whether the Medicaid expansion the Affordable Care Act instituted was coercive. Both Paul Clement and Donald Verilli again argued before the Court. Chief Justice Roberts extended the time limit for both parties by 15 minutes during the arguments. Solicitor General Verrilli's performance during the hearings was widely criticized by analysts. ==Outcome== Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion nominally upholding the Affordable Care Act but overturning one section as exceeding Congress's spending authority. The case generated a complex division on the bench. With respect to the Anti-Injunction Act and individual mandate penalty, judgment was for the Secretary of Health and Human Services. With respect to the Medicaid expansion, judgment was for the challenging states. #All the justices were in rough agreement that the Anti-Injunction Act did not apply. Five justices (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan) joined an opinion as to this. #One combination of five justices (Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito) were of the opinion that the individual mandate was within the scope of neither Congress's Commerce Clause nor Necessary and Proper Clause powers. But as four of them did not concur in the judgment, their votes could not count toward a controlling opinion. #A separate combination of five justices (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan) held the individual mandate was a valid exercise of Congress's taxing power. As these five justices concurred in judgment and agreed to the same parts of Chief Justice Roberts's opinion, this was the binding and controlling majority as to this aspect of the case. #As the individual mandate was upheld, the issue of its severability from the rest of the Affordable Care Act was not reached. #A final combination of seven justices (Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan) concurred in judgment that the Medicaid expansion of the Affordable Care Act, in combination with existing statutes, amounted to an unconstitutionally coercive use of Congress's spending power. However, those seven justices were divided as to the appropriate legal remedy. Opinion of the Court Chief Justice Roberts authored an opinion, of which three parts gained the assent of five justices (Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan) and became the opinion of the Court, and one part which gained the assent of a plurality (Roberts, Breyer, and Kagan) and became part of the holding. Those parts of Roberts's opinion that gained the assent of five justices were Parts I, II, and III-C. Part I recounted the facts and procedural history of the cases. Part II concerned the applicability of the Anti-Injunction Act to the individual mandate penalty. Part III-C held that, for constitutional purposes, the individual mandate penalty was a valid exercise of Congress's taxing power. Tax Anti-Injunction Act The Anti-Injunction Act prohibits federal courts from enjoining agencies of the federal government from collecting a tax while a challenge to the tax is pending. Congress's motivation in passing the act was to prevent the starvation of the federal treasury while tax issues are being litigated before the courts. Instead, Congress requires a taxpayer who challenges any tax to first pay that tax, and only afterwards is the taxpayer allowed to bring suit and seek a refund. Challengers of the Affordable Care Act maintained that the individual mandate's enforcement mechanism was not a tax. The Court agreed. Because the Affordable Care Act labels the individual mandate's shared responsibility payment as a \\"penalty\\" instead of a \\"tax,\\" it prevents the penalty from being treated as a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act. Congress's taxing power Taking a functional view to the individual mandate penalty, the Court held that it was a tax for constitutional purposes.Pp. 39–50, slip op., National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, U.S. Sup. Ct. (June 28, 2012). The Court noted that the label of the individual mandate shared responsibility payment as a penalty for the purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act did not control whether it was a tax for purposes of constitutional analysis.P. 33, slip op., National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, U.S. Sup. Ct. (June 28, 2012). The Court asserted that the individual mandate penalty, in its practical operation, exhibited all the characteristics of a tax—the penalty \\"looks like a tax in many respects.\\" That is, the individual mandate penalty had all of the following features of a tax: #payment went to the U.S. Treasury when taxpayers filed their tax returns; #the amount of the penalty was determined by factors such as the individual's taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing status; #the penalty was found in the Internal Revenue Code, and enforced by the Internal Revenue Service in the same manner as taxes are collected; and #the penalty produced some revenue for the government. Further, the Court reasoned, while the penalty is treated as a tax for constitutional purposes, it is not a direct tax, and therefore is not required to be apportioned among the states according to population.P. 41, slip op., National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, U.S. Sup. Ct. (June 28, 2012). Here the Court concluded that \\"[a] tax on going without health insurance does not fall within any recognized category of direct tax ... The shared responsibility payment is thus not a direct tax that must be apportioned among the several States.\\" Finally, the individual mandate penalty operated within the constraints of even the narrowest reading of the taxing power, which disallows punitive taxation: #the upper limit of the penalty was not so high as to become coercive since it was capped by statute to never be more than the cost of obtaining insurance;P. 35, slip op., National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, U.S. Sup. Ct. (June 28, 2012). #the penalty had no scienter element typical of punitive statutes;P. 36, slip op., National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, U.S. Sup. Ct. (June 28, 2012). and #while the penalty was collected by the IRS, any failure to pay the penalty would not result in criminal prosecution. As Chief Justice Roberts concluded for the Court: Plurality holding As stated above, seven justices agreed in judgment for the states against the Department of Health and Human Services on the issue of the Medicaid expansion, but no opinion among them obtained the assent of five justices. At issue were amendments to the Social Security Act contained in Title X of the Affordable Care Act. These amendments, in expanding Medicaid coverage, made changes to the plan requirements states must meet in their Medicaid plans. The 1965 amendments to the Social Security Act that created Medicaid authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services to withhold federal payments to state Medicaid plans that were not in compliance with statutory requirements. The seven justices were in agreement that the Secretary's existing ability to withhold all funds from non-compliant plans, coupled with the substantial coverage changes enacted by the Title X amendments, amounted to an unconstitutionally coercive use of Congress's spending power, given that Congress was not going to cover the full cost of the Medicaid expansion after 2016. Where the justices differed was in what they thought constituted the appropriate legal remedy. Four justices (Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito) believed the Title X amendments should be struck down due to their impermissibly coercive nature. The remaining three justices (Roberts, Breyer, and Kagan) instead opted to exercise the existing severability clause (codified at 42 USC §1303) in the Social Security Act, as amended, holding that the ability given to the Secretary by statute to withhold federal payments could not be applied to the Title X amendments for those states refusing to participate in the Medicaid expansion.slip op., opinion of Roberts, CJ, Part IV, at 55–58. Since this latter opinion concurred in the judgment on the narrowest ground (i.e., severing only part of the application of the law instead of striking all of the amendments), the three-justice plurality became the controlling opinion under the rule set out by Marks v. United States (1977). ==Other opinions==  Chief Justice Roberts' opinion  Chief Justice Roberts, writing only for himself, would have held that Congress's power to \\"regulate Commerce\\" (the \\"Commerce Clause\\" Art. I, §8, cl. 3) does not extend to the regulation of economic inactivity.P. 41–42, slip op., National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, U.S. Sup. Ct. (June 28, 2012). Regarding the argument that the mandate penalizes or taxes \\"inactivity\\", Roberts wrote: Further, Roberts would have held that the individual mandate was unsupported by the Necessary and Proper Clause (Art. I, §8, cl. 18).See supra, slip op., at 33–36. Chief Justice Roberts concluded: Justice Ginsburg's concurrence/dissent Justice Ginsburg concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part. Joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, she would have upheld the individual mandate under the Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause:See supra, slip op., at 81. Further, joined only by Sotomayor, she dissented on striking down the Medicaid expansion penalty, arguing that it was within Congress's power under the Spending Clause:See supra, slip op., at 124. Ginsburg's dissent went on to highlight the implications of the majority's finding that the federal government's threat of taking away existing funding from states unwilling to implement Medicaid expansion left states with no \\"legitimate choice\\". Joint dissent Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito joined an unsigned dissent that argued the individual mandate was unconstitutional because it represented an attempt by Congress to regulate beyond its power under the Commerce Clause.See supra, slip op., at 143. Further, they argued that reclassifying the Individual Mandate as a tax rather than a penalty in order to sustain its constitutionality was not to interpret the statute but to rewrite it, which they deemed a troubling exercise of judicial power:See supra, slip op., at 144 and 151. The dissent also disputed Justice Ginsburg's claim that the court's opinion failed \\"to explain why the individual mandate threatens our constitutional order\\":See supra, slip op., at 100 and 140. Finally, the joint dissent argued that since the ACA exceeded its constitutional powers in both compelling the purchase of health insurance and in denying non-consenting States Medicaid funding, the whole statute should have been deemed inoperative because the two parts were central to the statute's design and operation.See supra, slip op., at 129–130. The joint dissent mentioned that \\"the Constitution requires tax increases to originate in the House of Representatives\\" per the Origination Clause,Fisher, Daniel. \\"Obamacare Dissents Poke Holes In Roberts' Reasoning\\", Forbes (June 29, 2012). though that issue was not addressed by the majority opinion.Eastman, John. \\"Hidden Gems in the Historical 2011-2012 Term, and Beyond \\", Charleston Law Review, Vol. 7, p. 19 (2012). Justice Thomas's dissent In a one-paragraph dissent, Justice Thomas emphasized his long-held belief that the Supreme Court's precedents have broadened Congress's powers under the Commerce Clause in a manner \\"inconsistent with the original understanding of Congress's powers and with this Court's early Commerce Clause cases\\". Thomas wrote that he agreed with Roberts' interpretation of precedents allowing Congress to use the Commerce Clause to regulate \\"the channels of interstate commerce\\" and the \\"persons or things in interstate commerce\\" and disallowing the regulation of commercial inactivity. However, he disagreed with the court's third, \\"substantial effects\\" test as established by Wickard v. Filburn, articulated within United States v. Morrison, and strengthened by Gonzales v. Raich. ==Reaction and commentary== Media coverage The Court convened on the morning of June 28, 2012, to announce its decisions on the ACA and two other cases; it announced its ruling on the ACA shortly after 10:00 am EDT. CNN and Fox News initially reported that the individual mandate was found unconstitutional, but corrected themselves within minutes. President Obama initially heard from CNN and Fox News that the mandate had been found unconstitutional, but then heard the correct information shortly thereafter. Speculation over Roberts' vote Immediately following the decision, there was speculation that the joint dissent was the original internal majority opinion, and that Chief Justice Roberts' vote changed some time between March and the public issuance of the decision. On July 1, 2012, CBS News, citing unnamed sources within the Court, said that over the course of internal deliberations Roberts changed his position from striking down the mandate to upholding it. The article, written by journalist Jan Crawford, reported that during the Court's private conference immediately after the oral arguments, Roberts was inclined to strike down the mandate but, in disagreement with the other four conservative justices, was not certain this required striking down the law in its entirety. News articles in May 2012 that warned of potential \\"damage to the court—and to Roberts' reputation—if the court were to strike down the mandate\\" increased the external pressure on Roberts, who \\"is keenly aware of his leadership role on the court [and] is sensitive to how the court is perceived by the public\\", and pays more attention to media coverage of the Court than some of his colleagues. It was around this time that Roberts decided to uphold the law. One of the conservative justices reportedly pressed Roberts to explain why he had changed his view on the mandate, but was \\"unsatisfied with the response\\". On July 2, Adam Liptak of The New York Times insinuated that the leak could have come from Justice Thomas, as Liptak pointed out that Crawford has long had a relationship with Thomas, granting rare interviews and Thomas singled her out as his favorite reporter, saying \\"There are wonderful people out here who do a good job—do a fantastic job—like Jan [Crawford].\\" Some observers have suggested Roberts' philosophy of judicial restraint or the lack of Supreme Court precedents available \\"to say the individual mandate crossed a constitutional line\\" played a part in his decision. The article reported that after Roberts \\"withstood a month-long, desperate campaign to bring him back to his original position\\", with Kennedy, who is typically the swing vote in 5–4 decisions, leading the effort, the conservatives essentially told him \\"You're on your own.\\" The conservative dissent was unsigned and did not, despite efforts by Roberts to convince them to do so, make any attempt to join the Court's opinion, an unusual situation in which the four justices \\"deliberately ignored Roberts' decision, the sources said, as if they were no longer even willing to engage with him in debate\\". In 2019 it was reported that Roberts had originally voted to invalidate the individual mandate and uphold the Medicaid expansion requirement. He believed that the Constitution's commerce clause never was intended to cover inactivity, such as the refusal to buy insurance. But he was uneasy with the political division in the vote tally and also did not want to invalidate the entire law because he thought the individual mandate was only inseverable from \\"community rating\\" and \\"guarantee issue\\" provisions of the law. Due to this impasse he explored the argument that the individual mandate could be upheld as a tax and invalidating the Medicaid expansion. Breyer and Kagan had previously voted to uphold the Medicaid expansion, but decided to switch and join Roberts' opinion on that section. Political reactions Then President Obama's comments on the Supreme Court's ruling President Obama praised the decision in a series of remarks, while discussing the benefits of the legislation in a statement shortly after the decision. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said that Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a longtime proponent of health care reform who died before the bill became law, could now \\"rest.\\" The ruling quickly became a rallying cry for Republicans who criticized the Supreme Court's reasoning and vowed to repeal the ACA. Though they had already repeatedly attempted to do so starting in January 2011, they were unsuccessful in enacting a repeal. Conservatives quickly seized on the fact that Obama and the bill's proponents insisted repeatedly throughout the protracted political debate 2009 and 2010 that the mandate was not a tax, but the Supreme Court upheld it on the grounds that it was a tax. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said he would repeal the bill, as did Speaker of the House John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Several state attorneys general who challenged the law stated that they were disappointed with the Supreme Court's ultimate decision but happy that in doing so, the Court limited the powers of Congress under the commerce clause. Several state Republican officials indicated their desire to utilize the option granted to them by the Supreme Court to not further expand Medicaid. The American Medical Association, the National Physicians Alliance, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Association of American Medical Colleges said that the ruling was a victory. The New York Times reported the ruling \\"may secure Obama's place in history\\". Academic commentary The New York Times reported that the court's ruling was the most significant federalism decision since the New Deal. It reported in this respect about the new limits the ruling placed on federal regulation of commerce and about the conditions the federal government may impose on money it gives the states. With respect to the Commerce Clause, the Court ruled that the federal government had no permission to force individuals not engaged in commercial activities to buy services they did not want. With respect to the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court held that the ACA's requirement that states rapidly extend coverage to new beneficiaries or lose existing federal payments was unduly coercive. The health-care law had to allow states to choose between participating in the expansion while receiving additional payments, or forgoing the expansion and retaining existing payments. Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, the first to challenge the ACA in federal court, praised the limits the Court placed on federal regulation of commerce and on the conditions the federal government could impose on money it gives the states. Georgetown Law professor Randy Barnett stated that by invalidating the withholding of existing Medicaid funding as unconstitutionally coercive the Supreme Court found an enforceable limit on the Spending Power of the federal government. This limit on the Spending Power of the federal government is part of Neal K. Katyal's ruling analysis. Law professor Neal K. Katyal at Georgetown University, who served as acting solicitor general of the United States and argued the health care cases at the appellate level, argued that the Supreme Court ruling could change the relationship between the federal government and the states because of \\"the existence of an extraconstitutional limit\\" on the federal government's power under the Spending Clause. Katyal said that until now it had been understood that when the federal government gave money to a state in exchange for the state's doing something, the federal government was free to do so as long as a reasonable relationship existed between the federal funds and the act the federal government wanted the state to perform. He then referred to the Court holding that the ACA's requirement that states rapidly extend Medicaid coverage to new beneficiaries or lose existing federal payments was unduly coercive by noting that the court found that \\"such a threat is coercive and that the states cannot be penalized for not expanding their Medicaid coverage after receiving funds. And it does so in the context of Medicaid, which Congress created and can alter, amend or abolish at any time. ... This was the first significant loss for the federal government's spending power in decades. The fancy footwork that the court employed to view the act as coercive could come back in later cases to haunt the federal government. Many programs are built on the government's spending power, and the existence of an extraconstitutional limit on that power is a worrisome development.\\" Katyal also mentioned that the federal government told the court that long-standing laws contain clauses that condition money on state performance of certain activities. \\"The decision leaves open the question of whether those acts, and many others (like the Clean Air Act), are now unconstitutional as well.\\" However Reuters reported later that Katyal reversed his opinion and stated that he didn't see any litigation coming out of the Supreme Court holding in the near term. In the same direction as Katyal argues Kevin Russell, who teaches Supreme Court litigation at Harvard and Stanford Law Schools and clerked for Judge William Norris of the Ninth Circuit and Justice Stephen Breyer. According to him several significant civil rights statutes, enacted under Congress's Spending Power, are at risk to be unconstitutional, because the Court held that Congress exceeded its Spending Clause authority by forcing states into an all-or-nothing choice by threatening to revoke all of their Medicaid funding if they did not participate in the Medicaid expansion. Russell remembers that a decade ago several states made challenges to a number of important civil rights statutes that condition receipt of federal funds on the state's agreement to abide by non-discrimination principles in the federally funded programs. \\"These statutes include Title IX (sex discrimination in federally funded education programs), Title IV (race discrimination in any federally funded program), and the Rehabilitation Act (disability discrimination in federally funded programs). States argued that by threatening to take away all of a program's funds if the State's didn't agree to abide by these statutes, Congress was engaging in unconstitutional coercion.\\" David B. Kopel, an adjunct professor of constitutional law at University of Denver, said that Supreme Court ruling is the court's most important ruling in defining the limits of Congress's power under the Spending Clause, because this clause must, like Congress's other powers, conform to the principles of state sovereignty that are embodied in the United States Constitution, the Tenth Amendment and Eleventh Amendment. According to him this has a tremendous impact on state budgets: \\"Today (and from now on!), states do not need to provide Medicaid to able-bodied childless adults. Likewise, states today have discretion about whether to provide Medicaid to middle-class parents. Undoubtedly, some states will choose to participate in the ACA's massive expansion of medical welfare, but fiscally responsible states now have the choice not to.\\" University of Michigan law professor Samuel Bagenstos told The Atlantic that the Court's holding on the Medicaid Expansion could be a landmark decision in federalism jurisprudence, if the Medicaid issue were not in the same case as the individual mandate. He deemed it \\"a big deal\\" that the Supreme Court has for the first time struck down a condition on federal spending on the grounds that it coerced the states. In his opinion this means that a number of federal statutes that had not really been subject to effective legal challenge before can now be challenged by the states. Public opinion Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind conducted research on the public's constitutional perspective by asking registered voters about key legal issues brought up by PPACA litigation through two surveys based upon a random sampling of the United States population. The authors, Bruce G. Peabody and Peter J. Woolley contend that, through public response on this case, that despite claims of an ignorant and uninformed public, the masses can be confident, properly conflicted, and principled when considering major controversies and dilemmas. Rather than polling the public on raw personal opinion, the study conducted inquired into the random voters legal judgement on PPACA constitutionality. For example, 56% of Americans (as of February 2012) deemed that Congress does not have the legal right to require everyone to have health insurance, while 34% believed that such a mandate was legally permissible. ==Subsequent cases== Sebelius was the centerpoint of the third legal challenge to the PPACA to reach the Supreme Court in California v. Texas, to be heard in the 2020-21 term. In 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that reduced the health insurance requirement of the PPACA to from 2019 onward, effectively eliminating the individual mandate. Texas and several states sued the federal government, arguing on the basis of Sebelius that with mandate eliminated, the entire PPACA was unconstitutional. A district court agreed with this, which was upheld on a challenge by California and other states to the Fifth Circuit, stepping in when the government declined to challenge the ruling. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case to consider not only if the elimination of the individual mandate makes the ACA unconstitutional, but factors related to the severability of the individual mandate from other provisions in the PPACA, as well as whether California has standing. ==See also== * 2011 term opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States * Sebelius v.

A let's play (LP) is a video (or screenshots accompanied by text) documenting the playthrough of a video game, usually including commentary or a camera view of the gamer's face. A let's play differs from a video game walkthrough or strategy guide by focusing on an individual's subjective experience with the game, often with humorous, irreverent, or critical commentary from the gamer, rather than being an objective source of information on how to progress through the game. While let's plays and live streaming of game playthroughs are related, let's plays tend to be curated experiences that include editing and narration, can be scripted, while streaming is an unedited experience performed on the fly. ==History== From the onset of computer video entertainment, video game players with access to screenshot capture software, video capture devices, and screen recording software have recorded themselves playing through games, often as part of walkthroughs, longplays, speedruns or other entertainment form. For example, the Japanese television program GameCenter CX had the host challenged to complete retro games within a single day, and others like Skip Rodgers had provided VHS tapes describing to players how to complete difficult games. One such form these took was the addition of running commentary, typically humorous in nature, along with the screenshots or videos; video-based playthroughs would typically be presented without significant editing to maintain the raw response the players had to the game. The presenter would also often poll the readers or viewers to certain in-game decisions as to provide an element of interactivity for longer games. Though others had used the same approach at the time, the forums at the website Something Awful are credited with coming up with the term \\"Let's Play\\" in 2007 to describe such playthroughs. The exact origins of the term are unclear, but believed to be in reference to a screenshot playthrough of The Oregon Trail via the Something Awful forums sometime in 2005; the playthrough can no longer be found on the site, but has been referenced by other forum threads. The format of let's plays is credited to Something Awful forum user Michael Sawyer under his username alias \\"slowbeef\\". Sawyer stated that the format he adopted came from an earlier playthrough by forum user \\"Vlaphor\\" for I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream. Sawyer's adaption would become the format that future Something Awful users would subsequently use. Sawyer is also credited for creating the first video playthrough for the game The Immortal which he made alongside his screenshot playthrough. From there, the format was popular with other forum users and many let's plays were created; the forum established a process to create these and the development of a large archive of let's plays. With the onset of user-created video streaming websites like YouTube and Twitch, more users have been able to prepare and share such videos, making the Let's Play format widely popular, spreading beyond the Something Awful forums. ==Contemporary== alt=Felix Kjellberg, A.K.A PewDiePie is seen at a convention. Let's play videos are similar to a player completing a game via streaming video for an audience. According to Patrick Lee of The A.V. Club, a good let's play video distinguishes itself from straightforward streaming playthroughs when the player has sufficiently familiarized themselves with the game as to be able to offer better commentary and show off more of the game to their audience, is able to provide the audience with personal recollections about the game, or can play through a game they have already completed under self- imposed challenges, such as completing a game without killing any enemies. Through this approach, Lee states, such let's play videos serve to help memorialize these games, helping those who may not have access to the titles (due to age or regional restrictions) to appreciate more obscure games. Some of the more popular gamers that create these videos have become internet celebrities and seen as a type of \\"professional fan\\", according to Maker Studios' Dar Nothaft; other gamers tune into these videos to get a different perspective on games rather than professional review sources. Felix Kjellberg, known by his online pseudonym PewDiePie, has monetized his \\"let's play\\" videos which reach over 100 million subscribers and over 25 billion views, . PewDiePie's influence on game sales has been considerable, and games that are featured in let's plays on his channel frequently see large boosts in sales, creating what is called \\"the PewDiePie effect\\". Some other people or groups include Achievement Hunter, The Yogscast, Smosh Games, Jacksepticeye, Markiplier, DanTDM, Game Grumps, Stampylonghead, and Machinima.com. Such let's plays are monetized by ad revenue from the video hosting site. For example, standard Google affiliate programs pay approximately 55% of the price paid by advertisers to the content provider, while Google retains the rest; as such, revenue from let's play channel are based on the number of viewers they obtain. Providers can also join various content networks like Maker Studios, which offer promotion and advertising for content providers in exchange for a share of the ad revenue. PewDiePie's monthly revenue from his let's plays are estimated to be between $140,000 and $1.4 million, while smaller channels can still earn between $500 and $1000 a month; the Wall Street Journal reported that PewDiePie made over $4 million in 2013, while Forbes ranked him the highest earning YouTube personality in 2015, earning over $12 million a year before taxes. As of 2018, some of these top earners made between a year. Several of these individual let's players, as they are called, have transformed this into a full-time career while learning skills such as communications and video editing that can be used for future jobs. More popular broadcasters often share part of their revenue for charitable efforts, or hold charity drives while they play through games for a live audience. PewDiePie's contribution in this area led to him being listing as one of thirty most influential people on the internet in a March 2015 list, and as one of the top 100 influential people overall in an April 2016 list, both compiled by Time magazine. Business Insider reported that eleven of the top twenty most-subscribed, independent YouTube publishers as of November 2014 are those that produce let's play videos. An October 2017 report from SuperData Researched estimated that between let's play videos and live streaming content of game video content, there were more people watching such videos than compared to all subscribers of HBO, Netflix, ESPN and Hulu combined, with over 517 million YouTube users and 185 million Twitch users. Let's play videos have been considered a favorable way to market game titles, in particularly for smaller developers. In one case for Thomas Was Alone, Mike Bithell, its developer, attributed the success of the game to a Let's Play video by game commentator and critic John Bain, also known as TotalBiscuit. Similarly, Davey Wreden, the developer of The Stanley Parable developed a relationship with various let's play channels prior to the release to assure they could play and record his game; his team further created specialized demos for two popular channels (Rev3Games and Steam Train) that jokingly teased the specific players. Wreden believes this helped lead to the over 100,000 sales of the full game within the first three days of release. Some developers have designed their games to be favorable for let's play videos. The developers of Octodad: Dadliest Catch aimed to have the game covered by let's play videos by \\"creat[ing] a lot of room where there are a lot of different options for a player to create their own comedy and put their own personality into that\\". The popularity of let's play and similar video commentaries have also led to changes in how some video games have been developed. The Let's Play approach favors games that are quirky and idiosyncratic that draw viewer attention, making some developers aim for these qualities in their games. It also helps for games in early access or beta release cycles as developers from such games can use these videos for feedback to improve their games prior to full release. The Let's Play videos also can bring in more attention to a niche title than traditional gaming press. The developers behind PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Hello Neighbor, rather than try to aim for attracting attention from the major let's play creators like PewDiePie, instead used an approach of gaining interest from several mid-level creators to help with drawing attention to their games during their early access period, with considerable success. Some games such as Goat Simulator and I am Bread are considered by critics and players to have been purposely made to be the subject of let's plays on popular channels as to drive interest in an otherwise-lackluster game, and are usually derided as \\"YouTube bait\\". Survival horror games, such as Five Nights at Freddy's and its sequels, which focus more on immersion than skill, are considered tailor-made to take advantage of let's play videos and other live-streaming play, as the games' design is aimed to shock the streaming users, providing humorous reactions such as jump scares that are a source of entertainment for viewers. This also provides a way for people who would not normally play such games for the discomfort of being scared by the game to find enjoyment in watching the reaction someone else has while playing it. The developers of both Amnesia: The Dark Descent and Outlast stated that let's plays of their games helps to make them successful considering that in neither case did they have a large promotional budget. In at least one case, the popularity of a game featured in let's plays has led to further sales far after the game's typical shelf-life has expired. In 2014, Electronic Arts opted to print more copies of the 2010 title Skate 3 after its appearance on PewDiePie's and other Let's Play channels have kept sales of the game high, keeping it in the top 40 sales charts for new games in the United Kingdom and with its 2014 sales being 33% higher than its 2013 sales. Let's plays can also be seen harming a game's distribution particularly for short, linear, narrative-driven games, since viewers can witness the entire game from a Let's Play recording without purchasing it and have no incentive to purchase the title. For the art game That Dragon, Cancer, its developer Ryan Green noted that while there were let's plays of the game, several which commented emotionally on the game's topic, some of these playthroughs had simply played through the game without added commentary, and provided no links to where players could learn more about the title. Green and his team at Numinous Games had used YouTube's content ID to have some of these videos taken down, a result that brought some complaints and which Green admitted later was not the right approach to address the issue. Green requested that with games such as That Dragon, Cancer, that those creating let's play use the playthrough of the game to initiate conversations with their viewers, and that viewers could show their appreciation of the game by tipping the developers in lieu of purchasing the full title. The phenomenon of Let's Plays was a focal point for the South Park episode \\"#REHASH\\". Double Fine Productions and 2 Player Productions have worked together to create a series called \\"Devs Play\\", inspired by let's plays where game developers play through games and offer their commentary from a developer's perspective, typically alongside one of the developers from the selected game. == Legal issues == Copyright The copyright nature of \\"let's play\\" videos remains in question; while the developer and/or publisher of games typically possess the copyright and granted exclusive distribution rights on the media assets of the game, others cite fair use claims for these works as their nature is to provide commentary on the video game. An important distinction for Let's Plays to qualify as fair use would be their transformative nature; the more that the Let's Play creator or streamer adds as commentary atop the gameplay, the more likely that it would be ruled as fair use. However, copyright law favors the game developer or publisher; if challenged, the Let's Play creator would have to argue in court for a fair use defense, which can be costly to pursue, and to date, there have been no known cases of let's plays challenged in legal systems, keeping their legal nature in question. Sites that host user-created let's plays tend to favor the copyright holders to maintain their safe harbor status as part of their liability protection within the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA); for example, YouTube uses both manual and automated systems to detect copyright infringement and issues copyright strikes to offending channels. In one case, Nintendo claimed that they retain the copyright and have registered the content through YouTube's Content ID system such that they can generate ad revenue from user videos, though Nintendo would later back off of such claims, and later created its own affiliate program, the Nintendo Creators program, between themselves, Google, and proactive uploaders to split profits. Smaller developers have been more open to allowing let's play videos. Ubisoft has stated that it allows its games to be used in let's play videos and allows for those making them to monetize from any ad revenue as long they stay within certain content-appropriateness guidelines. Microsoft Studios similarly created a set of game content usage rules that sets certain requirements and limitations on those using its software for let's play videos. In early December 2013, a change in YouTube's ContentID policy caused many existing let's play and other video-game related material to be blocked. In response, many developers and publishers issued statements and worked with YouTube to assure such videos were not meant to be blocked, helping those whose videos were affected, and encouraging users to continue to show these; these companies included Blizzard, Ubisoft, Capcom, Paradox Interactive, and Valve. YouTube later clarified that the change in the content ID system that caused videos to be flagged was likely a result of new tools it made available for multi-channel networks, which can cover separate video and audio copyrights. At least two known music multi-channel networks, TuneCore and INDmusic, who represent many video game music composers and artists, had automatically enabled the copyright protection for all of its clients without seeking their input, and as such, many of the let's play videos as well as the game developers' own promotional videos were blocked due to these actions. YouTube states they do not plan to change this system despite complaints from the original music composers. The streaming website Twitch implemented a similar copyright control approach that would mute recorded streams for up to half- hour blocks if copyrighted music was discovered in August 2014, which was found to have the same problems with blocking Let's Plays that used original game music. This prompted Twitch to alter the method to reduce false positive and provide ways for users to challenge such claims. Some games which have used licensed music, such as Concrete Jungle and Quantum Break, have provided a game option that disables licensed music playback or replaces this music with copyright-free music, making to make the games \\"stream-safe\\" to avoid being tagged as copyright infringing. In other cases, music licenses sites now consider the impact of let's plays on the video game marketing cycle, and offer broader licensing options for their music that includes their legal use in Let's Play for that game, and assurances that any let's plays tagged with content ID violations would be remedied. Even though these can be resolved, the time it takes to clear the content ID claim can be costly to let's play broadcasters as they lose advertising revenue on the video while it is offline, as well as losing impact for the developer and publisher of the game. Pinokl Games and tinyBuild, the developers and publishers, respectively, of Party Hard, had found let's plays of their game hit frequently with content ID claims that were resolved by the music licensing service; they opted to craft a new YouTube-friendly soundtrack for this purpose to avoid these. Promotion and disclosure Another legal issue related to let's play is disclosure. More popular YouTube channels will sometimes receive free promotional copies of games from developers and publishers in advance of release to promote the title. According to the US Federal Trade Commission, players that review or create commentary for such games should disclose the game if they subsequently make money from the review to stay within ethical business practices. In one specific scenario, John Bain, who has previously argued for clear disclosure of paid reviews, has revealed that he and several others were approached by Plaid Social, a marketing outlet for Warner Bros. Entertainment and offered promotional copies of the upcoming Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor in exchange for meeting very specific tasks in their presentation. Bain refused on these terms, but other commentators had taken the deal without disclosure of the deal, raising the issue of how many of these works were made through paid reviews. If an advertiser or marketer is offering to someone to write a review that is favorable to it, should be disclosed somewhere that is quite visible. According to Mary Engle, associate director for advertising practices at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), \\"disclosure should basically be unavoidable by the viewer. Perhaps the most important line to note. If a viewer doesn't automatically see or hear the disclosure without having to go hunting for it, it's not legal disclosure\\". In the aforementioned situation with Plaid Social and Warner Bros., the FTC issued a fine against the two companies, which Warner Bros. settled with in July 2016 and agreed to new regulations that would fine them in the future should such sponsored videos not be disclosed. A similar situation arose as a result of the skin gambling issues raised in mid-2016, with the FTC further refining its guidelines related to promotional advertising on social media in September 2017. Other issues In some cases, developers or publishers have used the DMCA to take down let's plays and other videos that are highly critical of a game, using the copyright provisions in the DMCA to override free speech or fair use aspects allowed for by the law. A noted case is that of Digital Homicide Studios against game critic Jim Sterling. Sterling had posted a let's play of Digital Homicide's The Slaughtering Grounds (2014) that noted numerous flaws in the game and called it as a potentially the worst game of 2014. Digital Homicide used a DMCA request to remove Sterling's video; Sterling was able file a counterclaim to restore the video. The action led to Digital Homicide's James Romine filing a $15 million defamation lawsuit against Sterling and 100 Steam users that left negative reviews of the game. The cases were ultimately dismissed or withdrawn. DMCA claims have also been threatened or used to remove let's plays of games owned by a company who do not agree with ideals or morals of the person creating the video. In September 2017, Kjellberg blurted out a racist insult while live-streaming a game to viewers, later apologizing for this; this followed previous incidents of where Kjellberg's on-screen behavior had been criticized. Campo Santo's founder Sean Vanaman was dismayed by this, and issued a DMCA notice to takedown Kjellberg's let's play of their game Firewatch, stating that having their game shown on his YouTube channel was the equivalent of endorsing his ideologies; YouTube complied with this request a few days later. Vanaman later clarified that his goal was not to censor Kjellberg, but that there is a \\"bad fit\\" between Kjellberg's views and Campo Santo's views and would prefer that Kjellberg not cover his games. Lawyers and legal experts speaking to Kotaku, The Verge and PC Gamer believed that content owners like Campo Santo have full control to issue DMCA takedowns under the law, but whether these takedowns are valid under fair use defense within copyright law is unclear, since to this point there has been no case law to challenge the legality of let's plays and other video game video walkthroughs or challenges to DMCA takedowns for this type of content. Kjellberg did not plan to counter the DMCA claim but pointed out that the use of DMCA to take down videos due to issues other than related to copyright has a potential for abuse by game developers and publishers and affect the current balance of the value of let's plays in game promotion and marketing. Trademark Sony Computer Entertainment of America attempted to trademark the term \\"let's play\\" as applied to streaming and broadcasting of video games in the latter part of 2015, but the request was preliminarily denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office citing an existing trademark. The MacArthur Law Firm, a firm specializing in video game legal matters, filed a formal petition to the Patent and Trademark office, citing that the denial should have been based on the claim that \\"let's play\\" has become a generic trademark and any further attempts to trademark the term should be denied. The Patent and Trademark office agreed, stating that the term \\"let's play\\" is now too generic to be trademarked. == See also == * Game demo * Game replay * Longplay * Speedrun * Video game live streaming * Video game walkthrough * YouTuber == References  External links == *The Let's Play Archive Category:Video game culture Category:Video game terminology Category:YouTube Category:Video game video content Category:Internet terminology Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Let's play"},{"id":"35198154","text":"The Book of Drugs is a 2012 memoir by the musician and songwriter Mike Doughty.

Produced by Mui Siu-ching it featured a cast which included Canti Lau, Kenix Kwok and Ada Choi. ==Synopsis== Luo Xiang buys a winning Hong Kong Jockey Club sweepstakes ticket, and because of it is murdered, as is his family. His murderers are his neighbours who include Chen Tao who uses his share of the prize money to become a tycoon. Luo Xiang and his wife become hungry ghosts, unable to be reincarnated until they have avenged themselves. Over the years Luo Xiang's ghost and the ghost of his wife seeks out the murderers to eradicate them and their families. However, Xiang's son (Xiao- wei's cousin) has been reincarnated as Chen Jia-bo (Canti Lao) the son of Chen Tao. Luo Xiang and his wife managed to kill Chen Tao's mother while haunting Chen Jia-bo, who is unaware of his past life. Chen Tao is disturbed by the deaths and haunting that Luo Xiang and his wife causes such that he hires a ghost specialist, who is aware of the ghosts, to deal with them. Luo Xiang and his wife are banished and sealed away by a ceremonial dagger, which is buried in the site where Luo Xiang, his wife, and son were buried to prevent them from haunting and killing. Through dreams linked to his past life, Chen Jia-bo is drawn to an island and the very area where he had been killed in his past life. By chance, he was abducted by gangsters in a ransom attempt and thrown into the sea. Luo Xiao-wei (Ada Choi), whose corpse had been accidentally cast into the sea on the night of the murders and somehow purified that she is a normal ghost, saves him and falls in love with Chen Jia-bo and follows him around once he is rescued. When Jia-bo's friend Yao Mei-qi (Kenix Kwok) is mortally wounded in a fall, Xiao-wei's spirit occupies her body in order to dwell in the realm of the living and be together with Jia-bo. A romance blossoms between the two, though, it doesn't last long as the ex-boyfriend of Yao Mei-qi fatally strangles her. As Xiao-wei lacks the power to prevent the corpse from decay, she forced to relinquish it, but not before Jia-bo comes to love her and learn a little of the truth. The burial site of the ceremonial dagger and Luo Xiang's family is disturbed by a couple burying their dead dog and later unearthed due to heavy rains that flood the area. This results in the dagger moved from the specialized ghost seal and being discovered along with the skeletons of Luo Xiang, his wife, and son. The disturbance enables Luo Xiang and his wife to return to recruit Chen Jia-bo for their revenge. Finding some closure after Xiao-wei, Jia-bo begins a relationship with Ye Hui (Fiona Leung). Ye Hui is the daughter of one of the murderers, who became a tramp and abandoned his family out of remorse for the death of the Luo family, though, he is later killed by the ghost of Luo Xiang's wife. When her mother remarried, Ye Hui took her stepfather's surname and in doing so became hidden from Luo Xiang's quest for revenge. Chen Tao starts losing his family one by one to freak accidents set up by Luo Xiang while the relationship between him and Chen Jia-bo become strained. Furthermore, when the skeleton of Xiang's son is examined and shows similar structure to Jia-bo's skeletal X-ray scans, Chen Tao begins acting erratically to the point that he murdered some of his former associates, including one of the neighbors that had helped him kill the Luo family. The ghost specialist is called on again and another banishing ceremony is performed after Chen-To recovers the skeletons of Luo Xiang and his wife. Luo Xiang's skeleton is cast into the fire, forcing the ghost into the afterlife. Chen Jia-bo interrupts the ceremony, though, and the spirit of Luo Xiang's wife takes possession of him after specialist accidentally wounds him that some blood falls onto her bones. Luo Xiang's wife learns of both Ye Hui's identity and attempts to force Jia-bo to avenge her by killing Ye Hui and Chen Tao. In order to avoid this, Jia-bo takes his own life by throwing himself into a fire after a confrontation with Chen Tao. Chen Tao, having lost everyone and everything, survives the wrath of the ghosts only to be killed and robbed in the same manner that he inflicted on the Luo Family. One day, Ye Hui visits Jia-bo's grave and when she leaves, she sees the spirits of Jia-bo and Xiao-Wei together before smiling, knowing that she can move onward. ==Side Stories== The TV series also goes into a few minor stories, particularly a murder case in which a detective, who happens to be one of Jia-bo's friends, finds a painting of a childhood crush from his hometown and eventually discovered her murder due to her ghost leading him to her body and her murderer. ==References== The content of this article is partially based on that from the corresponding article on the Chinese Wikipedia.

He did not graduate, instead leaving Oxford to manage his family's estates in Breconshire, Monmouthshire and Herefordshire. In 1877 Lloyd moved to London, where he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple. In London he became involved in local government, and as secretary of the London Municipal Reform League campaigned for the creation of the London County Council. When the first elections to the county council were held in January 1889, he was elected as a Progressive Party councillor representing North Kensington. Re-elected in 1892, he was defeated in 1895 and failed to regain his council seat at subsequent elections. Lloyd took a great interest in the traditions and history of his native county. He amassed a collection of papers and documents which he used as the basis of three publications: Historical Memoranda of Breconshire (two volumes 1903 and 1904), The Great Forest of Brecknock (1905) and The Early History of the Old South Wales Ironworks (1906).

Niagara Conservation also manufactures lighting fixtures, light bulbs, caulks, sealants, and weatherization products. ==History== Niagara Conservation was established in 1977 by William Cutler ==Product innovation== Niagara Conservation manufactures water-reducing, green products including toilets, aerators, and showerheads. In 2009, the company released the Stealth toilet, which used a new technology combining air and water to flush liquids and solids with only 0.8 gallons of water. Niagara's Stealth is currently the only single flush 0.8 gallons per flush (GPF) toilet in the world. The Stealth's ultra-high-efficiency low-flow toilet uses newly engineered technology where an air transfer system pressurizes the bowl's trap-way to flush quietly with limited water usage. All Stealth toilets are certified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s WaterSense program. Niagara Conservation also manufactures the Flapperless toilet, which uses a half-cylinder 1.6 gallon bucket instead of a flapper. When the toilet is flushed, the bucket dumps the water into the tank, initiating the flush. The flapper is the piece of common toilet technology that fails most often, without a flapper, a toilet is less likely to fail. ==Water conservation== In 2013, Niagara Conservation received the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) WaterSense Manufacturer Partner of the Year award for helping to increase water efficiency and awareness.http://www.epa.gov/watersense/partners/watersense_awards.html> Niagara received a similar award in 2011 for contributions to conservation initiatives.http://epa.gov/watersense/docs/excellence_awards_fact_sheet.pdf> Niagara has 30 products that are EPA certified, including the Stealth and Eco- Logic toilets, the Earth, Prismiere and Sava showerheads and the Dual Thread Faucet Aerator. ==Municipality and utility partnerships== In 2004, Niagara Conservation and Austin Water offered the residents of Austin, Texas the chance to replace their toilets with high-efficiency toilets through the city’s Free Toilet Program. If residents received their water from Austin or an eligible metropolitan utility district, they could replace up to three toilets with Niagara EcoLogic high-efficiency flapperless toilets. The program also offered rebates for purchasing high-efficiency toilets. In 2009, Niagara Conservation partnered with Fort Worth’s Water Conservation Section to provide free installation of high efficiency pre-rinse spray nozzles and aerators for local foodservice providers to reduce water consumption. The \\"SpraySmart\\" program replaced nozzles that use over three gallons of hot water per minute with Niagara nozzles that use 1.28 gallons per minute. In 2011, the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District in Lake Elsinore, California launched a free water conservation program that replaced old toilets with Niagara Conservation's Stealth System to save water. The program is currently in its first phase. In 2012, Niagara Conservation donated 1.0 GPF toilets to the Boys & Girls Clubs of Monterey County to help combat the club's rising water bills. The club previously paid up to $800 a month for water. In September 2015 California Water Service announced it will begin offering free High-Efficiency Toilets to their customers in California. Cal Water will provide residential customers who have existing toilets using 1.6 gallons per flush or greater with a Niagara Stealth high-efficiency toilets that use 0.8 gallons per flush. Free toilets will be available while supplies last. The homeowner will have to arrange to have the toilet(s) installed and dispose or arrange recycling of their old toilet(s). Since some old toilets use up to 8.0 gallons of water per flush this program is expected to save up to 50 gallons per day per household or up to 18,000 gallons per year per household.Cal Water Announces Rollout of Free Toilet Delivery Program accessed 27 Apr 2016 ==References * https://web.archive.org/web/20110628215542/http://worldwatercouncil.org/—World Water Council * http://www.epa.gov/watersense/—Environmental Protection Agency's WaterSense * http://www.awwa.org/Resources/Waterwiser.cfm?navItemNumber=1516—American Water Works Association * http://www.siwi.org/worldwaterweek—World Water Week * Water and Agriculture Information Center — U.S. Department of Agriculture - National Agricultural Library * http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/naturalresources/components/DD6946r.html — University of Minnesota Category:Manufacturing companies based in Texas Category:Privately held companies based in Texas Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1977 ","title":"Niagara Conservation"},{"id":"35198469","text":"St. Lorenz Basilica is a baroque minor Basilica in Kempten, Bavaria, named after the Christian martyr Lawrence of Rome.

Roman Giel of Gielsberg, the Abbot of Kempten, commissioned the master builder Michael Beer from Graubünden to build a new church to serve the parish and monastery. The foundation stone of the Basilica of St. Lawrence was laid on 13 April 1652.1652 – St Lorenz Basilika, Kempten, Bavaria, archiseek This was one of the first large churches built in Germany after the end of the Thirty Years' War. Michael Beer built the nave, the ground floor of the towers and the choir. He was succeeded by Johann Serro on 24 March 1654. The church was consecrated on 12 May 1748. In 1803 the monastery was dissolved and the church became a purely parish church. In 1900 the twin towers were finally completed. They were built of concrete which is heavier than the used material before that time. Cracks at the connections to the main building are the result of the completed towers. In 1969 Pope Paul VI bestowed the honorary title of basilica minor. The building included a residence for the Prince-abbots. == References == * Website of the parish of St. Lorenz in Kempten Church interior Category:Basilica churches in Germany Category:Kempten Category:Roman Catholic churches in Bavaria Category:Church buildings with domes Category:Building and structure articles needing translation from German Wikipedia ","title":"St. Lorenz Basilica"},{"id":"35198500","text":"Conolly may refer to: *Arthur Conolly (1807–1842), British intelligence officer, explorer and writer *Claud Conolly Cowan or Claude Dampier (1879–1955), British film actor *Conolly Abel Smith CB GCVO JP (1899–1985), Vice Admiral in the British Royal Navy who served during World War I and World War II *Conolly Gage (1905–1984), British politician and judge *Conolly Norman (1853–1908), Irish alienist, or psychiatrist *David Conolly, writer, director, comedian and actor *Edward Michael Conolly (1786–1849), Irish Member of Parliament *Edward Tennyson Conolly (1822–1908), New Zealand lawyer, politician and judge *Islay Conolly (born 1923), Caymanian educator *James Conolly (1868–1916), Irish republican and socialist leader *John Augustus Conolly, Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross *John Conolly (1794–1866), English psychiatrist *Kevin Conolly MP, an Australian politician, is a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly *Lady Louisa Conolly (1743–1821), the third of the four Lennox Sisters in Stella Tillyard's book Aristocrats *Patricia Conolly (born 1933), Australian stage actress *Richard L.

They are a branch of the Uí Néill dynasty. The name is also variously spelled as O'Ferrally, Farrelly, Farley, etc. It is a completely different clan from the Ó Fearghail or Farrell or O'Farrell clans. ==History== According to the Life of Saint Máedóc of Ferns, the O'Farrelly family traces its origin back to a man named Urcain, who lived c. 624 AD. He was supposedly descended from the High-King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who reigned from 379 to 405 AD, according to the Annals of the Four Masters. His pedigree is given as- Urcain, son of Ailill, son of Rechtaide, son of Eitin, son of Felim, son of Caol, son of Áed, son of Ailill, son of Erc, son of Eógan, son of Niall of the Nine Hostages. The Life states- Once when Máedóc was at Ferns at the end of his time, the angel of the Lord revealed to him that the term of his days and the end of his life was now approaching and drawing nigh, and bade him go to the place of his resurrection, and to the site of his burial, and to leave his churches and noble annoits, and his chosen sanctuaries, to their native gentry and to their proper heirs after him. Máedóc did so. He left Ferns and its lands under the authority of Cele and Aedan, and with their race and descendants, together with the perpetual obligation of levying and collecting the tribute dues of Leinster, and of dividing them impartially among his churches and coarbs, as we said above. He went thence to Drumlane, and did the same in that church. He left the headship and coarbship of that church with Urcain, son of Ailill, who was called Faircellach. Máedóc had baptized this man, Urcain, and given him the name of Faircellach; for these were the two first attendants that Máedóc had, viz. Faircellach and Fergus his brother, two sons of Ailill. The descendants of Urcain were thereafter called the Ó Faircellach, meaning the descendants of Faircellach and from that time onwards were the abbots of Drumlane Abbey in County Cavan, Ireland. According to the above Life, Urcain's other brother, Fergus, was made erenagh of Rossinver Church in County Leitrim. He is described as Máedóc's own dear faithful foster-child and equal-aged companion. The Life then gives the succession of the O'Farrellys up to the time of Fergal ua Ruairc, King of Connacht from 956 to 967 AD- When fierce Maedoc died, both wall and great garden, the church with its horned cattle, were entrusted by him to Faircellach. After Faircellach died, the protection of the church was entrusted to the welcoming countenance which never refused a company, to the noble man, to Maelchiarain. Cúduilig, short was his activity, after forcible Maelchiaráin; Three years were these two undoubtedly in the coarbship after one another. Maelbrigde of the melodious voice, Concobar was his son; Maelbrigde did not succeed to the fair church, but his son Concobar succeeded. In the time of Concobar, head of schools, after every one in Drumlane, came O'Rourke with no weakly band to exact guesting from the high church. This was the number of the household of Fergal which came to the city of elegant Maedoc, thirteen good men without concealment, three and three hundred men of war. Three nights were they in his fair church, the warriors in Drumlane, without destruction to young or old of them, and with Concobar to satisfy them jointly. The attendance on them, though it was a hard bargain, though it was ignoble for O'Farrelly, no man of them was without payment of his portion, was neglected or forgotten. Three hundred men took refection, methinks, around Fergal king of Ireland. The earliest mention of the family in the Annals of the Four Masters is at 1025 AD- Duibhinsi Ua Faircheallaigh, Abbot of Druim-leathan, died. Other early mentions are at 1059, 1257, 1368, 1369 etc. The most famous of the early O'Farrelly ecclesiatics was David Ó Faircheallaigh who became Bishop of Kilmore diocese in 1408. The succession list of the O'Farrelly abbots, priors and priests can be seen under the Wiki entry for Drumlane. The family seem to have dispensed patronage to poets. A poem written towards the end of the 16th century praises Brian O'Foirchiollaigh with the lines- O best Brian O'Farrelly did not forget; Those who have come to you for ale-feasts have caused redness in the palms of the ale dispensers. You are the artisan of the artisans, the master of the hawk; With what wine has fallen to them from your goblets, their black cloaks have become red mantles.'Poems on the O'Reillys', James Carney (ed.), (Dublin, 1950), page 10, lines 225-232 ==Elizabethan Wars== Several O'Farrellys are mentioned in the Fiants of 19 January 1586 when Queen Elizabeth I of England granted them pardons for fighting against the Queen's forces. The 1882 transcription of the Fiants misspells the name as Irielli by leaving out the initial 'F' (Page 143, Document 4813)- Pardon to Hugh, son of Hugh, son of William Firielli of Droumlain; Patrick son of Hugh, son of William Firielli of same; Moyle-Shaughelen, son of Gillpatrick, son of William Firielli; John, son of Gillpatrick, son of William Firielli; Henry, son of Gillpatrick, son of William Firielli; Donel, son of Gillpatrick, son of Hugh Firielli; Edmond, son of Hugh, son of Hugh Firielli; Gillpatrick, son of Thomas, son of Gillpatrick Firielli; Shane, son of Morrish, son of Mahowne Firielli. ==1800+== In the Tithe Applotment Books of the 1820s & 1830s there were 269 Farrellys and 29 Farellys who were paying tithes in County Cavan. In the Census of Ireland, 1911 there were 1,075 Farrellys in County Cavan, 13 O'Farrellys and four Farellys. ==Notable Farrellys== *Alexander Farrelly (1923–2002), the governor of the United States Virgin Islands serving from 1987 to 1995 *Bernie Farrelly, former camogie player, winner of the Gradam Tailte award for skill tests in 1987 and 1988 *Bobby Farrelly (born 1958), American film director, screenwriter and producer *Columb Farrelly (died 2008), Irish music producer and composer, worked with singer Sinéad O'Connor *Cynthia Farrelly Gesner (born 1962), American film actress and entertainment lawyer *Denis Farrelly (1912–1974), Fine Gael politician from County Meath in Ireland *Dick Farrelly (1916–1990), Irish songwriter, policeman and poet, composer of \\"The Isle of Innisfree\\" *Elizabeth Farrelly, Sydney-based author, architecture critic, essayist, columnist and speaker *Farrelly brothers, screenwriters and directors of eleven comedy films *Frank Farrelly (1931–2013), the author of a book called Provocative Therapy *Gareth Farrelly (born 1975), Irish footballer *Gary Farrelly (born 1983), Irish artist *Gearoid Farrelly, Irish comedian *John Patrick Farrelly (1856–1921), American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church *John V.

Her onstage persona was that of an abrasive but loveable character with an ability to argue down even the toughest of hecklers. Born in London, she made her music hall debut in Bermondsey, London. She became popular with cockney working- class audiences, and went on to appear on the same bill as Jenny Hill at the Canterbury Theatre of Varieties and the same bill as Vesta Tilley at Carlo Gatti's Charing Cross Music Hall. Off-stage, she became a popular figure in London for her many charitable donations to the poor. In later life Bellwood suffered from alcoholism as well as financial troubles and bankruptcy. With her health in decline, she died at her home in London, aged 40. ==Biography== Early life Bellwood was born in LondonCatherine Mahoney, FreeBMD, England & Wales, FreeBMD Birth Index, 1837-1915, volume 1d, p. 421 to Patrick Mahoney and his wife Catherine (née Ready), both of whom originated from County Cork in Ireland, and who had married in November 1849.Patrick Mahoney marriage to Catherine Ready, FreeBMD, England & Wales, FreeBMD Marriage Index: 1837-1915, Vol. 4, p. 541 The couple had four daughters: Mary, Ellen, Catherine and Ann Mahoney, as well as a son, James Mahoney. Career In 1876, aged 20, Catherine 'Kate' Mahoney assumed the stage name Bessie Bellwood and made her music hall debut at Bermondsey in London, where she had been a rabbit puller, or skin-dresser, in a local factory. Although she lacked the versatility of her rivals Marie Lloyd and Jenny Hill, she nevertheless became a popular performer noted for her 'saucy' stage manner and her ability to argue down even the toughest of hecklers—including a 15-stone coal-heaver who left the music hall where she was appearing after a five-minute dispute during her act. Her volatile, unpredictable nature was such that within four hours of having a devout conversation with Cardinal Manning about a Catholic charity she was shortly afterwards arrested in the Tottenham Court Road for knocking down a cabman because she believed he had insulted the man she loved.Le Roy, George Music Hall Stars of the Nineties British Technical and General Press (1952) pg 41 A devout Roman Catholic, she was admired by her public for her many acts of kindness to the poor, which included paying for Masses for the dead and dying, giving away her own money and possessions, taking in laundry, cleaning homes and looking after children. On 24 September 1884 she married John Nicholson, a Commission Agent in the Register Office in Leeds. Little is known of Nicholson after the wedding, and he does not seem to have played a major part in his wife's life. Bessie Bellwood in some of her characters - The Sketch 30 September 1896 Maurice Willson Disher (1893-1969), in his book Romance of the Music Hall, wrote of Bellwood: > \\"When Tony Pastor, the leading music hall manager of America, came over to > arrange her visit to New York, she gave a great party there in his honour. > In the midst of it, according to H. G. Hibbert’s account, Bessie Bellwood > gave a shriek of delight when she heard a hawker crying winkles down the > lane. \\"His stock on a japanned tea-tray slung round his neck was promptly > commandeered. The shocked footmen, handing round tea, were despatched for > pins, and the immortal singer of ‘Wot cheer, ‘Ria,’ whose real name was > Mahoney, and who claimed to be a descendant of Father Prout,’ but who, most > certainly, began life as a rabbit skinner in the New Cut, carefully divided > her spoils among many applicants.\\"Bellwood in Frederick Denny's > Encyclopaedia of the British Music Hall Of her popular song What Cheer Ria?, author Peter Davison notes: \\"Bessie Bellwood was one of the first of the great women characters of the music halls; and she was the kind of woman who epitomised the spirit of the halls. She had a magnificent gift of repartee, she could dominate a lively audience, and with her courage and humour went a deep generosity that became a byword. This was not limited to giving money to those out of luck... \\"Davison, Peter Songs of the British Music Hall Pub.

It was co designed by Vai and guitar manufacturer Ibanez in 1987. 'Evo' still retains identical specifications to the production model, with several aesthetic modifications. ==History== The Ibanez JEM line is considered Vai's signature guitar line. Around 1993 he recalls that he wanted to design a \\"Jem that had a classic look to it,\\" and out of this came the JEM7VWH.http://www.vai.com/minisites/EVO/history_frameset.html Vai was sent four production models when they came out and started playing them all in an effort to decide which one to use on a longer-term basis. According to Vai, \\"guitars are like snowflakes in that it seems like there are no two that are exactly alike,\\" so it was important to him to select one which fit his playing best. Around the same time Dimarzio also sent him several pickup prototypes, of which one design was selected and dubbed \\"Evolution\\". Vai then named his favourite of the guitars \\"Evo\\" (after the pickups installed in it) so that he could easily distinguish between his aesthetically identical guitars. Vai has played Evo since before the recording of Sex & Religion in 1993. ==Features== Evo is largely identical to a stock JEM7VWH,http://www.vai.com/minisites/EVO/bodyfront_frameset.html sporting an Ibanez Edge tremolo, 24-fret neck, and Dimarzio Evolution pickups.

Upon the second signing the signature was covered in plastic, but it has still faded much.http://www.vai.com/minisites/EVO/bodyback_03.html ==Recent and Present Day== Vai has used the guitar on a large number of his studio albums.

('Flo' is a modified jem 77fp modified with an aanj neck made to look like a jem 7v,http://www.vai.com/all- about-flo-history/ with a Fernandes Sustainer attached.) Due to the guitars extended service to Vai, coupled with his aggressive playing style, 'Evo' currently suffers various fallibilities, both aesthetic and structural.

Founded as Vestergaard Frandsen in 1957 as a uniform maker, the company evolved into a social enterprise making products for humanitarian aid in the 1990s. It is now best known for inventing the LifeStraw water filter and the PermaNet mosquito net. ==History== Vestergaard was founded in 1957 by Kaj Vestergaard Frandsen, a former farmer and the grandfather of the current CEO, Mikkel Vestergaard Frandsen. Kaj founded the company with a friend before doing it alone. The company made linings for jackets and uniforms. Kaj's son Torben took over in 1970. Production was first moved to Ireland and then to Poland in 1989. In 1990, Torben bought up 1 million yards of Swedish army surplus fabric used for uniforms, and turned it into blankets for aid organizations. That was the beginning of a change in focus of the company that continued after Mikkel was persuaded to join the company by his father in 1993. Mikkel had worked in Lagos from the age of 19 running a truck company, which \\"ignited his passion for Africa.\\" He left Nigeria following a military coup and returned to Denmark to work with his father. In 1997 Torben and Mikkel agreed to split the company into separate female uniform and humanitarian textiles businesses, and then Mikkel bought out his father and stopped producing uniforms. Under Mikkel's leadership the company focused on the business model of Humanitarian Entrepreneurship, product innovation that improves lives of people and makes a profit. In 1996, the company began supplying Guinea worm filters to The Carter Center. PermaNet bed nets were launched in 1999, LifeStraw was introduced in 2005 and ZeroFly entered the market in 2012. Those early products defined Vestergaard’s three focus areas aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals : public health, water and food security. The company moved headquarters from Kolding to Lausanne in 2005-6, which it said was to better attract specialist employees and due to the presence of international organizations such as UN agencies and the Red Cross in Switzerland. In 2010, the company was around 20 times the size of when Mikkel joined it. Vestergaard has continued to work on product innovations for vector borne illnesses, water borne illnesses and food security. In 2007, due to the increase in insecticide resistant mosquitoes, a new bednet was developed as a combination net with increased efficacy against mosquitoes resistant to insecticides. Vestergaard has been a member of the UN Global Compact since 2008 and initiated, then participated in the Bed Net Industry Dialogue hosted by the Global Business Coalition in 2009. In 2012, Vestergaard developed IR Mapper, an online tool for mapping insecticide resistance. ==Products== The company has several \\"disease control textiles\\" products designed as health interventions for developing countries, including the LifeStraw water filtration device to prevent waterborne disease, and the PermaNet, a mosquito net impregnated with the long-lasting insecticide deltamethrin to prevent malaria. The company also produces ZeroFly, which is a defence against insect pests for livestock and crop protection. Vestergaard also initiates programs to enhance delivery of its products: the company bundles LifeStraw and PermaNet together into a CarePack of preventive health tools to encourage people to get tested for HIV; LifeStraw has been distributed as part of the LifeStraw Carbon for Water program, where nearly 900,000 water purifiers were distributed in Kenya through funding provided by carbon offsets. In 2014, Lifestraw launched a Give Back program designed to provide one school child in a developing country safe drinking water for an entire school year. The program is funded by retail sales in North America or Europe. * LifeStraw. A water filter designed to be used by one person to filter water for drinking. It filters a maximum of 1000 litres of water, enough for one person for one year. It removes almost all of waterborne bacteria and parasites. In addition to the classic LifeStraw, the manufacturer also produces other styles on the LifeStraw product: the LifeStraw Family, a larger unit designed for family use,LifeStraw Family Features and the LifeStraw Go Water Bottle, which incorporates a LifeStraw filter into a 22-ounce bpa-free sports water bottle. * PermaNet. Vestergaard is the largest producer of insecticide-treated bed nets and has distributed over half a billion nets worldwide. * ZeroFly. ZeroFly products are insecticide-treated materials, including tarpaulins and storage bags. ==Recognition== The company was named as a Fast Company Top 50 company in 2007.

His son Sir Thomas Frankland, 6th Baronet commissioned James Wyatt to build a new house, stables and triumphal arch in classical style; it was completed in 1790.Robinson, p. 175 The 6th Baronet's son, Sir Robert Frankland-Russell, 7th Baronet, had no son and following his death in 1849, the estate passed to his cousin's third daughter who had married Sir William Payne-Gallwey, 2nd Baronet two years earlier.Robinson, p. 176 (The baronetcy passed to his cousin Frederick William Frankland). In 1881 the estate passed to Sir William's son, Ralph. When Ralph's son was killed in World War I Ralph decided to sell the estate by auction. The house failed to sell and was demolished in 1927. The entry arch/gatehouse still stands and is in use. The stables building is also still present.

The office is housed within the Malacañang Palace complex. ==History== The Office of the President (OP) was created through Administrative Order No. 322, s. 1997. The order was issued following the submission of position papers by the officials of the Department of History of the University of the Philippines, and the Board of National Historical Institute which conducted deliberations and consultations in four meetings held at the Malacañang Palace from May 5 to June 25, 1997.

The engine is around 20 feet high and dwarfs the figure of a mechanic standing alongside. A steeple compound engine is a form of tandem compound steam engine that is constructed as an inverted vertical engine. Because of their great height, they became known as \\"steeple\\" engines. == Compound engines == Compound engines have either two or three cylinders, in which the steam is expanded in turn. The exhaust of the high-pressure or HP cylinder feeds the low-pressure or LP cylinder. Three cylinder engines also had an intermediate-pressure or IP cylinder, but these were less common than two cylinder engines.. In the tandem compound the cylinders are arranged end to end on a common axis (in this case, vertical) with both pistons mounted on the same rod and moving together. Each cylinder has independent valves and valve gear. The pipe connecting them may be enlarged to form a 'receiver', a reservoir for steam at the intermediate pressure. This improves the efficiency of compound engines. Other than their great height, the tandem compound steeple engine had no connection to Napier's earlier steeple engine, as used for paddle steamers on the Clyde. The vertical tandem compound has been used for marine use in small steamboats, although not under the 'steeple' name. Horizontal space in such boats is often more restricted than vertical space. == Vertical compound engines == The Fitchburg engine (illus.) was one of a series of similar engines offered in various configurations. The steeple arrangement required a high ceiling to the engine house, but had two advantages: it took up less floor space than a horizontal engine and it also required less complex masonry foundations beneath the engine. A vertical engine could be erected on any reasonably level base that was strong enough to bear its weight. A horizontal engine required carefully aligned brickwork to support both the crankshaft and cylinder(s) separately. Such brickwork was costly, took time to build and also prevented new engines being installed in old engine houses without expensive rebuilding. Fitchburg were notable in also supplying an automatic governor (illus., left-hand flywheel) that controlled the valve's cut-off according to load. Such governors would become significant around 1900 with the development of the high-speed engine, where they were used to control speed precisely. In these earlier medium-speed engines, the function of these governors was not just to control the engine's speed, but also to improve efficiency. The Fitchburg piston valves could be operated with a cut-off from zero to two-thirds of the stroke. A shorter cut-off improves efficiency when operating under light loads. Earlier engines had used devices such as expansion valves to achieve this, but they also required the continued attention of a skilled driver, who could 'drive' the engine by varying the cut-off as load changed. The earlier Watt governors only controlled a throttle valve, so although they controlled an engine's speed, they did not encourage efficiency. An engine operating with no cut-off but a throttled steam supply will be operating inefficiently, owing to reduced expansive working and the risk of wire-drawing. The first 'automatic' governors were termed that because they not only controlled the speed, but could also take over the role of the driver and could vary cut-off too. == Other notable makers == alt=A large three-cylinder stationary steam engine, driving a dynamo generator. The engine is so tall that there are two gallery walkways around it at different heights, with ladders between them. One of the best-known examples of the steeple engine was the Willans engine. These were double- or triple-expansion compound engines, with the unusual features of single-acting cylinders and a central spindle valve shared between all cylinders. By around 1900, more of the Willans type were in service for electrical generation than any other type. One of the last steeple compound engine designs was the Skinner Unaflow of 1929. Although some were used as stationary engines and generator sets, most were marine engines. The Great Lakes ferry continues in service with her original engines. ==Notes References== Category:Stationary steam engines Category:Steam engines by layout Category:Compound steam engines ","title":"Steeple compound engine"},{"id":"35199082","text":"Anelosimus linda is a species of spider in the family Theridiidae.

The song was also recorded in a Spanish-language version, titled \\"Me quedo\\", but was not released as a single from the Spanish-language version of the album, Inédito. The song shows a very mature sense of love, a way to understand how many times the end of a story is the most correct path to take.

The studio integrates the practices of architecture, craft, and product design. molo products develop from Forsythe and MacAllen's materials research and studies. ==History== molo founders, Forsythe and MacAllen met in 1994 while studying Architecture at Dalhousie University.Dunwoody, Catherine (Vol. 10, No. 4, 2007). \\"A Look Above The Rest\\". Nuvo, pp. 62-64. The two formed Forsythe + MacAllen Design Associates, and began a series of small projects. In that time they designed and built three houses for private clients, including the Colorado House, which was awarded the inaugural ar+d Award for Emerging Architecture in 1999. In 2001, they moved to Vancouver and continued their material investigations while developing submissions for architecture and design competitions. That year, they were awarded the Grand Prize in the Aomori Northern Style Housing Competition, juried by Tadao Ando and Jean Nouvel. Over the course of ten years, the designs would develop from a glass housing complex into the completed Aomori Nebuta House, a museum honouring and celebrating the Aomori Nebuta festival. Forsythe and MacAllen designs would continue to win awards, establishing the pair to pursue commercial scale operation. In 2003, molo was founded to produce and sell Forsythe and MacAllen's product designs. The name change reflects a growing team of support staff, and comes from \\"middle ones, little ones,\\" referring to the shift from architectural design to product design. MacAllen has since stated that the distinction is no longer necessary, as he and Forsythe feel that they are simply different words for design at various scales. ==Design intent== molo's design philosophy reflects extensive material research and consideration to continual improvement. Products are intended to create space, whether physical or experiential. The design process and materials used are evidence of a philosophy \\"that products should not only be sustainable themselves, but they should also aid in more sustainable practices in the spaces around them\\". The soft collection, a modular system composed of wall partitions, lighting, seating and table elements, is made with textile or paper. Elements use flexible honeycomb geometry to bend, shift, expand, and collapse for ease of storage. The collection is an evolutionary step in Forsythe and MacAllen's designs for softroom and softshelter, concepts which address issues of temporary housing for the homeless or disaster relief. Elements of the soft collection have been added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. They have also been featured in exhibitions at the Centre of Arts Caja de Burgos, the Museum of Vancouver, the Vancouver Art Gallery and the Gardiner Museum. In 2005, softwall was also honoured with an INDEX: Design to Improve Life award for the Home Category. Soft is protected by a series of international patents and design registrations. ==Awards== *Chicago Athenaeum International Architecture Award for Nebuta House (2011) *ar+d Award for Emerging Architecture for Aomori Nebuta House (2011) *Architectural Record Design Vanguard (2010) *Winner, \\"Best Exhibit\\", ICFF Editor's Choice Awards, International Contemporary Furniture Fair (2010) *MIPIM Architectural Review Future Project Award for Aomori Nebuta House (2010) *Winner, \\"Body of Work\\", ICFF Editor's Choice Awards, International Contemporary Furniture Fair (2006) *Winner, \\"Best New Designer\\", ICFF Editor's Choice Award, International Contemporary Furniture Fair (2004) *Winning Entry, First Step Housing Competition, Organized by Common Ground Community and the Architectural League of New York (2003) *First Prize, LighTouch Competition, Organized by Design Singapore (2003) *Golden Prize, Design Beyond East and West Housing competition (2003) *Winning Entry, Young Architects Forum Competition: \\"Inhabiting Identity\\", Architectural League of New York (2003) *ar+d award for Emerging Architecture for float tea lantern (2002) *First prize, Aomori Northern Style Housing Competition (2001) *ar+d Award for Emerging Architecture, for Colorado House (1999) ==References * Category:Design companies of Canada Category:Companies based in Vancouver Category:2003 establishments in British Columbia Category:Canadian companies established in 2003 ","title":"Molo (design company)"},{"id":"35199140","text":"Samuel Bowyer (12 October 1887 - 1961 or 1967) was an English footballer who made over 90 appearances in the Football League before the First World War. ==Career== Diminutive inside forward Steve Bowyer initially played for Lostock and once scored 4 goals in 6 minutes v Altrincham.

In a career that lasted from August 1837 to 1839 he competed twenty-one times and won fourteen races. Grey Momus first attracted attention as a two-year-old when he recorded two impressive victories at Goodwood in August. In the following year he won seven times from nine starts, taking two of the year's biggest races, the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket and the Gold Cup at Ascot. Grey Momus won one competitive race and took three walkovers in 1839 before being retired. He was exported to stand as a stallion in Germany, where he had some success as a sire of winners. ==Background== Grey Momus was strongly-built, heavy-shouldered grey horse, bred at Sledmere Stud in Yorkshire by Sir Tatton Sykes, 4th Baronet. He was sired by Comus, who finished third in the 1812 Epsom Derby before becoming a successful sire of winners. His dam, an unnamed mare by Cervantes, also produced a mare who became the ancestor of the Thoroughbred family known as 2-e, which produced such horses as Reigh Count, Candy Spots and Granville. Before he appeared on the racecourse, Grey Momus had been bought at Doncaster by John Bowes. The colt was sent into training with John Barham Day at Danebury near Stockbridge in Hampshire. Day also rode the grey in most of his races. ==Racing career== 1837: two-year-old season Grey Momus raced six times as a two-year-old in 1837. He made his debut Goodwood in the four furlong Lavant Stakes on 2 August. Ridden by his trainer John Day, he started favourite at odds of 1/2 and won \\"without any difficulty\\" by half a length from Kirtle, Anchorite and two others. Two days later at the same course he carried top weight of 124 pounds to victory in the Molecomb Stakes at odds of 4/7. His victories seemed to establish Grey Momus as the leading colt of his generation, and he was an early favourite for the following year's Derby. After a break of two months, Grey Momus reappeared in the Hopeful Stakes at Newmarket on 3 October for which he started 4/7 favourite despite carrying top weight. He started badly and was left with a great deal of ground to make up before finishing strongly to take second place behind the 15/1 outsider Saintfoin. At the next Newmarket meeting two weeks later he finished unplaced behind Ion when favourite for the Clearwell Stakes. At the Newmarket Houghton meeting on 30 October, Grey Momus was pitted against Colonel Peel's four-year-old filly Vulture, over five furlongs in a match which was highly anticipated. The match, which attracted keen betting interest, was made for £1000 with Grey Momus receiving 38 pounds from his older rival. At half way, Grey Momus seemed to be struggling, and looked likely to be easily beaten, but he stayed on strongly and was only half a length behind at the finish. Two days later at the same meeting Grey Momus was moved up in distance for one mile sweepstakes in which he prevailed by a neck from Paganini after a \\"desperate race\\". By the end of December, Grey Momus, after his mixed results at Newmarket, was third favourite for the Derby behind D'Egville and a son of Cobweb who was later named Phoenix. 1838: three- year-old season Grey Momus in his stable: contemporary engraving Before the start of the 1838 season Grey Momus entered the ownership of Lord George Bentinck. The colt began his three-year-old season in the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. Following the withdrawal of Phoenix, Grey Momus started at odds of 4/1 in a field of six runners. The grey colt was sent into the lead by John Day from the start and was never headed, winning easily by a length won from Saintfoin, with the favourite, Bamboo in third place. The supporters of the beaten favourite were dissatisfied by their horse's defeat and as a result, Grey Momus and Bamboo ran a match race at level weights over the same course and distance three days later. Grey Momus increased his superiority over his rival to win a prize of 300 sovereigns very easily by two lengths after Bamboo had led for the first half of the race. At Epsom on 30 May he was made 5/2 favourite for the Derby in a field of twenty-three runners, with Bentinck \\"declaring to win\\" with Grey Momus in preference to his other runner D'Egville. Grey Momus started well and disputed the lead with the previously unraced outsider Amato, before beginning to struggle in the straight. Although the grey colt \\"strained every nerve\\", he finished a well- beaten third behind Amato, with Ion taking second place. Two weeks after his defeat in the Derby, Grey Momus was sent to Ascot where he ran against older horses in the Gold Cup over a distance of two and a half miles. He started favourite at odds of 4/5 and took the race from the four-year-olds Epirus and Caravan. A year after his first appearance, Grey Momus returned to Goodwood on 31 July and won the Drawing Room Stakes from three opponents. Two days later at the same course, he won the Racing Sweepstakes over one mile from a field which included The Oaks winner Industry. After a two-month break, Grey Momus returned to run at the autumn meetings at Newmarket. On the opening day of the First October meeting he contested the Grand Duke Michael Stakes over ten furlongs and won at odds of 1/4 from Dash, with the 1000 Guineas winner Barcarolle in third. On the following day, Grey Momus was opposed by only one horse, a colt named Quo Minus in the Newmarket St. Leger and won at odds of 1/15. On his final start of the year, Grey Momus ran a £500 match at Newmarket's Houghton meeting on 2 November, and was beaten over two miles by Caravan. This defeat confirmed the belief of some observers that the successes of Grey Momus in 1838 owed more to his connections clever selection of targets rather than any exceptional ability. Others, however, felt that Grey Momus had been unsuited by the very soft ground and had not given his true running. 1839: four-year-old season Grey Momus began his four-year-old campaign in the Port Stakes at Newmarket's Craven meeting on 5 April. The race attracted only three runners, but these included two Classic with Grey Momus being opposed by Don John, the John Scott-trained winner of the 1838 St Leger. The previously undefeated Yorkshire colt was strongly favoured in the betting, but Grey Momus won the two mile contest \\"in a canter\\" by two lengths. At the next meeting, Grey Momus claimed three more prizes without having to race. He was allowed to walk over in a £50 race over three miles on 15 April. He walked over again in a similar event two days later and in a Queen's Plate the following afternoon. Grey Momus was strongly fancied to win a second Ascot Gold Cup but was forced out of the race by injury. He then finished third behind Harkaway and Caravan in the Tradesmen and Innkeepers' Cup over two and a half miles at Cheltenham on 3 July. On his final start he broke down in a race at Guildford. ==Stud career== Grey Momus began his stud career by returning to his breeder's Sledmere Stud. He was bought by Count Hahn of Basedow, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and exported to Germany where he had some success as a stallion. Among his German progeny were the Henckel-Rennen winner Seal and Dolores, the winner of the Union- Rennen.http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Bios2/GreyMomus.htm Grey Momus died in 1856. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1835 racehorse births Category:1856 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 2-d Category:Godolphin Arabian sire line Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Grey Momus"},{"id":"35199218","text":"France Martineau is a professor and a Canadian linguist.

She was one of the key figures in the famous Poison Affair. Vigoreaux was married to a ladies' tailor and had herself been a wet nurse to several members of the aristocracy before she became a successful fortune teller who specialized in palm reading and performed at parties hosted by the nobility. In late 1678, Vigoreaux hosted the party where the lawyer Maitre Perrin heard Marie Bosse say that she was a professional poisoner. This led to the arrest of Vigoreaux and Bosse as well as Bosse's family on 4 January 1679. They were the first to be arrested in the actual Poison Affair, and their testimony led to the arrest of La Voisin and the exposure of her whole organisation. Marie Vigoreaux was proven to be closely linked to the Bosse family, as she was claimed to have had sexual relations with all of the family members. At the threat of additional torture, Vigoreaux and Bosse confessed to being poisoners and made a list of their customers and colleagues. Vigoreaux implicated Marguerite de Poulaillon by naming her as her client: when Poulaillon expressed that she wished to be a widow, Vigoreaux had recommended her to Bosse. Adam Lesage claimed that Vigoreaux and her spouse had been commissioned by François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg to murder his wife and a business associate, and her husband later identified Montmorency in prison, though he later retracted his statement. Vigoreaux had also been commissioned by the Marquis de Feuquieres to make him untouchable in battle by the use of magic, and to murder someone who tried to prevent him from marrying. 4 May 1679, Vigoreaux and Bosse was sentenced to be tortured and burned to death.

The highway is known as Main Street while in Mansfield, Mansfield Highway while in southern Fort Worth, Kennedale Parkway in Kennedale, Riverside Drive and Rosedale Street in central Fort Worth, Commerce Street in downtown Fort Worth, Main Street in northern Fort Worth, and Saginaw Boulevard in Saginaw. The highway was originally designated on January 14, 1991, to replace a portion of Loop 496, and the old route of US 287 and US 81\\\\. The route was then rerouted several times during the 1990s. BUS US 287-P is located almost entirely in Tarrant County, and is mostly located in Fort Worth. The highway is, as of 2010, the longest business route of US 287, while located in Texas.See Business routes of U.S. Route 287 in Texas. BUS US 287-P is one of the few highways to be designated as a north–south highway. ==Route description== Entrance to the Fort Worth Stockyards, located on Business U.S. 287-P BUS US 287-P begins at an exit on US 287/US 81\\\\.

The highway passes through a large field, and expands to four lanes, total. All this time, a set of railroad tracks is running alongside the highway. The road continues past several warehouses, and a second railroad comes alongside the road. Then the Old Decatur Road branches off of the route, which provides access to a large neighborhood. The highway passes a few large farms, before intersecting with Bailey Boswell Road, and entering the city of Saginaw. The road then comes back together, with a center turn lane dividing the two opposite directions. The highway passes a large railroad depot, and a long row of fast-food restaurants, and proceeds through downtown Saginaw. The Saginaw Chamber of Commerce, located along the highway BUS U.S. 287-P then reaches its interchange with Interstate 820. The interchange is a cloverleaf, and is BUS U.S. 287-P's only exit.

The road continues through Marine Park, intersecting Northside Drive, and a set of railroad tracks. The highway passes a few small businesses, before becoming a large bridge, passing over the Trinity River. The Historic Tarrant County Courthouse After crossing over the Trinity River, the highway splits and becomes Commerce Street and Houston Street. The route intersects Spur 347, and passes around the Tarrant County Courthouse. ==History== BUS US 287-P was first proposed on June 21, 1990, and was approved and designated on January 14, 1991. The original route stretched from a junction with US 81/US 287 southward to US 287 in Mansfield, and replaced an old route of US 81/US 287 and a portion of Loop 496\\\\. The original length of the highway was approximately long. On October 25, 1990, the route of the highway was shortened by about a mile, and rerouted to Meacham Field, a few miles to the west of the original designation. The approximate length of BUS 287-P at this time was long. The route was minorly rerouted on January 5, 2012, although rerouting the highway was proposed on December 16, 2010. The course of the route was described as traveling from an intersection with US 287/US 81, southward through Saginaw, to Spur 280 in Fort Worth, and traveling on to I-35W, running concurrent with I-35W, then through Kennedale and on to Mansfield, to a southern terminus with US 287. ==Major junctionsSee also== * * ==NotesReferences== 87-2 Business (Mansfield-Fort Worth) Business (Mansfield-Fort Worth, Texas) Category:Transportation in Tarrant County, Texas 87-2 Business (Masfield-Fort Worth, Texas) Category:Mansfield, Texas Category:Transportation in Johnson County, Texas ","title":"U.S. Route 287 Business (Mansfield–Fort Worth, Texas)"},{"id":"35199265","text":"The 1972–73 FIBA Women's European Champions Cup was the thirteenth edition of FIBA Europe's competition for women's basketball national champion clubs, running from November 1972 to March 1973.Results in todor66.com Daugava Riga defeated Clermont UC in the final to win its tenth title in a row.List of finals, 1959–91, in FIBA Europe's website ==Preliminary round== { class=  !width=200Team #1 !width=50Agg. !width=200Team #2 !width=501st !width=502nd - align=rightLe Logis  align=center117–160align=left Firestone Wien  align=center62–91 align=center55–69 - align=rightAcademica Coimbra  align=center82–119align=left Mataró  align=center48–48 align=center34–71 - align=rightTirnforf Ware  align=center142–128align=left Black Star  align=center66–53 align=center76–75 - align=rightKFUM Stockholm  align=center93–122align=left Göttingen  align=center44–60 align=center49–62 - align=rightRapid Bucharest  align=center121–89align=left Maccabi Tel Aviv  align=center70–48 align=center51–41 } ==First round== { class= style=\\"text- align:center\\" !width=200Team #1 !width=50Agg. !width=200Team #2 !width=501st !width=502nd - align=rightIraklis  align=center81–240align=left Geas  align=center46–116 align=center35–124 - align=rightFirestone Wien  align=center134–164align=left Łódź  align=center70–83 align=center64–81 - align=rightMataró  align=center113–115align=left TFSE Budapest  align=center54–58 align=center59–57 - align=rightTirnforf Ware  align=center101–295align=left Clermont  align=center41–125 align=center66–170 - align=rightGöttingen  align=center89–178align=left Sparta Prague  align=center47–92 align=center42–86 - align=rightUxeledge College  align=center70–165align=left Minyor Pernik  align=center38–81 align=center32–84 - align=rightRapid Bucharest  align=center134–141align=left Voždovac  align=center68–58 align=center66–83 } ==Group stage== Group A {class= - align=center - !width=20 # !width=175Team !width=20Pld !width=20W !width=20L !width=30PF !width=30PA - bgcolor=B0EE90 1align=\\"left\\" Daugava Riga  6  6  0  519  320 - bgcolor=B0EE90 2align=\\"left\\" Geas  6  2  4  397  425 - 3align=\\"left\\" Łódź  6  2  4  372  451 - 4align=\\"left\\" TFSE Budapest  6  2  4  360  450 - } Group B {class= - align=center - !width=20 # !width=175Team !width=20Pld !width=20W !width=20L !width=30PF !width=30PA - bgcolor=B0EE90 1align=\\"left\\" Clermont  6  4  2  431  370 - bgcolor=B0EE90 2align=\\"left\\" Sparta Prague  6  4  2  405  321 - 3align=\\"left\\" Minyor Pernik  6  3  3  371  387 - 4align=\\"left\\" Voždovac  6  1  5  375  504 - } ==Semifinals== { class=  !width=200Team #1 !width=50Agg. !width=200Team #2 !width=501st !width=502nd - align=rightGeas  align=center116–117align=left Clermont  align=center56–63 align=center60–54 - align=rightSparta Prague  align=center101–150align=left Daugava Riga  align=center40–62 align=center61–88 } ==Final== { class=  !width=200Team #1 !width=50Agg. !width=200Team #2 !width=501st !width=502nd - align=rightClermont  align=center104–147align=left Daugava Riga  align=center44–64 align=center60–83 } ==References== Champions Cup Category:EuroLeague Women seasons ","title":"1972–73 FIBA Women's European Champions Cup"},{"id":"35199290","text":"Winestead Hall was a large country house at Winestead in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. ==History== 1930s buildings replacing Winestead Hall Sir Robert Hildyard, 2nd Baronet commissioned the house, which was then known as the Red Hall, to a design thought to have been by Lord Burlington, in the 1720s.Robinson, p. 190 The work was completed by Sir Robert Hildyard, 3rd Baronet.

He was also an early psychical researcher known for conducting experiments into table-tipping. ==Biography== He was born at Orange, Vaucluse, the son of Adrien de Gasparin. In 1836 he entered the service of his father, then minister of the interior, as chief of a department, became master of requests in the Council of State in 1837, and in 1842 was elected to the Chamber of Deputies from Bastia in Corsica. He was an advocate of religious liberty, prison reform, abolition of slavery, and the rights of the Protestant church, of which he was a member. His independence was not relished by the government, and his sympathy for Protestantism was not shared by his constituents. He was thus voted out of office in 1846, and put all of his enthusiasm into his written work. When the revolution of 1848 took place, he was asked to declare himself in favor of the new constitution. He refused. His disapproval of the form later given to the government by Louis Napoleon was even stronger, and he permanently moved to Switzerland. From 1849 until his death, he lived at Geneva. In the winter, he delivered courses of lectures on economical, historical, and religious subjects, many of which were subsequently published. During the Franco-German War he addressed an appeal to the French people urging them not to persevere in it. His death was hastened by his exertions in the care of refugees from Bourbaki's army, whom he received into his house. ==Spiritualism== In 1853, Gasparin with a group of his friends conducted experiments into table-tipping at his home. The experiments were conducted over a period of five months. He recorded the activity of table movements which he believed were the result of a physical force emanating from the bodies of the sitters. He proposed a theory of fluidic action (termed \\"ectenic force\\"), which he believed could explain the phenomena.Anderson, Rodger. (2006). Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies. McFarland & Company. pp. 68-69. Professor Marc Thury (1822-1905) from the University of Geneva who also attended some of the experiments supported Gasparin's conclusions in a pamphlet in 1855,Podmore, Frank. (1897). Studies in Psychical Research. New York: Putnam. p. 44 and conducted some of his own experiments in which similar results were obtained.Carrington, Hereward. (2007, originally published 1939). Laboratory Investigations into Psychic Phenomena. Whitefish, MT: Kessinger Publishing. p. 44 The physicist and spiritualist William Crookes was influenced by Gasparin's experiments.Crookes, William. (1874). Researches in the Phenomena of Spiritualism. London: James Burns. pp. 26-27 The experiments were also endorsed by A. Campbell Holms.Holms, A. Campbell. (1927). The Facts of Psychic Science and Philosophy. Occult Press. pp. 276-277 Camille Flammarion provided summaries of the work of de Gasparin and Thury.Flammarion, Camille. (1907). Mysterious Psychic Forces. Small, Maynard And Company. pp. 229-288 Critics like Frank Podmore argued that the conditions were insufficient to prevent trickery.Podmore, Frank. (1897). Studies in Psychical Research. New York: Putnam. p. 47 \\"If neither the feet nor the hands of the sitters could be employed, the knees could apparently have been used without much risk, and Thury clearly could not watch both the upper and under surfaces simultaneously. On the whole, though the experiments were conducted with care and a laudable desire not to exaggerate the importance of the facts observed, the experimenters do not appear to have sufficiently realised the possibilities of fraud; and their results add little evidence for action of a psychic, or, as Thury has preferred to name it, ectenic force.\\"Chisholm, Hugh. (1911). The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volumes 25-26. New York. p. 337. \\"It is doubtful from the description of the experiments whether the precautions taken were sufficient to exclude unconscious muscular action or even deliberate fraud.\\" The table-tipping experiments were heavily criticized by Louis Figuier. He noted that Gasperin's claim of the movement of tables without material contact was a \\"physical impossibility\\" and that he was never able to reproduce the phenomena before the French scientific community. He stated that \\"to admit reality of the elevation of a table, without any contact, it would have to be reproduced several times, and at will, in experiences with other observers. This has never arrived; which leads one to conclude that any connivance slipped into the experiments.\\"Figuier, Louis. (1880). Mystéres De La Science. Paris: Librairie Illustree. p. 579 ==Works== He published numerous articles in the Journal des Débats and the Revue des Deux Mondes.

His main interest was landscape painting under the tutelage of Hendrik van de Sande Bakhuyzen. In 1861 he moved to the United States and obtained a position teaching art at the University of Rochester. In 1866 he married Josephine Koelmann, also from The Hague. In 1865 Van Ingen was given charge of the School of art at Vassar College, at first the only member of the faculty. The Vassar College Art Gallery opened that year under his direction. The students used it as a studio, and at times copied the paintings. He remained at Vassar for the remainder of his life, living in a small house near the campus with occasional trips back to Europe. Under his leadership the school grew from an initial curriculum of practical studio exercises to include studies of art history and criticism. He also was instrumental in the school building a valuable collection of oils, paper sketches and plaster casts. Van Ingen died of heart problems on 17 November 1898. ==Work== Henry Van Ingen, c. 1877. Dutchess County Historical Society. Van Ingen was deeply influenced by The Hague School, a movement that emphasized traditional Dutch subjects such as interiors and landscapes. These were the main themes of his work, but were adapted to the scenery of the Hudson River Valley. Some of his animal paintings such as Eagle (1873) and View of Washington’s Headquarters (1883) were entirely American in their themes. He used a wide array of colors and strong, perhaps impressionistic, brushstrokes. He was described by one of his students as a \\"burly Dutchman reared within sound of Antwerp chimes - [He] has a homely, kindly face and very approachable manners, but stands no nonsense\\". ==References== Category:1833 births Category:1898 deaths Van Ingen, Henry Category:Dutch emigrants to the United States Category:Dutch landscape painters Category:Hague School Category:Artists from The Hague Van Ingen, Henry ","title":"Henry Van Ingen"},{"id":"35199397","text":"\\"Franky\\" is the fourth episode of the sixth series of the British teen drama Skins. It premiered on E4 in the UK on 13 February 2012. The episode is told from the point of view of character Franky Fitzgerald.http://www.channel4.com/programmes/skins/4od#3287601 ==Plot== Franky is in a bad place – it's the week of her mock exams and she's unable to concentrate on her studies, is constantly having visions of Grace, and regularly ignoring Matty's calls. Mini is too busy having sex with Alo to help her, her adoptive fathers' efforts to support her simply make her feel smothered, and in her isolation, she is drawn towards Luke, the boy from Morocco, and she enters into a sexual relationship with him. Luke is violent and is constantly getting into fights, but she feels he's the only person who understands her, and his dangerous world provides an outlet for her to vent her anger, frustration and grief. This begins to take its toll on her life, and she begins to burn bridges with the rest of her friends - this includes being aggressive to her teachers, intimidating Mini and getting into a fight with Geoff, causing him to fall over and injure his skull. But despite all of this, help comes in the unlikely form of Nick, who has begun to develop feelings for Franky and repeatedly attempts to get her back on track, despite Luke's efforts to keep her with him. After a talk from Jeff, Franky finally takes his advice to see a counsellor. There, she is presented with a Pingu toy, and asked who it represents to her. After a minute loses control of her grief at Grace's death and tearfully begs the Pingu doll (which she sees as Grace) for forgiveness, before flying into a rage and throwing a chair at it. She then returns to Luke in tears, and he consoles her, by first drying her eyes and then lightly slapping her cheek to wind her up. Nick tries to rescue her from a fight between Luke's gang and another gang and carries her off against her will while she screams at him to put her down. He finally does put her down outside and she tells him that she doesn't need rescuing, and she laughs at him once she realizes why he's been trying to help her. Luke catches up to them and beats up Nick. Franky seems pleased at first but becomes concerned when Luke continues to kick Nick while he's down and stops him. Luke is jealous and makes Franky choose which path she wants to follow. After some hesitation she chooses to go with Luke. While Luke is driving them Matty calls her and, realizing that she's with Luke, begs her to leave him. Luke also recognizes Matty's voice and tells Franky to hang up. She tells Luke that it's no one, and tells Matty to let go of her. Luke, jealous and enraged, grabs her phone from her and throws it out the window, startling her. Back at Luke's apartment, he gets high and yells at her irrationally about how she's had three in one night. She's surprised and says that it isn't like that. He doesn't listen to her and repeatedly tells her that she thinks that she's a big girl. He unbuckles his belt and pushes her down on his bed, and at first she thinks that he's just initiating the kind of rough sex that they typically have, but when she asks him to look at her, he puts his hand on her face and continues while she struggles against him. After Luke rapes her, she flees his apartment as soon as she feels it is safe to leave, while he's in the shower and can't see her and returns home. Jeff consoles her about her place in their family, but she doesn't tell him about what happened the night before. Luke follows her back to her home, not wanting to let her go. He tells her that he loves her, and when she insists she doesn't want to be with him he belittles her, telling her that no one else would have her, that she should be grateful. When he raises his arm to strike her she starts to scream and ducks out of the way, but the larger and more imposing Jeff steps in between them and he very firmly orders him off. Franky then goes to Nick's house and makes amends with him, and a new friendship is born between them.http://www.cultbox.co.uk/reviews/episodes/2951-skins- series-6-episode-4-reviewhttp://www.denofgeek.com/television/1244496/skins_series_6_episode_4_review_franky.html ==References== Category:2012 British television episodes Category:Skins (British TV series) episodes ","title":"Franky (Skins series 6)"},{"id":"35199403","text":"UCLA Bruins retired numbers may refer to: *UCLA Bruins men's basketball retired numbers *UCLA Bruins football retired numbers ","title":"UCLA Bruins retired numbers"},{"id":"35199416","text":"\\"Trilogy Time\\" is the 20th episode of the seventh season of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, and the 156th episode overall. It aired on April 9, 2012. ==Plot== Quinn has thrown out most of her things in order to appease Barney's irrational fear of change, but Barney will not even let her keep her coffee mugs. Ted and Marshall suggest it would be a good time to sit down for another \\"trilogy time\\", in which they watch the original Star Wars trilogy and predict what their lives will be like in three years. The tradition started in 2000 when Ted and Marshall chose to watch the entire trilogy instead of studying for their economics final after Marshall stated that if one did not watch the trilogy through every three years, \\"the dark side wins\\". Ted and Marshall begin to predict their futures three years at a time. Ted consistently imagines himself as a successful architect who has designed multiple skyscrapers and married to a woman who resembles Robin. Marshall imagines himself with a mustache, married to Lily, and a successful lawyer with a family of five children. Barney hopes to live his life the same way as he currently is, introducing the gang to a new girl he is sleeping with only to kick her out so that they will never see her again. In 2012, Ted realizes after reflecting on the trilogy times of 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009 that his friends are all moving on without him, and that there must be something wrong with him. He predicts a bleak future of himself living alone while Marshall and Lily are happy with a large family and Robin has married someone else, with the only constant being Barney will always be looking for a new girl. Barney refutes Ted, stating that for the first time he wants to be with someone he knows three years later. He returns to his apartment, apologizes to Quinn, and christens his commitment to her by breaking some of his coffee mugs. He says that although they have not yet talked of their future, he wants her to know that he is hers for as long as she will have him. When both of them wind up farting in front of each other, something Barney had been doing outside for some time, drawing the attention, and later obsession, of a neighbor across the street, inadvertently destroying his marriage. Quinn happily says that they are at least a real couple. Marshall comforts Ted, saying that \\"2015 will be different\\". In a flash forward to 2015, Marshall and Barney set up for another trilogy time. Though Barney complains that Ted is breaking their tradition by bringing a girl, he and Marshall make an exception because Ted really loves the girl, his infant daughter with the Mother. ==Production== In an interview, show co-creator Craig Thomas revealed that in the flash-forward to 2015 that Barney's left ring finger is intentionally not shown. He called it, \\"One of those little moments where you realize what a good actor Neil Patrick Harris is because he can somehow make hiding his left hand seem perfectly natural.\\" ==Reception== The A.V. Clubs Donna Bowman graded the episode a B+, stating that it had the show's \\"classic trope of flash- forwards and backs\\", mixed with fantasy predictions. Chris O'Hara of TV Fanatic gave the episode a perfect score (5.0). Michelle Profis of Entertainment Weekly said the episode's final scene opened potential for further material late in the series. ==References * *Barney's Blog: Patent Pending - Monday, April 9, 2012 Category:How I Met Your Mother (season 7) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"Trilogy Time"},{"id":"35199423","text":"\\"The Magician's Code\\" is the hour-long final episode of the seventh season of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother. It aired in two half-hour parts on May 14, 2012. ==Plot== Part 1 Lily starts going into labor, but refuses to go to the hospital until Marshall is there with her. Ted and Robin try to distract her with stories from their past until her contractions are four minutes apart, and Robin offers to deliver the baby for her, claiming that she has done this before, and Lily finally agrees to go to the hospital. Meanwhile, Barney and Marshall are stuck in Atlantic City following the events of \\"Good Crazy\\" and must find a way back to Manhattan for the birth. Barney offers to help Marshall on the condition that Marshall's son has the middle name \\"Wait-for-It\\". Marshall agrees and Barney manages to secure two seats on a bus to New York—only for Marshall to realize that the destination refers to the state of New York and not New York City; its final destination is actually Buffalo. The two are left trying to find another way back to the city when several senior citizens on the bus, inspired by Marshall's predicament, claim to be having heart attacks to force the driver to take a detour to the hospital where Lily is giving birth. Lily starts giving birth without Marshall, and Robin faints at the sight of the birth and while talking to Ted in the waiting room, expresses confusion since she had not fainted during prior deliveries. Ted reasons that it is different when it is someone she loves, and the conversation leads to them finally reconciling as friends. Marshall arrives just in time for his son to be born, whom Lily names after Marshall's late father and honors Barney's condition, and everyone welcomes Marvin Wait-for-It Eriksen into the world. Part 2 Part 2 begins with a flashforward to Barney's wedding, where Lily tells Ted that the bride wants to see him. After the birth of Marshall and Lily's son, Robin tells Ted that all the women he has pursued in the past were the wrong person, with Victoria being the only exception. She convinces Ted to call Victoria; Ted eventually asks Victoria to meet him at MacLaren's, hoping to find out if she ever got engaged. She arrives in a wedding dress and asks him to run away with her, as she has never stopped thinking about him. After seeking advice from the others, he agrees and gets in the car with her, but Ted admits he cannot let Victoria leave her fiancé at the altar after what Stella did to him. He tells Victoria that he is taking her back to the church so that she can go through with her wedding. However, he begins reminiscing about their past relationship and drives past the church, the two hold hands as they drive off into the sunset together. Marshall and Lily appoint Robin to take the photograph for baby Marvin's birth announcement, but she is unable to take a decent shot of the family together. Eventually the two fall asleep on their bed with Marvin between them, allowing Robin to get a perfect shot. Barney returns to Quinn to find that she has re-decorated the apartment bright pink as an act of revenge for his leaving town after their fight, but Barney is glad that she has not left him and the two make up. On the way to Hawaii, Barney is stopped at airport security because of a mysterious box he has placed in his luggage, the contents of which he claims he cannot reveal due to \\"the Magician's Code\\". He and Quinn are taken in for questioning, where she reveals that she has quit her job for Barney and is now unemployed. After missing their flight, Quinn is ready to leave, forcing Barney to perform the trick contained within the box, which turns out to contain an engagement ring. He proposes to Quinn and she accepts. They return to Marshall and Lily's apartment to announce their engagement. As Quinn leaves the room to tell the story of the proposal, Barney asks Robin if she is okay with everything. Robin says that she knows how awesome he is, and that she is happy for him. The episode closes with a flash- forward to Barney's wedding. Ted and Marshall stand in a hallway, with Marshall talking about how everything turned out for them. Ted enters a room where the bride is located, when the bride turns to face Ted, it is revealed to be Robin. ==Production== In an interview published after \\"The Magician's Code\\" originally aired, show co-creator Craig Thomas admitted that Barney's bride \\"had to be [Robin]\\", and it was decided, \\"literally years ago,\\" that the two of them would get married after they originally broke up in season 5. As for Lily and Marshall's baby's middle name, \\"Wait-for-It\\", Thomas said, \\"How often do you tell someone your middle name? ... Middle names aren't that useful and why not?\\". ==Reception== The season finale was viewed by 8.49 million viewers. Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B, stating that much happened in the episode even if there were contradictions along the way while the outcomes of certain events are attempts at misdirection. Entertainment Weeklys Michelle Profis stated the episode does not leave anything for the audience to contemplate before the next season but left some emotional moments such as the baby being named after Marshall's father. Ethan Alter of Television Without Pity gave part one a C+ and part two a C−. He referred to the episode as a \\"fake clip show\\" where \\"the fake clips here were funnier than anything else in the episode\\", and remarked that the show could have revealed Robin as Barney's bride with equal impact in the season premiere, thereby making the entire season redundant. ==ReferencesCategory:How I Met Your Mother (season 7) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"The Magician's Code"},{"id":"35199437","text":"Prisons in Iceland are few and generally low security. ==Current== {class=\\"sortable \\" !Name !Municipality !Established !Capacity !Security level !Notes - Fangelsið Akureyri Akureyrarkaupstaður style=\\"text-align: right;\\"1978 style=\\"text-align: right;\\"10 Low Used for prisoners with a remaining sentence of 1 year or less.

It was written by the English historian Norman Cohn, then of the University of Sussex, and first published by Sussex University Press in association with Heinemann Educational Books in 1975. It was released as a part of a series of academic books entitled 'Studies in the Dynamics of Persecution and Extermination' that were funded by the Columbus Centre and edited by Cohn himself. Within the book, Cohn argues that there never were any Devil-worshipping witches in Early Modern Europe, and that all of those persecuted for being so were innocent. In this he specifically rejects the Witch-cult hypothesis put forward by English scholar Margaret Murray, which argued that there really had been a witch-cult religion which had been pre- Christian in origin. Cohn notes that accusations of worshiping a beast-headed deity, eating children and committing incest were not new to the witches of Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe, but had originally been leveled at Jews in the first century and then at Christians in the second, before being reused against Christian heretical sects like the Waldensians and the Knights Templar during the Late Medieval. Europe's Inner Demons has come to be recognised as one of the most influential historical studies of European witchcraft beliefs. It has come under criticism for its rejection of Margaret Murray's hypothesis by proponents of that theory within the Contemporary Pagan movement. ==Background== In 1966, the University of Sussex in Southern England set up a research centre to investigate the contexts under which the persecution and extermination of different groups of people came about. Based on the proposal of David Astor, it was initially titled the Centre for Research in Collective Psychopathology, but was later renamed the Columbus Centre, after the Columbus Trust which financed it. Multidisciplinary in nature, the Centre went on to publish a series of books on various different persecutions throughout history, from the rise of European nationalism to the Holocaust and apartheid in South Africa. Cohn's study of the Early Modern persecutions of individuals accused of being witches fitted into this series of publications.Cohn 1975. p. ix. In 1957, Cohn had published a book entitled The Pursuit of the Millennium: Revolutionary Millenarians and Mystical Anarchists of the Middle Ages, which saw a revised and expanded edition in 1970. Cohn would note that there was \\"a certain relationship\\" between The Pursuit of the Millennium and Europe's Inner Demons, with the two being \\"complementary to one another.\\"Cohn 1975. p. xiii. ==SynopsisReception== The American anthropologist William Arens decided to end his book, The Man-Eating Myth (1979), with a quote taken from Europe's Inner Demons. A critique of claims regarding the existence of socially- sanctioned cultural cannibalism, Arens used the work to draw comparisons between the Early Modern claims of demonic cannibalism with the anthropological community's attitude to cannibalism in \\"primitive\\" cultures around the world, highlighting that both are based on scant evidence.Arens 1979. p. 185. ==References== Footnotes Bibliography ;Academic sources * * * ==See also== * A Brief History of Blasphemy Category:1975 non- fiction books Category:Academic studies of ritual and magic Category:History books about religion Category:History books about witchcraft Category:Heinemann (publisher) books ","title":"Europe's Inner Demons"},{"id":"35199469","text":"The Great Sauk Trail Council is a defunct local council of the Boy Scouts of America which was based out of Ann Arbor, Michigan serving Livingston County, Washtenaw County, Jackson County, Lenawee County, Hillsdale County, Monroe County, Eastern Calhoun County, and the city of Flat Rock, in Michigan. ==History== The Great Sauk Trail Council was a result of a merger in 1993 between the Wolverine Council and Land o' Lakes Council. The new council was known as the Wolverine-Land o' Lakes Council until the Great Sauk Trail Council name was decided upon later that year. In 2012, the Great Sauk Trail Council was merged with the Southwest Michigan Council to form the Southern Shores Field Service Council as a part of the Area 2 Project, which created four Field Service Councils in the lower peninsula of Michigan, under the Michigan Crossroads Council. ==Organization== The council was administratively divided into districts: * Chief Lenape Trails District serving Jackson County, Lenawee County, Hillsdale County, and Eastern Calhoun County * Three Fires District serving Livingston County * Running Waters District serving Monroe County and the city of Flat Rock * Huron Trails District serving Washtenaw County ==Camps== Camp Munhacke is a camp located roughly 15 minutes north of Chelsea, Michigan, located on Bruin Lake. Camp Munhacke is a camp for the Southern Shores Field Service Council, hosting Cub Scout Resident Camp during the summer. The camp features four cabins, 33 campsites, three pavilions, a dining hall with industrial style kitchen, archery range, rifle range, fire bowl and waterfront. It also borders the Pinckney Recreation Area and connects with the Potawatami Trail. The camp host 2,000 campers in a six-week season, and approximate 15,000 through the course of the year. This is a year round facility used for Cub Scouts Resident camp in the summer and Boy Scouts/Cub Scouts camping/events at other times. Events include Cub Scout/Boy Scout Training events, shooting sport events, hosts many events for the District and Order of the Arrow and weekend camping. Camp Muscootah is a camp five minutes west of Hillsdale, Michigan. The camp offers 13 campsites, an open pavilion, and a large fire bowl. Camp Teetonkah is a camp near Grass Lake, Michigan. Opened in 1912, it is the second-oldest Boy Scout camp in America. The camp can be found on Jackson County's Big Wolf Lake and features a new dining hall, three cabins, four Adirondack shelters and seven campsites. Camp Teetonkah is one of the oldest Boy Scout camps still operating in the United States. Originally, the camp consisted of about . Teetonkah has operated on the same land since 1913, but the land was owned privately until the then-Jackson Council took official title in 1917, stated in the deed to the camp. The facility now operates as a weekend camp. According to a 1921 news clipping, the name \\"Tee-Tonk-Ah\\" means \\"Big Lodge\\" In 1913, the Jackson Council held its first summer camp at Teetonkah, and continued to hold them for 81 years. In 1994, due to the lack of Scouting unit support as evidenced of fewer than 150 participants for the whole few-week season, and continuing financial losses, the summer camp operation closed. Today, Teetonkah is available for use by all BSA groups. They can use the facility for activities besides weekend campouts. Training events include \\"National Youth Leadership Training\\" and \\"Wood Badge\\", advanced adult leader training, outdoor leadership training, Jamboree shakedowns, multiple training groups, and shooting sport events. During 2006-07, a dining hall was built that included an industrial kitchen and a 250-person capacity dining area. Also at the camp are 14 unisex showers for adult males and females, and restrooms. The building has seating area for another 250 people under a pavilion attached to the dining hall. From 2008-11, the camp had a select lumber \\"harvest\\" under a new forestry plan. This allowed for the creation of seven campsites. In 2009, water was reactivated to two cabin areas and one campsite, and, as money permits, the camp plans to have running water in all campsites. In late 2011, oil was discovered on the property, providing much-needed revenue for the property. In 2012, a shooting range was created for the use of high-powered rifles as well as pistols. Five shotgun stands were also added. On December 12, 2015, the Michigan Crossroads Council Executive Board voted to close Camp Teetonkah and cease its operations by Dec. 31. Camp Kanesatake is a defunct Boy Scouts of America camp located in Cambridge Township, Lenawee County, Michigan. Camp Kanesatake was built in 1926 and was the Wolverine Council camp until it was sold in 1981. ==Order of the Arrow== Manitous Lodge served at the council Order of the Arrow lodge. The name is translated as \\"Mystic Lodge\\" in Ojibway, and the lodge totem is the medicine wheel. The four chapters in the lodge, Munhacke, Teetonkah, Tecumseh, and Allohak, correspond in location with their respective districts. The names come from the original lodges found within the council, prior to council mergers. The lodge annually held four events: Spring Ordeal, Fall Fellowship, an April Work Day and Winter Banquet. ==See also== * Scouting in Michigan ==References * Category:Central Region (Boy Scouts of America) Category:Youth organizations based in Michigan Category:Defunct local councils of the Boy Scouts of America Category:1993 establishments in Michigan Category:2012 disestablishments in Michigan ","title":"Great Sauk Trail Council"},{"id":"35199472","text":"Peter Shiao (Chinese: 萧培寰; pinyin: Xiāo Péiyuán) is a cross border entrepreneur, film and media producer, financier, marketer, social activist and commentator, who, throughout his multi-industry career, has sought to unite the East and West.

It is closely related to Tai Pao of Vietnam, where it may have originated. It was once written in a unique script, the Tai Yo script, but that is no longer in use. The language is known regionally in Laos and Thailand as Tai Mène and Tai Nyaw and, in Vietnam as Tai Do and Tai Quy Chau. Superficially, Tai Yo appears to be a Southwestern Tai language but this is only because of centuries of language contact and it is properly classified with the Northern Tai languages. The Nyaw/Nyo spoken in central Thailand and western Cambodia is a dialect of Lao and not the same as Tai Yo.Thananan (2014) ==Tai Mène== The Mène people of Laos claim to be from Xieng Mène (also Xieng My) in Vietnam.

Tai Mène or related languages may have also been spoken in Thường Xuân District, Thanh Hóa, Vietnam by the Yo (Do) people (Robequain 1929). Distribution Tai Mène is spoken in Borikhamxay Province, in many villages of Khamkeut District and several villages in Vieng Thong District (Chamberlain 1998).

So many deaths were later attributed to people sitting in the chair, that the landlord donated it to the Thirsk Museum. ==Background== Thomas Busby was arrested, tried and condemned to death after he murdered his father-in-law Daniel Auty (or Autie) in 1702. Auty and Busby were running a coin counterfeiting business (as well as other criminal enterprises) and they argued about the business which ended with Busby killing Auty. One variation of the story has Busby cursing the chair whilst on his way to his execution, whereas another says that he was drunk in the chair when he was arrested and cursed it then. Busby was gibbeted at Sandhutton crossroads, beside an inn, which later had its name changed to the Busby Stoop Inn. The site of the execution, opposite the pub on the A61 and A167 crossroads (now a roundabout), was said to be haunted by Busby's ghost. ==Deaths== Locals claimed that during the Second World War, Canadian airmen from the nearby base at Skipton-on-Swale went to the pub and those who sat in the chair never returned from bombing missions over mainland Europe. In the 1970s some fatal accidents were linked with the chair. In 1978 the chair was ultimately hung from the ceiling of Thirsk Museum to prevent occupancy, even by maintenance. A furniture historian examined the chair and found it to have machine-turned spindles, whereas 18th-century chairs were made using a pole lathe. He dated the chair to 1840, 138 years after Busby's execution. ==Cultural references== Busby's chair, as depicted in Hetalia: Axis Powers In Episode 26 of the webcomic Hetalia: Axis Powers, England monologues to himself that he will get revenge on America using \\"Busby's Chair\\". However, Russia sits in the chair instead, causing it to break with his ominous aura. This chair is also mentioned in one of Russia's character songs \\"Pechka, Light My Heart\\" in the lyrics \\"even the Busby's chair gets blown into bits\\". In the same series, England's character song \\"Pub and Go\\" reminds that if you sit there (in Busby's chair), you'll die and be \\"dragged straight down to hell\\". In his character song \\"Absolutely Invincible British Gentleman\\", Busby's chair is mentioned in the lyric: \\"In phenomena, Busby's chair, predictions\\". Busby's chair was mentioned in an episode of the television programme Unsolved Mysteries, and a similar story about a cursed chair was included in an episode of Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction. ==References== Sources * *THE SECRET OF THE GHOST CHAIR Category:Curses Category:Chairs Category:History of North Yorkshire Category:Individual pieces of furniture Category:English furniture ","title":"Busby's stoop chair"},{"id":"35199590","text":"The 1973–74 FIBA Women's European Champions Cup was the fourteenth edition of FIBA Europe's competition for women's basketball national champion clubs, running from November 1973 to April 1974.Results in todor66.com Daugava Riga defeated Clermont UC in a rematch of the past edition's final to win its eleventh title in a row.List of finals, 1959–91, in FIBA Europe's website ==Preliminary round== { class=  !width=200Team #1 !width=50Agg. !width=200Team #2 !width=501st !width=502nd - align=rightUGE Wien  align=center148–118align=left Academica Coimbra  align=center86–53 align=center62–65 - align=rightNyon  align=center99–147align=left Aalst  align=center50–57 align=center49–90 } ==First round== { class=  !width=200Team #1 !width=50Agg. !width=200Team #2 !width=501st !width=502nd - align=rightUGE Wien  align=center133–178align=left Politehnica Bucharest  align=center73–94 align=center60–84 - align=rightStanda Milan  align=center139–103align=left Aalst  align=center76–47 align=center63–56 - align=rightMTK Budapest  align=center?align=left Black Star  align=center106–47 align=center? - align=rightMaccabi Tel Aviv  align=center92–175align=left Clermont  align=center49–67 align=center43–108 - align=rightMataró  align=center102–178align=left Łódź  align=center47–79 align=center55–96 - align=rightYükseliş Koleji  align=center104–195align=left Maritsa Plovdiv  align=center58–96 align=center46–99 - align=rightCentymca  align=center69–202align=left Slavia Prague  align=center31–107 align=center38–95 - } ==Group stage== Group A {class= - align=center - !width=20 # !width=175Team !width=20Pld !width=20W !width=20L !width=30PF !width=30PA - bgcolor=B0EE90 1align=\\"left\\" Daugava Riga  6  6  0  482  279 - bgcolor=B0EE90 2align=\\"left\\" Politehnica Bucharest  6  4  2  385  421 - 3align=\\"left\\" Standa Milan  6  1  5  353  424 - 4align=\\"left\\" MTK Budapest  6  1  5  346  419 - } Group B {class= - align=center - !width=20 # !width=175Team !width=20Pld !width=20W !width=20L !width=30PF !width=30PA - bgcolor=B0EE90 1align=\\"left\\" Clermont  6  5  1  467  341 - bgcolor=B0EE90 2align=\\"left\\" Łódź  6  3  3  393  345 - 3align=\\"left\\" Maritsa Plovdiv  6  3  3  353  378 - 4align=\\"left\\" Slavia Prague  6  1  5  371  463 - } ==Semifinals== { class=  !width=200Team #1 !width=50Agg. !width=200Team #2 !width=501st !width=502nd - align=rightŁódź  align=center104–172align=left Daugava Riga  align=center52–91 align=center52–81 - align=rightPolitehnica Bucharest  align=center153–165align=left Clermont  align=center71–75 align=center82–90 - } ==Final== { class= style=\\"text- align:center\\" !width=200Team #1 !width=50Agg. !width=200Team #2 !width=501st !width=502nd - align=rightDaugava Riga  align=center164–120align=left Clermont  align=center96–67 align=center69–53 } ==References== Champions Cup Category:EuroLeague Women seasons ","title":"1973–74 FIBA Women's European Champions Cup"},{"id":"35199605","text":"Thai Song, or Lao Song, is a Tai language of Thailand.

The lake is approximately long, about wide at its widest point, and about deep. The Lake is surrounded by the City of Saratoga Springs on the north west, the Town of Malta on the south west, the Town of Stillwater on the south east, and the Town of Saratoga on the north east. New York State Route 9P is a highway that runs along the southern end and eastern side of the lake, and then crosses its outlet in the north. The lake's major source is the Kayaderosseras Creek which enters the lake from the north west, and the outlet is Fish Creek, which exits the lake from the north and flows into the Hudson River at Schuylerville, New York. ==Fishing== Fish species present in the lake are walleye, smallmouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, redbreast sunfish, bluegill, northern pike, tiger muskie, largemouth bass, carp, pumpkinseed sunfish, and brown bullhead. There is a state owned hard surface ramp boat launch off Union Avenue on the north shore. ==History== View of Saratoga Lake from the north end in the vicinity of Moon's Lake House about 1867 The name Saratoga is said to derive from the native Se-rach-ta-gue, meaning hillside country of the great river; however several completely different interpretations have been proposed. Archeological evidence shows Native American occupation dating back to 7000BC. The first European to visit the lake may have been the Jesuit Isaac Jogues in 1642. The Saint Isaac Jogues Chapel, on the Lake in Stillwater, commemorates his mission.

Competitions were held annually thereafter for several years. This tradition was revived in 1986 with the first Head of the Fish Regatta which, by 2010, had grown to be \\"the second largest regatta in the country, by volume of boats entered.\\" ==Places on Saratoga Lake== The north end of the lake, around Fish Creek, contains a public boat launch and many private marinas while the middle and southern areas are less densely developed. * Brown's Beach - Stillwater.

In 1782 he was invited by William Bolts to join a voyage to the North West Coast of America sailing from Trieste under the Imperial Austrian flag. He subsequently commanded the Austrian East India Company ships Concordia and Edward on voyages to India. Heinrich Zimmermann, Etching of the Portrait by Johann Georg Edlinger in Friedrich John Gallerie denkwürdiger Baiern, München, Fleischmann, 1807. ==Biography== Johann Heinrich Zimmermann was born on 25 December 1741 in Wiesloch, a short distance south of Heidelberg in the Palatinate.Most sources give 25 October 1741, but this is based on a mis-reading of December written as ‘Xbris’ on his baptismal registration: Manfred Kurz, “Heinrich Zimmermann of Wiesloch”, Cook’s Log, vol.33, no.1, 2010, pp.3-12. http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu41177.htm Leaving home in 1770, Zimmermann had a variety of jobs around Europe. He had trained as a ‘Gürtler’, the profession of a worker in precious and non-precious metals who made ornaments, jewelry, cutlery including swords, metal tools and implements. He spent time working at this in Geneva, Lyons and Paris before he arrived in London in 1776 where, after a short period of working in a sugar refinery, he joined HMS Discovery as an able seaman on 12 March of that year for James Cook's third voyage to the Pacific.Friedrich Nicolai, Beschreibung einer Reise durch Deutschland und die Schweiz im Jahre 1781, Berlin und Stettin, Bd.6, 1785, pp.692-3. He became the ship's coxswain in July 1776. During the voyage he kept a concise journal (contrary to orders) written in abbreviated German in a small notebook, which he afterwards used to write an account of it, Reise um die Welt mit Capitain Cook, published in Mannheim in 1781 and in Munich in 1783.Digitised at: Digitalisat Staatsbibliothek Bamberg (PDF), Digitalisat Internet Archive He had the help of a friend in writing it, according to Johann Reinhold Forster.Johann Reinhold Forster, preface to his translation of [John Rickman], Tagebuch einer Entdeckungs Reise nach der Südsee, Berlin, 1781. A French edition was published in Berne in 1783, and a Dutch edition in 1784.Henri Zimmerman, Dernier Voyage du Capitaine Cook autour du Monde, Berne, la nouvelle Société Typographique, 1783 ; H. Zimmerman, Reize rondom de Waereld met Kapitein Cook, Leyden, Honkoop, 1784. A Russian translation of Zimmermann's account of Cook's last voyage was published in St. Petersburg in 1786 and 1788.Г.

Govor, Bibliografiia Avstralii, 1710-1983, Moskva, Nauka, 1985, p.65. The fame generated by the book led to Zimmermann being appointed in August 1781 by the Prince Elector of Bavaria, Karl Theodor, to the position of “Churfürstlicher Leibschiffmeister” (Master of the Prince Elector's Ships), where he was responsible for the fleet of hunting and excursion boats on Lake Starnberg.Inamarie Kottmeier, „Das ungewöhnliche Leben des Heinrich Zimmermann, kurfürstl.

Shortly after arriving at Starnberg, Zimmermann accepted an invitation from William Bolts, made through George Dixon, to join the proposed voyage of the Imperial ship Cobenzell, and obtained leave from the Prince Elector to do so.Staatsarchiv München, HRI 197v7, Briefprotokolle Gericht Starnberg, Band 1804; cited in Inamarie Kottmeier, „Das ungewöhnliche Leben des Heinrich Zimmermann, kurfürstl. Leibschiffmeister am Starnberger See”, Vom Einbaum zum Dampfschiff, Bd.2, Starnberg, München, Förderverein Südbayerisches Schiffahrtsmuseum Starnberg e.V., 1982, S.17. The voyage of the Cobenzell was to have been an Austrian answer to James Cook’s voyages, an Imperial voyage of discovery round the world which included a venture to exploit the commercial possibilities of the fur trade on the North West Coast of America and trade with China and Japan. Zimmermann was joined in Trieste by three of his former shipmates under Cook, George Dixon, George Gilpin and William Walker, all four to sail as officers on the Cobenzell. Three naturalists, Franz Josef Maerter, Karl Haidinger and Franz Boos, and a gardener, Franz Bredemeyer, were assigned to undertake the scientific tasks of the voyage. Zimmermann's participation in the forthcoming voyage was announced in the Augsburg newspaper, the Augsburgische Ordinari Postzeitung of 2 August 1782: > Munich, 30 July: Mr Zimmermann, of whom it is reported in the Brünner > Zeitung under the heading Munich that he made the great voyage around the > world with the celebrated Captain Cook and afterwards became Shipmaster in > the service of the Elector on the Würmsee some hours distant from here, > received some time since letters from the English Captain Digson [Dixon], in > which he was invited with very flattering expressions to take part in the > forthcoming voyage from Trieste to the East Indies, with a monthly salary of > 6 pounds Sterling, for a period of five years, with the assurance that when > he completed the voyage he could take part in a second one, in which his > rank and character would be better. Mr Zimmermann’s heart was struck by this > offer. In ardent enthusiasm he sought His Highness the Elector's gracious > permission. Our gracious Prince, attentive above all to scientific talent > and genius, acceded in this case to his plea, granting him for the expected > five years only his existing yearly salary of 400 gulden and allowed him to > be paid half of that to supply him with sufficient travelling money; with > which he gave the gracious Father of the Country notice of his departure, > having also had his position and salary confirmed. Completely infused with > this favour, yesterday he eagerly went with the post to his present destiny. Although Emperor Joseph II was initially enthusiastic, the venture eventually proved impossible to realize. The opposition of Bolts’s Belgian financial partners was a principal cause of its not going ahead, and the Emperor also refused to provide finance for it apart from the expenses of his naturalists: in the autumn of 1782 it was abandoned.Guillaume Bolts, Recueil de pièces authentiques, relatives aux affaires de la ci-devant Société impériale asiatique de Trieste, gérées à Anvers, Antwerp, 1787, p.110.

Bolts sent the Cobenzell in September 1783 on a commercial voyage to the India by way of Marseilles, where she took in the principal part of her cargo, Madeira and the Cape of Good Hope.Wiener Zeitung, 15 and 18 January 1783; Gazette de France, 14 Octobre 1783.

XLVII, April 1918, pp.85-92; The Daily Universal Register, 10 October and The Morning Post, 2 July 1785. Zimmermann sailed on the ship as far as Marseilles, where he was employed by Bolts in the fitting out of the Ferdinand, a ship Bolts planned to send to the North West Coast of America under the flag of the Kingdom of Naples.Robert J. King, \\"Heinrich Zimmermann and the Proposed Voyage of the KKS Cobenzell to the North West Coast in 1782-1783\\", The Northern Mariner/Le Marin du Nord, vol.21, no.3, July 2011, pp.235-262. Although King Ferdinand IV of Naples gave Bolts a charter for a Royal Indian Company of Naples (Regia Società del India di Napoli), the hopes for a voyage to the North West Coast under the Neapolitan flag in the Ferdinand came to nought.Archivio di Stato di Napoli, Esteri, f.4211; cited in Aurelio Lepre, “Sui rapporti tra Mezzogiorno ed Europa nel Risorgimento”, Studi storici, Anno 10, no.3, Luglio-settembre. 1969, pp.557. In May 1787, Zimmermann found employment with the Brussels banker and merchant Edouard de Walckiers as ship’s master to take Walckiers’ ship the Concordia from Ostend to India in 1787.M. Mullens to Zimmermann, London, 26 February 1787; Georg von Vollmar Papers, Anhang: Nachlass von Johann Heinrich Zimmermann, A6, f.11; International Institute of Social History (IISH), Amsterdam. Zimmermann was asked in 1789 to plan a Russian expedition to the Pacific. Although he submitted plans, Russia was then engaged in wars with the Ottoman Empire and with Sweden, and the expedition never eventuated.Jacovleff to Zimmermann, St. Petersburg, 16 October 1789; Georg von Vollmar Papers, Anhang: Nachlass von Johann Heinrich Zimmermann, A9, f.4; International Institute of Social History (IISH), Amsterdam. In 1791-1792 he again took a ship, the Edward, to India for Edouard de Walckiers.Bletterman to Zimmermann, 24 April 1791; Georg von Vollmar Papers, Anhang: Nachlass von Johann Heinrich Zimmermann, A10, ff.4-5; International Institute of Social History (IISH), Amsterdam. The advent of war with revolutionary France put an end to the trade with India from the Austrian Netherlands, and Zimmermann returned to Munich. He retired to Starnberg in 1804 and died there on 3 May 1805.Inamarie Kottmeier, „Das ungewöhnliche Leben des Heinrich Zimmermann, kurfürstl.

It is notable for being the location of Big Brother Australia’s live shows. In 2019, the studio, along with the Big Brother house, has been bulldozed to make way for a rumoured roller coaster attraction. ==History== Dreamworld Studios opened in 1986 as the Music Bowl. Around 1990, the auditorium's name was changed to Dreamworld Amphitheatre before being renamed Dreamworld Studios in 2001 when Big Brother Australia began production. In August 2019, the venue was demolished to make way for a future attraction for the theme park. In the months prior to its demise, vision of the abandoned house spread across social media. This resulted in numerous trespassers and vandals visiting the compound. Later, four children were charged with arson after they were seen running from the abandoned house at the time that a fire broke out. ==Big Brother== Dreamworld Studios are mostly used during the production of Big Brother Australia. The Big Brother house was located a short walk away from the studios. This allowed live shows to take place in the auditorium. Big Brother was produced at Dreamworld from 2001 until 2008 for Network Ten and from 2012 until 2014 for the Nine Network. ==Temporary use== During periods where Big Brother was not in production, Dreamworld Studios have been used for various temporary shows. In 2004, Dreamworld played host to the Believe in Dreams illusion show at Dreamworld Studios. The show starred John Taylor.

Viper captured several French privateers in the waters around Great Britain, and took part in a notable engagement. She was sold in October 1809. ==Anglo-French War== Greyhound was commissioned in June 1780 under Lieutenant Richard Bridge for the Scilly Isles and Irish Sea. As Viper, she was in company with on 3 January 1781 when they captured the Dutch vessel Catherine. Viper was under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Dickinson. Then in August, and Viper were in company when they recaptured the sloop Peggy and the cutter Hope. On 16 April 1782, Viper captured the French privateer Brilliant. Later that month, on 28 April, Viper and the brig brought into Waterford a French privateer lugger and her prize. The prize was a sloop that had been sailing from London to Cork with merchandise when the privateer took her. and Viper were in company on 22 June when they sighted a cutter off Land's End. They gave chase and by 1 p.m. they caught their quarry. She proved to be the Dutch privateer Sea Lion (or Zeuwsche Water Leuw), of Flushing, but out of Cherbourg. Sea Lion had a crew of 50 men, and was pierced for 12 guns, but was only carrying eight 3-pounders. During this cruise she had taken a sloop between Lyme and Weymouth.At the time (1780-84), Britain and the Dutch Republic were embroiled in the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. Viper was paid off in June 1783, but immediately recommissioned again under Lieutenant Arthur Webber for the Irish Sea. Lieutenant John Crymes took command in 1784 for Land's End and the Irish Sea. In 1785-86 Viper was off Milford on Sea.O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 1, p.281. She was paid off in August 1786. In January of the next year she was again recommissioned for the Irish Sea, again under Crymes's command, and in July was at Lundy.North Devon magazine: containing the cave and lundy review, Volumes 1-2, pp.56-62. From 1788 to 1789, she was under the command of Lieutenant S. Rains. She was recommissioned in November 1791 under Lieutenant Robert Graeme for the Irish Sea, and he remained in command until late 1793. In June Viper and Graeme were at Plymouth.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.429. ==French Revolutionary Wars== In October 1793 Lieutenant John Pengelley (or Pengelly) assumed command. France invaded the Netherlands in January 1795. On 19 January 1795, one day after stadtholder William V of Orange fled to England, the Bataafse Republiek (Batavian Republic) was proclaimed, rendering the Netherlands a unitary state. From 1795 to 1806, the Batavian Republic designated the Netherlands as a republic modelled after the French Republic. On 20 January 1795, the Royal Navy seized several Dutch war and merchant vessels then at Plymouth. The British position was that the ships were not prizes, but were being held in trust for the stadtholder. until formally seized a year or so later. The naval vessels were the Zeeland (64 guns), the Brakel (54 guns), the Tholen (36 guns), the brig Pye, the sloop Mierman, and the cutter Pye. In addition, there were seven homeward and two outward bound Dutch Indiamen, and from 50 to 60 merchant vessels, all lying in Plymouth Sound. The ships were ordered round to Hamoaze where, after landing their powder, they were allowed to keep their colours flying. In time, the vessels became prizes. All the British vessels at Plymouth on 20 January 1795, including Viper, shared in the prize money arising from the seizure. In October 1796 captured the French privateer Vautour. The letter transmitting Captain Beauclerk's letter remarked that Viper and had twice chased Vautour off the coast. Nuestra Señora de la Piedad On 13 March 1797, Pengelley and Viper were about seven leagues north-west from Alboran, as they were returning to Gibraltar from Algiers when she sighted a Spanish privateer. As they approached, Pengelley fired a gun, which the Spaniard answered, first with a shot and then a broadside after he hove to. At half-past one Viper closed alongside the brig. The ensuing action lasted until 3:10 p.m., when the Spaniard hauled down his colours. During the action, the Spanish several times attempted to start fires on Viper by throwing over flasks filled with powder and sulphur. The Spanish brig was Nuestra Señora de la Piedad. She was armed with six 4-pounder and four 6-pounder guns, and eight swivels, and had a crew of 42 men. The two vessels were thus relatively evenly matched. Nuestra Señora de la Piedad had one man killed and seven dangerously wounded, one of whom died; Viper suffered no casualties. In 1799, Viper visited Sierra Leone, leaving on 1 April in company with ,Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.441. and returning on 3 August. Pengelly reported that he had run down the coast and found the settlements very healthy.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 2, p.259. Viper and Furet On 26 December 1799, at 10:15 a.m. Viper was seven or eight leagues south of the Dodman, serving as escort to a convoy of three merchant vessels, a sloop, a brig, and a three-masted ship,Fabre (1886), pp.9-12. when she sighted a suspicious vessel sailing towards her. Realising that the approaching vessel was an enemy, Pengelley sailed towards him. The French captain thought that Viper was maneuvering with such timidity that he could prevail. The engagement commenced at 10:45 a.m. The close action continued for three-quarters of an hour, when casualties on board the privateer caused the majority of the crew of the privateer to panic, forcing the captain of the enemy vessel to take flight. A running fight of an hour and a half ensued as Viper pursued her opponent. Eventually, Viper got close enough to be able to pour two broadsides into her enemy, who then struck his colours. The enemy turned out to be the French privateer Furet, of fourteen 4-pounder guns and 57 men under the command of Citizen Louis Bouvet. Furet was two days out of Saint Malo and had earlier that day put a seven-man prize crew aboard a vessel that she had taken. In the battle with Viper, Furet had four men killed and her first and second captains and six men wounded, four dangerously; Viper had one man wounded, with Pengelley also being slightly injured. Because both captor and captive were much damaged in their sails and rigging, Pengelley put into Falmouth, from where he intended to sail to Plymouth as soon as he could. The French wounded were transferred to the hospital of Mill Prison. Some weeks later the British paroled Bouvet and sent him in the cartel John to Morlaix. This was a sufficiently notable single-ship action that in 1847, the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Viper 26 Decr. 1799\\" to the one surviving claimant from the action. Morbihan In March 1800 Lieutenant Matthew Forester replaced Pengelley. Viper joined Sir Edward Pellews squadron at Morbihan on 5 June,. Then on 6 June, the boats of the squadron attacked Morbihan itself. The British were able to cut out five brigs, two sloops, and two gun vessels, and to capture 100 prisoners. The British burned the corvette brig Insolente, of 18 guns, as well as several small craft. They also destroyed the guns there and blew up the magazine. On 27 June Viper was in company with when they recaptured Lord Duncan. Because Viper was part of Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron, her crew was entitled to share in the proceeds from the squadron's recapture of Lancaster on 28 June. Similarly, Viper shared in the proceeds of Vigilant, Menais, Industry (salvage for recapture), wreck of a vessel sold, Insolent, and Ann. Lastly, she shared in the squadron's capture of the French privateer Guêppe on 30 August. Cerbère At some point in mid-1800, Lieutenant Jeremiah Coghlan (acting) assumed command. In July 1800, Coghlan, who had been watching Port-Louis, Morbihan, proposed to Pellew that he, Coghlan, take some boats into the harbour to cut out one of the French vessels there. Pellew acceded to the proposal and gave Coghlan a cutter from Impetueux, Midshipman Silas H. Paddon, and 12 men. Coghlan added in six men and a boat from Viper, and a boat from . On 29 July the boats went into the port after dark, targeting a brig. During the run-up to the attack the boats from Viper and Amethyst fell behind, but Coghlan in the cutter persisted. Coghlan's initial attempt at boarding failed and he himself received a pike wound in the thigh. The French repelled a second attempt too. Finally, the British succeeded in boarding, killing and wounding a large number of the French brig's crew, and taking control. The two laggard boats came up and the British then brought the brig out of the harbour and back to the fleet. The brig was Cerbère, of three 24-pounder and four 6-pounder guns, with a crew of 87 men, 16 of them soldiers, all under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Menagé. The attack cost the British one man killed (a seaman from Viper), and eight men wounded, including Coghlan and Paddon. The French lost five men killed and 21 wounded, including all their officers; one of the wounded men died shortly thereafter. The Royal Navy took Cerbère into service under her existing name. Pellew's fleet waived their right to any prize money as a gesture of admiration for the feat. Pellew also recommended Coghlan's promotion to Lieutenant, which followed, though Coghlan had not served the requisite time in grade.Long (1895), pp.219-20. Earl St. Vincent personally gave Coghlan a sword worth 100 guineas, in order to \\"prevent the city, or any body of merchants, from making him a present of the same sort\\".Littell (1844), Vol. 1, p.237. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp, \\"29 July Boat Service 1800\\" to the four then surviving claimants from the action. On 1 November Viper recaptured Diamond. On 1 February 1801, Viper captured Mont Blanc. Mont Blanc was advertised for sale in April. She was a schooner of 108 and had been captured as she was sailing from Cayenne to Lorient. Her cargo was for sale too, including 19 elephants' teeth, as were six brass guns and four iron guns.\\"Advertisements & Notices.\\" Trewman's Exeter Flying Post [Exeter, England 23 April 1801: n.p.] Next, Viper and captured Petit Felix on the 15th of the month. Petit Felix was a new Chasse-marée of 53 tons (bm). Her cargo, for exportation, consisted of brandy, red and white wine, castile soap, tar, twigs, and whisk brooms. Also on 15 February Viper captured Jupiter. On 1 April, Viper was in company with when they encountered four French privateers off Land's End. Three of the privateers escaped. Nevertheless, Atalante pursued one and after a chase of 17 hours captured her. She turned out to be the brig Héros, of Saint Malo. She was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 73 men under the command of her master, Renne Crosse. Viper shared in the proceeds of the capture of Adelaide and a brig on 8 August as part of Pellew's squadron. Viper was then paid off in October 1801. ==Napoleonic Wars== In September 1803 Lieutenant Robert Jump assumed command of Viper. On 8 May 1806, Viper detained and sent into Plymouth the ship Hercules. In 1806 Lieutenant Daniel Carpenter replaced Jump. Viper, under Carpenter, detained Hetty on 6 August and Diana on 27 August. ==Fate== The Commissioners of the Royal Navy put Viper up for sale on 13 October 1809 at Plymouth. She was sold that year. ==Notes, citations, and references== ;Notes ;Citations ;References *Fabre, Eugène (1886) Voyages et combats, Volume 2.

It was released by Woodstock Records on October 28, 2008. Michael Falzarano is a rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He is best known as a member of the New Riders of the Purple Sage and, before that, Hot Tuna. He has also played with other bands and recording artists, both live and in the studio. We Are All One is his third album as a band leader, after Mecca (1996) and The King James Sessions (2006). ==Recording== The songs on We Are All One were recorded over a period of several years, with different combinations of musicians. Most of the material was recorded in 2004 and 2005, before Michael Falzarano joined the New Riders. In a 2009 interview, Falzarano said, \\"I didn’t start out thinking that I was going to do a 'special guest' album or an 'and friends' album. Whenever friends of mine or people I knew were coming to town, I'd say, 'Hey, I'm in the middle of working on an album. Are you interested in doing a session?' The reason it sounds [so cohesive] — even though it took so long to come together — is because when I do my stuff or I do my thing, it's me. It's what I sound like. Regardless of whether it takes me ten years or two weeks, it usually winds up sounding pretty much the same. For the most part, I play traditional- sounding roots music, Americana kind of stuff. So, it's not fashionable in the sense that if I don't get this out this year, it's going to be old-hat.\\" ==Critical reception== On All About Jazz, Doug Collette said, \\"Redoubtable sideman to Bay Area notables including Hot Tuna and the New Riders of the Purple Sage, guitarist Michael Falzarano offers inspiration throughout his third CD that consolidates the talents that have proven so reliable over the years.... It's little surprise Falzarano's aided and abetted here by a star- studded cast of musicians, 'The Extended Family' to Falzarano.... The front man's amiable presence appears in tangible musicianly forms throughout the CD.... Michael Falzarano's greatest talent may be his ability to galvanize all the participants involved here. He is crucial in erecting the united front of a genuine band, giving another meaning altogether to the title We Are All One.\\" On Allmusic, William Ruhlmann wrote, \\"For his solo albums, of which this is the third, [Falzarano] has no trouble getting his friends to sit in. Here, those friends include the late master fiddler Vassar Clements, in some of his final recordings... Hot Tuna's (and Jefferson Airplane's) Jorma Kaukonen... Jefferson Starship's Pete Sears... the New Riders' pedal steel player Buddy Cage... and the Band's Garth Hudson... The guests provide some of the instrumental highlights of the disc, but they are only icing on the cake. For the most part, Falzarano leads ensembles anchored by Harvey Sorgen or Ray Grappone on drums, Steve Rust or Pete Bennett on bass, Melvin Seals or Jon Marshall Smith on organ, and Jimmy Eppard or Kerry Kearney on lead guitar. His leadership consists of his sturdy songwriting and singing in a countryish, bluesy vein that will be familiar to fans of the Band and the groups of which he's been a member. His adequate voice is in the conventional rusty, adenoidal style, his tunes are blues and rock staples, and his lyrics touch on the misunderstandings of love and the need for universal brotherhood.\\" Writing on Jambands.com, Brian Robbins said, \\"Past projects (the Memphis Pilgrims and the solo 2005 King James Sessions) have proven Michael's talent as a bandleader, but his latest release, We Are All One, is the best yet. And although the album features a revolving cast of characters recorded over a long period, it sounds like the result of a bunch of old friends sitting down one evening and going for it with the tape rolling.... Even though there's no one core group of musicians throughout the album, We Are All One is held together by the good Falzarano karma. This is definitely his album, no matter who sits in where — and, in the end, the man proves his point: given the chance, we are all one.\\" On KindWeb, Jud Conway wrote, \\"Somewhere between his busy schedule teaching guitar workshops and producing, recording, and performing with a veritable 'who's who' of jam band royalty, Falzarano has managed to release We Are All One, his third proper solo album, on Woodstock Records.... Having worked as a rhythm guitarist with or for many of the guest artists appearing on We Are All One, Falzarano promotes the solo project as a quasi-group effort, informally crediting the album to 'Michael Falzarano and Extended Family'.... In essence, because the basic tracks for We Are All One were recorded during multiple sessions and with numerous musicians over a period of several years, Falzarano was able to turn the tables on high-profile players and solicit their uninhibited support in helping him to realize his musical vision. Consequently, Michael Falzarano delivers one of the most compelling and organic albums in his extensive discography.\\" ==Track listing== #\\"Why I Love You I Can't Explain\\" (Michael Falzarano) – 4:08 #\\"Sweet Marie\\" (Falzarano) – 3:19 #\\"It's My Own Fault\\" (Falzarano) – 3:08 #\\"Candy Man\\" (Reverend Gary Davis) – 3:57 #\\"We Are All One\\" (Falzarano) – 3:43 #\\"It's Just My Way\\" (Falzarano) – 3:56 #\\"How Long Blues\\" (Leroy Carr) – 4:42 #\\"New Shirt\\" (Falzarano) – 4:47 #\\"When There's Two There's Trouble\\" (Falzarano) – 4:05 #\\"Crazy Days\\" (Falzarano) – 5:18 #\\"To Let the Fire Die\\" (Falzarano, Kerry Kearney) – 3:35 #\\"We Are All One\\" (acoustic) (Falzarano, Kearney) – 3:14 #\\"Last Train Out\\" (in memory of Allen Woody) (Falzarano) – 5:46 #\\"Gonna Power Down Now\\" (instrumental) (Falzarano) – 3:41 ==Personnel== *Michael Falzarano – guitar, lead vocals Featuring *Vassar Clements – fiddle *Melvin Seals – Hammond organ *Buddy Cage – pedal steel guitar *Jorma Kaukonen – guitar *Garth Hudson – keyboards *Professor Louie – piano, Fender Rhodes piano, accordion, vocals *Kerry Kearney – guitar *Kane Daily – slide guitar *Jimmy Fleming – mandolin *Jimmy Eppard – guitar, vocals *Dave Castiglione – saxophone With *Harvey Sorgen – drums *Pete Sears – piano *Jon Marshall Smith – Farfisa organ *Ray Grappone – drums *Peter Bennett – bass *Steve Rust – bass *Chris Matheos – bass *Charlie Wolfe – harmonica *Eileen Murphy – drums *Frank Celenza – bass *Vicki Bell – vocals *Klyph Black – bass, vocals *Tommy Circosta – vocals *Miss Marie – vocals *Mike Dunn – bass *David Malachowski – guitar *Gary Burke – drums Production *Michael Falzarano – producer, mixing *Jon Marshall Smith – mixing *Professor Louie – recording *Vicki Bell – recording *Dave Cook – recording *Mike Birnbaum – recording *Kevin Morgan Studio – art, layout ==References== Category:Michael Falzarano albums Category:2008 albums ","title":"We Are All One"},{"id":"35199918","text":"Michael Caridia (born 2 August 1941) is a British former child actor.

Stevens was first elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1927 and served continuously until 1940. Having served as a senior minister in the Bavin ministry, following the defeat of the Nationalist coalition led by Bavin, who was in poor health, at the 1932 state election, Stevens was elected leader of the newly formed United Australia Party (UAP) in New South Wales and became Opposition Leader. Bruxner was first elected to the Assembly in 1920 and served continuously until 1962. Initially a member of the Progressive Party, he served as party leader in opposition between 1922 and 1925; and resumed leadership in 1932, following the resignation of his successor, Ernest Buttenshaw. By this stage, the party was renamed as the Country Party. The Stevens–Bruxner coalition came to power as a result of the Lang Dismissal Crisis, when the Governor of New South Wales, Philip Game used the reserve power of The Crown to remove Jack Lang as Premier, asking Stevens to form government. Going to the polls a month later, Stevens/Bruxner won a landslide victory at the 1932 state election and were re-elected at the 1935 and 1938 state elections, albeit with reduced margins. This ministry covers the period from 13 April 1938 until 5 August 1939 when the deputy leader of the UAP, Eric Spooner resigned from cabinet and on 1 August 1939, moved a no confidence motion against Stevens for not running a balanced budget. Stevens resigned as Premier and Leader of the UAP, and was succeeded by Alexander Mair, who formed a coalition with Bruxner. ==Composition of ministry== First arrangement The composition of the ministry was announced by Premier Stevens on 13 April 1938 and covers the period until 13 October 1938 when there was a minor rearrangement, unless the Minister retains the portfolio for the full term.

She made her first appearance during the episode airing on 18 September 1991 and departed on 20 May 1994. Thomsen made return guest appearances in 1996 and 1997. Jessie Bullions portrayed a young Finlay in a flashback in 1997. ==Casting== Thomsen was still a teenager when she secured the role and she relocated her family from Brisbane to Sydney to accommodate filming. Thomsen told Jenna Price from The Sydney Morning Herald: \\"It's me who did the pushing ... my parents just supported me.\\" In 2012, Lynne McGranger who plays the character's on-screen mother Irene Roberts said that she doubted Finlay would ever return to the series because Thomsen had quit acting and became a mother. ==Character development== Finlay is involved in a relationship with Blake Dean (Les Hill). The two characters share an \\"unexpected passionate kiss\\", but Blake tells her that he is not interested, leaving Finlay \\"devastated\\". A reporter from Inside Soap said that Finlay has \\"really fallen for\\" Blake and is \\"hurt and embarrassed\\" to be rebuffed by him. In the following months Blake changes his mind, but Finlay puts up a \\"fight\\" and tries to resist him. The writer added that Blake \\"broke her heart and made her feel a fool, and she isn't ever going to let him put her in that position again\\". Finlay turns down Blake's offer of a date, but agrees to go scuba diving with him as friends. However, Finlay fails to resurface after the dive because her oxygen supply is cut short and Blake fears that she has drowned. The scenes were filmed at UnderWater World in Mooloolaba, Queensland. The storyline served as the serial's end-of-year \\"cliff-hanger\\" and viewers had to wait until the series returned to find out whether or not Finlay survives. A writer from The Sun-Herald said that she would survive and be \\"possibly suffering from brain damage\\", while Inside Soap's reporter revealed that the character's \\"life hangs in the balance\\". This leads to \\"tense scenes\\" with Finlay's mother Irene and Blake. He then declares his love for Finlay, but other characters think that he is still not over his ex-girlfriend Meg Bowman (Cathy Godbold), who died from leukaemia. Thomsen told Robert Kilroy-Silk on his show Kilroy Down Under that Finlay had a positive influence on young people at times. In one storyline Finlay taking \\"uppers and downers\\" to help her studying for her high school certificate. She explained to Kilroy-Silk that she \\"really enjoyed\\" the storyline and found it \\"worthwhile\\". She had \\"a lot of\\" younger girls and mothers writing to her to thank you to her for portraying the issue. When Thomsen was at high school, she knew other that were going through the same situation during studying as her character did. She added that it was a topic that \\"a lot of girls needed to know the effects of and after they watched it they sort of became aware of what was going to happen to them and that it was affecting them in the wrong way.\\" She concluded that topics that achieve what Finlay's storyline did are \\"really worthwhile\\". ==Storylines== Finlay first appears as a runaway who unsuccessfully attempts to get a free meal from the Diner and sleeps at the boat shed. She spends the night on one of the boats but wakes up to find it has been taken out by Nick Parrish (Bruce Roberts) and Lucinda Croft (Dee Smart). When they discover her, Lou gives her money to stay at the caravan park. She befriends Sophie Simpson (Rebekah Elmaloglou) and tells her of her plan to support herself through school. Sophie helps persuade Ailsa Stewart (Judy Nunn and Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson) to give her a job at the Diner. Finlay applies to Summer Bay High but the new principal Lois Crawford (Tina Bursill) is trying to turn the school into a more elite establishment and doesn't want Finlay attending. Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn), who has been demoted in favour of Lois, champions her cause. When Fin accidentally hits herself with a cupboard door, she uses the bruise to claim Lois hit her. The lie is found out but Lois is removed from the school anyway and Donald is reinstated as principal. Finlay is set a test, which she passes at the second attempt and she is enrolled in Year 11. As part of a deal she had earlier made with them, Finlay moves in with Sophie's foster parents Michael (Dennis Coard) and Pippa Ross (Debra Lawrance. Donald checks her records and learns that her mother Irene (Jacqui Phillips) has reported her missing, meaning he is obliged to tell the police where she is. Irene is revealed to be a violent alcoholic but Finlay almost returns to her when Irene attempts to use her younger brother Damian (Matt Doran) as leverage. However, Damian tells Finlay to keep her new life and Finlay tells him he should make the break from Irene as well. Fin discovers Sophie is pregnant by her late boyfriend David Croft (Guy Pearce). When Sophie starts dating Simon Fitzgerald (Richard Norton), Fin betrays her confidence and tells him about the pregnancy. Finlay makes friends with Meg Bowman and is upset by her death from leukaemia. She dates Randy Evans (Murray Bartlett), who Michael disapproves of. When she asks to go away with him and his friends for the weekend, Michael refuses and although he agrees to let her spend the day with them, he tells her if she stays overnight she will not be welcome in the house. Fin's evening is a disaster when Randy gets drunk and allows one of his friends to make advances on her. She returns to Summer Bay but doesn't feel able to go back to the Rosses so she stays with Bobby and her boyfriend Greg Marshall (Ross Newton) until Bobby and Randy convince her to return home, where Michael and Pippa offer to officially foster Finlay. She is initially keen but feels guilty when she gets a letter from Damian, who runs away from home. Fin and Sophie hide him until he is discovered but he is allowed to stay with the Rosses when Irene is revealed to have been beating him. Irene tries to take Damian by force and falls down some stairs during a confrontation. She threatens to charge Fin and Damian with assault if they do not come home but ultimately accepts defeat and both Finlay and Damian are fostered by the Rosses. Finlay worries when Damian becomes friends with Shane Parrish (Dieter Brummer) who leads him astray. She initially believes Damian is behind a robbery at the surf club kiosk but when she learns Shane is responsible and is blackmailing Damian she defends him to Adam Cameron (Mat Stevenson). She later shares a kiss with her friend Blake Dean and assumes they are now a couple. Blake isn't keen but can't bring himself to tell her, so he and Adam arrange for Finlay to see him kissing another girl, Andrea. When Fin learns it was a set-up, she gets her own back by sabotaging Blake's alarm clock so he is late for an exam. She later has a relationship with classmate Robert Davis (Steven Trinder) and tries to set Sophie, now a new mother, up with his friend Gary (Grant Wilson) but Sophie decides she isn't ready for a relationship. Fin has a crisis when Sophie and Ryan Lee (Alistair McDougall) accidentally throw her study notes away. She tries to use Blake's instead but is unable to make sense of them. Robert gets some stolen exam papers so they can cheat but Fin has an attack of conscience and confesses to Nick, meaning she has to repeat the year. Fin and Blake begin scuba diving lessons together and become close again. Fin's reluctance to commit to a relationship with Blake fades after an accident where she is trapped underwater and nearly drowns. They share a kiss and become a couple. Irene (now played by Lynne McGranger) returns to town, having sobered up, but Fin and Damian are reluctant to trust her, trying to hide all the alcohol in the house and refusing to return to live with her. Blake's sister Karen (Belinda Jarrett) is paroled from juvenile detention and begins causing problems. After she starts a fight in a night club that results in Blake being punched, Blake follows Karen to the city to sort her out and later sends a letter to Fin saying he is not coming back, leaving her heartbroken. Irene moves to town permanently and, although Fin declines to live with her, they begin to rebuild a relationship, with Irene helping Fin when she begins taking medication to help her study. Fin is less pleased when her older brother Nathan (David Dixon) appears after being released from jail and is proved right when Nathan goes back to his old ways and is jailed for robbery. Michael's son Haydn (Andrew Hill) returns to town and Fin dates him until it is revealed he has a gambling addiction and he temporarily flees town after conning money out of Michael and Pippa. When he returns and tries to mend his ways, Roxanne Miller (Lisa Lackey) convinces Finlay to give Haydn another chance. Haydn convinces Fin to help him with a plan to win enough money to pay Michael and Pippa back but his horse loses. Haydn then leaves town again, leaving a goodbye letter. Not long after, Fin leaves Summer Bay to attend college. In 1996, Fin returns to Summer Bay. She explains that she has been told she cannot have children as she miscarried six months earlier. She also admits that Barry, (David E Woodley) her boyfriend, proposed to her. She tells Irene that they would like her to be a surrogate and she accepts. They leave for the United States to start the procedure. A few months later Finlay herself falls pregnant, but assures Irene she will bring up both babies. She returns to town to be with Irene when she gives birth, but her son Paul is abducted only a few hours later. A distraught Irene tells Fin that Paul is nothing to do with her and orders her to go. Later, Fin and Irene reconcile off screen when Irene visits her after the birth of her other son Mark. Soon after, Irene is reunited with Paul and sends him to live with Fin.

Seattle Kokon Taiko (SKT) was founded from two separate taiko groups, Seattle Taiko Group and Kokon Taiko Ensemble in 1990 and continues to perform as an active member of the Seattle taiko and arts scene. ==Mission statement== \\"Through taiko, we hope to contribute to the development of a uniquely Japanese American art form --Japanese in origin, American in expression-- that weaves threads of continuity between generations and builds bridges of understanding among people of all nationalities and walks of life.\\"\\"Who is SKT?\\" Seattle Kokon Taiko. Accessed March 6, 2012. http://www.seattlekokontaiko.org/. ==History== In April 1980, Ondekoza, the famed Japanese taiko group, appeared at the Seattle Cherry Blossom Festival. Members of the local Japanese-American community were impressed and inspired to take up the art form themselves. Sue Taoka, a community activist and former member of Denver Taiko, who had received training from Sensei Seiichi Tanaka of the San Francisco Taiko Dojo, agreed to teach the new group which began gathering in Seattle's Chinatown/International District. In the first eight months of their existence, over 50 different people took part in the several times a week group practices with many leaving after various periods of participation. The high turnover rate was due in part to the physical demands and time commitment required (Taoka was a strict teacher who emphasized fundamentals and encouraged at-home drilling). An even bigger impediment may have been the lack of actual drums. The group drilled in a rat-infested, empty storefront in Seattle's Chinatown on used car tires, and later, one broken Chinese Lion Dance drum salvaged from the trash. As the core group began to emerge they solicited local merchants in the Japanese American community to raise funds to purchase the materials needed to make the first set of taiko drums. In July 1981 the Seattle Taiko Group made its official debut at the Seattle Chinatown/International District Summer Festival with a line-up that included Sue Taoka, William Satake Blauvelt, Jeff Hanada, Richard Higa, Ann Kawasaki, Kathy Kozu, Jan Kubota, Akemi Matsumoto and Masaye Okano (later Nakagawa). Although positively received the group was dissatisfied with its performance and decided to postpone any further appearances for an extended period. During this time Taoka left the group to attend law school full-time and the group filled the gap by holding workshops with more established groups and teachers including Kinnara Taiko of Los Angeles, Roy and P.J. Hirabayashi of the San Jose Taiko Group and Sensei Seiichi Tanaka of the San Francisco Taiko Dojo. Fellow travellers who also helped or encouraged the group at this time were sister group Katari Taiko of Vancouver B.C., Canada (who had formed the year before) and singer-songwriter Robert Kikuchi-Yngojo of San Francisco, CA. Over the next several years the group's line-up changed with only Blauvelt, Hanada and Okano (Nakagawa) remaining from the original group. Key new members included Stan Shikuma, Ken Mochizuki, Sheri Nakashima, Michelle Kumata, Tom Eng, Joanne Egashira, Harriet Kashiwada, Kaoru Nakamura, and Michio Teshima. The group performed at venues throughout the city and region and took part in workshops with Grand Master Daihachi Oguchi of Japan's Osuwa Daiko and the Okinawan all-women's group Miyarabi Taiko at the Japan/US Taiko Festival in San Francisco. The group also participated in and performed at one of the first pilgrimages to Tule Lake, California - the site of one of 10 former concentration camps that held Japanese Americans during World War II. While there the group met influential taiko artists Russel Baba and Jeanne Aiko Mercer from whom they would take workshops over the years. In 1986, Stan Shikuma and Michio Teshima left the group to form a new group with William Satake Blauvelt (who had left in 1985 over artistic differences). Using the Japanese word \\"kokon\\" which refers to something that is both ancient and modern at the same time and the desire to be a smaller, more adventurous musical group they called themselves Kokon Taiko Ensemble. They spent a year building drums, gathering gear and creating a repertoire that included traditionally based pieces and jazz influenced work. After debuting as a trio at the Nippon Kan Theater the group wanted to expand their sound by incorporating fue (Japanese flute) and more extensive use of percussion to augment the drums. They taught an extended series of taiko classes from which they recruited new members Joyce Nakamura and Martin Louie and became a quintet performing at area festivals and on local television. In 1990 the two groups reconciled. Seattle Taiko Group had lost much of its membership in the previous years and Kokon Taiko Ensemble's Michio Teshima was stricken with stomach cancer. Teshima, a respected community activist, was a bridge in bringing the two group's together as he had been a part of both. After performing together at Teshima's memorial service the two groups began rehearsing and agreed on a joint performance season billing themselves as Seattle and Kokon Taiko. After the season a professional mediator was brought in to formally work out the terms of the merger and the combined group officially became Seattle Kokon Taiko. The original line-up featured Harriet Kashiwada, Sheri Nakashima, Meiko Blosser, Aiko Suganuma, Joyce Nakamura, Martin Louie, William Satake Blauvelt and Stan Shikuma. In addition to performing each member took up various responsibilities running the group with Kashiwada heading the steering committee and Blauvelt and Shikuma co-artistic directing. Shikuma described the two groups as a \\"diverging stream that reconnects.\\" The newly minted Seattle Kokon Taiko went on to perform at all the major festivals in the area including a joint appearance with taiko master Kenny Endo at Bumbershoot: the Seattle Arts Festival. They also later appeared onstage at that festival's \\"Bumberdrum!\\" percussion summit with artists from around the world including Brazilian master Airto and Micheal Shrieve of Santana. Seattle Kokon Taiko also produced \\"New Songs for Ancient Voices\\" the first evening length concert by a local taiko group presented as part of new music organization Marzena's spring festival in honor of Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu. The group also began ongoing collaborations with choreographer A.C. Peterson (\\"Ozkei\\") and butoh dancer Joan Laage (\\"The Bride's Tales\\") appearing at On the Board's Northwest New Works Festival and the Seattle Fringe Festival respectively. The group also expanded its musical horizons by incorporating improvisational soloing with jazz saxophonist Steve Yamasaki and Native American and Japanese folk singing with vocalist Takuya Funaki. ==Present== Today, Seattle Kokon Taiko remains one group that practices regularly to perform for the Seattle community and beyond. Seattle Kokon Taiko has evolved into a massively important part of the Seattle community. Like San Jose Taiko, it is a community-based group without a sensei. They are directed by a five-member board of directors, with about nine more performing members. Previously, there were distinct roles filled by the members (Artistic Director, Performance Director, etc.), but now most of the roles are shared by group members, with the exception of Treasurer and Booking Coordinator.\\"Who is SKT?\\" Seattle Kokon Taiko. Accessed March 6, 2012. http://www.seattlekokontaiko.org/. ==Performance style== Stan Shikuma describes the group's kata as a stylistic variation of the kata taught by Seiichi Tanaka at San Francisco Taiko Dojo. However, Seattle Kokon Taiko does have repertoire that are Oedo Sukeroku naname, or slant, style, upright beta style, and Yodan style. ==Influences== Seattle Kokon Taiko list many different taiko artists and groups as early and later influences. Their early influences include Seiichi Tanaka and San Francisco Taiko Dojo, San Jose Taiko, Kinnara Taiko, and Katari Taiko. Their later influences include Uzume Taiko, Kenny Endo, and Kodo.\\"Who is SKT?\\" Seattle Kokon Taiko. Accessed March 6, 2012. http://www.seattlekokontaiko.org/.

It is part of a string of novels written to further the cause of the women’s movement by gaining empathy from its readers. Following its three female protagonists through the militant campaign of the Women’s Social and Political Union, the novel examines both gender and class. The novel references many historic events and people, both by their known aliases and their real names. == Publication and reception == Colmore’s novel was first published in 1911 by Stanley Paul and Co., London. At the time of publication the women’s movement had already been working and organizing for over 50 years. It was reviewed and advertised in the Suffrage newspaper Votes for Women and sold by the Women's Social and Political Union (WPSU) press. 'Gertrude Colmore' was the pen name for Gertrude Baillie-Weaver who also published The Life of Emily Davison in the same year. Pandora republished it in 1984 under the title Suffragettes: A Story of Three Women. The Broadview Edition, released in 2007 and edited by Alison Lee, is intended for academic study, and uses the 1911 text together with Colmore’s original notes and with appendices on the women's suffrage movement. ==Plot summary == The novel mainly follows three women, Sally Simmonds, Edith Carstairs, and Geraldine Hill, and their involvement with the WSPU. Sally, a working class girl, attends a meeting where she hears Lady Hill speak and becomes entranced. Her quick conversion is contrasted to Edith Carstairs who undergoes a conversion from a polite Suffragist to a militant Suffragette. During the course of the novel Sally Simmonds risks everything she has: job, relationship, and life, enduring the hunger strike and subsequent abuse in prison. Edith navigates the social ramifications with outwardly charming Cyril Race, a deceptive politician. Lady Geraldine Hill does her part as an upperclass woman of title, disguising herself as a working class woman in order to participate in the hunger strike (having been released due to her title when she was previously incarcerated). The novel follows many historical events such as the hunger strike, Conciliation Bill, and Black Friday. ==Main characters == Sally Simmonds – A working class girl who is entranced by Lady Hill. She is a maid of all work at the home of the Bilkes family, whose patriarch is against suffrage and mock Sally upon discovering her affiliation. She is sent to Mrs. Carleton’s Home of Rest for Working Women and Girls where she becomes deeply involved with the movement, leaving her job and boyfriend to work for the WSPU. She is caught during a riot and sent to prison where she participates in the hunger strike and is forcibly fed and beaten. She embodies the WSPU motto, \\"Deeds not Words\\". Edith Carstairs – a middle class girl who becomes involved in the suffrage movement with her mother. She draws an important distinction between suffragists – who support the cause, and suffragettes who are militant and \\"unwomanly\\". She undergoes a conversion, seeing the necessity of militancy after becoming involved with Lady Hill. She is fanciful, imagining fairies and fantasy heroes on the road with her, turning down an uninteresting suitor (who eventually becomes the doctor who force feeds Sally in prison) in favor of the charming and posh Cyril Race. Lady Geraldine Hill – the wife of Lord Henry Hill and a leader of the militant suffragists. She works to further the cause by speech making, political networking, and social clout until she is arrested and quickly released because of her high standing. She then disguises her appearance to be treated as a working class girl and undergoes force feeding to tell the world what horrors are being enacted on women. Lord Henry Hill – the husband of Geraldine who supports her suffrage involvement. After her time in prison he amends his original statement that he could only follow her 'so far', to encouraging her completely in her efforts. Cyril Race – a handsome politician who shows romantic interest in Edith. However he cuts ties with her once she becomes a militant and eventually votes against the conciliation bill showing his true feelings. Robbie Colquhoun – Edith’s friend from childhood who has been in love with her for years but does not earn her affection until she discovers he supports the suffrage cause. Joe Whittle – Sally’s boyfriend who accompanies her to suffrage meetings but does not support the cause. Sally’s involvement becomes an irreconcilable difference between them, as he wants to get married and Sally does not. Sally is not overly hurt when he moves on. Monty Cartairs – Edith’s brother who mocks the movement at first believing all militants to be unfeminine. He meets Lady Hill abroad and is taken aback by her grace and beauty believing her to be someone else. He attends a WSPU meeting to see her and is shocked to discover his companion is the women he had lambasted for being unwomanly. He then converts to the cause. == Themes and historical content== The novel uses many real events both directly and indirectly. Many characters have real-life counterparts. Lady Geraldine Hill is meant to be Lady Constance Lytton, who disguises herself to experience forced feeding in prison. Christina Amherst is Christabel Pankhurst the daughter of Emmeline Pankhurst – leaders of the WSPU, and Annie Carney is Annie Kenney one of the women who interrupted the Liberal Party meeting to ask about women’s rights. Specific events such as Black Friday and the Conciliation Bills are also represented, at times mirroring Votes for Women or echoing speeches made by the real-life counterparts to characters. The novel makes use of religious themes to create a conversion novel. Visceral experiences push Edith to revise her moral zeitgeist and social standards. The novel sets out to garner sympathy for the militant suffragettes by humanizing the movement and relating in a sentimental writing style already familiar to her readers. The novel combines sentimentalism and realism to contrast the women’s lives before and after involvement with the suffrage movement. ==See also== * Women's suffrage organizations and publications == References == Colmore, G., and Alison Lee.

Working with the writer Emmanuel Dongala he animated the Théâtre de l’Éclair in Brazzaville. He has directed short and feature-length films, and two documentary films on writers Sony Lab'ou Tansi and Tchicaya U’Tamsi. As an actor, he has played in several films and TV movies. ==Work== Baker is the author of several novels and plays. In 1993, he began to make short films. He released his first feature film, the documentary Diogène à Brazzaville, a portrait of the Congolese writer Sony Labou Tansi. Three years later he followed this with a portrait of the writer Tchicaya U Tam'si. His short film Les Oranges de Belleville about a blind man was one of fifteen films from fifteen different directors combined into the movie Paris, la métisse de 2005. In 2006 his play Les jours se traînent, les nuits aussi (The days drag on, the nights too) was broadcast on Czech radio. Talking of the play, he said \\"it is not protest or activist, but more psychological. These are stories of women and men, their sufferings, their difficulties ahead in life\\".

It tells of a Senegalese woman who, aged 50, discovers the pleasures of the flesh in the arms of a little thug 25 years younger. Ramata was released in France in 2011. The film was adapted from a novel by Abasse Ndione. Baker said he hesitated at first over choosing Katoucha as the lead due to her reputation and the fact that she was not an actress, but eventually accepted that she was right for the role.

Phonphanit was a journalist in Narathiwat Province, Thailand and he died while covering the bombing in Sungai Kolok. Six people died as a result of the incident, and about 100 were injured. The incident caused a public and media discussion about the South Thailand Insurgency as a result of criticism over the government's initial reaction, especially the contradictictory information delivered by the military, who called it a drug war retaliation, and the police, who said it was conducted by insurgents. ==Phonphanit== Phamon Phonphanit was born in 1950 and died on September 24, 2011. He was a print reporter for Sue Samut Atyakam, a local Thai newspaper in the Narathiwat Province, and the ISRA News Agency. He died later from injuries sustained while covering a bombing on September 16, 2011. He is now buried at Wat Khok Khien. ==Indident== On 16 September 2011, Phonphanit was reporting about a series of bombings that were occurring in downtown Sungai Kolok. While he was at the scene reporting about two car bombs that had just exploded minutes earlier, a motorcycle bomb went off injuring him among several civilians. Phonphanit died at Yala Central Hospital 8 days later where he was sent for severe burns. The bombs in the cars and motorcycle were detonated in specific 20- minute intervals along the busy strip where they were strategically placed. A fourth bomb was discovered and defused before it was able to explode. The three bombs caused around 118 injuries and six deaths in the heavily populated area. Four people died at the scene and 2 more people died later,. Phonphanit was the sixth death. Four Malaysians died and two Thai citizens. Thai soldiers interrogated two suspects seen on videotapes and placed by eyewitnesses. ==Context== Authorities believe the bombs are related to the violent conflict between various Muslim insurgent movements that started in January 2004. The South Thailand Insurgency is a movement that is still active in southern Thailand today. Muslims have a majority in the south. More than 4,800 people have been killed in southern Thailand as a result of attacks. Thailand government officials have yet to resolve these issues. The suspects denied involvement and were later released. No one has been officially charged for the attack nor has any group claimed responsibility. An almost identical bombing in the same city happened on 21 August 2008, killing another Thai reporter, Chalee Boonsawat of the Thai Rath. ==Impact== In March 2011, the government stated that the violence is in fact still increasing. Initially a military spokesperson said the incident was the work of a \\"drug gang.\\" But the bombings actually raised the awareness and led to discussions in the press about the insurgent uprising in the south my Muslim separatists, according to an editorial in the Asia Times. For example, Thai Travel News wrote that the military had \\"confused\\" people by calling it a drug war retaliation and clarified the attack as part of the insurgency.

Pearsons Corner is located at the intersection of Delaware Route 8 and Delaware Route 44 west of Dover. == History of Pearsons Corner == In 2009 a cultural resource survey was undertaken by the Delaware Department of Transportation. This survey has illuminated early life in Pearsons Corner. Much of the following information is extracted from this report.  Early History of Kent County  Pearson's Corner is located in West Dover Hundred, Kent County, Delaware, approximately ten miles west of Dover. What is now Kent County was originally part of the Whorekill County, as it was named by early Dutch settlers. It became an independent territory under the name St. Jones County in 1680 and was transferred to William Penn in 1682. Though there is no extant record of the change of name to Kent County, historian J. Scharf contends that it was likely done at the time of this transfer. There were few settlers and no village of real importance in St. Jones/Kent County in the 17th century. A census taken just after the formation of the county in 1680 enumerated only 99 people and subsequent settlement occurred slowly, driven mostly by migrants from Maryland who settled along the streams and waterways of central Delaware (Scharf 1888:1028-1029).  19th Century Development  In the early 19th century a new road was laid out connecting the Road from Dover to the Horse Head to the community at Dinah's Crossroads to the north. The area of present-day Pearson's Corner continued to be marked by large farms as the Rash and Pearson families became increasingly strong presences in the community. By the second half of the 19th century, a road had been constructed from Pearson's Corner south to Hazlettville (or George Town) and a small village had coalesced at the crossroads formed by this road and the road to Dover. By the middle of the 19th century, the intersection was home to dwellings as well as a blacksmith and wheelwright shop, store and granary that served both the rural community and travelers. The roads leading away from Pearson's Corner were dotted with scattered farmsteads. Before Joseph Rash Sr. died in 1837, he had sold a 15-acre parcel at what is now the northeast corner of Pearson's Corner to Joseph Rash Jr. (Kent County Deed S2/214). After his death, the remainder of Joseph Rash Sr.’s 300 acre tract was divided into four smaller farms. A 60 acre parcel adjacent to the aforesaid 15 acre tract was devised to John H. Rash who subsequently purchased the 15 acre parcel from the heirs of Joseph Rash, Jr. Thus, by 1840 John H. Rash owned a contiguous 75 acre farm at the northeast corner of Pearson’s Corner. In 1845, John H. Rash sold the farm to Moses Rash who owned the property until his death in 1887 (Kent County Deeds P3/117 and A4/61). Moses Rash was a farmer who cultivated grain and fruit for the market. He erected a “fine residence” on his property in 1849 (J.M. Runk & Co. 1899:1370) and Price and Rea's map of Delaware confirms that a dwelling was certainly standing on the property by 1850. Located approximately on the lot at present 5752 Forrest Avenue, this dwelling remained standing into the 20th century. In 1846 Elijah Crouch purchased the 100 acre farm that had previously been laid off to Elizabeth Course in Elizabeth Roe's will, from John and Elizabeth Jones, the heirs of John Jones. Though a dwelling house existed on the property when the Kent County Orphans Court ordered the division of the lot in 1839, it is unknown whether this dwelling was standing at the time of Crouch's purchase. Regardless, Crouch built a new dwelling house on the property between 1850 and 1859 and this house is still standing today at 3299 Hartly Road. Crouch also built a house on the south side of the road from Dover to the Horse Head between 1850 and 1859, but this house was removed by 1868. In 1870, William Pearson sold 108 acres of his farm on the south side of the Horse Head Road to Abraham Pearson. This farm had previously been the residence of William Pearson, but was at the time of sale already in Abraham Pearson's possession. Five years later, William Pearson sold a house lot on the southeast corner of Pearson's Corner, bounded on the north by the Road to Dover, on the west by the road to Hazlettville and on the south and east by the 108 acre farm William Pearson had previously sold to Abraham Pearson (Kent County Deeds T5/162 and M5/12). Thus, until it was divided from the larger farm tract in 1870 this small lot at the southeast corner of Pearson's Corner had been part of a much larger farm that centered on a farmhouse located to the east. Although it existed as a part of a larger farm tract, a building was standing at the southeast corner of Pearson's corner as early as 1850. A.D. Byles’ Map of Kent County, Delaware (1859), which identifies the building as a “store” provides the earliest evidence of the building's use. A deed from the 1875 sale of the corner lot from William Pearson to Abraham Pearson described the property as containing “several improvements now enjoyed by the said John Pearson as tenant under the said William Pearson Sr.” (Kent County Deed T5/162). A plot accompanying the Delaware General Assembly's Act to Straighten a Road from Pearson's Corner to Hazlettville identifies the building as “Pearson’s House”. The earliest architectural description of the Pearson store uncovered in the course of this research is found in an 1899 deed of sale for the adjacent farm in which one boundary of the farm is described as “the said small lot of land containing about three quarters of an acre and which said small lot of land has erected thereon a three story framed building used as a store and dwelling house.” At the time the house and store lot was occupied by Willard S. Carson (Kent County Deed E8/407).  20th Century Development  At the beginning of the 20th century, Pearson's Corner still existed as a rural crossroads village. But as the century progressed, changes and improvements to the road network and the pressures of post-World War II suburban development would alter, but not destroy, the historic character of the community.  Amish Settlement  In 1915, the first Amish settlement in Kent County started when the families of Bishop David Y. Miller and Jacob K. Miller arrived in Delaware. They had moved to the state from the west and settled near Dover in East Dover Hundred. These families were soon joined by the family of William Beachy and several others and by 1916 five Amish families had settled in the area. They were drawn to the state by the availability of good level land at reasonable prices and the large acreage of fruit crops the ground supported. Though some families left – like the Beachys who soon made plans to move to Oregon – enough Amish families continued to move into Delaware to steadily grow the community. By 1924, sixteen Amish families lived in the state – a number that grew to 111 families by 1988. Since the 1980s, the growth of Amish farms along the road from Hartly to Dover has been limited due to industrial expansion. Many farmers have moved from fruit and vegetable production to grain production and also established small shops to maintain economic viability (Clark 1988; Hostetler and Yoder 1990).  Old Pearson Store  The old Pearson store and house had been torn down or otherwise removed from the lot at the southeast corner of Pearson's Corner by 1922. That year, the Delaware State Highway Department drew plans for the widening of the road from Dover to Pearson's Corner. Though these plans do depict buildings, there is nothing shown on the southeast corner of Pearson's Corner. It is likely that Willard C. Hurd constructed the building that now stands at the southeast corner of Pearson's corner shortly after he purchased the property in 1923 as an aerial photograph shows a building on the lot in 1926 (Kent County Deed K12/293). By 1933, Hurd's property contained a two-story frame store, two gasoline pumps and a corn crib and shed.  Changes to the Road Network  The single greatest change to the landscape of Pearson's Corner in the 20th century was the construction of Delaware Route 8 (Halltown Road) between Pearson's Corner and Marydel. The Delaware State Highway Department granted Contract CK-9 to Harrison Engineering & Construction Corporation of Buffalo, New York on March 29, 1922 for work on a 6.2 mile section of roadway between Marydel and Pearson's Corner (Delaware State Highway Department 1922). Between 1939 and 1941, the Delaware State Highway Department widened State Routes 44 and 8 by four to six feet between Dover and Everett's Corner. Touted as a “long awaited improvement,” the first contract for the widening of State Route 44 between Dover and Pearson's Corner was completed in 1939 (Delaware State Highway Department 1939) and the improvements to the section of State Route 8 between Pearson's Corner and Everett's Corner were completed two years later (Delaware State HighwayDepartment 1941).  Post World War Two Residential and Commercial Development  With increased access to the Pearson's Corner area and the pressures of the suburban housing boom driving up land prices in Kent County, Ralph J. Vincent began subdividing and selling his 89-acre farm at Pearson's Corner (see Kent County Deeds T18/382, K19/361, I21/337 and K21/462). The first new houses to be constructed on the former Vincent farm were located on the northwest side of Delaware Route 8 (6401 and 6417 Halltown Road). Completed by 1952, these two small dwellings are depicted on the Delaware State Highway Department's plans for improvements to Mardyel- Pearson's Corner Road. By 1961, the dwelling at 3327 Hartly Road was completed and by 1968, the house at 6433 Halltown Road had been built (Aerial Photographs 1954, 1961 and 1968). Outside of the Vincent farm, other landowners took advantage of increased land values in the region and also sold off portions of their property for residential development. The dwelling at 2333 Pearsons Corner Road had been constructed or moved to the site before Carlton I. Pippin sold one acre of his five-acre property to Peter and Charlotte Ann Goff in 1967 (Kent County Deed S24/83; Aerial Photograph 1968). The crossroads at Pearson's Corner also attracted commercial development in the Post World War Two era, most of which was geared towards satisfying the needs of automobile travelers. In the 1950s and 1960s two gas stations opened at the crossroads, in addition to the abovementioned station operating at the site of the former Pearson store. A house and luncheonette that had been built between 1937 and 1953 at the northeast corner of Pearson's Corner was converted to a store and gas station by 1959 (Kent County Deed Z21/305; Aerial Photograph 1937). And another gas station was built at 6549 Halltown Road between 1961 and 1968 (Aerial Photographs 1961, 1968). More recently, a large Royal Farms convenience store and gas station opened on the southwest corner of Pearson's Corner between 2002 and 2007 (Aerial Photographs 2002, 2007). == Notable Families ==  The Rash Family  The Rash family was a prominent Delaware farming family that had settled near Pearson's Corner by the early 19th century. John Rash, the founder of the American branch of the Rash family had emigrated from Wales and settled near Camden, Delaware where his son Joseph Rash Sr. was born. Joseph Rash Sr. and his first wife owned and cultivated a farm near Camden where they raised five children: Joseph Jr., John, Hester, Elizabeth and Mary. However, after his first wife's death, Joseph Sr. sold the farm near Camden and bought 300 acres of the tract formerly called Wieberry near Pearson's Corner, making him the first of the Rash family to settle in the vicinity. Shortly thereafter, and prior to 1817, Joseph Rash Sr. married Elizabeth Hurd and the couple made their homestead on the 300 acres he had purchased near Pearson's Corner. He cleared and cultivated the land, erected buildings on the property and quickly became involved in the political and religious affairs of the community (J.M. Runk & Co. 1899:841).  The Pearson Family  William Pearson – the namesake of Pearson's Corner – was the first member of the Pearson family to settle near present-day Pearson's Corner. William Pearson and his wife Ann had at least seven children: William, Lydia, Rhody, Eliza, John, Martha and Abraham (United States Census Population Schedules 1850). In 1833, William Pearson purchased a large tract containing 437 acres and 25 square perches of land on the south side of the Horse Head Road, much of which would later become the property of his son Abraham (Kent County Deed G3/213). William Pearson established a farmstead on his property and a tax assessment recorded in 1837 noted that a brick dwelling, wooden dwelling, and outbuilding occupied by Pearson himself stood somewhere on the property (Kent County Board of Assessments 1837). A deed written in 1870 offers clues to the likely location of Pearson's early house. When William Pearson sold part of his farm tract to Abraham Pearson in that year the property was described as “lying on the South side of the Public road from Dover to Davis Corner, at or contiguous to Pearson’s Corner, the same being now in the tenure of the said Abraham Pearson and was lately the farm residence of the said William Pearson” (Kent County Deed M5/12). Beers’ Atlas of the State of Delaware (1868) shows Abraham Pearson's residence on the south side of the road to the east of Pearson's Corner, which is likely the dwelling referred to in the aforesaid deed.  The Thomas Family  By 1850, Jonathan Thomas had established a wheelwright shop on the five acre property at the northwest corner of Pearson's Corner which his son had purchased in 1840 from John H. Rash (Kent County Deed Q3/2). He operated a wheelwright and blacksmith shop on the property until he died in 1864. Upon his death the Orphans Court of Kent County ordered that his lot at Pearson's Corner, which at the time contained a two-story frame dwelling, a blacksmith shop and wheelwright shop, stable and smoke house, be divided amongst his heirs – his wife Harriet, nine children and three grandchildren – and a survey of the property was drafted to this effect (Kent County Probate Files, Jonathan Thomas deceased, 1864- 1866). Ultimately the property passed to Jonathan Thomas’ son, Joseph H. Thomas, who continued to operate the wheelwright shop at least until 1880 and likely until his death (see Kent County Probate Files, Joseph H. Thomas and United States Census Population Schedules 1870, 1880; Boyd 1874; Boyd 1879). Joseph H. Thomas and his wife Mary lived on the property in Pearson's Corner and in addition to serving as the village's wheelwright, Thomas was also the postmaster (Kent County Probate Files, Joseph H. Thomas; Boyd 1874; Boyd 1879). The house at the northwest corner of Pearson's Corner remained in the Thomas family until the heirs of Mary Thomas sold the property in 1925 (Kent County Deed X12/5). ==References== http://www.deldot.gov/archaeology/pearsons_corner/ Archaeology/Historic Preservation Cultural Resource Survey for Pearson's Corner Transportation Study, West Dover Hundred, Kent County, Delaware Category:Unincorporated communities in Kent County, Delaware Category:Unincorporated communities in Delaware ","title":"Pearsons Corner, Delaware"},{"id":"35200165","text":"Professor Rudolf Konrad Allemann is a Distinguished Research Professor and Pro Vice-Chancellor International and Student Recruitment and Head of the College of Physical Sciences and Engineering at Cardiff University.

He played college football for the University of Nevada, and was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the seventh round of the 2012 NFL Draft. He also played for the Tennessee Titans and New York Jets. ==Early life== Matthews was born on October 12, 1989 in Santa Ana, California. He attended Saddleback High School and lettered for the basketball team, averaging 9.8 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 0.3 blocks and 2.3 steals. In addition, he played for the football team. ==College career== Matthews initially signed a letter of intent committing to the University of Oregon. Matthews attended Bakersfield College before transferring to the University of Nevada, Reno. In his two years catching passes from Colin Kaepernick at Nevada, he had 147 receptions for 2,243 yards and 13 touchdowns. While at Nevada, Matthews was named second-team all-WAC as a wide receiver. ==Professional career== Matthews was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the seventh round with the 227th overall selection of the 2012 NFL Draft.  Miami Dolphins   2012 season: Rookie year  Matthews recorded his first reception in a 19–14 losing effort against the Buffalo Bills on November 15. He finished the Thursday Night Football game with one catch for 19 yards. Overall, he finished his rookie season with 11 receptions for 151 receiving yards.  2013 season  Matthews was one of only four receivers to make the final 53-man roster in 2013. This was crucial after seeing Dustin Keller go down in a preseason game against the Houston Texans. Matthews was a second-year player adding to the likes of Mike Wallace, Brian Hartline, and Brandon Gibson. Matthews had his first two-touchdown game in another losing effort against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 11, 2013. He finished the Monday Night Football game with 120 yards on 11 receptions. After Miami's Brandon Gibson went down in Week 11, Matthews has received a large increase in targets and a number of starts. Matthews proved to be a reliable target, specifically in the Miami win against the New England Patriots on December 15, 2013. Matthews caught a 24-yard reception to keep the drive alive in the 24–20 upset. The 2013 season came to an end with Matthews contributing 41 receptions for 448 yards and 2 touchdowns.  2014 season  The 2014 campaign was a lackluster performance for Matthews, who had emerged in 2013 as a reliable target, with the season ending prematurely for Matthews when off-field conduct resulted in his suspension for the final game against the New York Jets. While Matthews had shown promise, he finished the 2014 season with 12 catches on 21 targets for 135 yards and 2 touchdowns.  2015 season  In Week 7, against the Houston Texans, Matthews reeled in a then career-high 53-yard receiving touchdown in the first quarter of the 44–26 victory. On November 30, 2015, Matthews suffered multiple fractured ribs in the Miami Dolphins' Week 12 loss to the New York Jets. On January 2, 2016, Matthews was placed on injured reserve. Overall, in the 2015 season, he finished with 43 receptions for 662 receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns. Tennessee Titans 2016 season On March 9, 2016, Matthews signed a three-year deal with the Tennessee Titans. In his first season with the Titans, he set a career-high in receiving yards with 945 and with 9 receiving touchdowns. He led the Titans in both receiving yards and touchdowns. 2017 season On September 24, 2017, Matthews scored a 55-yard touchdown during the Titans' 33–27 victory against the Seattle Seahawks. On November 16, 2017, he scored a 75-yard touchdown as the Titans lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 40–17. Overall, he finished the 2017 season with 53 receptions for 795 receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns. 2018 season On August 21, 2018, Matthews signed a one-year contract extension with the Titans through the 2019 season. On September 26, Matthews requested his release from the Titans, citing a lack of playing time and targets. The team granted his request the next day and released him.

In 1988, Zou became head of the State Planning Commission, where he made decisions to hold major conferences for the integration of Guangxi Province as well as for initiatives for the establishment of regional economic zones. Zou was widely considered a strong proponent of central planning, and was quoted saying that \\"market mechanisms must take a backseat to economic planning.\\" However, beginning in early 1992 he publicly echoed Deng Xiaoping's efforts to revive reform; as seen in an early 1992 speech where he praised Guangdong Province's accomplishments in economic reform and high economic growth. From 1991 to 1998, Zou served as the Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China, and was one of China's point men for negotiations with the west. In 1994, he travelled in Canada and the United States and with then American President Bill Clinton to discuss issues of trade and human rights.

It is the flagship hospital of Kaiser Permanente, the largest managed care organization in the United States, through its Kaiser Foundation Hospitals division. ==History== The Oakland Medical Center was the first of the Kaiser Permanente hospitals, and opened in 1942 as a result of the acquisition of the Fabiola charity hospital (which operated from 1887-1932 before being sold to Samuel Merritt Hospital) by the Permanente Foundation, founded by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser and physician Sidney Garfield. This was the first modern Health maintenance organization (HMO) hospital after the experiment of using an HMO model was found to be successful among the 90,000 Richmond Kaiser Shipyards workers in the Richmond, California, Field Hospital. Several additions and renovations followed over the decades, notably a signature 12-story, 420-bed tower which opened in 1973. ==New flagship facility== To meet California's updated earthquake safety standards, the Oakland Medical Center was replaced in stages. First, a new parking garage opened in 2011. This was followed by a new twelve-story, 349-bed full service hospital across the street from the old facility. The new hospital is on the site of the MacArthur/Broadway indoor shopping center, opened in 1965 and demolished in 2009. The new Oakland Medical Center features twelve inpatient operating rooms, six outpatient operating rooms and seven outpatient procedure rooms, eight delivery rooms, and an emergency department. There are single occupancy rooms only (previously, patients shared rooms). Every patient has a private room with room service, free Wi-Fi access and a pull-out guest bed. A 42-inch flat- screen monitor in each room allows patients to watch TV, and also to look up the names of doctors and nurses, have a remote conversation with an interpreter and see their treatment plan. The hospital building is complemented with a four-story medical office building hosting ninety-nine provider offices. These additional buildings opened in July 2014; the Oakland Medical Center, the flagship facility of the entire Kaiser Permanente system, is one of three new Kaiser hospitals that began operating that year. A new hospital in suburban San Leandro opened in June, and the Redwood City medical center opened in December.Coming soon: A state-of-the-art, environmentally friendly facility… , KP.org, 2012, access date 23-03-2012 New Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center Tops Out, ENR California, 14-07-2011, access date 23-03-2012 ==University partnerships== The Oakland Medical Center maintains a relationship with the Tang Center, the UC Berkeley student clinic for medical needs outside the scope of the Tang Center's episodic medicine capabilities.Tang Center/Oakland Kaiser, KP.org, 2012, access date 23-03-2012 Furthermore Mills College has a similar relationship with Kaiser Oakland.Kaiser Permanente at Mills College, KP.org, 2012, access date 23-03-2012 The Mills student health center hosts a Kaiser doctor and nurse.

It opened this division in 1989 and has received complaints for years, although these are the first serious violations. The nurses say the problems stem from budget cuts, understaffing, and increased regulations. The nurses have described the patient record keeping as \\"deplorable\\".Kaiser Hospice Under Threat Of Losing Medicare Funding, Janet Wells, San Francisco Chronicle, 10-01-2012, access date 23-03-2012 Moreover due to the conditions the Health Care Financing Administration has threatened to cut Kaiser's $700,000 Medicare disbursement. The HCFA cited patient care violations such as misdiagnoses and medication delays. Kaiser responded with a 90-day plan to fix the issues. The hospital is required to provide 24-hour care but this service especially the nurse advice line has been described as \\"shoddy\\". Nurses report that although Kaiser acts to fix problems quickly, it chooses temporary fixes over long term solutions to bigger problems in a routine fashion. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that once investigators leave \\"it all goes down the tubes again\\" and that management changes the charting system monthly causing distress for the employees. It has also been reported that staff have been banned from charting anything that could arouse the suspicions of inspectors such as medical record errors and that some workers had been written up for doing so. Kaiser's spokesperson reported that morale is low and the medical facility is undergoing \\"tough\\" and \\"turbulent\\" times. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * Official webpage * This hospital in the CA Healthcare Atlas A project by OSHPD * Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center - U.S. News & World Report - Health Category:Hospitals in Oakland, California Category:Hospitals in Alameda County, California Category:Kaiser Permanente hospitals Category:1942 establishments in California ","title":"Oakland Medical Center"},{"id":"35200253","text":"Moores Corner is an unincorporated community in Kent County, Delaware, United States.

The actor auditioned for the part of Alex and was told he had won the role on the same day. His casting was announced in June 1997. Maxwell said he was thrilled to get the part, and he hoped his character would have some juicy storylines lined up. Maxwell made his first screen appearance as Alex during the episode broadcast on 9 July 1997. Alex was a young aristocrat, who inherited Oakwell Hall. A writer for the Daily Mirror branded Alex a womaniser and said he was arrogant and self-centred. Maxwell stated his character would not be the most popular person in Emmerdale. The character appeared as the estranged husband of Tara Cockburn (Anna Brecon), and later embarked on an affair and business partnership with local businesswoman Kim Tate (Claire King). He continued to pursue her even after he married Tara. Alex developed a drug addiction and during Emmerdale's 25th anniversary episode, he caused the death of Linda Fowler (Tonicha Jeronimo). While out for a drive with Linda, Alex snorted cocaine and tried to molest her. As she fought him off, Alex crashed the car and when he saw Linda was unconscious, he moved her into the driver's seat. Alex made a return to the village in February 1998 during a one-hour episode and he later appeared in the spin-off Emmerdale: Revenge, in which he died after falling from a roof. Mark Oliver of The People referred to Alex as \\"dashing\\", while Tony Purnell of the Daily Mirror branded him \\"the biggest baddie on the box.\\" ==Storylines== Lord Alex Oakwell and his fiancée, Tara Cockburn (Anna Brecon), form a partnership with local businesswoman Kim Tate (Claire King) at Home Farm Estates. Alex soon begins an affair with Kim, even though she is engaged to Steve Marchant (Paul Opacic). Alex and Tara marry, but Alex continues his affair with Kim, until Steve discovers them and warns Kim that Alex has an ulterior motive. Kim continues to build her partnership with Alex, but she eventually questions his character when she catches him taking cocaine in the midst of her engagement party. During the party, Alex flirts with local vet nurse Linda Fowler (Tonicha Jeronimo) and he offers to take her home, to which Linda agrees. Alex takes more cocaine, and Linda has to fight him off when he attempts to molest her. Alex loses control of his car and crashes into a tree, injuring Linda. He then moves an unconscious Linda to the driver's seat and flees the area, after kissing her goodbye. As a result, Linda is incriminated for causing the car accident and she later dies in hospital. A few months later, Alex returns to the village and feigns remorse for killing Linda to Tara, who attempts to use this opportunity to get revenge by agreeing to leave the country and start anew with him. However, Alex betrays Tara when he takes her jewellery and leaves without her – leaving Tara heartbroken. Alex takes Linda's father Ned Glover (Johnny Leeze) and her husband Biff Fowler (Stuart Wade) hostage at gunpoint, before kidnapping Steve, Linda's colleague, vet Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) and Ned's friend Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell). Though he loses control of the siege when Paddy injects one of Alex's henchmen before he can shoot Zak dead, Alex manages to flee the village. Ten months later, Linda's younger brother Roy Glover (Nicky Evans) learns that Alex has resurfaced in London and sets out to avenge Linda's death. Teaming up with Dan Campbell (Richard Dillane), a detective sergeant who worked undercover in Alex's empire to investigate his criminal activities, Roy peruses Alex and they fight on a roof. Alex ends up hanging from the edge of the roof, and pleads for Roy to help him. Roy reluctantly attempts to help Alex to safety, but Alex loses his grip and falls to his death. ==Casting== Maxwell told Linda Udall of The People that he was \\"absolutely thrilled\\" to get the part of Alex. He explained \\"Landing a part in Emmerdale is the biggest thing that has happened in my career. It's such a fantastic opportunity for me. I went for an audition on a Thursday morning, I was offered the part in the afternoon and started filming the following Monday. It's been absolutely incredible.\\" Maxwell said he was unsure what was in store for his character, but he hoped it would be juicy. He believed that he was going to enjoy the part and added \\"I've never played a lover before and I'm looking forward to getting some experience at this particular role.\\" Maxwell made his debut screen appearance as Alex on 9 July 1997. ==Development== Maxwell described Alex as \\"a sexy young aristocrat\\" and said he did not think he was anything like his character. Udall called Alex a \\"thrusting young newcomer\\", while a writer for the Daily Mirror said he was \\"an arrogant, self-centred womaniser.\\" Of Alex, Maxwell later said \\"I have to find a positive side to his character but I have to admit it can be pretty hard with a person like Alex. He is weak-willed, arrogant and motivated by self-preservation. He is certainly not going to be the most popular person in Emmerdale.\\" Alex soon encountered Kim Tate (Claire King) and she initially dismissed him for a stable hand, but when she learnt he was a lord, she changed her attitude towards him. Kim made a play for Alex, seeing him as a wealthy potential investor.Parkin 2002, p.101. King told Helen Childs of Inside Soap that Kim finds Alex's title very attractive, as soon as she learnt he was a lord, he became more fanciable to her. Childs said it was an added bonus that Alex happened to be \\"handsome toy-boy material as well.\\" Kim tried to charm her way into Alex's affections, but his fiancée Tara Cockburn (Anna Brecon) stood in her way. Describing Kim's reaction to Tara, King said \\"She doesn't believe Alex genuinely loves Tara either. It's one of those marriages of convenience, where they've known each other since they were six and their daddies expected them to marry. In fact, it's almost like an arranged marriage.\\" Kim tried to put an end to Alex's engagement, by using their business deals over the stud farm. Alex was aware that Kim had money, which he needed as he was almost broke. Kim believed she could be a part of Alex's life, by throwing money at him. Childs explained Kim's partner Steve Marchant (Paul Opacic) could only stand back and watch Kim try to secure a place among the upper classes and added that with Alex on the scene, Steve did not stand a chance. Kim later invested in Alex's stud farm and he continued to show an interest in her even after he married Tara in a lavish ceremony on 21 August 1997.Parkin 2002, p.185. Opacic said Steve did not know Kim and Alex had begun an affair, as he assumed a lord would not be interested in a middle- class woman like Kim. During the soap's 25th anniversary episode broadcast in late 1997, Alex caused the death of regular character Linda Fowler (Tonicha Jeronimo). While attending Kim's engagement party at Home Farm, Alex was caught snorting cocaine in the bathroom. He later flirted with Linda, after she had a row with Biff Fowler (Stuart Wade), and he offered to take her for a drive in his sports car. Alex was seen snorting cocaine while driving and he tried to molest Linda, who fought him off. The fight caused Alex to crash the car into a ditch and when he discovered Linda was unconscious, he moved her into the driver's seat. The Daily Mirror's Tony Purnell said \\"The lecherous lord escaped serious injury and fled the scene\\". Biff then discovered Linda's lifeless body in the car. Alex later returned to the village in a one-hour special broadcast on 10 February 1998. The episode was described as being \\"dramatic\\" and \\"action-packed\\" by a writer for Inside Soap. The cast and crew were due to film the whole episode shortly before Christmas, but an unexpected snow flurry forced a schedule change and they had to finish filming in January 1998 instead. Alex then appeared in the spin-off Emmerdale: Revenge, which was released on video on 20 November 1998.Parkin 2002, p.107. Linda's brother, Roy (Nicky Evans), tracked him down to London, where he was found to be involved in a drugs gang. While being chased across a roof, Alex slipped and fell to his death. ==Reception== Linda Udall of The People said \\"Maxwell looks like he could have stepped straight from the pages of a Jilly Cooper sex and saddle saga. In skin-tight jodhpurs, black leather riding boots and flexing a horse whip in his hands he positively oozes sex appeal.\\" Udall's colleague, Mark Oliver called Alex \\"dashing\\", while Dave Lanning called him a \\"wimp husband\\". Tony Purnell of the Daily Mirror branded Alex a \\"cad\\" and said he was \\"turning into the biggest baddie on the box.\\" A reporter for the Daily Record called Alex \\"villainous\\". A columnist for Inside Soap named Alex and Kim's relationship as one of the \\"Hot affairs of the Dales\\", writing that \\"Lady of the Manor Kim got more than she bargained for when she found out that aristocrat Alex was due to get married to Tara.\\" ==References== * ==External links== * Character profile at MTV3 * Character profile at the Internet Movie Database Category:Emmerdale characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1997 Category:Fictional cocaine users Category:Male characters in television Category:Male villains ","title":"Lord Alex Oakwell"},{"id":"35200323","text":"Kyle Brandon O'Quinn (born March 26, 1990) is an American professional basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association.

It was named in honour of Russian admiral Pavel Nakhimov, one of the most famous admirals in Russian naval history. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the award was potentially and only temporarily retained by Decree No 2424-1 of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation of March 2, 1992. It was never awarded under the Russian Federation and finally removed from the list of state awards by decree of the President of the Russian Federation of March 2, 1994. == Award statute == The Medal of Nakhimov was awarded to sailors and soldiers, petty officers and sergeants, ensigns and warrant officers of the Soviet Navy, Naval Infantry and naval units of the Soviet Border Troops for courage and bravery displayed during the defence of the Soviet Union in naval theatres, while protecting the maritime borders of the USSR, during military duties with a risk to life. 14,020 people were awarded the Medal of Nakhimov from its creation in 1944 to its abolishment in 1994. The Medal of Nakhimov was worn on the left side of the chest and when in the presence of other orders and medals of the Soviet Union, it was situated immediately after the Medal \\"For Battle Merit\\". If worn in the presence of orders or medals of the Russian Federation, the latter have precedence. == Award description == The Medal of Nakhimov was a 36mm in diameter circular bronze medal with a raised rim. The obverse had at its center the relief left profile bust of admiral Nakhimov, surrounded by small beading along the entire medal circumference, also along the circumference, in the upper half on either side of the bust, the relief inscription \\"ADMIRAL NAKHIMOV\\" (Russian: «АДМИРАЛ НАХИМОВ»), in the lower half, a relief five pointed star over laurel branches. The reverse bore the same small beading along the entire circumference. At the center a medallion bearing a sailing ship surrounded by a ring of rope over crossed naval anchors connected together by a circular chain surrounding the medallion and passing below the lower tips of the anchors. The Medal of Ushakov was suspended from a standard Soviet pentagonal mount by a ring through the suspension loop. The mount was covered by an overlapping 24mm wide silk moiré blue ribbon with three central 3mm wide white stripes situated 2mm apart. == See also == *Awards and decorations of the Soviet Union *Order of Nakhimov == References  * Legal Library of the Soviet Union * The Commission on State Awards to the President of the Russian Federation Category:Military awards and decorations of the Soviet Union Category:Military awards and decorations of Russia Category:Courage awards Category:Awards established in 1944 Category:Awards disestablished in 1994 ","title":"Medal of Nakhimov"},{"id":"35200340","text":"The Michigan Crossroads Council (MCC) is a local council of the Boy Scouts of America that serves the youth of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.

The Michigan Crossroads Council (MCC) was created by the merger of nine councils in the lower peninsula of Michigan. It is a coordinating council that oversees properties, personnel, and program. The MCC is then split into four sub-councils or \\"Field Service Councils\\" which are then divided into districts. * Great Lakes Field Service Council * President Gerald R. Ford Field Service Council * Southern Shores Field Service Council * Water & Woods Field Service Council ==History== BSA Councils in Michigan prior to the Area 2 project and the Michigan Crossroads Council The Scouting program in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan saw a drastic drop in membership beginning in the early 2000s. The decrease in population was due to the economy in Michigan and the resulting out-migration of population, jobs and industry. The Area 2 Project was created in 2010 and studied the impact on Scouting and presented the Crossroads Recommendation, which proposed that the ten councils in Michigan merge into one large council. Erie Shores Council in northwest Ohio voted not to join Area 2 project. Hiawathaland Council in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, voted against merging into MCC and later merged with the Bay-Lakes Council in Wisconsin. As a result, in 2012, the remaining lower peninsula councils were merged into the Michigan Crossroads Council and its Field Service Councils. ==Camps== All properties in the Michigan Crossroads Council are operated by the council-wide Outdoor Adventures Division. Each year, the Outdoor Adventures Committee assesses the council property and determines which programs each camp will be operating such as resident summer camps, weekend camping, or shooting sports activities.

Mulliken (June 10, 1872 – June 20, 1952) was an early twentieth- century American architect and developer who built many of his works in New York City, NY. Mulliken’s apartment and hotel buildings are remarkable for their Beaux-Arts-style and broad use of architectural terra cotta set around flat, and often red, brick. == Biography == Born in Sterling, Illinois in 1872, Mulliken graduated from Columbia University's School of Arts with a Bachelor of Philosophy, course in Architecture, in 1895. He graduated with his future partner, Edgar J. Moeller, although their formal partnership did not begin for another seven years.\\"Graduates of Columbia\\", The New York Times, June 13, 1895. In a passport application submitted in 1894 as a student from New York City, Mulliken listed his permanent residence as Detroit, Michigan and his attributes as 6’1” in height, blue eyes, brown hair, a high forehead, a straight nose, a small mouth, heavy chin, and fair complexion. In another passport application submitted in 1896, Mulliken listed his new permanent residence as Chicago, Illinois and he had recently married Ellen C. Emerson (née December 23, 1872) of Stillwater, Minnesota in January 1896. He also records his new occupation as architect. Mulliken professionally began his working career in the employment of the Chicago architect Daniel H. Burnham (1895–1896) and later the New York architect Ernest Flagg (1897). Mulliken opened an office with Edwin E. Pruitt in July 1899 at 289 Fourth Avenue.Real estate record and builders' guide New York, F. W. Dodge Corp.

New York, N.Y. : Columbia University Libraries, 2010. Mulliken appears as a Lead Architect in 1900, designing properties under his name alone. Then, Mulliken and Edgar J. Moeller created the partnership for which each is better known, Mulliken & Moeller, in 1902. After their return to New York, Mulliken, his wife, and four children eventually moved to Pelham, NY where he and his wife would remain throughout his known life. He died in his home in Pelham at the age of 80, three years after his retirement, and was survived by his wife of fifty-six years and each of his children. == Selected works == Ameritania Hotel * Madison Court Apartments (1900–1901) – Mulliken as architect. 1361 Madison Avenue, aka 51 East 95th Street.

The resulting 800,000 gallon spill, the largest in Bay Area history, threatened sensitive natural habitats both inside and outside the bay, including the Bolinas Lagoon, and contributed to the growth of activism against pollution, after thousands of bay area residents volunteered to clean up beaches and rescue oil soaked birds. A number of environmental organizations had their origins in the spill cleanup. Standard Oil spent more than $1 million in the clean-up. ==Inception of International Bird Rescue and volunteerism== In March 1971, California's Fish and Game Department estimated that 7,000 birds were oiled during the incident, most of which died prior to collection or while being taken into care. At the end of January 1971, roughly 200 of the 1600 birds \\"brought in\\" were still alive. Ultimately less than 80 of those survived. The resulting environmental destruction from the spill, specifically the avian population, prompted volunteers to rescue some 4,300 birds. At the time, knowledge on how to care for oiled birds was low. Despite best efforts, only 300 or so animals were ever deemed fit to be released. The remnants of this volunteer force eventually resulted in the creation of the International Bird Rescue in an endeavor to increase knowledge and research in bird rescue. One of the largest volunteer turnouts since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake came of this event. ==See also== *Cosco Busan oil spill *List of oil spills *John Francis, an environmentalist whose career began with the spill ==References *Photographs of the spill at SmugMug *40th anniversary blog at the International Bird Rescue Research (founded at the time of the spill) *\\"The early bird gets the oily bird\\", a first hand account of the volunteer bird cleaning efforts at FoundSF *PRBO Conservation Science originating in the spill *PBS film of work constructing oil barriers at Bolinas Lagoon during the spill Category:Oil spills in the United States San Francisco Bay oil spill Category:Environment of the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Disasters in California Category:Petroleum in California Category:Standard Oil San Francisco Bay oil spill San Francisco Bay oil spill San Francisco Bay oil spill Category:Environmental issues in California Category:History of the San Francisco Bay Area ","title":"1971 San Francisco Bay oil spill"},{"id":"35200449","text":"Hickman is an unincorporated community in Kent County, Delaware, United States.

The ECHL Board of Governors created the ECHL Hall of Fame to recognize the achievements of players, coaches, and personnel who dedicated their careers to the league. Hall of Fame members are selected in four categories: Player, Developmental Player, Builder, and Referee/Linesman. Players must have concluded their career as an active player for a minimum of three playing seasons, though not continuous or full seasons. Developmental Players must have begun their career in the ECHL and went on to a distinguished career in the NHL, playing a minimum of 260 regular season games in the NHL, AHL and ECHL. Builders may be active or inactive whereas Referee/Linesman must have concluded their active officiating career for a minimum of three playing seasons. No more than five candidates are elected to the Hall of Fame each year with no more than three Players, one Developmental Player, two Builders and one Referee/Linesman. The Builder and the Referee/Linesman categories are dependent upon the number of candidates in the Player category. The nomination and subsequent selection of candidates is determined by the ECHL Hall of Fame Selection Committee which is appointed by the ECHL. The ECHL Hall of Fame inaugural class was inducted during the 2008 ECHL All-Star Game festivities at Stockton Arena in Stockton, California, and included ECHL founder Henry Brabham, the ECHL's first commissioner Patrick J.

As a result, Extra, which was on channel 94 at the time, was moved to channel 95, replacing its timeshift service Extra 2.

On 19 January 2016, Extra replaced WIN's five-hour timeshift of their datacasting channel Gold on channel 82. When WIN and NBN launched 9Life in March 2016, their channel listings were reshuffled to mirror Nine's metropolitan listings. Extra ceased broadcasting on 24 September 2018 with the channel space to be occupied by Your Money, a joint venture business channel between Nine and Australian News Channel. Promotional trailers for Your Money were shown during the period until 6:00 am Eastern on 1 October 2018, when the new channel came on air. After Your Money was closed down on 17 May 2019, its DTT channel space was taken by an HD version of 9Gem.

During qualifying, forty-six cars were entered, but only forty-three were able to race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Hamlin clinched is tenth career pole position, with a time of 38.626. After his qualifying run, Hamlin commented, \\"We're four weeks in, and we've had two good weeks and two bad weeks. There's light at the end of the tunnel. I feel like this weekend we've got a little bit more speed than we had in Vegas. We're getting better, and we've got some good stuff coming with our team. We're obviously heading in the right direction.\\" He was joined on the front row of the grid by Kyle Busch. Martin qualified third, Biffle took fourth, and Kahne started fifth. The three drivers that did not qualify were Robby Gordon, Joe Nemechek and Timmy Hill. Hamlin was quickest in the second practice session with a time of 38.706 seconds.

Harvick, Kenseth, Martin Truex, Jr., and Stewart completed the first ten positions during the session. Race The race, the fifth in the season, began at 3:12 p.m. EDT and was televised live in the United States on Fox. The conditions on the grid were dry before the race while cloudy skies were expected. Jeff Hamilton, of Motor Racing Outreach, began pre-race ceremonies, by giving the invocation. Next, Night Ranger performed the national anthem, and the trio of Sean Hayes, Chris Diamantopoulos, Will Sass (from the film The Three Stooges) gave the command for drivers to start their engines. Pole position winner, Hamlin maintained the lead throughout the first lap, but was overtaken by Kyle Busch on the following lap. As the weather became worse for racing conditions, many teams adjusted their cars during the first set of green flag pit stops. On the 85th lap, Stewart claimed the lead from Kyle Busch. Shortly after, Stewart moved back into the lead ahead of Hamlin and Kyle Busch after pitting. The race ran 250 miles without incident, with the first caution on Lap 125 for rain. During pit stops, Stewart refused to pit, while Hamlin in the second position and a few others did. Also during the caution, Johnson, who had been in the top-ten for most of the race, began having problems with a potential oil leak, causing the smoke to run out of under the car. Afterward, the caution flag turned to a red flag, stalling the race because of the rain shower. Afterward, NASCAR decided the end the race, making Stewart the winner. Kyle Busch finished second, ahead of Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Harvick and Edwards. Biffle, Ryan Newman, Martin Truex, Jr., Kurt Busch, and Johnson rounded out the first ten positions. It was the first time a NASCAR race in the premiership had gone without an incident-related safety car since the October 2002 Talladega race. ==Results== Qualifying Denny Hamlin scored the pole position. {  - !

He became a Dominican friar and hermit after his return from a long pilgrimage that took him to both Rome and to Jerusalem. He became noted as a wonderworker who made miracles occur and he was known for his solitude and silence in reflection in order to better achieve communication with God. His beatification received approval in late 1561 under Pope Pius IV. ==Life== Gundisalvus was born in 1187 in Portugal to nobles. It was said at his baptism he fixed his intense gaze upon the Crucifix as he was being carried to the baptismal font. He was devoted to Jesus Christ in his childhood and decided to become a priest. He later received his ordination from the Archbishop of Braga after the successful completion of his studies and distributed his great wealth to his nephews. The new priest spent time in his parish of Saint Paio de Vizela and obtained leave so as to go to visit Rome and Jerusalem while leaving his priest nephew in charge of his parish. It was held that he returned from the pilgrimage after just over a decade. He visited the tombs of Saint Peter and Saint Paul before going to Jerusalem via ship. Gundisalvus returned to find that austere measures he now upheld in his life were something that his nephew did not welcome and who set a dog upon him while viewing him as nothing more than a vagrant. Discernment led Gundisalvus to the Order of Preachers to which he was admitted into and he was allowed to live as a hermit who was in the service of his local people. He built a bridge himself over the Tâmega River. The workers who helped build the bridge once ran out of wine leading him to smack a rock with his stick causing it to split open with wine pouring out of it. On another occasion the workers ran out of food and he went to the water and called out promoting fish to jump onto the river bank providing the workers with food. He died in 1259. Cakes São Gonçalo Pastries, a type of erotic pastry from Portugal with supposed origins in pre-Christian Celtic fertility rites. The so-called \\"Bolos de São Gonçalo\\" (associated as promoting fertileness and fruitfulness) are associated with Amarante. The reason for the association with the name of Gonçalo is disputed and obscure. ==Beatification== Pope Pius IV beatified him on 16 September 1561. But Pope Julius III had before on 24 April 1551 allowed for public worship in his name in Portugal though did not allow his beatification at that time. Pope Clement X - after the beatification - extended his public worship with a Mass and Divine Office to Portugal and the entire Dominican order. The late priest is considered to be quite popular in Brazil and has several localities named after him such as São Gonçalo de Amarante and São Gonçalo. ==References * Saints SQPN Category:1187 births Category:1259 deaths Category:12th-century Portuguese people Category:12th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:12th-century venerated Christians Category:13th-century Portuguese people Category:13th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:13th- century venerated Christians Category:Portuguese beatified people Category:Dominican beatified people Category:Hermits Category:People from Vizela Category:Portuguese Dominicans Category:Portuguese Roman Catholic saints Category:Venerated Catholics Category:Venerated Dominicans ","title":"Gundisalvus of Amarante"},{"id":"35200537","text":"Bob Woods (born January 24, 1968) is a Canadian ice hockey coach and former player.

He lived with the family of Dr. Nathaniel Stafford in Baltimore until joining the Union Army in 1861 during the Civil War. Afterward, McNeese moved to Menard County, Texas, where he became a businessman and rancher. He also served as the county's clerk from 1871 to 1873. In 1873, McNeese began a cattle drive to New Orleans, but due to a drought and the Panic of 1873, he was forced to end the drive after reaching the Sabine River. He sold his cattle and settled in Oberlin. McNeese married Susan Bilbo in 1876; the couple had nine children, seven of whom survived infancy. In 1887, McNeese earned his law degree from Tulane University in New Orleans. The next year, he was hired as the first Superintendent of Schools of Imperial Calcasieu Parish. As superintendent, McNeese advanced education in the parish; he pioneered the concept of using taxes to fund parish schools, supported consolidated schools in rural areas, and advocated supervision of rural schools in the parish. McNeese retired in 1913, and died a year later on June 5, 1914. In 1940, Lake Charles Junior College changed its name to John McNeese Junior College to recognize McNeese.

Names have been changed to protect the identities of the deceased.\\" \\"WARNING: The deaths portrayed in this show are real and extremely graphic.\\" The disclaimer then cuts to a scene of a city at night, followed by images of various manners of death, either from episodes or file footages, while the voice-over reads the monologue, which appears in \\"comic-book\\" style (comic font inside yellow boxes, as in a comic book): > \\"The human body is remarkably resilient...\\" > (Note: in the following sentence, only the ALL CAPPED words are illustrated > in large, red \\"Sin City\\"/\\"comic\\" font; the rest are only heard) \\"Every day > we fight a new WAR against GERMS, TOXINS, INJURY, ILLNESS, CATASTROPHE and > Calamity.\\" > \\"The fact that we survive at all is a miracle...\\" > \\"Because, every day we live...\\" > \\"We face 1000 WAYS TO DIE.\\" The first story begins with the opening screenshot drawn as a comic, which fades to the live action. The narrator gives an account of the story as it unfolds, describing the circumstances leading up to the death and details of the death itself. The story is interspersed with expert testimony from physicians and scientists about the science of the death (what happens to the body, etc.). The story ends with another comic screenshot, over which the \\"Way to Die # \\" and the nickname for the death is typed over the image in black and red \\"True Crimes\\"/\\"Sin City\\"/\\"comic\\" font.

Season One was written and directed by Tom McMahon. The third episode also debuted a new narrator, actor Ron Perlman, instead of Beers, who previously narrated the pilot episodes. The episodes in the rest of Season One, while maintaining the \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" story-telling aspect of the first two shows, vary in formatting compared to the pilot. The \\"comic-book\\" styling is completely gone, as are the trivia bits between segments. Each episode opens with a voice-over by the narrator giving brief summaries of upcoming deaths, accompanied by clips. This fades to a more ominous version of the previous disclaimer: white wording on black background, while a deeper, echoing voice-over reads: > \\"WARNING: The deaths portrayed in this show are real and extremely graphic.\\" > \\"Names have been changed to protect the identities of the deceased.\\" > \\"Do not attempt to try ANY of the actions depicted.\\" > \\"YOU WILL DIE!\\" (the word \\"DIE\\" reverberates ominously). The disclaimer then cuts to animation depicting human figures encountering various deaths, while the voice-over reads (Note: only the ALL CAPPED words are illustrated): > \\"Death...is everywhere. Most of us try to avoid it, others can't get out of > its way. Every day we fight a new war against GERMS, TOXINS, INJURY, > ILLNESS, and CATASTROPHE.\\" > \\"There's a lot of ways to wind up dead. The fact that we survive at all is > a miracle, because every day we live, we face.... 1000 WAYS TO DIE.\\" This introduction cuts to a screenshot of the \\"victim\\", framed by gray grainy film art, and information appears as being typed out onto screen: \\"DATE\\" and \\"LOCATION\\" (Typing in the ¨Dirty Ego¨ font) . The stories are played out as in the \\"Pilot Season\\", but end as they began, with a different screenshot of the \\"victim\\" (this time, they are usually dead), again framed in grainy film art, over which the \\"Way to Die # \\" and the nickname for the death typed over the image in yellow and red text in the \\"True Crimes\\" font. Two stories are shown in this manner, then an outro to the commercial says, \\"Coming up:\\" followed by brief, clever descriptions of upcoming deaths. This is usually repeated twice. After the last commercial break, the real-life story is shown, followed immediately by the end credits, which appear as white spray-painted bold letters on a grainy film background, backed by heavy metal music.

Prior to her election to the State Legislature, Kitchen was an attorney, and later managed the health care regulatory group of Price Waterhouse Coopers. ==Political career== Kitchen also served as a policy adviser to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. She began her career in the Texas Attorney General's consumer protection division. Texas House of Representatives Ann Kitchen was elected to the Texas State House of Representatives, District 48, in the election of 2000. She was defeated for reelection in 2002 by Republican Todd Baxter following the 2000 redistricting in Texas.Smith, Amy, \\"Dream on, Dream Team\\",Austin Chronicle, Nov 8, 2002 In the legislature, she is best remembered for her contributions to House Bill 1156, which expanded women's access to health care, and Senate Bill 11, the Medical Records Privacy Act. After leaving the legislature, Ann Kitchen was Executive Director of the Indigent Care Collaboration (ICC) a regional collaboration of public and private hospitals, clinics, MHMR, public health departments, university medical departments, and medical society responsible for providing care for uninsured individuals. Austin City Council Ann Kitchen is currently Vice Chair of the City of Austin Charter Revision Committee and is City Councilmember for District 5. Kitchen was elected to Austin City Council District 5 on November 4, 2014. She garnered 54% of the vote in a field of seven candidates and avoided a runoff election. She was sworn in on January 6, 2015. In 2015, Kitchen proposed regulations on ridesharing companies such as Uber and Lyft. These regulations were presented as necessary for public safety, such as a requirement for fingerprinting rideshare drivers. Opponents, noting that Kitchen received campaign contributions from taxi companies, claimed that the gross receipts tax, rules on fares, and other regulations included in the proposal threatened to drive those companies out of Austin. On May 9, Kitchen's proposed regulations went into effect after a ballot proposition to alter them, backed by an $8 million Uber/Lyft-funded PAC, was defeated in a special election. In response, Uber and Lyft ceased services in Austin. In May 2017, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 100, which overruled local ride-share regulations and removed the fingerprint-screening requirement. The non-profit Texans for Public Justice reports that Uber and Lyft spent up to $2.3 million in support of the statewide legislation. 2018 Re-Election In 2018, Ann Kitchen was elected to her second term in City Council after running unopposed. Recall Efforts In January 2016, a recall petition against Kitchen was circulated and submitted to the City Clerk in February 2016 by the Austin4All PAC. Austin4All was criticized by city leaders and many Austinites for its purported lack of transparency and multiple ethics complaints were filed against the PAC, claiming Austin4All violated state election law by knowingly accepting political contributions and making political expenditure over $500 without filing a campaign treasurer appointment. Groups supporting Councilwoman Kitchen were formed as well in order to oppose Austin4All's petition. In February 2016, Austin4All submitted 5,289 signatures to the city clerk's office. City Clerk Jannette Goodall rejected the recall petition shortly after, citing the group's failure to sign petition sheets in the presence of a notary. In October 2019, Kitchen was one of several Austin City Council members, along with Mayor Steve Adler, faced a recall effort due to the City’s handling of homelessness camping regulations. As of May 2020, the recall effort was still active but had not successfully gained the number of signatures required to put the recall on a ballot. ==References== Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Austin City Council members ","title":"Ann Kitchen"},{"id":"35200641","text":"Kim Pearce (born 1985) is an English theatre director. ==Education== Pearce attended Dame Alice Harpur School (now part of Bedford Girls' School).

The tree was unusual, both for its location since the only other scattered trees in the area grew next to water, and because hackberry trees were not native to the region. As a result, there were a variety of stories to explain the origin of the tree, including a Native American legend that a great chief had been buried there along with a medicine bag containing hackberry seeds. In 1936 Colorado planned to extend State Highway 121 over the hill at the location of the hackberry tree. Due to local opposition, plans were made to transplant the tree, and a ditch was dug around the tree in preparation. However, in 1937, the tree was cut down by vandals before it could be moved. Hackberry Hill Elementary School was put near that hill. In 1966 a roadside park was established to the west of the highway with a new hackberry tree and a sign commemorating the original tree. ==References== Category:Arvada, Colorado Category:Landforms of Jefferson County, Colorado Category:Hills of the United States Category:Landforms of Colorado ","title":"Hackberry Hill"},{"id":"35200674","text":"Waninawa, also known as Kamanawa and Panoan Katukína, is a Panoan language of Brazil.

It was renamed Brau und Brunnen in 1988. It owned a number of formerly independent breweries, including Einbecker Brewery. Until the early 1990s, Brau und Brunnen was the largest beverage company in Germany, but its market share steadily declined throughout the 1990s. An additional cause for the decline was the company's purchase of Bavaria – St. Pauli Brewery and Jever for an estimated 800 million DM, although these purchases were later estimated to only be worth closer to 250 million DM. Other companies engaged in a series of mergers and acquisitions, and by 1999, it had sunk to the fourth-largest beverage company and was continually losing money. After unsuccessful internal reorganizations, the company was purchased by Dr. August Oetker KG and integrated into its subsidiary Radeberger Gruppe. ==See alsoReferences * Category:Beer in Germany Category:German companies established in 1972 Category:Food and drink companies established in 1972 ","title":"Brau und Brunnen"},{"id":"35200742","text":"Atswawaka, also called Atsahuaca, or Atsawaka-Yamiaka, is an extinct Panoan language of Peru.

He won two EuroLeague championships with Maccabi Tel Aviv, in 1977 and 1981, while reaching the EuroLeague Final another time in 1980. In the 1977 final, he led all scorers with 26 points. ==Amateur career== Boatwright graduated from Minico High School in Rupert, Idaho, in 1970, where he lettered in basketball, track and golf. He led the Spartans to back-to-back state championship games in 1969 and 1970. As a junior, he averaged 37 points per game during the state tournament. He still holds the record for most free throws taken and made. Boatwright is the second-leading Minico scorer, all time. Having earned a slew of All-State and All-American honors, Boatwright received a scholarship to play at Utah State University. He was the leading scorer in both his junior and senior seasons at Logan, and was named Utah State's top athlete in 1974, the same year in which he graduated with a degree in political science. ==Professional career== Boatwright played for Maccabi Tel Aviv of the Israeli Basketball Super League, from 1974 to 1982. He began playing only in EuroLeague, until 1976, when he also started playing in the Israeli League. Maccabi won the EuroLeague championship in 1977, and Boatwright was the team's leading scorer. ==National team career== Boatwright was selected as a member of the Israeli Olympic basketball team for the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics. While playing for Maccabi, Boatwright had acquired Israeli citizenship. He was consequently able to participate in the EuroBasket 1981, as a member of the senior Israeli national team. At EuroBasket 1981, he averaged 9.6 points a game, and helped Israel finish in sixth place. ==Post playing career== In 1983, Boatwright began teaching and coaching at Star Valley, Wyoming. He guided his team to the state championship, and was named Wyoming's \\"Coach of the Year.\\" He later taught at elementary and secondary schools in Wyoming, Arizona, and California. In addition, Boatwright, a father of four, and married to Jennifer Magrane Boatwright, ran Snowline Basketball Camp across the Western US for 24 years. In 2003, Boatwright became an assistant boys' basketball coach and history teacher at Wood River High School of Hailey, Idaho. He resigned in December 2012, to undergo chemotherapy. Boatwright died on February 11, 2013, of liver cancer in Ketchum, Idaho.http://woodriverchapel.com/book-of-memories/1496400/Boatwright- James/service-details.php ==References *FIBA Profile *FIBA Europe Profile Category:1951 births Category:2013 deaths Category:American expatriate basketball people in Israel Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball coaches from Idaho Category:Basketball players from Idaho Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Converts to Judaism Category:High school basketball coaches in Idaho Category:High school basketball coaches in Wyoming Category:Israeli men's basketball players Category:Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C. players Category:Naturalized citizens of Israel Category:People from Rupert, Idaho Category:People from Twin Falls, Idaho Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Schoolteachers from Wyoming Category:Small forwards Category:Utah State Aggies men's basketball coaches Category:Utah State Aggies men's basketball players ","title":"Jim Boatwright"},{"id":"35200771","text":"The Arnold River is a river in the north of the Northern Territory of Australia. ==Course and features== The Arnold River rises about northeast of the Bullwaddy Conservation Reserve and north of the Carpentaria Highway.

Low-threshold programs may be contrasted with \\"high-threshold\\" programs, which require the user to accept a certain level of control and which demand that the patient accept counselling. Low-threshold treatment programs are not to be confused with simple needle exchange programs, and may include comprehensive healthcare and counseling services. The International Journal of Drug Policy in its volume 24 published an Editorial which endeavoured to define a service known to be \\"low-threshold\\", based on some popular and known criteria. According to that Editorial, low-threshold services for drug users can be defined as those which offer services to drug users; do not impose abstinence from drug use as a condition of service access; and endeavour to reduce other documented barriers to service access. ==Background== Injection drug users (IDUs) are at risk of a wide range of health problems arising from non-sterile injecting practices, complications of the drug itself or of the lifestyle associated with drug use and dependence. Furthermore, unrelated health problems, such as diabetes, may be neglected because of drug dependence. However, despite their increased health care needs, IDUs do not have the required access to care or may be reluctant to use conventional services. Consequently, their health may deteriorate to a point at which emergency treatment is required, with considerable costs to both the IDUs and the health system. Accordingly, harm reduction based health care centers, also known as targeted health care outlet or low-threshold health care outlet for IDUs have been established across a range of settings utilising a variety of models. These targeted outlets provide integrated, low-threshold services within a harm-reduction framework targeting IDUs, and sometimes include social and/or other services. Where a particular service is not provided, referral and assistance with access is available. In 2007, for example, 33% of all US needle-syringe programs (NSPs) provided on-site medical care, and 7% provided buprenorphine treatment. Similarly, in many European countries NSP outlets serve as low-threshold primary health care centers targeting primarily IDUs. ==Health care models== These targeted outlets vary widely and may be either \\"distributive\\", providing basic harm reduction services and simple healthcare with facilitated referrals to specialist services, or \\"one-stop-shops\\" where a range of services including specialist services are provided onsite. The services being offered by these outlets range from simple needle and syringe provision, to expanded services including basic and preventive primary healthcare, hepatitis B and A vaccinations, hepatitis C testing, counselling, tuberculosis screening and sometimes opioid maintenance therapy. Some centers offer hepatitis, HIV treatment and dental care. The goal of these outlets is to provide: (1) opportunistic health care, (2) increased temporal and spatial availability of health care, (3) trustworthy services of health care, (4) cost-effective mode of health care, (5) targeted and tailored services. In the United States as of 2011, 211 NSPs were known to be operating in 32 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Indian Nations. The bulk of funding has come from state and local governments, since for most of the last several decades, federal funding for needle exchange programs has been specifically banned. Globally, as of 2008, at least 77 countries and territories offer NSPs with varying structures, aims and goals. Some countries use needle exchange services as part of integrated programs to contain drug use, while others aim simply to contain HIV infection as their top priority, considering reduction in incidence of drug use as a much lower priority. Acceptance of NSPs vary widely from country to country. On the one hand, in Australia and New Zealand, electronic dispensing machines are available at selected locations such as the Auckland needle exchange and the Christchurch needle exchange, allowing needle exchange service 24 hours to registered users. On the other hand, over half of the countries in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa retain the death penalty for drug offenses, although some have not carried out executions in recent years. ==Evaluation== Low-threshold programs offering needle exchange have faced much opposition on political and moral grounds. Concerns are often expressed that NSPs may encourage drug use, or may actually increase the number of dirty needles in the community. Another fear is that NSPs may draw drug activity into the communities in which they operate. It has also been argued that in fighting disease, needle exchanges take attention away from bigger drug problems, and that, contrary to saving lives, they actually contribute to drug-related deaths. Even in Australia, which is considered a leading country in harm reduction, a survey showed that a third of the public believed that NSPs encouraged drug use, and 20% believed that NSPs dispensed drugs. In the United States, the ambivalent public attitude towards NSPs is often reflected in police interference, with 43% of NSP program managers reporting frequent (at least monthly) client harassment, 31% reporting frequent confiscation of clients' syringes, 12% reporting frequent client arrest, and 26% reporting uninvited police appearances at program sites. A single 1997 study which showed a correlation between frequent program use and elevated rates of HIV infection among IDUs in Vancouver, Canada, has become widely cited by opponents of NSPs as demonstrating their counter-productiveness. Authors from the 1997 Vancouver study have, in multiple publications, issued disclaimers against the misuse of their work by opponents of NSPs. They point out that frequent attendees of the program tended to be young and often indulged in extreme high-risk behaviors. The 1997 results were hence of a statistically biased sampling. They have emphasized that the correct message to be derived from their 1997 study can be read in the title of their work: \\"Needle exchange is not enough\\". This is the same message presented by many other articles since. Comprehensive, systematic surveys of the costs and effectiveness of low-threshold primary healthcare programs are not available due to the heterogeneity of these programs and the study designs. Narrower focus studies dealing solely with the needle exchange issue are abundant, however, and generally support the thesis that NSPs reduce the risk of prevalence of HIV, hepatitis and other blood-bourne diseases. These studies suggest that such outlets improve the overall health status of IDUs and save on the health budget by reducing episodes in emergency departments and tertiary hospitals. In Australia, monitoring of drug users participating in NSPs showed the incidence of HIV among NSP clients to be essentially identical to that of the general population. Fears that NSPs may draw drug activity into the communities in which they operate are contradicted by a study that showed that by far the greatest number of clients of an NSP in Chicago came to the area to exchange needles (60%) rather than to buy drugs (3.8%). Internationally, support for the effectiveness of low-threshold programs including needle exchange have come from studies conducted in Afghanistan, China, Spain, Taiwan, Estonia, Canada, Iran, and many other countries. However, in many countries, there is strong opposition to such programs. Despite the lack of definitive scientific evidence on the effectiveness of IDU-targeted low-threshold services, the available evidence, revealing barriers to service access and the late presentation of seriously ill IDUs to hospital, suggests the ongoing need for targeted and low-threshold services. Because of this, organizations ranging from the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control, the American Bar Association, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the World Health Organization, and many others have endorsed low-threshold programs including needle exchange. ==References== Category:Harm reduction Category:Drug policy Category:Substance abuse Category:Drug rehabilitation Category:Addiction medicine ","title":"Low-threshold treatment programs"},{"id":"35200930","text":"Enneapterygius pallidoserialis, the pale white-spotted triplefin, is a species of triplefin blenny in the genus Enneapterygius.

In 1867 at the Surprise of Mbin o Ngor (a surprise attack against the Serers by the Muslim marabout which precipitated the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune), Diakhao was burned to the ground by the marabouts. To rebuild his capital (Diakhao), Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak implemented new tax measures throughout the Sine. Although Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak had no problem collecting taxes in other areas of Sine, he failed in Joal, one of the principalities of Sine occupied by the French administration. For years he tried to exercise his authority in Joal. In August 1871, he went to Joal to deal with the French and exercise his authority in the area. He was assassinated.

The play made its New York premier at the Standard Theatre on February 14, 1887.A History of the New York Stage, Volume 3 Thomas Allston Brown - 1903 - Page 253 (Google Books)Bangor Daily Whig And Courier (Bangor, Maine) Saturday, April 23, 1887; Page 4Opera House Last Night-The Capital, (Annapolis, Maryland) Saturday, March 19, 1887, col.2, Page 3 ==Synopsis== Boston Daily Globe, December 28, 1886 “Pa” is a widower and wears a wig. He has three daughters, the eldest of whom has reached the rather advanced age, for a marriageable daughter, of 35. The next in line is 30. The youngest, still in short clothing is 17. “Pa” is possessed of the laudable ambition of providing his daughters with wealthy husbands. In order to scale down the age of the eldest to a marketable tenderness, the youngest is forced to remain a baby and confine herself to dolls and the “Chatterbox.” Pa’s only income seems to be the interest on the $20,000 left to a dog, of which he is the administrator. Consequently, when the millionaire father of Sydney Bumps expresses a wish that his son should unite himself with one of Pa’s daughters, Pa makes the effort to forward the contract. Successive endeavors to unite young Bumps, who is a farcical cross between a country bumpkin and an idiot, to the eldest and the next in line are unsuccessful. Pa’s troubles come to an end, however, when the rustic child of fortune elopes with the baby.”Pa” at the Park-Boston Daily Globe (Boston, Massachusetts); Tuesday, December 28, 1886; pg. 5 ==Revue== The Toronto Daily Mail, February 4, 1887 Sol Smith Russell is a general favourite wherever he goes and his engagements are invariably successful ones. Toronto is no exception to the rule and always turns out good audiences to see and hear him. Last evening the Grand Opera House was well filled with an audience that went away delighted with Mr. Russell’s new comedy “Pa” by Cal Wallace. The play is a highly amusing one, somewhat of the farcical order, witty in dialogue and full of comical situations. It portrays the adventures of an old gentleman, Perkimen Guinney or “Pa,” who has three daughters, two marriageable and one who thinks she is. “Pa” is the legal guardian of a dog to which a small fortune was bequeathed by its owner, and he seeks to add to his pecuniary advantage in this respect by marrying one of his daughters to a loony medical student whose father is millionaire. Many absurd situations arise out of this scheme and “Pa” finds himself as a rule, in a sea of difficulties, which however, he safely crosses in the end, and all is happiness and joy. It is needless to say that Mr. Russell is the life of the piece, and those who have seen him before need not be told that while he is on stage the house is kept in continual laughter. His comicalities are never exaggerated, but they never fail to excite the utmost merriment. His power of facial expression is wonderful and the imitations which he gave were very true to nature. A recitation of a rural idyll also was enthusiastically applauded, and his songs met with equal favour. It may safely be said that the quaint humour of Mr. Russell’s acting is inimitable. His company is a very good one. The four ladies take their parts well, as do the gentleman. Miss Emma Hagger’s dancing won her an encore, and Frank Lawton proved himself wonderfully agile in the same line. The whistling of the latter with banjo accompaniment brought down the house. “Pa” is very funny and should draw crowded houses. It will be repeated this evening and at both performances to-morrow.Music and Drama- The Toronto Daily Mail – February 4, 1887 col. 1, pg.3 ==Cast== A History of the New York Stage, Volume 3 Thomas Allston Brown - 1903 - Page 253 (Google Books) * Perkimen Guinney (Pa): Sol Smith Russell *Beatrice Guinney: Emma Hagger *Hope Guinney: Virginia Nelson *Sybil Guinney: Emily Bancker *Raymond Dawsey: Fred Percy Marsh *Spartacus Hubbs: Frank Lawton *Sydney Bumps: Fred P.

December 23, 1942) is a conceptual artist and one of the founders of the Bay Area Conceptual Art movement in California. Paul Kos (together with his contemporaries Vito Acconci, Howard Fried, and Bruce Nauman) was one of the first artists to incorporate video, sound and interactivity into his sculptural installations. == Short biography == The Sound of the Ice Melting, 1970 Paul Kos moved from Wyoming to San Francisco where he received both his B.F.A and M.F.A from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1967, where he later taught in the New Genres department. In the mid-1960s he worked on abstract fiberglass sculptures, but he then turned away from those to more site-specific art. The first major retrospective of his work “Everything Matters” was held at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive. A second major survey of the artist's work was held at di Rosa in 2016.http://www.dirosaart.org/paul-kos/ Today Kos lives and works in San Francisco. He has exhibited on both the West and East coasts and has received several awards, including five National Endowment for the Arts fellowships and the Rockefeller Foundation fellowship. His work can be found in the collections of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, di Rosa, the Museum of Modern Art (New York), and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Kos holds the Dodd Chair at the University of Georgia, and has received a Eureka Fellowship, a Flintridge, a Guggenheim, a Rockefeller, a Tiffany and six NEA Fellowships. Besides his studio practice, Kos has made large scale public art installations including:Poetry Sculpture Garden with Poet Laureate, Bob Hass, at 199 Fremont, San Francisco and “Every thing matters” for the Bishop Collection at the new UCSF Campus . == Paul Kos’s sound bites from the Spark interview == # \\"An artist goes in and out of shape ... when you're in shape, ideas are coming faster than you have time to make them.\\" # \\"My feeling is, if an artist develops fairly rigorous formalism in their education ... after that, one should be able to move from craft to craft.\\" # All art should have good craft—that's just an assumption. But good craft is not art. Art is that magic that happens somewhere between the viewer, the object and the artist. The artist initiating it, but the viewer being that receiver of that triangle.\\" # \\"In new genres, the craft is thinking on one's feet. And being able to use a material based on a site, maybe the site determines what the material is. It tells you everything.\\" # \\"Often I think a conceptual artist, unlike the painter or sculptor begins with a concept. And then finds the material that best suits that concept, that somehow the concept has some indigenous qualities to it that tell the artist what to use.\\" # \\"I respect painting probably the most because they are to the arts like philosophy is to the humanities.\\" # \\"When I was young I really loved magic tricks. I loved the idea of doing ... a piece could have an element in it which is a surprise.\\" # \\"When everything matters, essentially, every detail counts.\\" # \\"Work should not necessarily be read like language is -- left to right top to bottom. Instead, the work has its own language system.\\" # \\"I'm trying to pare down and pare down -- use less adjectives and less adverbs, trust the verb and some nouns.\\" ==Selected work==  The Sound of the Ice Melting (1970)  10 boom microphones plugged into an active sound system recorded the sound of 25 pound blocks of ice melting in a metal pan on the floor.  Chartres Bleu (1982- 1986)  This piece represents a full-scale recreation of a stained-glass stained glass windows in Chartres Cathedral. Twenty seven vertically stalked monitors show glass panels of the famous church over a period of twenty four hours, condensed into twelve minutes. Readability of represented narrative scenes changes, depending on the changes of the light. The work is permanently on view at di Rosa.  Sand Piece (1971)  Two story gallery was transformed in an hourglass. A tone of sand that was placed on the upper floor was sifting through a minute hole to the lower level, in the shape of a perfect cone.  rEvolution: Notes for the Invasion: mar mar march (1972- 73)  Viewer must walk around narrow planks of wood to see a monitor that shows a small figure marching above typewriter keys that spell mar mar march. Interesting correlation between the fiction and the reality and mechanical regularity of little man’s steps and disposition of wooden planks.  Tower of Babel (1989)  Tower of Babel is an installation from 1989. that criticizes divisions between different cultures and advocates international understanding. Tower of Babel is a Vladimir Tatlin–inspired metal ramp with twenty video monitors featuring seventy-six people speaking fifty different languages. Cacophony seems indecipherable, unless a viewer comes closer to individual monitors.This piece is inspired by a Biblical story of the Tower of Babel in which people used to speak only one language before they became too ambitious and tried to build a tower to the heavens. God made them speak different languages so that they could not understand each other.  Pawn (1991)  Image of a red pawn that is made with 25, 000 magnetic chess pieces. These pieces don’t mimic pawn’s symmetry but the illusion of light and shadow in bright red and white. A red pawn presents an obvious metaphor for life under Communism.

He is most known for stealing the Marlborough diamond in London in 1980, and also for serving as a technical advisor on the 2009 film Public Enemies. On August 29, 2012, Scalise was sentenced in a Chicago federal court to 106 months in prison after pleading guilty in January 2012 to racketeering. == Early years == In March 1961, the Chicago Tribune reported that Scalise had been indicted on a larceny charge involving four stolen automobiles. In January 1963, the Chicago Tribune reported that Scalise and Harry Aleman, who would go on to become a notorious Chicago Outfit hit man, both had been arrested and charged with assaulting a Chicago police captain's son. In March 1967, the Chicago Tribune reported that Scalise had a record of arrests for possession of burglar tools, including lock-picking devices. In 1970, Scalise was sentenced to eight years in prison on federal auto theft charges. Scalise also served as a soldier for Chicago mob boss Albert Tocco. And in the 1970s, Scalise was allegedly part of the Chicago mob killing crew known as the \\"Wild Bunch.\\" He never was charged with any murders, however. == Marlborough diamond robbery == On September 11, 1980, Scalise and a colleague, Arthur Rachel, undertook a $3.6 million jewel robbery in broad daylight at Graff's jewelry store in London's busy Knightsbridge area, stealing the 45-carat Marlborough diamond, along with many other jewels. Authorities quickly identified the perpetrators—noting that one of the robbers, who turned out to be Scalise, had a badly deformed left hand. The heist lasted about one minute. The duo was arrested as they exited their flight home at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Before and during the robbery, Scalise and Rachel made little effort to hide their identities, with Rachel renting the getaway car in his own name. While in London, the men stayed at the Royal Mount Hotel. Scalise spent almost three years after that in federal custody in the U.S., fighting extradition. In July 1983, Scalise and Rachel were turned over to British authorities. In August 1984, Scalise was sentenced to 16 years in an English prison—on the Isle of Wight -- for the crime. In September 1987, Scalise and Rachel sued U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, alleging that Meese was \\"capricious and arbitrary\\" in refusing to permit them to serve the rest of their sentences in the United States. In 1988, while still incarcerated in England, Scalise was interviewed by FBI agents, seeking information about possible bodies buried in a deserted field just east of Argonne National Laboratory and just 50 yards from a home where Scalise had lived with a girlfriend from 1974 until 1980. In May 1989, it was reported that a hitman for the Chicago Outfit who at one time was close to Scalise had told FBI investigators that Scalise had mailed the Marlborough diamond to his sister in New York City immediately after the 1980 heist. The Marlborough diamond was never recovered. A cabdriver in London, Paul Bryk, told authorities that Scalise and Rachel had asked the cabbie to mail a package they were sending to a New York address—a package that authorities believe contained the diamond. == Return to the U.S.== Scalise was released from prison around Christmas 1992 after serving more than 12 years behind bars. At that point, he moved into his father's home in Chicago's Bridgeport neighborhood. In January 1994, he was arrested and charged with possession of burglary tools. In July 1998, Scalise was indicted with four others in a cocaine conspiracy after a government sting. Scalise was alleged to have tried to buy 20 kilograms of cocaine from a federal informant in Los Angeles. In May 1999, Scalise pleaded guilty to the drug-related charges and agreed with prosecutors to a nine-year prison term. On September 1, 1999, Scalise formally was sentenced to nine years in prison. Authorities had said that Scalise cooperated with them into other drug investigations, and that Scalise had been primarily responsible for delivering money to buy cocaine for further distribution in the Chicago area. In 2007, federal investigators said publicly that they believe Scalise killed mob enforcer William Dauber and his wife, Charlotte, in Will County, Illinois. Scalise has never been charged in that murder, however, and a source told the Chicago Sun-Times that his alibi was that he was at a court hearing at the time of the slayings. == Movie work == Scalise served as a technical advisor to help out with filming prison sequences for the movie Public Enemies, which was shot in Chicago and was about prolific bank robber John Dillinger. == Federal racketeering charges, conviction and sentencing == In April 2010, federal authorities indicted Scalise and two lifelong colleagues, Arthur Rachel and Robert Pullia, on racketeering charges as the trio was alleged to have made extensive plans for robberies and burglaries. Among the heists the three had planned—but never carried out—were robbing an armored car in La Grange, Illinois and breaking into the fortress-like home in Chicago's Bridgeport neighborhood owned by the late Chicago Outfit leader Angelo J. LaPietra. In January 2012, Scalise reached an agreement with federal prosecutors, pleading guilty on January 18, 2012 to racketeering and other crimes. The plea deal came as the FBI released evidence of many secretly recorded tapes of Scalise and his colleagues, planning their crimes. Scalise allegedly had boasted on the recordings that he, Rachel and Pullia were too old to be recognized, and that the police would be \\"looking for some young guy. But there's no coppers that know us today.\\" Scalise also was implicated in a letter he wrote to corrupt former Chicago Police Chief of Detectives William Hanhardt—who recently was released from federal prison—that authorities had intercepted. In that letter, Scalise wrote that \\"everyone in court looks at you as guilty and that defendants often forget they did do the crime. The only approach is to make something else the issue to trick the jury.\\"http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/iteam&id;=8509855 Outside court, Scalise told the Chicago Tribune's John Kass that he was writing a book about his exploits, and he explained that he pleaded guilty even though he thought he might win \\"because sometimes you've just got to be realistic.\\" He also told Kass that \\"it would have been a very interesting trial.\\" Regarding the Marlborough diamond, Scalise spoke to reporters outside the courtroom on the matter, responding to one reporter's question about whether anyone could recover the gem. \\"If Lloyd's (of London) wanted to pay enough money, maybe they could,\\" Scalise told reporters, referring to the insurance company that covered the loss of the diamond. \\"You guys will have to wait until the book comes out.\\" On August 29, 2012, U.S. District Judge Harry Daniel Leinenweber sentenced Scalise to 106 months in federal prison. \\"This was certainly a waste of a life,\\" Leinenweber told Scalise, who declined to speak in court. \\"This is a guy who was given a lot and certainly squandered it.\\" Scalise's scheduled release date is May 28, 2019, but he was released to a halfway house in the Chicago area in February 2019.http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList;=false&FirstName;=Joseph&Middle;=&LastName;=Scalise&Race;=U&Sex;=U&Age;=&x;=0&y;=0 == Personal == Scalise's father, Louis, was a retired Chicago Park District employee.

The business routes in the US state of Texas are traditionally short spurs or loops that connect the main route, in this case, U.S. Highway 287 (US 287), to the center or commercial district of a city. The routes commonly follow the course of an decommissioned state highway, or the old course of the main route. Business routes are signed with the traditional US 287 highway shield, and with a small \\"business plate\\" placed above the marker. TxDOT regards business routes as official highways, and is responsible for the maintenance of the route. As of 2010, there are nine official business routes of US 287\\\\. There are also two cancelled business routes, both of which were located in Amarillo. Of the nine routes, seven of them are located in Northeast Texas. ==Facts== *Longest Route: BUS US 287-P, located in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, at long. *Shortest Route: BUS US 287-T, in Corsicana, at just long. * Half of the eight routes are located in the DFW Metroplex. * Unusually, six of the nine routes are designated as north–south, instead of the usual south–north. ==Current routes== Grapeland left Business U.S. Highway 287-V (BUS US 287-V) is a short loop business route located almost entirely inside the city limits of Grapeland. The highway is known as Main Street. The road passes directly through the center of Grapeland. The route was designated on January 20, 1977 as Texas State Highway Loop 531, but was changed to the current business route designation on September 26, 2003. ;Major junctions Corsicana left Business U.S. Highway 287-T (BUS US 287-T) is a very short spur business route located entirely in the city of Corsicana. The spur, long, helps connect people traveling to and from US 287 to Business Interstate 45. The route passes a few warehouses and businesses in far southern Corsicana. The route was designated on January 28, 1987 as Texas State Highway Spur 565, but was changed to the current business designation on June 21, 1990. ;Major junctions Mansfield–Fort Worth left Business US Highway 287-P (BUS US 287-P) is a business loop of US Highway 287 in the US state of Texas that serves as main street for Mansfield, downtown Fort Worth and Saginaw. The highway is known as Main Street while in Mansfield, Mansfield Highway while in southern Fort Worth, Kennedale Parkway in Kennedale, Riverside Drive and Rosedale Street in central Fort Worth, Commerce Street in downtown Fort Worth, Main Street in northern Fort Worth, and Saginaw Boulevard in Saginaw. The highway was originally designated on December 17, 1970 as Texas State Highway Loop 496 (signed as a business route of US 81 and US 287, depending on the US Route that followed that corridor). On November 25, 1975, Loop 496 extended south to FM 157. On June 2, 1982, it extended to US 287\\\\. On June 21, 1990, Texas State Highway Loop 496 was changed to its current business route designation. On October 25, 1990, the section of BUS US 287-P in Meacham Field was cancelled. BUS US 287-P is located almost entirely in Tarrant County, and is mostly located in Fort Worth. On December 16, 2010, Business US 287-P was rerouted along I-35 and Spur 280 rather than along Commerce Street, Main Street, and Rosedale Street. On April 30, 2015, the section of BUS US 287-P from FM 917 to FM 157 was given to the city of Mansfield, and the section south of FM 917 became part of FM 917. BUS US 287-P was rerouted north along FM 157 to US 287. On July 27, 2017, FM 157 was rerouted south along FM 917 and US 287, completing the changes in the system. The highway is, as of 2010, the longest business route of US 287, while located in Texas. BUS US 287-P is one of the few highways to be designated as a north–south highway. Vernon left Business U.S. Highway 287-F (BUS US 287-F) is a short loop business route located entirely in Vernon. The highway is known as College Drive when concurrent with US 70, Hillcrest Drive as a stand-alone road, and Wilbarger Street while concurrent with Loop 488\\\\. Most of the route's course is concurrent with Loop 488, which passes directly through downtown Vernon. This was designated as Texas State Highway Spur 417 on October 15, 1965, but was changed to the current business designation on June 21, 1990. ;Major junctions Electra Midlothian Waxahachie ==Former routes== Amarillo This was redesignated from Loop 395 on June 21, 1990, only to revert to Loop 395 on October 25, 1990.

It is reported in one source that his original name was Yi Taek- jo.Iraola, Antton Egiguren (2007) True Confucians, Bold Christians: Korean Missionary Experience. A Model for the Third Millennium. Amsterdam : Rodopi ==Biography== Early Years Yi Byeok was born in 1754 in Gyeonggi-do, Pocheon-gun, Naechon-myeon, Hwahyeon-ri. His ja was Deok-jo (德操) his ho Gwang- am (曠庵). His father was Yi Bu-man (李溥萬), 1727-1817, of the Gyeongju Yi clan, and his mother was a member of the Cheongju Han clan. He was the second son among six children. His grandfather Yi Geun had held a high rank in the army, and his father, elder brother Yi Gyeok (李格), and younger brother Yi Seok (李晳) were also military officials. Yi Byeok was remarkably tall, and his father tried to make a soldier of him; but from an early age he refused, earning himself the nickname Byeok, (either 蘗, (corktree) or 僻, implying isolation and oddity) for his stubbornness.Jean Sangbae Ri, Confucius et Jésus Christ page 22 His family belonged to the Namin faction, which included many families residing in Gyeonggi-do, and as such, except for a few years when Yi Byeok was alive, were excluded from holding office by the factional politics of the Joseon period. This exclusion from power might explain why many of the scholars from these families pursued studies, which indicated their dissent from orthodox Neo-Confucianism. Yi Byeok decided at an early age not to study for the national examinations, which were necessary for a career in government administration. Instead, he chose pure scholarship, focusing on the Chinese Confucian classics, studying the Four Books and the Five Classics as a matter of course. Yi Byeok's great-grandfather, Yi Gyeong-sang, had accompanied Crown Prince Sohyeon (1612-1645) during the eight years that he spent in China. It is likely that he brought back books written by the Jesuit missionaries (“Western Learning”), including those about Catholicism which Yi Byeok later studied.see: Theologia Korea site in Korean The writings of Seongho Yi Ik inspired many of the scholars who adopted the Practical Learning (Silhak) approach. Yi Byeok and the other scholars with whom he explored the tenets of Catholicism in the following years were surely no exception. Jeonjin-am In 1777 (according to Dallet) or 1779 (according to Jeong Yak-yong),Jean Sangbae Ri, Confucius et Jésus Christ page 23 the Namin scholar Gwon Cheol-sin (權哲身, 1736-1801) seems to have started a series of study sessions for his pupils and other scholars that, like him, were influenced by the Silhak- inspired writings of his teacher, Seongho Yi Ik. These meetings were held in a remote mountain hermitage, Jeonjin-am, which belonged to Ju-eo-sa temple near Gwangju, Gyeonggi-do. The meetings were probably intended as an ongoing seminar to gain a better understanding of human life through renewed study of the Chinese classics, as well as the books introducing European knowledge that had been written in Chinese by Matteo Ricci and other Jesuits. If there were books about Catholicism among them, they seem only to have given a very shallow presentation of the faith. Dallet began his Histoire with a description of Yi Byeok's difficult journey to join the group.Dallet, Histoire, Vol 1 pages 14-15 Among those present in the group were Jeong Yak- jeon (丁若銓, 1758-1816), whose wife was Yi Byeok's sister (who had died by 1784)Jean Sangbae Ri, Confucius et Jésus Christ page 26 and (perhaps) Mancheon Yi Seung-hun (蔓川 李承薰, 1756-1801) whose wife was the sister of Jeong Yak-jeon. Yi Byeok's wife (Gwon Ryu-Han-Dang) was a niece of Gwon Cheol-sin, being the daughter of his brother Gwon Il-sin (權日身, 1742-1792).Introduction “A Record of the Words of Ryu-Han-Dang.” The Translation Series of the Korean Christian Classics 1. Seoul: The Korean Christian Museum, Soongsil University. 2007. Conversion to Catholicism Dallet reports that it was Yi Byeok who, on hearing in 1783 that Yi Seung-hun was to accompany his father on the annual embassy to Beijing, urged him to contact the Catholic priests there and be baptized, then bring back more information. This he duly did, receiving baptism early in 1784. He returned to Korea bringing books and objects of devotion. Yi Byeok seems to have taken some time to study the books before declaring himself convinced. He then set about evangelizing those around him, including Gwon Cheol-sin and his younger brother Gwon Il-sin. In the Jachan myojimyeong (autobiographical epitaph) written later by Dasan Jeong Yak-yong there is an account of a moment in April 1784 when Yi Byeok first told him about Catholicism and showed him a book. Jeong Yak-yong had a very high opinion of Yi Byeok's intellectual skills, especially after receiving his help in 1784 in formulating a reply to the king's questions about Confucian philosophy, a reply that greatly impressed the king by its “objectivity”.Jean Sangbae Ri, Confucius et Jésus Christ page 27 Jean Sangbae Ri remarked that the theory regarding the emanation of Le and Ki had originated with Yi Byeok, who was following Yi Hwang Toegye; Jeong Yak-yong then began following the ideas expressed by Yi I Yulgok. The baptism of these first converts, including Yi Byeok, is said to have happened in September 1784, whereupon Yi Byeok took the name Jean Baptist. It is not clear whether Jeong Yak-yong was among those who were baptized then. His older brother Jeong Yak-jong was destined to become the main leader of the community along with Yi Seung-hun and died for his faith in the persecution of 1801. There was an immediate hostile reaction to the new religion, about which little was as yet known, among the more strictly Confucianist scholars. There was opposition even among the Namin faction. The silk letter written in 1801 to the Bishop of Beijing by Alexander Hwang Sa-yeong included a lengthy account of the origins of the Korean church. In it, he tells how Yi Ga-hwan (李家煥, 1742-1801), who had risen to be Minister of Justice (刑曹判書, hyeongjo panseo), and was one of the most senior members of the faction and a very great scholar, tried to argue with Yi Byeok, but ended up being converted by him. He was martyred in 1801.Jean Sangbae Ri, Confucius et Jésus Christ page 29 Arrest and death Early in 1785, the growing group of believers and sympathizers moved their regular gatherings for worship from the house of Yi Byeok to that belonging to another convert, Kim Beom-u, on the hill where Myeongdong Cathedral now stands. Kim was not an aristocrat as so many of the others were. Almost immediately, the authorities raided the house, suspecting it of being a gambling den, and were embarrassed on finding it full of nobles. A report by a government agent to the Minister of Justice lists those acting as leaders: Yi Seung-hun, the brothers Jeong Yak-jeon, Jeong Yak-jong, Jeong Yak-yong, Gwon Il-sin, with Yi Byeok taking the leading role as teacher during the ceremony.A French translation is reprinted in Jean Sangbae Ri, Confucius et Jésus Christ, page 29-30 All were arrested, the books that were found were confiscated, and the nobles were then sent home with a warning not to continue. However, Kim Beom-u was tortured, exiled, and finally executed since he was not of noble birth.Jean Sangbae Ri, Confucius et Jésus Christ, page 29-30 Dallet (Vol 1 pages 28–9) says that Yi Byeok was put under intense pressure from his father until finally, more or less, he gave up the faith. He was tormented by remorse until he died of the plague in 1786.There are no reliable documents supporting this claim. A different account of his death is given by Antton Iraola who reported that he died on 14 June 1785, after 15 days of constant prayer, during which he neither ate nor slept. What seems clear is that his family, under strong pressure from the Confucian leaders that were hostile to the Namin and their newly found foreign faith, kept him more or less imprisoned in his home. There is no record of any communication addressed to the Catholic community emanating from him after the arrest. The group's leadership was taken by Yi Seung-hun, who seemed to have established a native hierarchy, at least before the Bishop of Beijing intervened to stop it.Jean Sangbae Ri, Confucius et Jésus Christ, page 31 Yi Byeok's life is poorly documented and the main source for much information about him is the rather dramatized account in Dallet's Histoire de l’église de Corée (2 vols, 1874), which relied heavily on translations of documents sent to France by Bishop Daveluy (Dallet, Histoire, Vol.1, Introduction, page xi).Jean Sangbae Ri, Confucius et Jésus Christ page 30 ==Works== * The only surviving texts written by Yi Byeok are found in a volume containing a collection of writings by the first Korean Catholic believers, known as Mancheon yugo (蔓川遺稿), which was discovered in about 1970. Mancheon was the ho of Yi Seung-hun, whose writings occupy a major part of the book, But it also contains two poetic works attributed to Yi Byeok, the Hymn of Adoration of the Lord of Heaven (天主恭敬歌, Cheonju gonggyeongga), and above all, much longer and more complex, the Essence of Sacred Doctrine (聖敎要旨, Seonggyo yoji). Both are translated into French in the book by Jean Sangbae Ri; unfortunately, there seems to be no English translation. * The title to the Hymn indicates that it was composed at Ju-eo-sa temple in 1779. * The Seonggyo yoji is especially interesting by its combination of Christian teaching and the Confucian classics, especially the Great Learning (大學, Da xue) and the Doctrine of the Mean (中庸, Zhong yong). There is no indication of when it was composed, although it shows a deeper knowledge of Christianity, including stories from the Bible, which suggest a time after Yi Byeok's study of the books brought from Beijing by Yi Seung-hun. ==Grave== On June 21, 1979, the grave of Yi Byeok was discovered by chance at his birthplace. His remains were reinterred alongside those of Yi Seung-hun, Yi Ga-hwan, the Gwon brothers, and Jeong Yak- jong at the Catholic shrine that was erected on the site of Jeonjin-am. ==See also== * Roman Catholicism in South Korea * Korean Martyrs * Jeong Yak-yong * Yi Seung-hun ==References Daum entry about Yi Byeok * http://k.daum.net/qna/openknowledge/view.html?qid=3XUxv& Online text of Seonggyo Yoji * http://parabolog.wordpress.com/tag/%EC%84%B1%EA%B5%90%EC%9A%94%EC%A7%80/ * History of the Asian Missions - Introduction of Catholicism into Korea * Chon Jin Am, The Birthplace of the Catholic Church in Korea Print * Dallet, Charles.

Shankar, starring M. G. Ramachandran, Jayalalithaa and Rajasree, with L. Vijayalakshmi, Pandari Bai, M. N. Nambiar, Major Sundarrajan and Nagesh in supporting roles. A remake of the 1962 Hindi film China Town, it revolves around twins who become separated as children: one who grows up to be a criminal, and the other who is tasked with apprehending him. The film was released on 15 March 1968 and became a box office success. (1968-03-15) == Plot == Twins Sekhar and Anand, along with their mother Mangalam, witness their father Ramnadhan being murdered by Nagappan, an escaped convict who Ramnadhan had testified against. This prompts the family to leave to Madras to pursue a new life. But when Sekhar gets down from the train to fetch some water, it leaves without him. Nagappan arrives and kidnaps Sekhar, who is raised by him as a criminal. Sekhar remains unaware that the same man killed his father. Years later, Sekhar who now calls himself \\"Babu\\", is an established criminal and is the most wanted man in the city. Meanwhile, Anand is a club-dancer and neither he nor Babu are aware of each other's existence. During a police encounter, Babu is grievously wounded and seeks shelter in Mangalam's house, although he does not recognise her as his mother. He develops a soft corner for her, but when Nagappan (now known as Boopathy, the owner of a cabaret and employer of Babu) learns about this, he tries to eradicate the kind-self out of Babu. During another police encounter, Babu is again wounded, but becomes insane this time, also becoming amnesiac. D. I. G. Mogan comes across Anand, and after seeing the striking resemblance between him and Babu, advises him to act as Babu to get all the secrets of the gang and have them arrested. Anand agrees, but later realises Babu is his brother. Anand's girlfriend Jaya sees him having lot of money in a briefcase, and the police chase him. Unaware of the truth, she thinks he has turned into a criminal, and refuses to speak to him. Mangalam also comes to know of this, and becomes heartbroken. However, Mangalam and Jaya soon reconcile with Anand after learning of the truth, and they also learn that Babu is his brother. Babu's girlfriend Asha discovers that Anand is impersonating Babu, but he surrenders to her and explains about Babu's medical condition, subsequently revealing himself as Babu's brother. Asha forgives him and the duo subsequently team up to defeat Nagappan and his men. Babu later escapes from the prison to kill Anand when learning about him, but is cornered by Jaya, who tells him that Anand is his brother. Babu does not believe this, and kidnaps Jaya. He is later stopped by Mangalam, who makes him realise that he is her son and Anand is his brother. Remembering that Nagappan killed his father, he teams up with Anand to defeat Nagappan, who is later arrested. Subsequently, Babu returns to being \\"Sekhar\\", and reunites with his family. == Cast == * M. G. Ramachandran as Anand and Sekhar/Babu * Jayalalithaa as Jaya * Rajasree as Asha * Pandari Bai as Mangalam * M. N. Nambiar as Boopathy/Nagappan * Major Sundarrajan as D. I. G. Mogan * V. K. Ramasamy as Rao Bahadur Singaram * S. V. Ramadas as Ramnadhan * Nagesh (Guest-star) as Jaya's elder brother * L. Vijayalakshmi as the partner of Anand in the song \\"Aadaludan Paadalai\\" == Award == 1968 Tamil Nadu State Film Award * Won – Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Male Playback – T. M. Soundararajan == Production == Kudiyirundha Koyil is a remake of the 1962 Hindi film China Town. It was the first Tamil film to feature a Bangra dance sequence in the song \\"Aadaludan Padalai...\\", which became an instant hit among audiences. Ramachandran had to practice for one month to dance in the song. According to Jump Cut, Ramachandran portraying a dark-skinned character in the film was meant to showcase him as the criminal doppelgänger of a fair-skinned character, also played by him. == Soundtrack == Music was composed by M. S. Viswanathan. The song \\"Ennai Theriyuma\\" was later remixed by Achu for a film with the same name, and \\"Aadaludan Paadalai\\" was remixed by Amresh Ganesh for Motta Shiva Ketta Shiva (2017). == Release and reception == Kudiyirundha Koyil was released on 15 March 1968. The film was a box office success, and ran more than 100 days in Chennai, Madurai, Kovai, Trichi and other major cities. == References  External links == * Category:1960s spy films Category:1960s Tamil-language films Category:1968 films Category:Films directed by K.

After being in a school cadet in the Nicholas Military Academy, he was a student of the prestigious Nicholas Cavalry School in St. Petersburg graduating in 1890, when he joined the regiment of mounted grenadiers of the Imperial Guard as a cornet. In 1893, he joined the Dragoons Kharkov. From 1899, he commanded the Third Regiment of Cossacks of the Don. In 1904, he participated actively in the Russo-Japanese War as an officer of the First Chita Regiment, part of the Transbaikal Cossack army. On 24 August 1912 he was promoted colonel. During the First World War he was from July to April 1915 commander of the Nineteenth Don Cossack Regiment, on 8 April 1915 to April 1917 Commander of the Sixth regiment of Don Cossacks, and after his promotion to major general from April 1917 to January 1918 Commander of the 6th Don Cossack Division. ==The Civil War== Don Army commanders including Lieutenant-General Konstantin Mamontov on the right. (The cross over Mamontov's head was drawn by the photographer after he died.) After the revolution and the collapse of the front General Mamontov and his men returned to their lands of the Don, the stanitsa Nizhne-Tchirskaia. Like most of the Cossacks he was an outspoken opponent of the Bolsheviks and joined at the first opportunity to form a partisan detachment which rallied at Novocherkassk crossing the Red lines. On 12 February he joined the White Army, a loose confederation of Anti-Communist forces in the Campaign of the steppe. From July 1918 to 23 February 1919 he was commander of the eastern front of the Don Region, then the First Don Army. In July 1919 he was entrusted with the command of newly formed special troops, the Fourth Cavalry Corps of the Don. During the march on Moscow, Mamontov and his men carried out in August 1919 a raid behind enemy lines to disrupt the rear of the Red Army. His goal was to support the attack by the forces of General Anton Denikin in 1919, called 'The offensive of the armed forces of the south of Russia in 1919' in the historical literature, in the direction of Kursk and Voronezh. Mamontov’s troops consisted only of cavalry, which gave them great mobility and enabled to mount daring raid-type operations. The greatest success of the Mamontov Corps was the capture of a number of cities in central Russia, including Tambov, Yelets and finally, together with the corps of General Andrei Shkuro the city of Voronezh. The thrust of the Mamontov Corps worried the Soviet military leadership because Voronezh was only a few hundred kilometers from Moscow. After the personal order of Vladimir Lenin, they sent the best cavalry corps of the Red Army under the leadership of Budyonny against Mamontov's Corps, who succeeded in November 1919 after a very hard and bloody fighting in the Battles of Voronezh, Kastorensk and in the Kharkov operations at the end of 1919. These two offensives were directly connected with the Orel-Kursk operation in 1919 and were part of a broad military action in the Red Army counter-offensive in the southern front. Mamontov’s corps was routed by S. M. Budennyi’s cavalry corps at Kastornaia in November 1919. This defeat was crucial for the consolidation of the Bolshevik power and undermined the morale of the anti-Bolshevik forces. Mamontov was subsequently relieved of his command, but after a few days re-appointed to his post. Mamontov died on 14 February 1920 in Ekaterinodar of typhus. ==See also== * Don Army ==References== * The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970-1979). ==External links== *Anti-Bolshevik Russia in pictures *Museum and Archives of the White Movement ==Literature== * * Category:Imperial Russian Army generals Category:Russian anti-communists Category:Russian people of World War I Category:People of the Russian Civil War Category:White movement generals Category:1869 births Category:1920 deaths ","title":"Konstantin Mamontov"},{"id":"35201421","text":"John Rotheram (1725–1789) was an English cleric, known as a theological writer. ==Life== The second of the three sons of the Rev. William Rotherham (as the father spelt his name), who master of the free grammar school of Haydon Bridge, Northumberland, was born there on 22 June 1725, and was educated at his father's school. He entered The Queen's College, Oxford, as batler, on 21 February 1745, partly maintained by his elder brother, the Rev. Thomas Rotheram, professor in Codrington College in Barbados. He graduated B.A. in 1748–9, and then went to Barbados as tutor to the two sons of the Frere family, arriving in the island on 20 Jan. 1749–50. In 1751 he accepted the post of assistant in Codrington College. For his \\"services to religion\\" as a controversialist he was, though absent, created M.A. on 11 December 1753 by special decree of Oxford University. In 1757 he returned to England. Rotheram accepted, on arriving in London, the curacy of Tottenham in Middlesex, and held it until 1766. From 1760 to 1767 he held a Percy fellowship at University College, Oxford, and he was also one of the preachers at the Royal Chapel, Whitehall. Richard Trevor, the bishop of Durham, gave him the rectory of Ryton, where he was from February 1766 to 1769. On 30 October 1769 he was appointed by Trevor to the rectory of Houghton-le-Spring, which he continued to hold until his death; and from 1778 to 1783, when he resigned the benefice in favour of his nephew Richard Wallis, he was vicar of Seaham. He was chaplain to Bishop Trevor, on whom he preached a funeral sermon at Newcastle on 27 July 1771, and to his successor as bishop; he was elected proctor in convocation in 1774, and he was a trustee of Nathaniel Crewe's charity. Rotheram was struck by a stroke at Bamburgh Castle, when visiting Archdeacon John Sharp, and died there on 16 July 1789. His remains were laid near the grave of his brother, in the chancel of Houghton church, and a marble tablet was erected to his memory. ==Works== While living with the Frere family in Barbados, Rotheram wrote his first work: The Force of the Argument for the Truth of Christianity drawn from a Collective View of Prophecy, 1752, which was prompted by the controversy between Thomas Sherlock and Conyers Middleton. From Codrington College he produced the larger volume: A Sketch of the One Great Argument, formed from the several concurring Evidences for the Truth of Christianity (1754 and 1763). Besides single sermons, Rotheram published also: * An Apology for the Athanasian Creed (anon.), 1760; 2nd edit. with his name in 1762. This was answered anonymously in 1773, probably by William Adams. * An Essay on Faith and its Connection with Good Works, 1766 (4th edit. corrected, 1772; new edit. 1801), the substance of a course of sermons before the university of Oxford; the portion dealing with The Origin of Faith was published separately in 1761 and 1763. * Three Sermons on Public Occasions before the University of Oxford, 1766, all previously published separately. * An Essay on Establishments in Religion, with Remarks on the Confessional (anon.), 1767; reprinted in the Churchman Armed, 1814, i. 183–276, and answered by Caleb Fleming and others. * An Essay on the Distinction between the Soul and Body of Man, 1781. * An Essay on Human Liberty, 1782. ==References== * ==Notes== ;Attribution Category:1725 births Category:1789 deaths Category:18th-century English Anglican priests Category:English theologians Category:Fellows of University College, Oxford Category:English male non-fiction writers ","title":"John Rotheram"},{"id":"35201445","text":"The 2012 Avispa Fukuoka season sees Avispa Fukuoka return to J.League Division 2 after spending 2011 in J1.

This field develops computational and mathematical methods for solving problems pertaining to medical images and their use for biomedical research and clinical care. The main goal of MIC is to extract clinically relevant information or knowledge from medical images. While closely related to the field of medical imaging, MIC focuses on the computational analysis of the images, not their acquisition. The methods can be grouped into several broad categories: image segmentation, image registration, image-based physiological modeling, and others. == Data forms == Medical image computing typically operates on uniformly sampled data with regular x-y-z spatial spacing (images in 2D and volumes in 3D, generically referred to as images). At each sample point, data is commonly represented in integral form such as signed and unsigned short (16-bit), although forms from unsigned char (8-bit) to 32-bit float are not uncommon. The particular meaning of the data at the sample point depends on modality: for example a CT acquisition collects radiodensity values, while a MRI acquisition may collect T1 or T2-weighted images. Longitudinal, time- varying acquisitions may or may not acquire images with regular time steps. Fan-like images due to modalities such as curved-array ultrasound are also common and require different representational and algorithmic techniques to process. Other data forms include sheared images due to gantry tilt during acquisition; and unstructured meshes, such as hexahedral and tetrahedral forms, which are used in advanced biomechanical analysis (e.g., tissue deformation, vascular transport, bone implants). == Segmentation == T1 weighted MR image of the brain of a patient with a meningioma after injection of a MRI contrast agent (top left), and the same image with the result of an interactive segmentation overlaid in green (3D model of the segmentation on the top right, axial and coronal views at the bottom). Segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into different meaningful segments. In medical imaging, these segments often correspond to different tissue classes, organs, pathologies, or other biologically relevant structures. Medical image segmentation is made difficult by low contrast, noise, and other imaging ambiguities. Although there are many computer vision techniques for image segmentation, some have been adapted specifically for medical image computing. Below is a sampling of techniques within this field; the implementation relies on the expertise that clinicians can provide. * Atlas-Based Segmentation: For many applications, a clinical expert can manually label several images; segmenting unseen images is a matter of extrapolating from these manually labeled training images. Methods of this style are typically referred to as atlas-based segmentation methods. Parametric atlas methods typically combine these training images into a single atlas image, while nonparametric atlas methods typically use all of the training images separately. Atlas-based methods usually require the use of image registration in order to align the atlas image or images to a new, unseen image. * Shape-Based Segmentation: Many methods parametrize a template shape for a given structure, often relying on control points along the boundary. The entire shape is then deformed to match a new image. Two of the most common shape-based techniques are Active Shape Models and Active Appearance Models. These methods have been very influential, and have given rise to similar models. *Image-Based segmentation: Some methods initiate a template and refine its shape according to the image data while minimizing integral error measures, like the Active contour model and its variations. *Interactive Segmentation: Interactive methods are useful when clinicians can provide some information, such as a seed region or rough outline of the region to segment. An algorithm can then iteratively refine such a segmentation, with or without guidance from the clinician. Manual segmentation, using tools such as a paint brush to explicitly define the tissue class of each pixel, remains the gold standard for many imaging applications. Recently, principles from feedback control theory have been incorporated into segmentation, which give the user much greater flexibility and allow for the automatic correction of errors. *Subjective surface Segmentation: This method is based on the idea of evolution of segmentation function which is governed by an advection-diffusion model.K. Mikula, N. Peyriéras, M. Remešíková, A.Sarti: 3D embryogenesis image segmentation by the generalized subjective surface method using the finite volume technique. Proceedings of FVCA5 – 5th International Symposium on Finite Volumes for Complex Applications, Hermes Publ., Paris 2008. To segment an object, a segmentation seed is needed (that is the starting point that determines the approximate position of the object in the image). Consequently, an initial segmentation function is constructed. The idea behind the subjective surface method A. Sarti, G. Citti: Subjective surfaces and Riemannian mean curvature flow graphs. Acta Math. Univ. Comenian. (N.S.) 70 (2000), 85–103.A. Sarti, R. Malladi, J.A. Sethian: Subjective Surfaces: A Method for Completing Missing Boundaries. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. mi 12, No. 97 (2000), 6258–6263.A. Sarti, R. Malladi, J.A. Sethian: Subjective Surfaces: A Geometric Model for Boundary Completion, International Journal of Computer Vision, mi 46, No. 3 (2002), 201–221. is that the position of the seed is the main factor determining the form of this segmentation function. However, there are some other classification of image segmentation methods which are similar to above categories. Moreover, we can classify another group as “Hybrid” which is based on combination of methods. == Registration == CT image (left), PET image (center) and overlay of both (right) after correct registration. Image registration is a process that searches for the correct alignment of images. In the simplest case, two images are aligned. Typically, one image is treated as the target image and the other is treated as a source image; the source image is transformed to match the target image. The optimization procedure updates the transformation of the source image based on a similarity value that evaluates the current quality of the alignment. This iterative procedure is repeated until a (local) optimum is found. An example is the registration of CT and PET images to combine structural and metabolic information (see figure). Image registration is used in a variety of medical applications: * Studying temporal changes. Longitudinal studies acquire images over several months or years to study long-term processes, such as disease progression. Time series correspond to images acquired within the same session (seconds or minutes). They can be used to study cognitive processes, heart deformations and respiration. * Combining complementary information from different imaging modalities. An example is the fusion of anatomical and functional information. Since the size and shape of structures vary across modalities, it is more challenging to evaluate the alignment quality. This has led to the use of similarity measures such as mutual information. * Characterizing a population of subjects. In contrast to intra-subject registration, a one-to-one mapping may not exist between subjects, depending on the structural variability of the organ of interest. Inter-subject registration is required for atlas construction in computational anatomy. Here, the objective is to statistically model the anatomy of organs across subjects. * Computer-assisted surgery. In computer-assisted surgery pre-operative images such as CT or MRI are registered to intra-operative images or tracking systems to facilitate image guidance or navigation. There are several important considerations when performing image registration: * The transformation model. Common choices are rigid, affine, and deformable transformation models. B-spline and thin plate spline models are commonly used for parameterized transformation fields. Non- parametric or dense deformation fields carry a displacement vector at every grid location; this necessitates additional regularization constraints. A specific class of deformation fields are diffeomorphisms, which are invertible transformations with a smooth inverse. * The similarity metric. A distance or similarity function is used to quantify the registration quality. This similarity can be calculated either on the original images or on features extracted from the images. Common similarity measures are sum of squared distances (SSD), correlation coefficient, and mutual information. The choice of similarity measure depends on whether the images are from the same modality; the acquisition noise can also play a role in this decision. For example, SSD is the optimal similarity measure for images of the same modality with Gaussian noise. However, the image statistics in ultrasound are significantly different from Gaussian noise, leading to the introduction of ultrasound specific similarity measures. Multi-modal registration requires a more sophisticated similarity measure; alternatively, a different image representation can be used, such as structural representations or registering adjacent anatomy. * The optimization procedure. Either continuous or discrete optimization is performed. For continuous optimization, gradient-based optimization techniques are applied to improve the convergence speed. == Visualization == Volume rendering (left), axial cross-section (right top), and sagittal cross-section (right bottom) of a CT image of a subject with multiple nodular lesions (white line) in the lung. Visualization plays several key roles in Medical Image Computing. Methods from scientific visualization are used to understand and communicate about medical images, which are inherently spatial-temporal. Data visualization and data analysis are used on unstructured data forms, for example when evaluating statistical measures derived during algorithmic processing. Direct interaction with data, a key feature of the visualization process, is used to perform visual queries about data, annotate images, guide segmentation and registration processes, and control the visual representation of data (by controlling lighting rendering properties and viewing parameters). Visualization is used both for initial exploration and for conveying intermediate and final results of analyses. The figure \\"Visualization of Medical Imaging\\" illustrates several types of visualization: 1. the display of cross-sections as gray scale images; 2. reformatted views of gray scale images (the sagittal view in this example has a different orientation than the original direction of the image acquisition; and 3. A 3D volume rendering of the same data. The nodular lesion is clearly visible in the different presentations and has been annotated with a white line. == Atlases == Medical images can vary significantly across individuals due to people having organs of different shapes and sizes. Therefore, representing medical images to account for this variability is crucial. A popular approach to represent medical images is through the use of one or more atlases. Here, an atlas refers to a specific model for a population of images with parameters that are learned from a training dataset. The simplest example of an atlas is a mean intensity image, commonly referred to as a template. However, an atlas can also include richer information, such as local image statistics and the probability that a particular spatial location has a certain label. New medical images, which are not used during training, can be mapped to an atlas, which has been tailored to the specific application, such as segmentation and group analysis. Mapping an image to an atlas usually involves registering the image and the atlas. This deformation can be used to address variability in medical images.  Single template  The simplest approach is to model medical images as deformed versions of a single template image. For example, anatomical MRI brain scans are often mapped to the MNI template as to represent all the brain scans in common coordinates. The main drawback of a single-template approach is that if there are significant differences between the template and a given test image, then there may not be a good way to map one onto the other. For example, an anatomical MRI brain scan of a patient with severe brain abnormalities (i.e., a tumor or surgical procedure), may not easily map to the MNI template.  Multiple templates  Rather than relying on a single template, multiple templates can be used. The idea is to represent an image as a deformed version of one of the templates. For example, there could be one template for a healthy population and one template for a diseased population. However, in many applications, it is not clear how many templates are needed. A simple albeit computationally expensive way to deal with this is to have every image in a training dataset be a template image and thus every new image encountered is compared against every image in the training dataset. A more recent approach automatically finds the number of templates needed. == Statistical analysis == Statistical methods combine the medical imaging field with modern Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition. Over the last decade, several large datasets have been made publicly available (see for example ADNI, 1000 functional Connectomes Project), in part due to collaboration between various institutes and research centers. This increase in data size calls for new algorithms that can mine and detect subtle changes in the images to address clinical questions. Such clinical questions are very diverse and include group analysis, imaging biomarkers, disease phenotyping and longitudinal studies.  Group analysis  In the Group Analysis, the objective is to detect and quantize abnormalities induced by a disease by comparing the images of two or more cohorts. Usually one of these cohorts consist of normal (control) subjects, and the other one consists of abnormal patients. Variation caused by the disease can manifest itself as abnormal deformation of anatomy (see Voxel- based morphometry). For example, shrinkage of sub-cortical tissues such as the Hippocampus in brain may be linked to Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, changes in biochemical (functional) activity can be observed using imaging modalities such as Positron Emission Tomography. The comparison between groups is usually conducted on the voxel level. Hence, the most popular pre- processing pipeline, particularly in neuroimaging, transforms all of the images in a dataset to a common coordinate frame via (Medical Image Registration) in order to maintain correspondence between voxels. Given this voxel-wise correspondence, the most common Frequentist method is to extract a statistic for each voxel (for example, the mean voxel intensity for each group) and perform statistical hypothesis testing to evaluate whether a null hypothesis is or is not supported. The null hypothesis typically assumes that the two cohorts are drawn from the same distribution, and hence, should have the same statistical properties (for example, the mean values of two groups are equal for a particular voxel). Since medical images contain large numbers of voxels, the issue of multiple comparison needs to be addressed,. There are also Bayesian approaches to tackle group analysis problem.  Classification  Although group analysis can quantify the general effects of a pathology on an anatomy and function, it does not provide subject level measures, and hence cannot be used as biomarkers for diagnosis (see Imaging Biomarkers). Clinicians, on the other hand, are often interested in early diagnosis of the pathology (i.e. classification,) and in learning the progression of a disease (i.e. regression ). From methodological point of view, current techniques varies from applying standard machine learning algorithms to medical imaging datasets (e.g. Support Vector Machine ), to developing new approaches adapted for the needs of the field. The main difficulties are as follows: * Small sample size (Curse of Dimensionality): a large medical imaging dataset contains hundreds to thousands of images, whereas the number of voxels in a typical volumetric image can easily go beyond millions. A remedy to this problem is to reduce the number of features in an informative sense (see dimensionality reduction). Several unsupervised and semi-/supervised, approaches have been proposed to address this issue. * Interpretability: A good generalization accuracy is not always the primary objective, as clinicians would like to understand which parts of anatomy are affected by the disease. Therefore, interpretability of the results is very important; methods that ignore the image structure are not favored. Alternative methods based on feature selection have been proposed,.  Clustering  Image-based pattern classification methods typically assume that the neurological effects of a disease are distinct and well defined. This may not always be the case. For a number of medical conditions, the patient populations are highly heterogeneous, and further categorization into sub-conditions has not been established. Additionally, some diseases (e.g., autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) can be characterized by a continuous or nearly-continuous spectra from mild cognitive impairment to very pronounced pathological changes. To facilitate image-based analysis of heterogeneous disorders, methodological alternatives to pattern classification have been developed. These techniques borrow ideas from high-dimensional clustering and high-dimensional pattern-regression to cluster a given population into homogeneous sub-populations. The goal is to provide a better quantitative understanding of the disease within each sub-population.  Shape analysis  Shape Analysis is the field of Medical Image Computing that studies geometrical properties of structures obtained from different imaging modalities. Shape analysis recently become of increasing interest to the medical community due to its potential to precisely locate morphological changes between different populations of structures, i.e. healthy vs pathological, female vs male, young vs elderly. Shape Analysis includes two main steps: shape correspondence and statistical analysis. * Shape correspondence is the methodology that computes correspondent locations between geometric shapes represented by triangle meshes, contours, point sets or volumetric images. Obviously definition of correspondence will influence directly the analysis. Among the different options for correspondence frameworks we can find: Anatomical correspondence, manual landmarks, functional correspondence (i.e. in brain morphometry locus responsible for same neuronal functionality), geometry correspondence, (for image volumes) intensity similarity, etc. Some approaches, e.g. spectral shape analysis, do not require correspondence but compare shape descriptors directly. * Statistical analysis will provide measurements of structural change at correspondent locations.  Longitudinal studies  In longitudinal studies the same person is imaged repeatedly. This information can be incorporated both into the image analysis, as well as into the statistical modeling. * In longitudinal image processing, segmentation and analysis methods of individual time points are informed and regularized with common information usually from a within-subject template. This regularization is designed to reduce measurement noise and thus helps increase sensitivity and statistical power. At the same time over-regularization needs to be avoided, so that effect sizes remain stable. Intense regularization, for example, can lead to excellent test-retest reliability, but limits the ability to detect any true changes and differences across groups. Often a trade-off needs to be aimed for, that optimizes noise reduction at the cost of limited effect size loss. Another common challenge in longitudinal image processing is the, often unintentional, introduction of processing bias. When, for example, follow-up images get registered and resampled to the baseline image, interpolation artifacts get introduced to only the follow-up images and not the baseline. These artifact can cause spurious effects (usually a bias towards overestimating longitudinal change and thus underestimating required sample size). It is therefore essential that all-time points get treated exactly the same to avoid any processing bias. * Post-processing and statistical analysis of longitudinal data usually requires dedicated statistical tools such as repeated measure ANOVA or the more powerful linear mixed effects models. Additionally, it is advantageous to consider the spatial distribution of the signal. For example, cortical thickness measurements will show a correlation within-subject across time and also within a neighborhood on the cortical surface - a fact that can be used to increase statistical power. Furthermore, time-to-event (aka survival) analysis is frequently employed to analyze longitudinal data and determine significant predictors. == Image-based physiological modelling == Traditionally, medical image computing has seen to address the quantification and fusion of structural or functional information available at the point and time of image acquisition. In this regard, it can be seen as quantitative sensing of the underlying anatomical, physical or physiological processes. However, over the last few years, there has been a growing interest in the predictive assessment of disease or therapy course. Image-based modelling, be it of biomechanical or physiological nature, can therefore extend the possibilities of image computing from a descriptive to a predictive angle. According to the STEP research roadmap,STEP research roadmap . europhysiome.org the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) is a methodological and technological framework that, once established, will enable the investigation of the human body as a single complex system. Underlying the VPH concept, the International Union for Physiological Sciences (IUPS) has been sponsoring the IUPS Physiome Project for more than a decade,. This is a worldwide public domain effort to provide a computational framework for understanding human physiology. It aims at developing integrative models at all levels of biological organization, from genes to the whole organisms via gene regulatory networks, protein pathways, integrative cell functions, and tissue and whole organ structure/function relations. Such an approach aims at transforming current practice in medicine and underpins a new era of computational medicine. In this context, medical imaging and image computing play an increasingly important role as they provide systems and methods to image, quantify and fuse both structural and functional information about the human being in vivo. These two broad research areas include the transformation of generic computational models to represent specific subjects, thus paving the way for personalized computational models.N. Ayache, J.-P. Boissel, S. Brunak, G. Clapworthy, G. Lonsdale, J. Fingberg, A. F. Frangi, G.Deco, P. J. Hunter, P.Nielsen, M.Halstead, D. R. Hose, I. Magnin, F. Martin-Sanchez, P. Sloot, J. Kaandorp, A. Hoekstra, S. Van Sint Jan, and M. Viceconti (2005) \\"Towards virtual physiological human: Multilevel modelling and simulation of the human anatomy and physiology\\". Directorate General INFSO & Directorate General JRC, White paper Individualization of generic computational models through imaging can be realized in three complementary directions: * definition of the subject-specific computational domain (anatomy) and related subdomains (tissue types); * definition of boundary and initial conditions from (dynamic and/or functional) imaging; and * characterization of structural and functional tissue properties. In addition, imaging also plays a pivotal role in the evaluation and validation of such models both in humans and in animal models, and in the translation of models to the clinical setting with both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In this specific context, molecular, biological, and pre-clinical imaging render additional data and understanding of basic structure and function in molecules, cells, tissues and animal models that may be transferred to human physiology where appropriate. The applications of image-based VPH/Physiome models in basic and clinical domains are vast. Broadly speaking, they promise to become new virtual imaging techniques. Effectively more, often non-observable, parameters will be imaged in silico based on the integration of observable but sometimes sparse and inconsistent multimodal images and physiological measurements. Computational models will serve to engender interpretation of the measurements in a way compliant with the underlying biophysical, biochemical or biological laws of the physiological or pathophysiological processes under investigation. Ultimately, such investigative tools and systems will help our understanding of disease processes, the natural history of disease evolution, and the influence on the course of a disease of pharmacological and/or interventional therapeutic procedures. Cross-fertilization between imaging and modelling goes beyond interpretation of measurements in a way consistent with physiology. Image- based patient-specific modelling, combined with models of medical devices and pharmacological therapies, opens the way to predictive imaging whereby one will be able to understand, plan and optimize such interventions in silico. == Mathematical methods in medical imaging == A number of sophisticated mathematical methods have entered medical imaging, and have already been implemented in various software packages. These include approaches based on partial differential equations (PDEs) and curvature driven flows for enhancement, segmentation, and registration. Since they employ PDEs, the methods are amenable to parallelization and implementation on GPGPUs. A number of these techniques have been inspired from ideas in optimal control. Accordingly, very recently ideas from control have recently made their way into interactive methods, especially segmentation. Moreover, because of noise and the need for statistical estimation techniques for more dynamically changing imagery, the Kalman filter and particle filter have come into use. A survey of these methods with an extensive list of references may be found in. ==Modality specific computing== Some imaging modalities provide very specialized information. The resulting images cannot be treated as regular scalar images and give rise to new sub-areas of Medical Image Computing. Examples include diffusion MRI, functional MRI and others. Diffusion MRI A mid-axial slice of the ICBM diffusion tensor image template. Each voxel's value is a tensor represented here by an ellipsoid. Color denotes principal orientation: red = left-right, blue=inferior-superior, green = posterior- anterior Diffusion MRI is a structural magnetic resonance imaging modality that allows measurement of the diffusion process of molecules. Diffusion is measured by applying a gradient pulse to a magnetic field along a particular direction. In a typical acquisition, a set of uniformly distributed gradient directions is used to create a set of diffusion weighted volumes. In addition, an unweighted volume is acquired under the same magnetic field without application of a gradient pulse. As each acquisition is associated with multiple volumes, diffusion MRI has created a variety of unique challenges in medical image computing. In medicine, there are two major computational goals in diffusion MRI: * Estimation of local tissue properties, such as diffusivity; * Estimation of local directions and global pathways of diffusion. The diffusion tensor, a 3 × 3 symmetric positive-definite matrix, offers a straightforward solution to both of these goals. It is proportional to the covariance matrix of a Normally distributed local diffusion profile and, thus, the dominant eigenvector of this matrix is the principal direction of local diffusion. Due to the simplicity of this model, a maximum likelihood estimate of the diffusion tensor can be found by simply solving a system of linear equations at each location independently. However, as the volume is assumed to contain contiguous tissue fibers, it may be preferable to estimate the volume of diffusion tensors in its entirety by imposing regularity conditions on the underlying field of tensors. Scalar values can be extracted from the diffusion tensor, such as the fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivities, which indirectly measure tissue properties such as the dysmyelination of axonal fibers or the presence of edema. Standard scalar image computing methods, such as registration and segmentation, can be applied directly to volumes of such scalar values. However, to fully exploit the information in the diffusion tensor, these methods have been adapted to account for tensor valued volumes when performing registration and segmentation. Given the principal direction of diffusion at each location in the volume, it is possible to estimate the global pathways of diffusion through a process known as tractography. However, due to the relatively low resolution of diffusion MRI, many of these pathways may cross, kiss or fan at a single location. In this situation, the single principal direction of the diffusion tensor is not an appropriate model for the local diffusion distribution. The most common solution to this problem is to estimate multiple directions of local diffusion using more complex models. These include mixtures of diffusion tensors, Q-ball imaging, diffusion spectrum imaging and fiber orientation distribution functions, which typically require HARDI acquisition with a large number of gradient directions. As with the diffusion tensor, volumes valued with these complex models require special treatment when applying image computing methods, such as registration and segmentation.  Functional MRI  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a medical imaging modality that indirectly measures neural activity by observing the local hemodynamics, or blood oxygen level dependent signal (BOLD). fMRI data offers a range of insights, and can be roughly divided into two categories: * Task related fMRI is acquired as the subject is performing a sequence of timed experimental conditions. In block-design experiments, the conditions are present for short periods of time (e.g., 10 seconds) and are alternated with periods of rest. Event-related experiments rely on a random sequence of stimuli and use a single time point to denote each condition. The standard approach to analyze task related fMRI is the general linear model (GLM) * Resting state fMRI is acquired in the absence of any experimental task. Typically, the objective is to study the intrinsic network structure of the brain. Observations made during rest have also been linked to specific cognitive processes such as encoding or reflection. Most studies of resting state fMRI focus on low frequency fluctuations of the fMRI signal (LF-BOLD). Seminal discoveries include the default network, a comprehensive cortical parcellation, and the linking of network characteristics to behavioral parameters. There is a rich set of methodology used to analyze functional neuroimaging data, and there is often no consensus regarding the best method. Instead, researchers approach each problem independently and select a suitable model/algorithm. In this context there is a relatively active exchange among neuroscience, computational biology, statistics, and machine learning communities. Prominent approaches include * Massive univariate approaches that probe individual voxels in the imaging data for a relationship to the experiment condition. The prime approach is the general linear model (GLM) * Multivariate- and classifier based approaches, often referred to as multi voxel pattern analysis or multi-variate pattern analysis probe the data for global and potentially distributed responses to an experimental condition. Early approaches used support vector machines (SVM) to study responses to visual stimuli. Recently, alternative pattern recognition algorithms have been explored, such as random forest based gini contrast or sparse regression and dictionary learning * Functional connectivity analysis studies the intrinsic network structure of the brain, including the interactions between regions. The majority of such studies focus on resting state data to parcelate the brain or to find correlates to behavioral measures. Task specific data can be used to study causal relationships among brain regions (e.g., dynamic causal mapping (DCM) ). When working with large cohorts of subjects, the normalization (registration) of individual subjects into a common reference frame is crucial. A body of work and tools exist to perform normalization based on anatomy (FSL, FreeSurfer, SPM). Alignment taking spatial variability across subjects into account is a more recent line of work. Examples are the alignment of the cortex based on fMRI signal correlation, the alignment based on the global functional connectivity structure both in task-, or resting state data, and the alignment based on stimulus specific activation profiles of individual voxels. == Software == Software for medical image computing is a complex combination of systems providing IO, visualization and interaction, user interface, data management and computation. Typically system architectures are layered to serve algorithm developers, application developers, and users. The bottom layers are often libraries and/or toolkits which provide base computational capabilities; while the top layers are specialized applications which address specific medical problems, diseases, or body systems. == Additional notes == Medical Image Computing is also related to the field of Computer Vision. An international society, The MICCAI Society represents the field and organizes an annual conference and associated workshops. Proceedings for this conference are published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. In 2000, N. Ayache and J. Duncan reviewed the state of the field. ==See also== * Imaging informatics * Neuroimaging software ==References Journals on medical image computing == * Medical Image Analysis (MedIA) ; also the official journal of The MICCAI Society, which organizes the Annual MICCAI Conference a premier conference for medical image computing * IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (IEEE TMI) * Medical Physics * Journal of Digital Imaging (JDI) ; the official journal of the Society of Imaging Informatics * Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics * Journal of Computer Aided Radiology and Surgery * BMC Medical Imaging In addition the following journals occasionally publish articles describing methods and specific clinical applications of medical image computing or modality specific medical image computing * Radiology the official journal of the Radiological Society of North America * NeuroImage * Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (JMRI) * Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (MRM) * Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography (JCAT) * Human Brain Mapping Category:Bioimaging software Category:Medical imaging ","title":"Medical image computing"},{"id":"35201533","text":"La casa is a 1954 novel by Argentine writer Manuel Mujica Laínez.

During the test subjects are assisted in producing a reference force using various types of feedback (static weight or visual display of force generated). This is followed by an attempt of the subject to generate the reference force without assistance. The duration for both reference and matching tasks is usually four seconds. Results are taken as a mean value of force generated over a time interval set by the researcher. Time intervals are generally one second long and near the end of the attempt. Reference forces are typically set as a percentage of a subject’s MVC while error is typically reported as a percentage of a subject’s MVC. *Atomic force matching – It is one of the effective research method to obtain realistic classical interatomic potential or force field for molecular dynamics simulation with high degree of transferability for systems which the first principles or ab initio method is capable of treating. This method is based on fitting the forces on individual atoms in a number of reference structures, cohesive energies and stresses on unit cell obtained from first principles calculation with those obtained from classical interatomic potential. The target of the computational fitting is to determine unknown coefficients in classical interatomic potential function. This method is developed by F. Ercolessi, and J. B. Adams during 1992 and 1993 at Department of Material Science and Engineering at the University of Urbana-Campaign.Ercolessi, F., & Adams, J. B. (1992).

These two unknown parameters can be fitted to reproduce experimental data or accurate data obtained from first principle calculations. Differentiating the L-J potential with respect to r gives an expression for the net inter-molecular force between 2 molecules.

Both his grandfather Du Shenquan and father Du Rangneng served as chancellors during Tang Dynasty — Du Shenquen during the reign of Emperor Yizong, and Du Rangneng during the reigns of Emperor Yizong's sons Emperor Xizong and Emperor Zhaozong.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 18. Du Rangneng was a close confidant of Emperor Zhaozong's. In 893, after Emperor Zhaozong's failed campaign against the warlords Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (靜難, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) — a campaign that Du Rangneng had coordinated after Emperor Zhaozong ordered him to even though he was against the campaign — Wang and Li marched on the imperial capital Chang'an; under duress from them, Emperor Zhaozong was forced to order Du Rangneng to commit suicide.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. After Du Rangneng's death, Du Xiao mourned him bitterly, and even after the traditional three-year mourning period, he still partially wore mourning clothes for over a decade and did not embark on an official career. His older brother Du Guang'ai () was suffering from a mental illness, such that at times he would act out violently or speak angrily, but despite this, Du Xiao served him humbly as an older brother. During Emperor Zhaozong's Guanghua era (898-901), when the chancellor Cui Yin served also as the director of salt and iron monopolies, Cui offered him a number of positions in the imperial government — as an assistant to Cui as the director of the monopolies; as a Xiaoshulang (), a copyeditor at the Palace Library; a county sheriff near Chang'an; and a scholar at Hongwen Pavilion (); he declined them all. Later, after Emperor Zhaozong was forced by the warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) to move to Luoyang, the chancellor Cui Yuan, who was then also serving as the director of taxation, offered him the posts of assistant to Cui as director of taxation and the deputy director of palace affairs (殿中丞, Dianzhong Cheng). Cui spoke to him to persuade him to accept: Du Xiao therefore agreed to accept the posts. Shortly after, he was made Zuo Shiyi (), an advisory official at the examination bureau (門下省, Menxia Sheng), and soon was made an imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi) and Shanbu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (禮部, Libu). After Cui himself was removed (and later killed) by Zhu in 905,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. Du lost his position as imperial scholar and was only serving as Shanbu Yuanwailang. Several months later, however, he was given the responsibility of drafting imperial edicts, and was then given back his position as imperial scholar, and promoted to a supervisory position as Shanbu Langzhong (). == During Later Liang == In 907, Zhu Quanzhong had Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Du Xiao was made Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng) and continued to serve as an imperial scholar. In 909, he was made the deputy minister of public works (工部侍郎, Gongbu Shilang) and chief imperial scholar (翰林學士承旨, Hanlin Xueshi Chengzhi). That fall, he was made a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), as well as the deputy minister of census (戶部侍郎, Hubu Shilang).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. In 912, Emperor Taizu was assassinated by his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying, who took the throne himself. Zhu Yougui retained Du as a chancellor and gave him additional titles minister of rites (禮部尚書, Libu Shangshu) and grand scholar at Jixian Hall (). In 913, Emperor Taizu's nephew, the general Yuan Xiangxian, who was working in league with Emperor Taizu's son-in-law Zhao Yan and son Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun, rose against Zhu Yougui and attacked the palace. Zhu Yougui committed suicide. After Zhu Yougui's death, the imperial guards began to pillage Luoyang. During the confusion, Du Xiao was wounded by the soldiers and died from his injuries. After Zhu Youzhen subsequently took the throne, he gave Du posthumous honors. == Notes and references == * History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 18. * New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 35. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 267, 268.

He is also a seasoned singer and lyricist who has performed for few Kannada film songs. He has acted in numerous films as a child artist and also featured in few Television series. ==Personal life and family== Sunil Rao comes from a family of well-known musicians. His mother B. K. Sumitra, is a prominent Sugama Sangeetha (light music) singer. His sister Sowmya Raoh is also an established playback singer who has performed for various films in different languages. He was also interested in playback-singing and entered the film industry aspiring to be one. But he had to change his path towards acting since offers came pouring ever since he was a child. He studied in Bangalore's National College. ==Career== As a child artist Rao started his career as a child artiste in the year 1987 for the films such as Kendada Male and Elu Suttina Kote. He performed his roles much to the attention of producers and went on acting in a few more films. Television artist Rao, aspiring to be a playback singer, re-entered acting in his teens. He appeared in a few soap operas that included Janani, Chaduranga, Punarjanma, B. Suresh's Sadhane and T. N. Seetharam's Manvantara and Bhageerathi. In Janani, he was cast as the grandson of Bharathi Vishnuvardhan's character. Films Sunil Rao began his film career acting in some non-significant character roles in the films such as Chitra and Panchaalee. However, he shot to fame in the 2003 released Hinglish film Freaky Chakra. He starred alongside Deepti Naval as a young boy infatuated by an older woman. He also starred as a teenage lover in the Kavita Lankesh directorial Preethi Prema Pranaya opposite Anu Prabhakar, the same year.

In 2006, he starred in the critically acclaimed Belli Betta directed by Shivaraj Hoskere. He also appeared as one of the lead characters in the film Jackpot. Following these ventures, Rao became choosy and featured in very few films in the late 2000s. His only release in 2008 was his cameo appearance in the film Tajmahal. Minugu opposite Pooja Gandhi was his solo release in the year 2010. Noted film maker Sunil Kumar Desai announced a film called Sarigama in 2008 with Rao and Prajwal Devaraj in the lead. This film, expected to have a 2012 release got shelved due to unknown reasons.

Hallin and Paolo Mancini, is a seminal study in the field of international comparative media system research. The study compares media systems of 18 Western democracies including nine Northern European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland), five Southern European countries (France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) and four Atlantic countries (Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, and the United States). The conceptual framework developed in this study turned out to be an important contributionQuotes for illustration: „[T]his work, which is being acknowledged as a central text in an emerging subfield.” (Jones, 2008, p. 128) “Comparing Media Systems is, indeed, a path- breaking volume that will serve as a model for today’s comparative communication analyses.” (Graber, 2006, p. 935) “What is not open to speculation is the significance of this work. Hallin and Mancini’s pio-neering effort will define comparative media research for years to come.” (Patterson, 2007, p. 331) “A major recent contribution to the comparative research tradition “ (Hardy, 2008, p. 17) to the field of the comparative media systems research because it provides a systematic and applicable approach to analyze differences and similarities of the relationships between media and politics. Since the publication of Hallin and Mancini’s book in 2004, there has been a vivid academic discussion (Recent developments), particularly with regards to the adequacy of their suggested framework for understanding variations between different systems around the world, located within different cultural, social, and/or political contexts. As a consequence, a flourishing progression within the field of comparative media system research can be stated. == Contextualization ==  Comparative media system research  The field of comparative media system research has a long tradition reaching back to the study Four Theories of the Press by Siebert, Peterson and Schramm from 1956. This book was the origin of the academic debate on comparing and classifying media systems,cf. Hardy (2008), p. 11. whereas it was normatively biasedcf. Hardy (2008), p. xv. and strongly influenced by the ideologies of the Cold War era.Siebert and his colleagues developed a normative classification of four ideal media systems: the libertarian, the social responsible, the Soviet Communist, and the authoritarian model. Consequently, the author’s typology referred to the then ideological segmentation of the world: a liberal democratic free world in the “West” (labeled the First World), a soviet-communist sphere (labeled the Second World), and authoritarian states (labeled the Third World) (cf. Hardy, 2008, p. 11). Though this approach has often been criticizedcf. Patterson (2007), p. 329. (e.g. because of its ethnocentricity, inconsistent structure, questionable typologies, or its scant empirical basis of the analysiscf. Hardy (2008), p. 12-13.), it was a starting point for following normative media theoriescf. Jackubowicz (2010), p. 2.As Hardy (2008) and Jakubowicz (2010) point out, there were additional and modifying developments of the original typologies (e.g. by Denis McQuail (1987), Raymond Williams (1968), or Robert G. Picard (1985)) and alternative schemas as well, which moved further away from the original typologies (e.g. J. Herbert Altschull (1984)). and the development of the field. Comparative media system research has been subject to several changes since its establishment.cf. Jakubowicz (2010), p. 1. The number of categories to describe media systems grew and approaches got more complex. Another trend is that researchers factor in political systems more intensively to explain and compare media systems. A more fundamental development is the shift from normative to empirically based approaches. There are still problems of comparative media studies in various countries which must be faced. The validity of the country sampling procedure is one problem, beside the adequate definition of the scope of the comparison to meet the specific national features of the cases, and the definition of adequate indicators as the basis for the comparison.cf. Sparks (2006), p. 24. Additionally, the developed models are still relatively static not being able to describe changes adequately, and online media have been largely neglected though their importance has been increasing since the late 1990s.cf. Jakubowicz (2010), p. 1. However, comparative media system studies are an important instrument for contemporary communication phenomena under study. The comparative design is a bridge between traditional and nation-centered studies of media systems and new media as well as globalization perspectives.cf. Hardy (2008), p. 21. Jakubowicz points out that contemporarily comparative media system analyses are seen as the key approach to understand globalization processes of the media.cf. Jakubowicz (2010), p. 1.  Systematic classification of the approach  Comparative media system research is one possible approach to study transnational and border-crossing communication processes worldwide. A very useful and heuristic systematization of the vast field of transnational and border-crossing communication comes from Wessler and Brüggemann (2012)cf. Wessler & Brüggemann (2012, in press). (see also Dimensions of analysis). According to this heuristic, the approach from Hallin and Mancini can be identified and localized as one specific combination of the components along these three dimensions of analysis. Their perspective of analysis is focused on a systematic comparison of media systems within Western democracies. Consequently, their level of analysis concentrates on media systems within the context of nation states. Their main objectives are media- politics relations primarily on the level of structures, but in addition to it, they consider all objects of analysis to gain an encompassing understanding of these relations. == Objectives == Developing a unifying conceptual framework for comparing media systems was essential for Hallin and Mancini. They focused on theory building rather than testing theories, as the then prevailing Four Theories of the Press and its subsequent normative modifications showed deficiencies in adequately analyzing present media systems. Consequently, Hallin and Mancini focused on an empirical “by treating these systems not as abstract ideals but as concrete social formations that developed under particular historical conditions.”Hallin & Mancini (2012a), p. 1-2. Hallin and Mancini initially chose a “most similar systems”-design – that is, comparing systems which are quite similar according to their structures and functioning to understand in which aspects they differ from each other to discover specific characteristics of each single system. Following this design, they conceptualized dimensions containing particular variables to analyze similarities and differences between the 18 countries under study. Their objective was to find more or less coherent patterns within their sample which could possibly be condensed into ideal types in terms of Max Weber’s conception of ideal types. Since the dimensions and the resulting models cover specifically the media-politics relations of the Western world, Hallin and Mancini do not claim universal validity of their framework. Hence, it must be reconceptualized to meet the specific conditions of media-politics relations beyond the Western world.cf. Hallin & Mancini (2012b). == Hallin and Mancini’s framework == Hallin and Mancini’s conceptual frameworkThe dimensions that Hallin and Mancini use for their framework are originally not devised by them. They trace to then existing concepts (e.g. the dimension of political parallelism is initially developed by Seymour-Ure (1974)) but they “go beyond earlier scholars in amplifying these dimensions and exploring their linkages” (Patterson, 2007, p. 329). consists of the four dimensions structure of media markets, political parallelism, professionalization of journalism, and the role of the state with regards to media systems; and of the five dimensions the role of the state, type of democracy (consensus vs. majoritarian), type of pluralism (individual vs. organized), degree of rational-legal authority, and degree of pluralism (moderate vs. polarized) with reference to the political contexts of media systems. According to specific constellations of the variables within these dimensions, Hallin and Mancini conceptualized the three models of media and politics.  Dimensions: media systems   Structure of media marketscf. Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 22-26.  The structure of media markets is concerned with the development of a mass press. The authors highlight several variables which can be used to describe the characteristics of press systems: * newspaper circulation rates * newspaper-readership relationship (elite- vs. mass-orientation) * gender differences in newspaper reach * relative importance of newspapers and television as sources of news * ratio of local, regional, and national newspapers * degree of a clear separation between sensationalist mass press and quality press * regional or linguistic segmentation of media markets * influence of bordering countries on the national media system  Political parallelismcf. Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 26-33.  Political parallelism refers to the “fact that media in some countries have distinct political orientations, while media in other countries do not.”Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 27. The authors established 5 factors or indicators to assess the extent of political parallelism: * the extent of political orientation within media content * organizational connections between the media and political organizations * the tendency of media personnel to take part in political life * partisanship of media audiences * journalists’ role orientation and practices (e.g. journalists as advocates vs. neutral arbiters, opinion-oriented vs. information-oriented reporting style, separating vs. blending commentary and information) * internal pluralism (i.e. covering different opinions and perspectives within one medium) or external pluralism (i.e. covering different opinions and perspectives within one media branch (e.g. the press system)) * the regulation of public service broadcasting (e.g. controlled by the government, insulated from direct political control, proportional representation of political parties or socially relevant groups)  Professionalization of journalismcf. Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 33-41.  The professionalization refers to the continuum of independent to instrumentalized journalism: * degree of autonomy * development of distinct professional norms and rules (e.g. practical routines or ethical principles) * public service orientation of the journalists (i.e. orientation towards an ethic of public service rather than towards interests of individual persons)  Role of the statecf. Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 41-44.  This dimension stresses the power the political system has in shaping the structure and functioning of a media system. “But there are considerable differences in the extent of state intervention as well as in the forms it takes.”Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 41. Hallin and Mancini use the following variables to cover this fourth dimension: * censorship or other types of political pressure * endowment of the media with economic subsidies * ownership of media- or telecommunication-organizations * provision of regulations for the media (laws, licensing, etc.) * the state as an information source and “primary definer” of news Ultimately, the interrelations of these four dimensions are complex. They have to be assessed empirically for every new case under study. Consequently, they may “influence one another in important ways, but also vary independently.”Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 45.  Dimensions: political context  In a next step, Hallin and Mancini identified five core dimensions to assess the political contexts of media systems. They took relevant concepts from the literatures on comparative politics and political sociology to gain a better understanding of the political influences on the development of media systems. The resulting dimensions are presented as dichotomies, but they are just poles on a continuum. The first dimension is the role of the state.cf. Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 49-50. It is conceptualized by the distinction between liberal democracies and welfare state democracies. The main difference between these two categories is the interventional activity of the state (e.g. funding vs. free market). This difference takes shape in the relative importance of private business or social institutions within the political system in question. A further important dichotomic dimension is labeled consensus vs. majoritarian democracy.cf. Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 50-53. Majoritarian democratic systems contain two dominating parties and, due to the plurality voting system, the winning party actually concentrates the political power so that there is a clear distinction between the government and the opposition. Furthermore, the Cabinet predominantly influences political decision processes. By contrast, the consensus politics model encompasses a multi-party system which is based on the power sharing principle according to the proportional representation so that compromise and cooperation between the opposing forces are central. Additionally, there is a separation of power between legislative and executive. The third dimension is the distinction between individual and organized pluralismcf. Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 53-55. resp. liberalism and corporatism. Individual pluralism is defined as the organization of the political representation “in terms of the relation between governing institutions and individual citizens, along with a multiplicity of competing ‘special interests’”.Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 53. On the other hand, the focus on organized social groups is more important within organized pluralism systems. Thus, corporatism includes the “formal integration of social groups into the political process”.Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 53. Hallin and Mancini identify the distinction between rational- legal authority and clientelismcf. Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 55-59. as another crucial dimension. Following Max Weber, Hallin and Mancini use the term rational-legal authority in its meaning as a form of governance whose main influence is maintained through formal and universalistic rules of procedure, i.e. an independent and autonomous administrative apparatus not affected by political and economic interests or lobbyism. This apparatus is the main institution of an efficient rational-legal system. In contrast, the orientation on common interests is much weaker within clientelism systems because individual interests and private relationships are the main forces maintaining the social organization. Consequently, “access to social resources is controlled by patrons and delivered to clients in exchange for deference and various forms of support”.Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 58. The final dimension is conceptualized by the distinction between moderate and polarized pluralism.cf. Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 59-61. Low consensus, challenged legitimacy of the political organizations or system, and deep cleavages within the political landscape are the main characteristics of polarized pluralism. An important indicator is the existence of anti-system parties and factions. Compared to this, moderate pluralism is mainly characterized by stronger tendencies toward the center, lower ideological differences between the political parties, greater acceptance of the political system, and better chances to gain consensus during political controversies.  The three models of media and politics  By using the aforementioned dimensions, Hallin and Mancini deduced and conceptualized three ideal models of media-politics relations (‘ideal’ according to Max Weber). Hallin and Mancini could identify specific patterns by geographical regions which were crucial for labeling the individual models:  The Three Models: Media System Characteristicscf. Table 4.1 The Three Models: Media System Characteristics (Hallin & Mancini, 2004, p. 67).  {  - ! Dimensions !! Mediterranean or Polarized Pluralist Model France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain !!

Controlled deregulation refers to the establishment of media policies by the political system, e.g. the implementation of formal licensing procedures for commercial broadcasting. Savage deregulation relates to the failure of the political system to impose such media policies. Consequently, the media corporations defined the regulation of the broadcasting market.

Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 66-73. of their three models which have to be considered in order not to overvalue the validity and significance of them. First of all, they focus on nation states and this level of analysis allows a specific perspective on media-politics relations but misses other phenomena of importance (e.g. transnational developments of media markets in Europe). Another concern is that the cases summarized within the single models vary enormously (especially within the Liberal model). Consequently, the models show a wide range of cases which might blur their distinction. Furthermore, the media systems within the analyzed countries might not be homogeneous (e.g. the structural differences between the print system and the broadcasting system in Germany). Because of the differences within the countries and the interferences between them, it is difficult to treat the 18 countries analyzed, as single cases because they depend on each other and influence each other. A final point is the dynamic of media systems because they cannot be assumed as static entities. Hence, media systems will always progress and there will always be changes resulting from those developing processes, so that reconsidering the characteristics of the mentioned models becomes necessary over time. Consequently, Hallin and Mancini point out in subsequent discussions that their models are not intended to be universal typologies which can be applied to other cases mechanically.cf. Hallin & Mancini (2010), p. xi.cf. Hallin & Mancini (2012a), p. 1.cf. Hallin & Mancini (2012b), p. 304. Instead, they suggest rather focusing on the dimensions and their applicability and adaption to analyze other media systems adequately – e.g. regarding Eastern European media systems, they propose to attach more weight to the role of the state and especially to the role of civil society to understand these systems appropriately.  The convergence-thesis  At the end of their book,Hallin & Mancini (2004), p. 251-295. Hallin and Mancini discuss the convergence- or homogenization-thesis. The basis for their argument is their observation of several transformation processes that take place especially in Europe. The most important processes are the European integration, politically as well as with regards to the media (e.g. European media laws), the decline of traditional political mass parties, the American influence on the professionalization of journalism, and finally the commercialization of the media markets in Europe. These are the main reasons why Hallin and Mancini conclude, that the European countries might be pushed toward the Liberal model. They even go one step further and hypothesize that the core forces of that homogenization- or convergence-process might be valid for other parts of the world. However, they point out that there might be limitations to this process as well because the elements of the process are anchored in the structural differences between the political systems around the world. == Recent developments (Beyond the Western world) == In this section, some recent issues and topics are mentioned because they arose from an ongoing scholar discussion about the applicability of Hallin and Mancini’s framework to other, especially non-Western countries: * Some researchers reflect upon the nature of the Polarized Pluralist model and its alleged applicability for many media systems beyond the Western world, for it seems to be a catch-all residual model.Summary of argumentation in: Hallin & Mancini (2012b), p. 279-280. * A related issue is the question whether the Polarized Pluralist model involves negative normative implications (compared to the other two models) what would turn it into an inferior or less-well developed model.Summary of argumentation in: Hallin & Mancini (2012b), p. 279-284. * Many researchers challenge the convergence-thesis because they identify serious differences between the cases they study and those Hallin and Mancini focused on, so that they conclude that globalization will rather result in hybridization- than in convergence-processes.Summary of argumentation in: Hallin & Mancini (2012b), p. 284-287. Concerning Western media systems, Hardy for example notes to include matters of ownership concentration and cultural processes to clarify and meet the complexity of convergence-processes.cf. Hardy (2008), p. 231-232. * A related point is the total exclusion of influential new online technologies and media which are of central importance for understanding transformations of media systems as well as the communication patterns within, between and beyond them.cf. Jackubowicz (2010), p. 10. Additionally, Hardy criticizes the neglect of all forms of entertainment media.cf. Hardy (2008), p. 20. * One of the main debates is about the extent to which the variables Hallin and Mancini use to measure the dimensions must be adapted to non-Western cases to meet their particular conditions.Summary of argumentation in: Hallin & Mancini (2012b), p. 287-299. Others criticize Hallin and Mancini’s concentration on media-politics relations because this perspective neglects interrelated variables, e.g. economic or cultural contexts.cf. Jackubowicz (2010), p. 12. * Concerning transnational and global developments, relations and influences around the world, some researches ask the question whether the nation state as a level of analysis is still appropriate.Summary of argumentation in: Hallin & Mancini (2012b), p. 299-300. For example, Jakubowicz argues that this methodological nationalism (cf. Mihelj et al., 2008) is inappropriate, for “media systems are no longer exclusively related to single political systems”,Jackubowicz (2010), p. 9. whereas Hardy notes that “[t]he political, legislative, cultural and social dimensions of the state are not simply diminished by globalisation”Hardy (2008), p. 237. and that “communication systems remain, to a significant degree, national in organization and orientation.”Hardy (2008), p. xvi. * A related debate is about the adequacy of focusing on structures and systems, as Hallin and Mancini did it, rather than considering more dynamic agencies and processes which cannot be covered entirely by a system- approach.Summary of argumentation in: Hallin & Mancini (2012b), p. 301-304.cf. Jackubowicz (2010), p. 11. * Hallin and Mancini decided to use a model- or ideal types-approach to explain certain patterns of their cases. Other researchers remark on the risk of generalizing and abstracting too early within the research process.Summary of argumentation in: Hallin & Mancini (2012b), p. 300-301. This vivid discussion reflects the status of Hallin and Mancini’s approach, as it is currently “the most well-developed analytical framework so far for understanding the relationship between media and political systems.”Hardy (2008), p. 232. Consequently, there are many studies that apply and adapt the framework for their cases under study. For example, Dobek-Ostrowska and colleagues published the edited volume Comparative Media Systems. European and Global Perspective (2010)Dobek-Ostrowska, B., Glowacki, M., Jakubowicz, K., & Sükösd, M. (2010). Comparative Media Systems. European and Global Perspective. Budapest: CEU Press. which contains comparative studies referring to or applying Hallin and Mancini’s framework for Central and Eastern Europe media systems. Hallin and Mancini published the edited volume Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World (2012)Hallin, D. C., & Mancini, P. (2012). Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. which gives a comprehensive overview with a more global perspective. Case studies from the media systems of Israel, Poland, Baltic states, Brazil, South Africa, Russia, China, and the Arab world are discussed by the contributors and a methodological reflection of Hallin and Mancini’s framework with regards to non-Western media systems is added. Further research was conducted by Jonathan Hardy, who analyzed the implications of transformation processes shaping contemporary media systems. As Hallin and Mancini did, Hardy focuses on media systems within Western democracies (actually 18 countries) and he adjoins their convergence thesis while he concentrates on print and broadcasting (especially TV).cf. Hardy (2008), p. xv. He chooses four paradigms (namely the liberal democratic theory, neoliberalism, libertarianism, and the critical political economy) as an analytical framework to examine relationships between media and politics, media and policy, media ownership and transnationalisation processes. Furthermore, Roger Blum’s approach (2005) is an attempt to broaden and complete Hallin and Mancini’s models by adding and modifying dimensions (he developed nine instead of four dimensions), classifying them as liberal, regulated, or as in between these two poles. Blum identifies six models of media systems,For a summary, cf. Jakubowicz (2010), p. 4-6. but he does “not explain how he created the models and why no other combination of specification is necessary”,Jakubowicz (2010), p. 6. so Blum’s framework is still in need for empirical support. Other studies focus on a single aspect of Hallin and Mancini’s framework and analyze it in detail. For example, Curran and his colleagues (2009) study the implications of the movement towards rather market-driven media and compare news contents and public knowledge of public affairs within different media systems by testing the hypothesis, “that market-based systems (…) impede the exercise of informed citizenship.”Curran et al. (2009), p. 6. There were also several conferences “triggered” by Hallin and Mancini’s framework; for example the International Media and Communication Conference “Comparing Media Systems: West Meets East” organized by the Department of Communication and Journalism at the University of Wroclaw (April 23–25, 2007), where more than 100 researchers attainedcf. Dobek-Ostrowska et al. (2010), p. vii. or conferences initiated by Hallin and Mancini themselves in Perugia in 2007, and in San Diego in 2009.cf. Hallin & Mancini (2012a), p. 2. Comparative media system research is an encouraging and important subfield of mediated cross-border communication. And Hallin and Mancini’s framework has been contributing to its consolidation and progression.cf.

He called for a \\"Norwegian ornithological central station\\" to be located in Stavanger, in a May 1920 article in the Stavangeren newspaper. His pleas were not only for a research station, but also the establishment of a society for the promotion of ornithological studies. In June 1920, Schaaning got in contact with six people willing to form an interim board of a Norwegian Ornithological Society. They were Gustav A. Arentz, Frederik Hansen, Erik Berentsen, Aamund Salveson (chair, deputy chair and two board members of Stavanger Museum), Oscar Collett and Carl Emil Petersen. Together Schaaning and this group campaigned in newspapers nationwide, calling for benefactors to help found an ornithological academic journal. By the end of 1920 Collett (and his wife) were the single largest benefactors of the journal; by he had contributed 22% of the journal's assets, more than twice as much as any other individual. Arentz, Petersen, Berentsen and Jakob Dreyer followed with a NOK 500 grant; Hansen and P. Chr. Schaaning contributed NOK 200. Four people gave 100, six people gave 50, five gave 30 and fifty gave NOK 20. was issued for the first time in March 1921. The interim board functioned until the first general assembly of the Ornithological Society, on 31 March 1922. It was decided that the board membership should reflect Norway's five regions (East, South, West, Central and North). Since the organization was operated out of Stavanger, however, it would prove difficult to hold regular meetings. It was therefore decided to supply the board with four deputies, all residing near Stavanger. As board members, the general assembly elected H. Tho. L. Schaaning (South), Askell Røskeland (West), Hjalmar Broch (East), Håkon Lie (Central) and Herm. Fjeldberg (North). Deputies became Gustav A. Arentz, Frederik Hansen, Erik Berentsen, Oscar Collett and Ths. Poulsson. The membership remained steady at c.190–200 people. No members' meetings were held; exceptionally some meetings were arranged by Herman L. Løvenskiold in Oslo in the late 1920s. The last written annual report was published as in 1931 describing the year 1928–29. It continued until April 1935 when issue 14–15 was published, and went defunct after that. The society was succeeded by a new Norwegian Ornithological Society in 1957. ==References== Category:Ornithological organizations Category:Education in Norway Category:Animal welfare organisations based in Norway Category:Organisations based in Stavanger Category:Scientific organizations established in 1920 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1935 Category:1920 establishments in Norway Category:1935 disestablishments in Norway ","title":"Norwegian Ornithological Society (1920–1935)"},{"id":"35203035","text":"West Germany sent a delegation to compete at the 1976 Summer Paralympics in Toronto, Canada.

Lord Clarendon referred to the Circle as \\"A college situate in a purer air\\", referring to its pursuit of truth away from the partisan passions of the town. The quote is referenced by John Buchan in his story \\"Fullcircle\\", though he misquotes it as \\"clearer air\\". The house was the property of the noble Cary family, and the circle was brought together by Lucius Cary, who became 2nd Viscount Falkland on the death of his father in 1633. The most prominent of those taking part was Edward Hyde, the future 1st Earl of Clarendon, who after 1660 would become known as a leading statesman, and then a historian. ==Views== Late engraving (1811) of Lord Falkland, after a portrait by Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen In the vexed religious climate of the time, the Circle was heterodox, inclining to sympathy with Socinianism. The favoured approach of some of those involved has been defined as \\"Arminian humanism\\", and in any case opposed to rigid Calvinism;See Arminianism in the Church of England. this approach fitted with political views that were essentially royalist. The central religious figure of the Circle was William Chillingworth. Falkland himself had a Catholic convert, Elizabeth Cary, Lady Falkland, for his mother, and found the tolerant approach of Erasmus attractive. ==Influences== Major influences on the thinking of the circle were Hugo Grotius and Richard Hooker because of the place the latter made for the use of reason in Biblical interpretation and church polity.Michael Brydon, The Evolving Reputation of Richard Hooker: An examination of responses 1600–1714 (2006), p. 52. These writers formed part of the broader Christian humanist tradition of Jacobus Acontius, George Cassander, Sebastian Castellio, Bernardino Ochino and Faustus Socinus. The anti-patristic views of Jean Daillé were also significant. According to the writings of Hyde (as Lord Clarendon), the gatherings and discussions themselves were modelled on those of Cicero and Erasmus, with guests being welcome to differ on points of view. Discourse also took place around the dinner table, with Clarendon likening the \\"Convivium Philosophicum or Convivium Theologicum (\\"philosophical-\\" or \\"theological feast\\") to Erasmus's Convivium Religiosum (\\"godly feast\\").\\" ==Tolerance, eirenicism, latitude== Chillingworth was influenced by Acontius, and the Circle read Acontius alongside Johannes Crellius, a Socinian. They found greater relevance in the eirenicism of Acontius than in the theology (Unitarianism) of Socinus himself. The context, as explained by the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, was that of the Thirty Years' War with its Protestant defeats of the 1620s and Catholic expansion; but also of the doctrines of the contra-Remonstrants in an environment of increasing skepticism on religious matters. Falkland and Chillingworth had been seared by the \\"Pyrrhonian crisis\\" of skepticism rampant.Hugh Trevor-Roper, From Counter-Reformation to Glorious Revolution (1992), p. 176. Opposed to fideism, the Circle found in the use by Grotius of probabilism a more attractive option to deal with the challenge of skepticism. Trevor-Roper supported the claims of the Great Tew group to the eirenic moral high ground on religious toleration and a commitment to rational dialogue on religion. This analysis has been challenged from the direction of the Circle's political thought, with its commitment to sovereignty. It has also been argued that these are two sides to the understanding of the period of the term \\"Socinian\\". The eirenic style was understood by Puritan opponents as Arminian rhetoric, and they moved away from compromise with it, to polemic and contemplation of war. The major theologians of the circle (Chillingworth, Hales, Taylor) have regularly been claimed as precursors of the Latitudinarians, a term anachronistic before 1660.E.g. Edward Augustus George, Seventeenth Century Men of Latitude; forerunners of the new theology (1908); . They are now considered to have paved the way for the Cambridge Platonists, in the attitude that there is no single basis of essential and true beliefs. The distinction now usual between the Cambridge Platonists and other Latitudinarians is a conventional one, introduced by John Tulloch in the 19th century. ==Participants== Participation in any actual dialogues as described by Hyde is problematic to establish; and the time scale has different points on it, though a beginning date of 1634 (Martinich) seems to be agreed widely. After about 1640 the troubled political situation overshadowed theoretical discussion and writing. The influence of the circle can be traced in theological production (especially Chillingworth's Religion of Protestants, 1638),In full The Religion of Protestants, a safe way to salvation, or, An answer to a booke entitle Mercy and truth, or, Charity maintain'd by Catholiques, which pretends to prove the contrary (Oxford, 1638). literary works and translation in a humanist vein, and the political line pursued by Falkland and Hyde in 1640–1, attempting to find a middle position between Puritan and Laudian extremes. Memorial to Falkland, who died at the first battle of Newbury of 1643, fighting recklessly on the royalist side, some 30 miles south of Great Tew Among those mentioned as being in Falkland's circle are: ;Churchmen *George AglionbyMalcolm, p.92 note 53. *Thomas Barlow *William Chillingworth *Hugh Paulinus Cressy *John Earle *Charles GatakerMartinich, p. 103. *John Hales *Henry Hammond *George Morley *Walter Raleigh the cleric. *Gilbert Sheldon *Jeremy Taylor. ;Men of letters *Thomas Carew *Charles Cotton (died 1658), father of Charles Cotton the poet. *Abraham Cowley *Sidney Godolphin *George Sandys *Sir John Suckling *Thomas Triplet *Edmund Waller ;Politicians and lawyers *Dudley DiggesMartinich, pp. 63–4. *Edward Hyde *John SeldenMartinich, pp. 63–4, and p. 217. Associations Since Great Tew was best known as an open house for Oxford scholars, and Falkland's contacts included a group centred on London and the court, it is artificial at best to assign membership in the circle to some who are known to have associated with the group. *Thomas Hobbes. Whether Hobbes actually visited Great Tew is unclear; he possibly did so in 1634. His associations with the circle through friendships are more certain in a London context. *Poets: Ben Jonson was on good terms with members of the circle, and visited Great Tew;Martinich, p. 217. Thomas May associated with the circle. *Wits: George Digby and Sir John Vaughan. *Katherine Jones, Viscountess Ranelagh, who moved to England from Ireland after the 1641 rebellion. *Sons of Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry. *Francis Wenman and Henry Rainsford, friends and neighbours of Falkland, linked to the Virginia Company of London.Malcolm, pp. 74–5. *Robert Payne and Thomas Lockey, on the Great Tew–Oxford axis of the 1630s.Malcolm, p. 325. *The Catholics Kenelm Digby and Wat Montagu, possibly. *Izaak Walton, biographer of Hooker, not likely to have participated at Great Tew, but close to a number of the Circle. ==Relationship to other groups== Falkland himself is identified as one of the Tribe of Ben, the followers of Jonson; and others of the Circle were also in the Tribe. Falkland also gave the first of the poetical tributes in the 1638 Oxford memorial volume Jonson Virbius, and others of the Circle who contributed were Henry Coventry, May and Digges.Barrett Wendell, The Temper of the Seventeenth Century in English Literature (1904), p. 136;archive.org. Hales and Chillingworth have been identified with an \\"Oxford School of rational theology\\", containing also Christopher Potter and William Page. It has been said that, despite the political difference over the defence of episcopacy, there is no clear distinction between the Great Tew line and Laudianism in theology. Falkland, Hyde and Sir John Colepepper were leaders of the \\"Country Alliance\\" of 1640.J. S. Morrill, The Revolt of the Provinces: Conservatives and Radicals in the English Civil War 1630–1650 (1980), p. 19. Katherine Jones was someone common to the Great Tew Circle and the Hartlib Circle. Robert Payne was a central figure in the so-called Welbeck Academy, around the Cavendishes, with which Hobbes was more closely associated than with Great Tew. Letice Cary, Viscountess Falkland, as a widow The widowed Lady Falkland (Letice or Lettice) took in John Duncon, brother of Eleazar Duncon and Edmund Duncon, who had lost his Essex rectory during the Civil war. He later wrote her biography (1648, in the form of an exchange of letters). It has been suggested that the household was run on lines similar to that at Little Gidding.A. L. Maycock, Nicholas Ferrar of Little Gidding (1938), note p. 231. ==References== *A. P.

The stunts are handled by Ravi Verma. In one of the scenes Dhruva Sarja jumped from 65 feet height and did all stunts without dupes. ==Plot== The story opens at a railway station where the director is narrating the different kinds of arguments and fights that happen at a railway station. The scene then shifts to a couple standing on a bridge over the tracks. The story soon moves into the lives of the couple who are fighting. Arjun (Dhruva Sarja) is seen having a heated argument with Poorna (Radhika Pandit). Although it is not made clear as to why they are fighting, it is understood that they are lovers and Arjun is trying to patch up with Poorna. Arjun tries valiantly to patch up with Poorna, who is vehemently denying his every apology and request to reconcile. Their argument soon enters into a situation where Arjun is forced to lie to stop Poorna from abandoning him and leave to Delhi. So, after befriending the ticket master (Tabla Nani), who helps his cause by giving Poorna a delayed ticket, Arjun feels that he has a chance to win back his love in just six days. Arjun challenges Poorna that he can win her back if she agrees to be with him for these last six days, in which he wants her to accompany her to all the places they had been as lovers before. Poorna reluctantly agrees, and the story now runs on two tracks where the director shows how close Arjun and Poorna were when they were together and how they are at present. So, as first four days pass, Arjun endures much scorn and hate from Poorna as he tries to win her heart. He takes on a gang of local goons who taunt her, and bashes them, but that still doesn't melt her heart. One day, Poorna appears at Arujun's house (the scene at this point shows that she might have actually forgiven Arjun) and asks him to buy her a dress and meet her tomorrow as she has a surprise for him. Arjun, excited, presents Poorna a dress, which she promises to wear when she meets him, and waits for her at the preset location. However, Arjun's heart is torn apart when Poorna introduces her fiancé Tarun (Tarun Chandra) further humiliating Arjun. Nevertheless, Arjun takes this insult in his stride and narrates his love story to Tarun, who is unaware that Arjun is actually telling Tarun his own love story he shares with Poorna. Tarun rejoices in the many twists and turns that Arjun endures to win Poorna'a love. It is now revealed that Arjun was nicknamed 'Achhu' and Poorna was nicknamed 'Rachhu' and they referred to themselves using the same names from the time they fell in love. Tarun is impressed with Arjun and promises any help he can offer for Arjun to reclaim his love and leaves. Although it is not revealed till the later part of the movie as to what caused the rift in their relationship, it soon becomes apparent that Poorna is upset with Arjun because he betrayed her when she trusted him the most. Dejected, she decided to end her relationship with Arjun and leave him for good. With five days having passed, Arjun begins to feel that his love is slipping away from him forever and bears his heart to Poorna, who by now has learnt that Arjun had no intention to betray her, and it was all her haste that has led to her breakup with Arjun. Disappointed with herself for humiliating the man she loves, she decides to leave the relationship anyway, as she fears that going back to Arjun now may cause him to doubt her feelings for him. However, on the seventh and final day, when the viewer suspects their relationship is soon to end, in a twist of fate, Arjun and Poorna miraculously unite and lead a happy life ever after. ==Production== Aesthetic sense was required for this romantic drama.

In the 20th century the house became a private school and it has now been converted to a luxury hotel. The estate is about of which are formal gardens. The River Ise flows from west to east south of the Hall.Parks and Gardens UK website , accessed 25 March 2012 ==History== Rushton Hall had been the possession of the Catholic Tresham family since the fifteenth century, when William Tresham bought the estate in 1438. He was Attorney General to King Henry V and Speaker of the House of Commons and was murdered in 1450. Sir Thomas Tresham (1500–59) was MP for Northamptonshire and three times High Sheriff of Northamptonshire. The latter's grandson Thomas (1534-1605), also a High Sheriff in 1573, built the Triangular Lodge in the grounds of the hall in 1592. His son, Francis Tresham, was involved in the Gunpowder Plot and died in the Tower of London in 1605. The estate then passed to his brother Lewis. The Hall was sold in 1619 to Sir William Cockayne, Lord Mayor of London who was the first Governor of Londonderry, Ireland. and on his death in 1626 passed to his eldest son Charles, later Viscount Cullen, who was appointed High Sheriff of Northamptonshire for 1636–37. The 2nd Viscount, Bryen, married Elizabeth Trentham, heiress to the Trentham estates including both Rocester Abbey and Castle Hedingham. Those estates would later be sold to fund the couple's extravagant lifestyle. In 1828 the Hall was sold to William Williams Hope, the family of Thomas Hope (1769–1831), a Dutch banker. After his death in 1854 the estate was sold to Clara Thornhill (later Clarke- Thornhill). Charles Dickens was a great friend of Clara and visited Rushton several times. The fictitious Haversham Hall in Great Expectations was conceived from the Hall. The Clarke-Thornhills owned the hall until 1934. After the death of William Clarke-Thornhill, the Hall was let to an array of tenants including American socialite James J. Van Alen who reinstated much Tudor and Jacobean architectural detail. It became a Grade I listed building in 1951. In 1957 it became a school for blind children run by the RNIB; the school moved to Coventry in 2002. The Hazelton family bought the hall in August 2003, and restored it to open as a 4 star hotel and spa. ==Estate== The estate has early 20th century formal terraced gardens designed by Thomas Mawson between 1905-1909. The rest of the estate has separate ownership to the hotel with features dating back to the 16th century and before. The 16th- century Triangular Lodge in the former parkland is owned by English Heritage and is open to the public. ==References * Rushton Hall Hotel, Conference and Wedding Venue, Spa and Restaurant * Parks and Gardens UK * BBC News item in 2002 about the sale of Rushton Hall Category:Country houses in Northamptonshire Category:Gardens in Northamptonshire Category:Gardens by Thomas Hayton Mawson Category:History of Northamptonshire Category:Grade I listed buildings in Northamptonshire Category:Grade I listed houses Category:Hotels in Northamptonshire Category:Country house hotels ","title":"Rushton Hall"},{"id":"35203468","text":"Belgium sent a delegation to compete at the 1976 Summer Paralympics in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Alexandre and Félix Fénéon were the first to use the term 'pointillism', in 1886, and Alexandre alone coined the term 'the Rouen School', in 1902 in a catalogue to an exhibition of the work of Joseph Delattre at the galerie Durand-Ruel à Paris. He also wrote several articles for Le Théâtre, notably 'Le Théâtre au Salon' in June 1898 and several theatre reviews. He was Inspecteur Général des Musées during the First World War. ==Works== * Honoré Daumier, l'homme et l'œuvre, H. Laurens, Paris, 1888 * Oeuvre d'Alphonse de Neuville, A. Lahure, 1889 * A. L.

Thoas 5; Parada, s.v. 8; Pausanias, 2.4.3. According to Corinthian tradition, Thoas and his descendants continued to rule Corinth until the coming of the Heraclids. According to the geographer Pausanias, Thoas remained in Corinth, succeeding his father as its ruler, while his brother Phocus led a colony to Tithorea. Thoas was the father of Damophon, Damophon of Propodas, and Propodas of Doridas and Hyanthidas. During the reign of the latter two, Corinth was seized by the Dorians under the command of Aletes, son of Hippotes. The brothers handed control of Corinth to him and were allowed to remain in the city, while the rest of the people were expelled.Pausanias, 2.4.3. ==Notes References == * Grimal, Pierre, The Dictionary of Classical Mythology, Wiley-Blackwell, 1996. . * Hard, Robin, The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology: Based on H.J.

In its strict technical sense, it refers to a domain or other property, in some cases including entire villages or towns, allocated for the support of individuals of the imperial family, noble houses or churches and monasteries. As the historian Paul Magdalino shows, these episkepseis were overwhelmingly situated in the coastlands around the Aegean Sea, which comprised the Empire's best arable land, or in fertile inland areas such as Thrace and Thessaly. In the 12th century, the term refers also to the fiscal divisions of the themes. As an institution, the episkepsis existed as early as the ninth century, with regards citing episketites - the position overseeing such territory - as a function of the oikeiakon, a sekreton created by Basil II. It is noted that an episkepsis is designated as an imperial holding throughout its existence in the Byzantine history. These holdings or estates were classified into three: imperial, personal, and ecclesiastical. Some of the examples of these territories include Macedonia, Miletos, and Alopekai. An episkepsis may be transformed into a kouratoria in the event of stability and expanded revenue. For instance, Seleukia was an episkepsis during the tenth century but later constituted the grand kouratoria of Tarsos. ==Sources== * * ==References== Category:Types of country subdivisions Category:Subdivisions of the Byzantine Empire ","title":"Episkepsis"},{"id":"35203543","text":"Sinoun Nuth (born 10 October 1985 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia) is Cambodian footballer who plays for home town club Visakha in Cambodian Second League.

Born on his father's 35th birthday after six years of unsuccessful pregnancies for his mother Countess Luise Henriette of Nassau. He was much hoped-for, looked like his father and was raised to be like him - spirited, quick-tempered and always in favour of war and the hunt (the most effective way of subduing him was always for his tutor to take away his sword for a few days). In 1670 he was made colonel of the Regiment Radziwiłł zu Fuß and four years later he and his father headed the Brandenburg force on its incursion into Alsace during the Franco-Dutch War. The campaign soon became mired into incessant manoeuvring, with the imperial commanded Bournonville afraid or unwilling to give battle. A cold wet autumn arrived, leading to supply and sanitary problems and disease in the Brandenburg army. Charles became ill late in November and at the start of December was sent to Strasbourg to recover.

His most renowned accomplishment includes founding of POSCO and growing it into one of the world's largest and most successful steel companies during his multi- decade tenure as Chairman and CEO. For this, he was often called the \\"Korean Andrew Carnegie\\". Earlier in his life, he served in the South Korean Army and led several platoons during the Korean War and eventually reaching the rank of Major General. He also founded POSTECH (leading research university in Korea), the Pohang Steelers soccer team, and the POSCO TJ Park Foundation. As a politician, he served for four months as Prime Minister of South Korea. His pen name was Chungam. == Biography ==  Early years  He was born on September 29, 1927 in Busan. When he was six years old, he moved to Japan where his father was working, and returned to Korea following the Korean emancipation from Japan.  Education  Whilst in Japan he entered the University of Waseda but returned to Korea without graduating. Following his return he studied at the Korea Military Academy and became a 6th Graduate, followed by a time of study at National Defense University Graduate School. He and other Korean military officers completed a bachelor's degree in a four- year standard university as required by the government. They had served in the army without completing a standard degree course after the liberation and it was the government's measure to build the Korea Military Academy (then called the South Korea Guard Academy) for officers to have a standard degree course (after 11th graduation). The government had noticed that they needed a commissioned education for officers to have bachelor's degree course in government level. The degree awarded from Dankook University is the only one which is acknowledged by Korea.  Military service  In 1948, Park graduated from the Korea Military Academy and was then commissioned as shavetail. He was awarded the Chungmu Order of Military Merit and the Hwarang order of military merit after participating in the Korean War. He did not take part in May 16 coup, but entrusted his family in case of failing Park Chung- hee. After the coup, he became a member of commerce[trade] and industry in Nation re-building supreme council and had a part in the first five-year Korea economic development plan. In 1963, Park was discharged as a Major General. He was awarded the Chungmu Order of Military Merit (1950, 1952), the Hwarang order of military merit (1951, 1953, 1954), the Order of Civil Merit, the Rose of Sharon Medal (1974), the order of the Legion of Honor(1990), the Norway order of military merit (1991). After his death, he was conferred posthumous honors of the Ching[Manchu] dynasty presented merit. He was granted an honorary engineering doctorate degree from Carnegie Mellon University, The University of Sheffield, Birmingham University, and The University of Waterloo. He was also granted an honorary doctorate in economics from M.V. in Russia. == Commercial life == After he transferred to the first reserve, he became the president of TaeguTec in 1964. One year later, the company turned around from deficit. To this day, TaeguTec is one of the only Korean companies that Warren Buffett has invested in. He became the president of Posco in April 1968. 10 years later, POSCO was a global company, and by 2010 was the world's third largest steelmaker. == Political activities == In 1980, Park entered the political world because of the possibility of being appointed as the first member of the Nation Preservation Legislation Council. He was elected to be the 11th member of the National Assembly under the Democratic Justice Party and he served as a director of the finance committee in the National Assembly. After three similar parties were merged, he became chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party. Park resigned as president of POSCO in October 1992. In the beginning of POSCO's establishment, Park used it to protect himself from political draft. He laid down the president position right after the establishment of a new government of discord with Kim Young-Sam and his government. He submitted a letter of resignation in October of 5th, 1992. Park's honorary president rejected the position of election task force from Kim Young-Sam's Democratic Liberal Party. On the same day, POSCO had an emergency board meeting to reverse his decision of resignation from POSCO.朴泰俊거취에 政·財界 술렁 Discord with Kim Young-Sam caused Park to resign from his position in the National Assembly. Park wandered from place to place abroad because he was suspected of taking about 3.9 billion from POSCO sub-venders. There was a widespread doubt that there was to be any targeted investigation of him. In 1997, he successfully came back and was elected as a member of the National Assembly in Buk-gu Pohang by blaming President Kim for the economic failure. He became the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, then supported Kim Dae Joong for the 15th presidency with Kim Jong Pil. He took office as the chairman in the government of Kim Dae Joong in 2000, but he resigned his spot because the government wrongfully accused him of property fraud.주간한국경제부총리, 당연직 총리대행(?) - 동아일보 The accusations were later found to be false by a Korean court. In his later years he participated in awarding the Chungam prize every year. == Awards and achievements ==  Awards  According to authorities of POSCO, “The National Commission give an award to Park Taejoon for contributing to national development.” The National commission also remade 6 out of his 7 medals (2 Chungmugong medals, 3 Hwarangmugong medals, Mugunghwa medal, Gumtap-industry medal) as a memorial to him. The National Commission placed 6 remade medals except for Gumtap-industry medal at the mortuary during his funeral.박태준 포스코 명예회장 별세(3보) He was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal by the Institute of Metals in 1987.  Achievements   Successful management of POSCO  According to Japan's Mitsubishi Research Institute, POSCO was able to succeed as a leader in promoting venture leadership and insight.

Relationship with Park Chung-hee  The relationship with Park Chung-hee(3rd President of South Korea) started from 1947 when they were in the military. Junghui Park, who was a company commander and also an instructor of ballistics, carefully observed Park Taejoon's behavior because he was good at mathematics and followed his own strict rules. He had become distant from Junghui Park since his graduation. Their relationship started again 10 years later when he had worked in the Headquarters of the Army as a colonel. At the same time, Junghui Park had been assigned as a commander of logistics support base asked Park Taejoon to assist him as the chief of staff. In spring of 1961, Junghui Park had prepared a military coup, which is well known as the 5.16 military coup, with some officers. Many commanders, including Jongpil Kim participated in the 5.16 military coup. Two months after the success of 5.16 military coup, Junghui Park assigned Park Taejoon as a chief secretary of chairman on nation reconstruction council. In September, Junghui Park assigned him as a chief member of commerce and industry division on nation reconstruction council. Park Taejoon had always accompanied Junghui Park on every business trip. In 1963, Taejoon Park and Junghui Park became civilians. Since Junghui Park had taken part in politics, many commanders who had followed him had also taken part in politics, except Taejoon Park who turned to be a businessman. At the end of this year, Taejoon Park was assigned CEO of the Korean Tungsten. He had changed the company from deficit to surplus. In 1967, Park Taejoon got special command to establish Pohang Iron & Steel Co. from president Junghui Park and was assigned as CEO of Pohang Iron & Steel Co. in 1978.李대통령, 故박태준 회장에 청조근정훈장 수여 After the Death of president Junghui Park, Park Taejoon volunteered to be the guardian of the son of president Park, Jiman Park.박근혜, 언제 입 열까…\\"MB같이 불통 문제 생길 수 있어\\" - 머니투데이 Park Taejoon supported him when he tried to take over Samyang Industries.\\"아버님·친구·간디 같은 분 인데…\\" 생전 고인 회고하며 눈물의 추도 - 서울경제'선덕여왕 덕만'의 '착한 동생' 박지만의 시련 - 오마이뉴스  Relationship with Seung-duk Koh  In 1984, Koh Seung- duk(고승덕) married Park Yooah(박유아) who is a second daughter of Park Tae-jun, Chairman of the once ruling Liberal Democrats(자민련), and previous CEO of POSCO.

A sense amplifier is part of the read circuitry that is used when data is read from the memory; its role is to sense the low power signals from a bitline that represents a data bit (1 or 0) stored in a memory cell, and amplify the small voltage swing to recognizable logic levels so the data can be interpreted properly by logic outside the memory.A Low-Power SRAM Using Bit-Line Charge- Recycling for Read and Write Operations , IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, 2010 IEEE Modern sense-amplifier circuits consist of two to six (usually four) transistors, while early sense amplifiers for core memory sometimes contained as many as 13 transistors.PDP-8 Maintenance Manual, Digital Equipment Corporation, F-87, 2/66, 1966; page 10-9 drawing RS-B-G007. There is one sense amplifier for each column of memory cells, so there are usually hundreds or thousands of identical sense amplifiers on a modern memory chip. As such, sense amplifiers are one of the only analog circuits in a computer's memory subsystem. == Basic structure == Figure 1(a) Sense amplifier is required during the data read and refresh operation from the memory concerned. {  + Classification ! Circuit Types !! Operation Mode -  Differential  Voltage-mode -  Nondifferential  Current-mode } == Memory chip operation == The data in a semiconductor memory chip is stored in tiny circuits called memory cells. Sense Amplifiers are primarily applied in Volatile memory cells. The memory cells are either SRAM or DRAM cells which are laid out in rows and columns on the chip. Each line is attached to each cell in the row. The lines which run along the rows are called wordlines which are activated by putting a voltage on it. The lines which run along the columns are called bit-line and two such complementary bitlines are attached to a sense amplifier at the edge of the array. Number of sense amplifiers are of that of the \\"bitline' on the chip. Each cell lies at the intersection of a particular wordline and bitline, which can be used to \\"address\\" it. The data in the cells is read or written by the same bit-lines which run along the top of the rows and columns.Characterization of SRAM sense amplifier input offset for yield prediction in 28nm CMOS , Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC), 2011 IEEE  SRAM operation  To read a bit from a particular memory cell, the wordline along the cell's row is turned on, activating all the cells in the row. The stored value (Logic 0 or 1) from the cell then comes to the Bit-lines associated with it. The sense amplifier at the end of the two complementary bit-lines amplify the small voltages to a normal logic level. The bit from the desired cell is then latched from the cell's sense amplifier into a buffer, and put on the output bus.Sense Amplifier for SRAM , Prof: Der- Chen Huang, National Chung Hsing University  DRAM operation  The sense amplifier operation in DRAM is quite similar to the SRAM, but it performs an additional function. The data in DRAM chips is stored as electric charge in tiny capacitors in the memory cells. The read operation depletes the charge in a cell, destroying the data, so after the data is read out the sense amplifier must immediately write it back in the cell by applying a voltage to it, recharging the capacitor. This is called memory refresh.  Design objectives  As part of their designs, sense amplifiers aim at a minimum sense delay, required level of amplification, minimum power consumption, fit into restricted layout areas, and high reliability and tolerance. == See also == * Differential amplifier * Shunts (electrical) == References  * Current Shunt Monitoring Products * Current Sensing Overview * High- speed sense amplifier for SRAM applications * Data caching in DRAM row buffers Category:Memory Category:Semiconductor technology ","title":"Sense amplifier"},{"id":"35203994","text":"Tango in D, Op. 165, No. 2, is a composition by Isaac Albéniz.

It was created by Andres & Marzo in 2004.Andrés, A Martín; Marzo, P. Femia (2004) \\"Delta: a new measure of agreement between two raters\\". British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, 57(1):1–19 ==Rationale for use== The most commonly used measure of agreement between observers is Cohen's kappa. The value of kappa is not always easy to interpret and it may perform poorly if the values are asymmetrically distributed. It also requires that the data be independent. The delta statistic may be of use when faced with the potential difficulties. ==Mathematical formulation== Delta was created with the model of a set of students (C) having to choose correct responses (R) from a set of n questions each with K alternative answers. Then : \\\\frac{K\\\\Sigma_{ii} - n }{n(K-1)} where the sum is taken over all the answers ( xij ) and xii are the values along the main diagonal of the C x R matrix of answers. This formula was extended to more complex cases and estimates of the variance of delta were made by Andres and Marzo. ==Uses== It has been used in a variety of applications including ecological mappingEllis EC, Wang H (2006) \\"Estimating area errors for fine-scale feature-based ecological mapping\\".

The fort has three different entrances at three different sides, which are western, the eastern and the southern sides.Itanagar Official website Archaeological finds from the site are on displayed at the Jawaharlal Nehru Museum, Itanagar. ==History== The Ita Fort is thought to be one of the early forts which the great Chutia king Ratnadhwajpal initially built all around his kingdom from Biswanath till Disang.Mignonette Momin, Society and Economy in North-East India,p. 48 The bricks used in the fort hint to later repairs in the 14th-15th century.

Das, in an article published in the Journal of Assam Research Society, claimed the fort to be the capital of Ramachandra/Mayamatta Mayapur.Maheswar Neog, Pavitra Assam, p. 57 But, from Assamese chronicles, we get to know that Ramachandra had his capital in Pratappura, due to which, he was also known as Pratappuriya. Pratappura has been identified to be located near Biswanath.[https://archive.org/details/JournalOfTheAsiaticSocietyOfBengalVolIv1835/page/n237/mode/1up?q=Jitari Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal, p.190-191, Pratappura, capital city of Ramachandra was located near Biswanath, in the vicinity of Agnigarh. The Pratapgarh ruins may have formed the eastern borders of the kingdom as evident from the Uma-tumani island(near Biswanath) stone inscription which mentions the ruler as Pratapuradhikari.The Uma-tumani Rock inscription has the word Pratapapuradhikari indicating Pratappura to be located nearby. Moreover, it is also known that Ramachandra/Pratapuriya's son Arimatta had his kingdom in present day Kamrup, Darrang and Sonitpur districts with capital at Baidargarh(Betna) and annexed the Kamata kingdom by killing the Kamateswar Phengua.Gait, Edward, A History of Assam, p.18 These facts prove that Ita fort had nothing to do with Arimatta line of kings. ==Gallery== File:Ita Fort 02.JPGA brick wall at the southern gate.

In his third appearance of the season, the last day of the season, he scored a hat-trick against Bologna in a match that finished 4–0 to Bari. With this feat, he became the first ever Bari player to score a hat-trick in an away game in Serie A for the club. Later during the summer, he was loaned out to Chievo on deadline day. After mostly spending the whole season playing with the Primavera under-19 team, Grandolfo made his first team debut on 22 May 2011, in a game against Bologna when he came on as a substitute. He made only one other appearance that season and so finished the season with two appearances and zero goals. As a consequence, Chievo decided not to retain him after his loan expired and so he returned to Bari, who were now in Serie B. In the first half of the 2012–13 Serie B season, Grandolfo made six appearances for Bari, but form evaded him and he was unable to score in any of those games. Due to lack of minutes at Bari, he went on loan to third division club Tritium where he made thirteen appearances and scored one goal, but once again, this spell proved largely unsuccessful. He once again returned to Bari at the completion of his loan spell at Tritium but was once again sent out on loan, this time to another third division side, Savona, for the entire 2013–14 season. At Savona his performance did not improve either, as he played only a total fourteen games with a spare goal, and was released for free by Bari at the end of the season. On 5 September 2014, it was announced Grandolfo had signed a contract with Serie D amateurs Correggese, with whom he had already training during the whole pre-season. On 12 July 2015, Grandolfo signed a 2-years contract with the Lega Pro side Fidelis Andria. In August 2016, Grandolfo signed for Serie C club Bassano. He successively joined newly-promoted Serie C club Virtus Verona for the 2018–19 season. On 10 July 2019 he signed a one-year contract with second-year extension option with Vis Pesaro.

Haggin, 69 Cal. 255; 10 P. 674; (1886), is a historic case in the conflict between riparian and appropriative water rights. Decided by a vote of four to three in the Supreme Court of California, the ruling held that appropriative rights were secondary to riparian rights. ==Background== The English common law system was adopted by California in 1850.Hanak, Ellen, et al(2011). \\"Managing California's Water: From Conflict to Reconciliation.\\" Public Policy Institute of California, San Francisco, 2011. Retrieved on 2012-4-15. (http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_211EHR.pdf)Freyfogle, Eric T. (1985-1986). \\"Lux v Haggin and the Common Law Burdens of Modern Water Law.\\" University of Colorado Literature Review volume=18 pages=485 With regards to water rights, English common law specifies that landowners have the right to the water that runs through or adjacent to their property for reasonable household purposes as long as their use does not interfere with the rights of other riparian land owners. These are known as riparian water rights. The English common law interpretation of reasonable household purposes meant domestic uses and small scale subsistence farming. Other landowners whose properties do not have water, have no right to use it . In 1855, California also adopted the right of prior appropriation. Appropriative rights were based on a first come, first served philosophy. This second system of water rights was developed for miners and farmers who did not own riparian land. The first to appropriate the water's use had rights to it. All those who subsequently established their claim, could only appropriate water if their use did not interfere with the previously established water use. Appropriative rights did not limit the amount of water that could be claimed. These two systems of water rights were at odds with one another. Appropriative water rights granted the first to claim the water's use complete rights to it. Riparian water rights established that use of the water was an uncontested right that came with the land and did not have to be shared with non-riparian land owners. The case of Lux v. Haggin clarified which system of water rights would prevail in California. ==Parties== Plaintiffs: Henry Miller and Charles Lux Charles Lux and Henry Miller were two German immigrants who met in San Francisco where both had established successful butcher shops.Igler, David (2001). Industrial Cowboys: Miller & Lux and the Transformation of the Far West, 1850-1920. Berkeley: University of California Press. () They became business partners and started raising cattle for their shops. In 1868, they began to purchase land in Kern County along Buena Vista Slough, a swampy area that was fed by the Kern River. Based on their land ownership, Miller and Lux claimed riparian rights to the natural flow of the river. Realizing that the Central Valley area was prone to drought, they developed an extensive canal system to irrigate their lands from the slough. By 1877 upstream water appropriation by the Kern County Land and Canal Company had dried out Buena Vista Slough completely. Close to 10,000 head of Miller and Lux's cattle perished that year as a result. Defendant: James Ben Ali Haggin Haggin was a wealthy socialite, lawyer, and business man who arrived in California during the gold rush. Among his business ventures was the Kern County Land and Canal Company, which was located along the Kern River and upstream from Miller and Lux's property. Haggin used appropriative water rights to divert water from the Kern River for agricultural irrigation of his large landholdings in Kern County. By 1877, Haggin had diverted so much water from the Kern River that it no longer flowed to Buena Vista Slough. ==History of the case== Lux v. Haggin (1881) Miller and Lux first filed suit against Haggin in 1879. The important issue in this case was determining what constitutes a watercourse. In order for Miller and Lux to be riparian landowners, they had to prove that the slough was in fact a watercourse. Their main argument was that the slough was an integral part of a major water system with a clearly defined waterway: water flowed down from the Sierras to Kern River, through Buena Vista Slough and into Lake Tulare. Haggin, on the other hand, argued that the slough was indistinguishable from swampland, and that the water present in the slough was merely overflow from Lake Tulare. On November 3, 1881 Judge Brundage ruled that \\"no continuous or defined channel\\" existed in Buena Vista swamp, and therefore Miller and Lux were not considered riparian land owners. Judge Brundage also included in his opinion that irrigation by means of appropriation was a \\"natural necessity\\" in the state of California. Lux v. Haggin (1884) In 1884, Miller and Lux appealed the 1881 ruling to the California Supreme Court. In this case, Miller and Lux addressed their property rights. They argued that Haggin's appropriations \\"carried the Kern River thirty miles from where nature had placed it, making a garden of what nature had made a desert and making a desert of their swampland.\\" In other words, Miller and Lux suggested a violation of their property rights; they had purchased land naturally containing water, and Haggin's upstream diversions had caused the water on their land to dry up. In response, the court agreed with Miller and Lux's appeal for riparian rights and overturned the lower court's ruling by a four to three decision. ==Issue== The overarching issue in Lux v. Haggin was whether the court would uphold English common law riparian rights (even though they were poorly suited to California's Mediterranean climate), institute the primacy of appropriative water rights, or create an entirely new system of water rights. A rehearing by the California Supreme Court in 1886 addressed the question: \\"Can a private corporation divert the waters of a watercourse, and thereby deprive the riparian proprieters of all use of the same, without just compensation?\\" ==Decision== The court upheld the validity and primacy of riparian rights by a vote of four to three. The majority opinion, by Justice McKinstry, was joined by Justices McKee, Sharpstein, and Thornton. Justices Ross, Morrison, and Myrick dissented. Justice McKinstry affirmed Miller and Lux's riparian rights along Buena Vista Slough, stating that \\"The owners of land by or through which a watercourse naturally and usually flows have a right of property in the waters of the stream.\\" Justice McKinstry also acknowledged public use of the water; appropriation by irrigation companies or irrigation districts, he conceded, was permitted with just compensation. ==Significance== Lux v. Haggin was a historic case in the development of water rights in California. During this time, the population was rapidly increasing and appropriation of water would soon become a necessity. The decision was important because it gave the court a chance to either continue to uphold English common law and riparian rights or give appropriative rights supremacy. In the end, the court recognized both water rights systems, but decided that appropriative rights were secondary to riparian rights. The ruling \\"created chaos by shackling the state with two fundamentally incompatible water allocation systems.\\" Additionally the original definition of \\"reasonable\\" water use under English common law was changed. The court decided that water could be used for commercial and agricultural purposes as long as the use did not negatively affect other riparian landowners. This broadening of the \\"reasonable\\" use definition meant that riparian land owners could now use more water than previously allowed. ==References== Category:1886 in United States case law Category:California state case law Category:Water in California Category:1886 in California Category:Kern River Category:History of Kern County, California Category:United States water case law ","title":"Lux v.

While the cotton textile mills were typical Fordian welfare units, with organized and well paid labour force housed in employee housing, the small scale industrial units were typically unorganized manufacturing. The textile mill housing was referred to as chawls, which are single room dwelling units laid in a row and provided with common water and sanitation facilities. East Ahmedabad is marked by such low income housing units. The workers of the unorganized manufacturing units begun to live in informal settlements, either developed as squatter settlements or informally subdivided private lands coming under various reservations of the city’s Development Plan (DP) or for acquisition under the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act (ULCRA),1976. Such settlements developed on a large scale in this segment of because of the demand from this industrial working class who typically desired a house close to their work place. Such informal and squatter settlements developed on a large scale in the 1980s and 1990s. Another significant phenomenon occurred during late 1980s and early 1990s; the cotton textile mills went into decline and closed down. But, their chawls remained and continued to house the former cotton textile mill workers. The parent unit, the textile mill having closed down and the residents of these chawls no longer being the employees of the mills, the mill owners were not interested in maintaining such dwellings. Since these chawls were under rent control legislation, the owners could not increase the rents. The owners therefore did not renovate the chawls where conditions deteriorated into slum type of housing. A few chawl owners offered the occupants to purchase their dwelling units so that the former could get rid of the burden and such transactions indeed took place in many chawls. In our field work we have come across several instances where a few dwelling unit occupants had not purchased the units when the majority had. In all, the land tenure arrangements became complex. In some cases where the owners stopped collecting the rents and the occupiers became the de facto owner. ==References== https://cept.ac.in/UserFiles/File/CUE/Working%20Papers/Revised%20New/12CUEWP12_Leaving%20Poor%20to%20Their%20Own%20Devices%20%E2%80%93%20Case%20of%20Amraiwadi%2C%20Ahmedabad.pdf Category:Neighbourhoods in Ahmedabad ","title":"Amraiwadi"},{"id":"35204215","text":"An indirect presidential election was held on 16 April 2012 to choose a new president of the World Bank Group to replace Robert Zoellick, whose term expired in June.

As of a rule change in 2010, voting shares now stand at United States of America (15.85%), Japan (6.84%), China (4.42%), Germany (4.00%), United Kingdom (3.75%), France (3.75%), India (2.91%), Russia (2.77%), Saudi Arabia (2.77%) and Italy (2.64%). Among countries with recently increased voting power are South Korea, Turkey, Mexico, Singapore, Greece, Brazil, India and Spain. By contrast, many developed countries lost vote share, as did a few developing countries, such as Nigeria. In 2011, a unanimous decision by the 187 members agreed to a \\"transparent, merit-based process.\\" Under a tacit agreement since the founding of the World Bank, a United States citizen has always led the organisation, while a European citizen has always led the \\"sister organisation,\\" the International Monetary Fund. The president is also the chairman of the World Bank's executive board. ==Electorate== The five nominated and 20 elected members of the executive board are the electors eligible to participate in the selection of the new president (this was the first presidential election with 25 voting members after one more member was added to the board on 1 November 2010). The last day for filing of nominations was 23 March, after which the executive board would conduct interviews with the candidates. The five largest shareholders of the World Bank – the United States, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, respectively – each appoint an executive director. China, Russia and Saudi Arabia also elect their own members. The rest of the executive board is elected by the other members operating within multi-country constituencies. At the time of the election the 25 members of the executive board and their constituents were: ==Candidates== The three official candidates were Korean-American Jim Yong Kim, the president of Dartmouth College; Nigerian Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Finance Minister of Nigeria; and Colombian Jose Antonio Ocampo, the director at the Economic and Political Development Concentration at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University. Other potential candidates included the self- declared Jeffrey Sachs, who criticised the institution for failing in its development efforts and said that someone who understands development and sustainability ought to be president. He was supported by the U.S. vice- president of the Institute for Economics and Peace, Michael Shank. The Huffington Post suggested that the U.S. administration gave serious consideration to nominating former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers for the position. According to Al Jazeera, over a dozen other possible nominees were considered by the United States, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the department's spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. ==Campaign== Before announcing Kim's candidature, the United States' Treasury Department said that \\"the United States continues its leadership role in the World Bank.\\" U.S. President Barack Obama said of Kim that \\"he's worked from Asia to Africa to the Americas – from capitals to small villages. The World Bank is one of the most powerful tools we have to reduce poverty and raise standards of living around the globe, and Kim’s personal experience and years of service make him an ideal candidate for this job.\\" His decision was read as a surprise, as Kim had a lower profile than the other potential candidates that had been discussed in advance, but was interpreted by the Associated Press as an attempt by Obama to fend off challenges by developing countries eager to end the U.S. control of the position. Kim also had early support from Canada and his native South Korea. Jeffrey Sachs withdrew his nomination, which was supported by a group of small countries, and backed Kim saying: \\"Dr Jim Kim is a superb nominee for the World Bank presidency. I support his nomination 100 percent. I congratulate the administration for nominating a world-class development leader for this position.\\" However, former World Bank economist and New York University professor William Easterly, worried about Kim's lack of experience in economics, said, \\"You have to have the mind-set to allocate scarce funds, rather than approaching the problem as if we have unlimited resources for suffering people. Frankly, I see some danger signs in this kind of pick.\\" Nigeria's Okonjo-Iweala said of her nomination that she was \\"absolutely [confident]. I have long experience in the World Bank, in government and in diplomacy and I look forward to giving you my vision at the appropriate time. I share the World Bank vision of fighting poverty with passion. The issue is in what direction one must take this to make this the most beneficial.\\" Her bid was supported by South Africa's Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan who said that \\"she has eminent academic qualifications and would be, I think, a candidate of choice not only on the African continent but well beyond as well.\\" She was formally nominated by South Africa, while the bid was supported by Angola which, with South Africa and Nigeria, lobbied other African states for support. Though Brazil said that both Okonjo-Iweala and Ocampo would be \\"great\\" candidates, it had not decided whom to support but would decide who the best voice of the emerging market economies was likely to be. Some indications suggested it supported Ocampo. Russia concurred in calling for a bigger role for emerging market countries in global financial institutions, while India said it would consult with the BRICS states. Mexico said that it was open to any option. An unofficial forum hosted by the Center for Global Development and The Washington Post was created and all three candidates were invited to give a speech and answer questions from Post editor Nancy Birdsall and the audience. Only Okonjo-Iweala and Ocampo responded and provided their views. Kim's failure to respond to the invitation was reported by William Easterly as being for \\"purely logistical reasons.\\" Nomination reactions Rogerio Studart, the Brazilian member of the executive board, said that developing countries would like to see a broad discussion about the World Bank's future in choosing a president. Former executive board member Domenico Lombardi said that Ocampo's and Okonjo-Iweala's credentials were a signal of a \\"big shift\\" in that it is reflective of a \\"game change\\" making this the first \\"truly contested election.\\" A former IMF official at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Arvind Subramanian, said Kim's nomination was \\"quite unusual\\" and doubted his credentials. He said of the process that \\"you will see more of a debate, an assessment of the merits of the different candidates and the direction of the bank. It is not a slam dunk. It is not an obvious choice.\\" Two associates of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Uri Dadush and Moises Naim, criticised the way the leaders of both the World Bank and the IMF have been selected through \\"opaque, quota-driven negotiations,\\" arguing that \\"no well-run global company selects its senior management this way.\\" Their colleague, Yukon Huang, suggested that Kim's nomination conveyed the message from the United States that Kim was a \\"man of the world\\" and added that the decision was based not on domestic political considerations but on Kim's professional qualifications. Meritocracy arguments Gordhan added that the nominations in this election had resulted in progress. \\"We have come some way because it's no longer in the smoke-filled rooms of Europe and the US that the spoils are shared between the IMF and World Bank positions, between those two centres of power. This time the invitation was open to anybody to nominate a candidate. [But] the question is whether the process subsequent to that...has followed through on basic democratic tenets.\\" Ocampo withdrew his candidacy on 13 April, citing a lack of support from his native Colombia and arguing that the process was political as opposed to merit-based. Before the election, Okonjo- Iweala also criticised the U.S. domination of the process since the World Bank's founding in 1944. ==Result== After Ocampo's withdrawal, and with support from Russia, Japan and many European countries, along with that of the United States, Canada and South Korea, Kim was announced as the winner on 16 April. China, India and Mexico were reportedly supportive of Kim's candidacy. A statement from the World Bank's directors read that the board had \\"deep appreciation\\" for Kim and that all the candidates \\"enriched the discussion of the role of the president and of the World Bank Group's future direction. The final nominees received support from different member countries, which reflected the high caliber of the candidates.\\" Kim, who was in Peru at the time, said that as president he would \\"seek a new alignment of the World Bank Group with a rapidly changing world. It was here in the shantytowns of Lima that I learned how injustice and indignity may conspire to destroy the lives and hopes of the poor. It was here that I saw how communities struggle to prosper because of a lack of infrastructure and basic services...And it was here that I learned that we can triumph over adversity by empowering the poor and focusing on results.\\" Okonjo-Iweala's reaction to the result included criticising the \\"long-standing and unfair tradition. It is clear to me that we need to make it more open, transparent and merit-based. We need to make sure that we do not contribute to a democratic deficit in global governance.\\" Reactions Obama congratulated Kim and said that he was \\"confident that Dr Kim will be an inclusive leader who will bring to the bank a passion for and deep knowledge of development, a commitment to sustained economic growth, and the ability to respond to complex challenges and seize new opportunities.\\" Despite controversy he also said that he was satisfied with the \\"open\\" and \\"transparent\\" selection process. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added that Kim \\"is an excellent selection to lead the World Bank forward, build consensus with donor and borrowing countries, and encourage the increasingly important leadership role of developing countries. We look forward to working with Dr Kim as he shapes an even stronger World Bank. Together, we will help develop economies, build partnerships, and alleviate poverty.\\" Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said of Kim that he would offer a new perspective as \\"his deep development background coupled with his dedication to forging consensus will help breathe new life into the World Bank's efforts to secure fast economic growth that is widely shared.\\" Richard Falk said the election signified a eurocentric prevalence and that the \\"geopolitical passivity of the BRICs is not encouraging.\\" He further noted: > UN System is largely frozen in time, and the world is deprived of a more > legitimate global problem-solving capability that is desperately needed at > this time. It is important to move toward the achievement of global > democracy for the sake of both global policymaking and the overall > legitimacy of world order. To move away from violent geopolitics, > acknowledging changes in the status of governments by reliance on soft power > criteria leadership of international institutions has never been more > useful. From this perspective the selection of Dr Kim, even if he lives up > to his considerable potential for a turn toward global empathy, is one more > lost opportunity. NGO reactions included that of Kim's former Health Global Access Project which called him a \\"transformative figure in global health\\" and cited his campaigning for increasing access to AIDS treatment in Africa which occurred \\"at a time when so-called experts in development – including the World Bank – argued that it was neither feasible nor cost-effective.\\" Oxfam's Elizabeth Stuart praised Kim but condemned the electoral process as a \\"sham\\": \\"Dr. Kim is an excellent choice for World Bank president and a true development hero. But we'll never know if he was the best candidate for the job, because there was no true and fair competition.\\" Peter Chowla of the Bretton Woods Project said the election was \\"a stitch-up between the US and Europe. This will further erode the Bank's legitimacy unless Kim starts listening closely to developing countries and critics of the World Bank, and begins a process of fundamental reform.\\" The Financial Times described the election as a \\"bitter contest\\" which exposed the World Bank's \\"failure to practise what it preaches.\\" It quoted the Secretary-General of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa Sindiso Ngwenya criticising the fact that the World Bank's selection process had not changed to \\"reflect evolving global realities. The World Bank has lost its moral authority with respect to the processes of fair governance and transparency. The bank prides itself on open competitive bidding, but this [election] was not based on merit but on those with the muscle.\\" ==References== World Bank President Category:World Bank Group ","title":"2012 World Bank Group presidential election"},{"id":"35204219","text":"Behrampura is an area located in Ahmedabad, India. http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_demolition-of-illegal-building-in- behrampura-in-ahmedabad-begins_1677598 ==References== Category:Neighbourhoods in Ahmedabad ","title":"Behrampura"},{"id":"35204221","text":"The Hong Kong women's sevens rugby union team represents Hong Kong at an international level and plays at the Hong Kong Women's Sevens and other international sevens tournaments. ==Current squad== Squad members based at the Hong Kong Sports Institute *Emmy CHAN Hoi Ping *Royce CHAN Leong Sze (C) *Christy CHENG Ka Chi (VC) *Candy CHENG Tsz Ting *CHONG Ka Yan *Stephanie CUVELIER *Adrienne GARVEY *Christine GORDON *Ivy KWONG Sau Yan *Dailo LAI Pou Fan *BB LEE Tsz Ting *Melody LI Nim Yan *NAM Ka Man *Natasha OLSON-THORNE *Aggie POON Pak Yan *Amelie SEURE *SHAM Wai Sum *Colleen TJOSVOLD *Lindsay VARTY *Cindy YUEN Lok Yee ==2014 Hong Kong 7s== Squad members for the Hong Kong Women's Sevens 2014 *Amelie SEURE *Royce CHAN Leong Sze (C) *Christine GORDON *Christy CHENG Ka Chi *Ivy KWONG Sau Yan *Candy CHENG Tsz Ting *Natasha OLSON-THORNE *Dailo LAI Pou Fan *Rose FONG *Lindsay VARTY *Cindy YUEN Lok Yee *Aggie POON Pak Yan Pool A {  - !

He graduated in 1972 from Ort Yad Singalovsky, and enlisted in the Israeli Air Force, and received an honourable discharge after three years of service, during the Yom Kippur war in 1973. In 1979 Shapira immigrated to the United States and commenced a career as an entrepreneur. ==Business career== Sha-Rub Investment Co. Shapira's first notable venture was Sha-Rub Investment Co., founded in 1981 with his cousin, Sheila C. Ruby. The company acquired distressed real properties, renovated and resold them in a rapidly appreciating market. Matrix Video Corporation In 1987 Shapira founded Matrix Video Corporation with Alon Carmel. Videocassette recorders were selling at the retail market and Shapira predicted an expanding demand for blank and pre-recorded video cassettes. The company soon became one of the largest manufacturers of blank and pre-recorded video cassettes in the West Coast and later executed an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Jdate.com Shapira's most notable venture, Jdate.com, was founded in 1996 with Alon Carmel (incorporated later as Matchnet PLC). Jdate rapidly expanded to dominate Jewish online dating outside of Israel.

Leveraging on this acquisition as well as creative large-scale marketing techniques, Matchnet expanded rapidly and reached a customer base of more than 20 million to position itself as a global leader in the online dating business. Shapira also led the expansion of Jdate into Israel and the later acquisition of its main Israeli competitor, Cupid.co.il. ==Fiix== This is a new venture he has founded recently which is a new Jewish dating app to complement the mobile lifestyle of the new generation.

Dr. Farone was hired at Philip morris to make safer products and to find business alternatives outside the tobacco industry. == Background == Farone has a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry (1965), an M.S. in Chemistry (1962) and was awarded his B.S. in Chemistry with honors in 1961. All of his degrees are from Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. Dr. Farone carried double majors during his undergraduate years and also has a strong background in business, mathematics, organic chemistry and engineering.Farone, William Anthony Resume of William Anthony Farone, estimated date 2002 Farone spent eight years as a top scientist at Philip Morris, and was tasked with creating a safer cigarette that would provide smokers with the desired pharmaceutical effects of nicotine but with less risk to health. Farone was later fired from the company. Farone has given government officials and trial lawyers valuable information on industry practices from the upper reaches of Philip Morris' internal company research.Schwartz J, The Washington Post Reengineering the Cigarette January 31, 1999. Page W08 ==Testimony== Farone claimed in his testimony in the Donald A. LaBelle case in July, 2000 that it is possible to make safer cigarettes, and that the means for doing so were known to the industry. He indicated that the only way to know if you've made a safer cigarette is to test it for biological toxicity, and failure to do so means that you haven't shown that it's safer. He contended that as early as 1936 it was possible to make cigarettes safer than those that were being marketed to the public at that time. He maintained that the industry deliberately manipulated the levels of nicotine by changing the ratios of nicotine and tar in their products. The witness noted that Philip Morris continually denied causation and addiction of nicotine, but that both of those concepts were accepted when he was working as a Philip Morris scientist. He argued that some of Philip Morris' statements about the relationship between smoking and disease were unethical.

Three songs were mixed in Sweden with Niklas Flyckt, whose previous work include Britney Spears’ song Toxic. The music video for the single They are Coming directed by Pete Riski won a Muuvi Award in 2009 by IFPI Finland, and director Antony Bentley received an honorary mention for the music video of Fast Lane at Oulu Music Video Festival in 2011. == Inspiration and recording == The title of the album refers to a UFO sighting Marko Nyberg witnessed near his home one night, but also the feeling of transference and escapism. The music was inspired by nature and recorded partly in a forest at Lake Bodom, an unsolved murder site in the early sixties in Finland. The band wandered in the fields in the night and during the day recorded the tracks with Reeta-Leena singing lying down on an old iron bed in a cottage of a hippie friend of theirs.

Filipecz de Prosznicz; 1431 - 28 June 1509) was an advisor of the kings Matthias Corvinus and Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary. From 1476 to 1490, he was bishop of Várad; from 1484 to 1490, he was also administrator of Olomouc. From 1480 to 1481, he was Landeshauptmann of Silesia. In 1492, he joined the Franciscan order. == Life == John Filipec was born in Prostějov and brought up in a humble utraquist family. After attending school in Prostějov, he became clerk of the Moravian governor in Olomouc. In this position, he met king Matthias Corvinus, when the latter took possession of Olomouc. Matthias recommended John as secretary to the Voivode of Transylvania. As a companion of the voivode, John then recommended the election of Matthias as king to the Estates of Bohemia. This was perhaps the reason why Matthias appointed John as his advisor and negotiator in 1472 and as Governor of Silesia in 1480.Ludwig Petry et al.: Geschichte Schlesiens, vol. 1, Sigmaringen, 1988, , p. 223 Filipec served as chief justice for a short time in 1486.  Bishop of Várad  Although John had not been ordained as a priest, Matthias Corvinus obtained a dispensation from Pope Sixtus IV, allowing him to appoint John as bishop of Várad in 1476. John was consecrated as bishop on 23 May 1477. After his appointment as bishop, John still worked for Matthias, who appointed him as Chancellor in 1478. Later that year, John tried to reconcile between Matthias and the Utraquist Estates. In 1380, he mediated in a conflict between King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and the Utraquist citizens of Prague. In 1481, Matthias appointed him governor of the Duchy of Jawor.  Administrator of Olomouc  Tombstone of John Filipec After the death of bishop Protasius of Olomouc in 1482, the cathedral chapter could not agree on the election of a successor. Normally King Matthias, as ruler of Moravia, would appoint the candidate proposed by the chapter. In the absence of a bishop, the diocese was administered by the canon (priest)s Johann Pauswangel, Alex von Iglau and Heinrich von Zwole. In 1484, the chapel elected, at the request of the King, John as a permanent administrator. As administrator, John introduced economic measures to counter the destruction brought about by the Hussite Wars. He improved the administration, and repaid the mortgages on several properties and the episcopal city of Mohelnice. He restored the Cathedral of Olomouc and other episcopal buildings and expanded the castles at Vyškov and Mírov. He promoted humanism in Moravia by founding a printing company in Brno, which published important humanistic works. John was accused of advocacy for the utraquist case and Pope Innocent VIII ordered an investigation by the papal nuncio in Buda. John was relieved of his duties as administrator of Olomouc and Bishop János Vitéz of Sirmium (a nephew of Archbishop János Vitéz of Esztergom) was appointed as the new administrator. However, János Vitéz never travelled to Olomouc to take possession of his new diocese. On 26 August 1488, John requested permission to resign as administrator and enter a monastery. The pope gave his permission on 3 June 1489 and appointed Ardicino della Porta as the new administrator. However, King Matthias rejected the request and Ardicino never went to Olomouc. King Matthias died and was succeeded by King Vladislaus II, who gave John on 21 September 1490 permission to resign, on the condition that he would continue to act as royal advisor and diplomat. In 1491, John founded a Franciscan monastery in Uherské Hradiště. In 1492, he founded another one in Jawor in Silesia. In the same year, he initiated the move of the Augustinian All Saints' monastery from Lanškroun to Olomouc.  Franciscan monk  In 1493, John brought his financial affairs in order and on 20 May 1492, he joined the Franciscan Order in Olomouc. He took his vows on 10 June in Wrocław. From 1492 to 1500, he lived in the monastery of Jawor. He then moved to Olomouc and finally to Uherské Hradiště. Even as a monk, he acted as a royal advisor until his death. In 1494, he took part in the negotiations with the utraquists in Prague about the reinstatement of the Catholic church. In 1508, he negotiated the resolution of a conflict between the Bohemian estates. He died in Uherské Hradiště. == References == * Winfried Eberhard, in: Erwin Gatz: Die Bischöfe des Heiligen Römischen Reiches 1448–1648, , p. 182–183 * Rudolf Grieger: Filipecz, Johann Bischof von Wardein: Diplomat der Könige Matthias und Wladislaw, Studia Hungarica, vol. 20, Munich, 1982 == Footnotes == Category:15th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Bishops of Olomouc Category:Chief Justices of Hungary Category:Hungarian Franciscans Category:1431 births Category:1509 deaths Category:15th-century Bohemian people Category:15th-century Hungarian people Category:Hungarian people of Czech descent ","title":"John Filipec"},{"id":"35204877","text":"Pablo de Greiff is a Colombian human rights activist, currently serving as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence. ==Early life and education== Born in Bogotá on 20 June 1963, de Greiff graduated from Yale University in 1986, and completed his PhD at Northwestern University in 1992. ==Career== De Greiff was assistant professor of philosophy in the State University of New York from 1992 to 2002, and associate professor there in 2000–2003.

Spencer, is a map associated to a deformation of a scheme or complex manifold X, taking a tangent space of a point of the deformation space to the first cohomology group of the sheaf of vector fields on X. == Definition ==  Historical motivation  The Kodaira–Spencer map was originally constructed in the setting of complex manifolds. Given a complex analytic manifold M with charts U_i and biholomorphic maps f_{jk} sending z_k \\\\to z_j = (z_j^1,\\\\ldots, z_j^n) gluing the charts together, the idea of deformation theory is to replace these transition maps f_{jk}(z_k) by parametrized transition maps f_{jk}(z_k, t_1,\\\\ldots, t_k) over some base B (which could be a real manifold) with coordinates t_1,\\\\ldots, t_k, such that f_{jk}(z_k, 0,\\\\ldots, 0) = f_{jk}(z_k). This means the parameters t_i deform the complex structure of the original complex manifold M. Then, these functions must also satisfy a cocycle condition, which gives a 1-cocycle on M with values in its tangent bundle. Since the base can be assumed to be a polydisk, this process gives a map between the tangent space of the base to H^1(M, T_M) called the Kodaira–Spencer map.  Original definition  More formally, the Kodaira–Spencer map is :KS: T_0 B \\\\to H^1(M, T_M) where *\\\\mathcal{M} \\\\to B is a smooth proper map between complex spacesThe main difference between a complex manifold and a complex space is that the latter is allowed to have a nilpotent. (i.e., a deformation of the special fiber M = \\\\mathcal{M}_0.) *\\\\delta is the connecting homomorphism obtained by taking a long exact cohomology sequence of the surjection T \\\\mathcal{M}_M \\\\to T_0 B \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{O}_M whose kernel is the tangent bundle T_M. If v is in T_0B, then its image KS(v) is called the Kodaira–Spencer class of v.  Remarks  Because deformation theory has been extended to multiple other contexts, such as deformations in scheme theory, or ringed topoi, there are constructions of the Kodaira–Spencer map for these contexts. In the scheme theory over a base field k of characteristic 0, there is a natural bijection between isomorphisms classes of \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to S = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(k[t]/t^2) and H^1(X, TX). == Constructions ==  Using infinitesimals   Cocycle condition for deformations  Over characteristic 0 the construction of the Kodaira–Spencer map can be done using an infinitesimal interpretation of the cocycle condition. If we have a complex manifold X covered by finitely many charts \\\\mathcal{U} = \\\\\\\\{U_\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\}_{\\\\alpha \\\\in I} with coordinates z_\\\\alpha = (z_\\\\alpha^1, \\\\ldots, z_\\\\alpha^n) and transition functions > f_{\\\\beta\\\\alpha}:U_\\\\beta_{U_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}} \\\\to U_\\\\alpha_{U_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}} > where f_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(z_\\\\beta) = z_\\\\alpha Recall that a deformation is given by a commutative diagram > \\\\begin{matrix} X & \\\\to & \\\\mathfrak{X} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\downarrow & & \\\\downarrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ > \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{C}) & \\\\to & \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{C}[\\\\varepsilon]) > \\\\end{matrix} where \\\\mathbb{C}[\\\\varepsilon] is the ring of dual numbers and the vertical maps are flat, the deformation has the cohomological interpretation as cocycles \\\\tilde{f}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(z_\\\\beta,\\\\varepsilon) on U_\\\\alpha\\\\times \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{C}[\\\\varepsilon]) where > z_\\\\alpha = \\\\tilde{f}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(z_\\\\beta,\\\\varepsilon) = > f_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(z_\\\\beta) + \\\\varepsilon b_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(z_\\\\beta) If the \\\\tilde{f}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} satisfy the cocycle condition, then they glue to the deformation \\\\mathfrak{X}. This can be read as > \\\\begin{align} \\\\tilde{f}_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma,\\\\varepsilon) = & > \\\\tilde{f}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(\\\\tilde{f}_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma,\\\\varepsilon),\\\\varepsilon) > \\\\\\\\\\\\ = & f_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(f_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma) + \\\\varepsilon > b_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\+ \\\\varepsilon > b_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(f_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma) + \\\\varepsilon > b_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma)) \\\\end{align} Using the properties of the dual numbers, namely g(a + b\\\\varepsilon) = g(a) + \\\\varepsilon g'(a)b, we have > \\\\begin{align} f_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(f_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma) + \\\\varepsilon > b_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma)) = & f_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(f_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma)) + > \\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}}{\\\\partial > z_\\\\alpha}(z_\\\\alpha)b_{\\\\beta_\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} and > \\\\begin{align} \\\\varepsilon b_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(f_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma) + > \\\\varepsilon b_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma)) = & \\\\varepsilon > b_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(f_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma)) + \\\\varepsilon^2\\\\frac{\\\\partial > b_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}}{\\\\partial z_\\\\alpha}(z_\\\\alpha)b_{\\\\beta_\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma) \\\\\\\\\\\\ > = & \\\\varepsilon b_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(f_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}(z_\\\\gamma)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ = & > \\\\varepsilon b_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(z_\\\\beta) \\\\end{align} hence the cocycle condition on U_\\\\alpha\\\\times \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{C}[\\\\varepsilon]) is the following two rules # b_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}}{\\\\partial z_\\\\beta}b_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma} + b_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} # f_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma} = f_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\circ f_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}  Conversion to cocycles of vector fields  The cocycle of the deformation can easily be converted to a cocycle of vector fields \\\\theta = \\\\\\\\{\\\\theta_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\\\\\} \\\\in C^1(\\\\mathcal{U},T_X) as follows: given the cocycle \\\\tilde{f}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = f_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} + \\\\varepsilon b_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} we can form the vector field > \\\\theta_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n > b_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}^i\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_\\\\alpha^i} which is a 1-cochain. Then the rule for the transition maps of b_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma} gives this 1-cochain as a 1-cocycle, hence a class [\\\\theta] \\\\in H^1(X,T_X).  Using vector fields  One of the original constructions of this map used vector fields in the settings of differential geometry and complex analysis. Given the notation above, the transition from a deformation to the cocycle condition is transparent over a small base of dimension one, so there is only one parameter t. Then, the cocycle condition can be read as > f^{\\\\alpha}_{ik}(z_k,t) = f_{ij}^{\\\\alpha}(f^1_{kj}(z_k,t), \\\\ldots, > f^n_{kj}(z_k,t),t) Then, the derivative of f^{\\\\alpha}_{ik}(z_k,t) with respect to t can be calculated from the previous equation as > \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{\\\\alpha}_{ik}(z_k,t)}{\\\\partial t} &= > \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{\\\\alpha}_{ij}(z_j,t)}{\\\\partial t} \\\\+ \\\\sum^n_{\\\\beta = 0} > \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{\\\\alpha}_{ij}(z_j,t)}{\\\\partial f_{jk}^\\\\beta(z_k,t)}\\\\cdot > \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{\\\\beta}_{jk}(z_k,t)}{\\\\partial t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Note because z_j^\\\\beta = f_{jk}^\\\\beta(z_k,t) and z_i^\\\\alpha = f_{ij}^{\\\\alpha}(z_j,t), then the derivative reads as > \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{\\\\alpha}_{ik}(z_k,t)}{\\\\partial t} &= > \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{\\\\alpha}_{ij}(z_j,t)}{\\\\partial t} \\\\+ \\\\sum^n_{\\\\beta = 0} > \\\\frac{\\\\partial z^{\\\\alpha}_i}{\\\\partial z_j^\\\\beta}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial > f^{\\\\beta}_{jk}(z_k,t)}{\\\\partial t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} If we use write a holomorphic vector field, having these partial derivatives as the coefficients, then because > \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_j^\\\\beta} = \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha = 1}^n \\\\frac{ \\\\partial > z_i^\\\\alpha }{ \\\\partial z_j^\\\\beta }\\\\cdot \\\\frac{ \\\\partial }{ \\\\partial > z_i^\\\\alpha } we get the following equation of vector fields > \\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=0}^n \\\\frac{\\\\partial > f^{\\\\alpha}_{ik}(z_k,t)}{\\\\partial t} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_i^\\\\alpha} =& > \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=0}^n \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{\\\\alpha}_{ij}(z_j,t)}{\\\\partial t} > \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_i^\\\\alpha} \\\\\\\\\\\\& \\\\+ \\\\sum^n_{\\\\beta = 0} > \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{\\\\beta}_{jk}(z_k,t)}{\\\\partial t} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial > z_j^\\\\beta} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Rewriting this as the vector fields > \\\\theta_{ik}(t) = \\\\theta_{ij}(t) + \\\\theta_{jk}(t) where > \\\\theta_{ij}(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{\\\\alpha}_{ij}(z_j,t)}{\\\\partial t} > \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_i^\\\\alpha} gives the cocycle condition. Hence this has associated a class in H^1(M,T_M) from a deformation.  In scheme theory  Deformations of a smooth variety > \\\\begin{matrix} X & \\\\to & \\\\mathfrak{X} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\downarrow & & \\\\downarrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ > \\\\text{Spec}(k) & \\\\to & \\\\text{Spec}(k[\\\\varepsilon]) \\\\end{matrix} have a Kodaira-Spencer class constructed cohomologically. Associated to this deformation is the short exact sequence > 0 \\\\to \\\\pi^*\\\\Omega^1_{\\\\text{Spec}(k[\\\\varepsilon])} \\\\to > \\\\Omega_{\\\\mathfrak{X}}^1 \\\\to \\\\Omega_{\\\\mathfrak{X}/S}^1 \\\\to 0 (where \\\\pi:\\\\mathfrak{X} \\\\to \\\\text{Spec}(k[\\\\varepsilon])) which when tensored by the \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathfrak{X}}-module \\\\mathcal{O}_X gives the short exact sequence > 0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_X \\\\to \\\\Omega^1_{\\\\mathfrak{X}}\\\\otimes\\\\mathcal{O}_X \\\\to > \\\\Omega_X^1 \\\\to 0 Using derived categories, this defines an element in > \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\text{Hom}(\\\\Omega_X^1,\\\\mathcal{O}_X[+1]) &\\\\cong > \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\text{Hom}(\\\\mathcal{O}_X,T_X[+1]) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\cong > \\\\text{Ext}^1(\\\\mathcal{O}_X,T_X) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\cong H^1(X,T_X) \\\\end{align} generalizing the Kodaira–Spencer map. Notice this could be generalized to any smooth map f:X \\\\to Y in \\\\text{Sch}/S using the cotangent sequence, giving an element in H^1(X,T_{X/Y}\\\\otimes f^*(\\\\Omega^1_{Y/Z})).  Of ringed topoi  One of the most abstract constructions of the Kodaira–Spencer maps comes from the cotangent complexes associated to a composition of maps of ringed topoi > X \\\\xrightarrow{f} Y \\\\to Z Then, associated to this composition is a distinguished triangle > f^*\\\\mathbf{L}_{Y/Z} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{L}_{X/Z} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{L}_{X/Y} > \\\\xrightarrow{[+1]} and this boundary map forms the Kodaira–Spencer map (or cohomology class, denoted K(X/Y/Z)). If the two maps in the composition are smooth maps of schemes, then this class coincides with the class in H^1(X,T_{X/Y}\\\\otimes f^*(\\\\Omega^1_{Y/Z})). == Examples ==  With analytic germs  The Kodaira–Spencer map when considering analytic germs is easily computable using the tangent cohomology in deformation theory and its versal deformations. For example, given the germ of a polynomial f(z_1,\\\\ldots, z_n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\\\\\{z_1,\\\\ldots, z_n \\\\\\\\} = H, its space of deformations can be given by the module > T^1 = \\\\frac{H}{df \\\\cdot H^n} For example, if f = y^2 - x^3 then its veral deformations is given by > T^1 = \\\\frac{ \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\\\\\{ x,y \\\\\\\\} }{(y, x^2)} hence an arbitrary deformation is given by F(x,y,a_1,a_2) = y^2 - x^3 +a_1 + a_2x. Then for a vector v \\\\in T_0(\\\\mathbb{C}^2), which has the basis > \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial a_1}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial a_2} there the map KS: v \\\\mapsto v(F) sending > \\\\begin{align} \\\\phi_1\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial a_1} + \\\\phi_2 > \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial a_2} \\\\mapsto & \\\\phi_1\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial > a_1} + \\\\phi_2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial a_2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\phi_1 + \\\\phi_2\\\\cdot x > \\\\end{align}  On affine hypersurfaces with the cotangent complex  For an affine hypersurface i:X_0 \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathbb{A}^n \\\\to \\\\text{Spec}(k) over a field k defined by a polynomial f, there is the associated fundamental triangle > i^*\\\\mathbf{L}_{\\\\mathbb{A}^n/\\\\text{Spec}(k)} \\\\to > \\\\mathbf{L}_{X_0/\\\\text{Spec}(k)} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{L}_{X_0/\\\\mathbb{A}^n} > \\\\xrightarrow{[+1]} Then, applying \\\\mathbf{RHom}(-,\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}) gives the long exact sequence > \\\\begin{align} > &\\\\textbf{RHom}(i^*\\\\mathbf{L}_{\\\\mathbb{A}^n/\\\\text{Spec}(k)},\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}[+1]) > \\\\leftarrow > \\\\textbf{RHom}(\\\\mathbf{L}_{X_0/\\\\text{Spec}(k)},\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}[+1]) > \\\\leftarrow > \\\\textbf{RHom}(\\\\mathbf{L}_{X_0/\\\\mathbb{A}^n},\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}[+1]) \\\\\\\\\\\\ > \\\\leftarrow > &\\\\textbf{RHom}(i^*\\\\mathbf{L}_{\\\\mathbb{A}^n/\\\\text{Spec}(k)},\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}) > \\\\leftarrow \\\\textbf{RHom}(\\\\mathbf{L}_{X_0/\\\\text{Spec}(k)},\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}) > \\\\leftarrow \\\\textbf{RHom}(\\\\mathbf{L}_{X_0/\\\\mathbb{A}^n},\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}) > \\\\end{align} Recall that there is the isomorphism > \\\\textbf{RHom}(\\\\mathbf{L}_{X_0/\\\\text{Spec}(k)},\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}[+1]) \\\\cong > \\\\text{Ext}^1(\\\\mathbf{L}_{X_0/\\\\text{Spec}(k)}, \\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}) from general theory of derived categories, and the ext group classifies the first-order deformations. Then, through a series of reductions, this group can be computed. First, since \\\\mathbf{L}_{\\\\mathbb{A}^n/\\\\text{Spec}(k)} \\\\cong \\\\Omega^1_{\\\\mathbb{A}^n/\\\\text{Spec}(k)}is a free module, \\\\textbf{RHom}(i^*\\\\mathbf{L}_{\\\\mathbb{A}^n/\\\\text{Spec}(k)},\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}[+1]) = 0. Also, because \\\\mathbf{L}_{X_0/\\\\mathbb{A}^n} \\\\cong \\\\mathcal{I}/\\\\mathcal{I}^2[+1] , there are isomorphisms > \\\\begin{align} > \\\\textbf{RHom}(\\\\mathbf{L}_{X_0/\\\\mathbb{A}^n},\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}[+1]) \\\\cong & > \\\\textbf{RHom}(\\\\mathcal{I}/\\\\mathcal{I}^2[+1],\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}[+1]) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cong > & \\\\textbf{RHom}(\\\\mathcal{I}/\\\\mathcal{I}^2,\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cong & > \\\\text{Ext}^0(\\\\mathcal{I}/\\\\mathcal{I}^2,\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cong & > \\\\text{Hom}(\\\\mathcal{I}/\\\\mathcal{I}^2,\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cong & > \\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0} \\\\end{align} The last isomorphism comes from the isomorphism \\\\mathcal{I}/\\\\mathcal{I}^2 \\\\cong \\\\mathcal{I} \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{A}^n}} \\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0} , and a morphism in > \\\\text{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}}(\\\\mathcal{I} > \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{A}^n}} \\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0} ,\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}) > send [gf] \\\\mapsto g'g + (f) giving the desired isomorphism. From the cotangent sequence > \\\\frac{(f)}{(f)^2} \\\\xrightarrow{[g] \\\\mapsto dg\\\\otimes 1} > \\\\Omega^1_{\\\\mathbb{A}^n}\\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0} \\\\to > \\\\Omega^1_{X_0/\\\\text{Spec}(k)} \\\\to 0 (which is a truncated version of the fundamental triangle) the connecting map of the long exact sequence is the dual of [g] \\\\mapsto dg \\\\otimes 1 , giving the isomorphism > \\\\text{Ext}^1(\\\\mathbf{L}_{X_0/k}, \\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}) \\\\cong > \\\\frac{k[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n]}{ \\\\left(f, \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_1}, \\\\ldots, > \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_n} \\\\right) } Note this computation can be done by using the cotangent sequence and computing \\\\text{Ext}^1(\\\\Omega^1_{X_0},\\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}). Then, the Kodaira–Spencer map sends a deformation > \\\\frac{k[\\\\varepsilon][x_1,\\\\ldots, x_n]}{ f + \\\\varepsilon g } to the element g \\\\in \\\\text{Ext}^1(\\\\mathbf{L}_{X_0/k}, \\\\mathcal{O}_{X_0}) . == See also == *Deformation theory *Cotangent complex *Schlessinger's theorem *characteristic linear system of an algebraic family of curves *Gauss-Manin connection *Derived category *Ext functor == References == * * *Mathoverflow post relating deformations to the jacobian ring.

In March 2012, Denmark took part in the World Twenty20 Qualifier in the United Arab Emirates, having qualified for the event by winning the European T20 Championship. Ahmed was selected in Denmark's fourteen man squad for the qualifier, making his Twenty20 debut against Bermuda at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium. He made four further appearances during the competition, the last of which came against Hong Kong, scoring a total of 38 runs at an average of 7.60, with a high score of 11. In August 2012, he was selected in Denmark's fourteen-man squad for the World Cricket League Division Four in Malaysia. In December 2012, he had a serious ACL injury in the left knee during practice, and was ruled out of the 2013 season.

Chidambaram Pillai has devoted himself to the cause of India's freedom from the British Raj. Chidambaram, appearing for the peasant Madasami, wins a case filed by an agent of a British proprietor. Chidambaram's father, who appeared for the agent, sends his son to Thoothukudi lest the British proprietor should give him any trouble. Madasami who accompanies Chidambaram, looks after the latter's salt- pan. At Thoothukudi, Chidambaram meets Subramaniya Siva, a freedom fighter and works for the Swadeshi movement. Chidambaram receives a complaint from some of the local merchants that the British Shipping Company had refused to load their goods. Against great odds, Chidambaram starts the National Shipping Company with Indian Capital to free Indian trade from dependence on foreign liners. The company prospers despite attempts by the British Company to sabotage the ship of the Indian firm. Chidambaram incurs the displeasure of the Government by organising a strike for getting the grievances of the local coral mill workers redressed and by organising public celebrations to mark the release of Bipin Chandra Pal in contravention of a prohibitory order. Chidambaram, along with Subramaniya Sivam, is invited to Tirunelveli by the District Collector, Winch. The collector directs them not to engage in political activity and also orders them out of the District. They defy the orders and are arrested. In the trial which ensues, Chidambaram is sentenced to 20 years life imprisonment and Sivam to 10 years. Chidambaram's sentence is reduced to six years on appeal. The imprisonment of these two leaders sparks off mass unrest which is put down ruthlessly. Some time later, the new District Collector Ashe is shot dead by a patriotic Vanchinathan, who commits suicide before the police can reach him. The news of the unrelenting struggle outside gives much consolation to Chidambaram and Sivam who are treated barbarously in the prison. Chidambaram emerges from the prison a broken man only to witness a series of disappointments – Chidambaram's brother has become insane, Sivam is a victim of leprosy contracted during his term in prison, people have forgotten him and his role in the Indian independence movement, the National Shipping Company is bought by its British rival and leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Subramania Bharati die one after another. Chidambaram devotes the last years of his life to the study of literature and dies still dreaming of the day when India would be free. == Cast == ;Male cast * Sivaji Ganesan as V. O.

O. Chidambaram Pillai, who founded the Swadeshi Stream Navigation Company to break the monopoly of the British over maritime trade out of India. During a time when the DMK was gaining political ground in Tamil Nadu, a time when there was competition between parties, and films were pitched against each other, the opposition unleashed a malicious propaganda that since Chidambaram belonged to the Indian National Congress, Kappalottiya Thamizhan was a film for the Congress. The film was not targeted for the masses, who at that time did not want to be \\"stirred\\" by the Nationalist Spirit. Sivaji Ganesan was hesitant to do the role of Chidambaram as he doubted whether he could perform the role flawlessly, but later accepted and studied various material to understand Chidambaram. S. V. Subbaiah was cast as the poet Subramania Bharati, taking inspiration from his role as Kavi Anandar from the play Kaviyin Kanavu (1945). V. Nagaiah who was then in \\"dire straits\\", was signed up for a significant role, that of Ulaganathan Pillai, as director B. R. Panthulu wanted to give him a \\"break in films\\". According to film historian S. Theodore Baskaran, there is no evidence of any research undertaken for making the film. He stated that the film had no props, apart from the character's costumes and the female character's ear-lobes, which were done to create a \\"period effect\\". The film was partly coloured using Gevacolor, and the colour sequences were processed at the Film Centre, Mumbai. == Soundtrack == The soundtrack of the film was composed by G. Ramanathan. All the songs are based on poems, written by Subramania Bharati. {  style=\\"font-size:100%;\\" ! No. !! Song !! Singers !! Lyrics !! Length -  1  \\"Chinnakkuzhandaigal\\"  P.

Viswanathan of The Frontline praised his performance, saying \\"Critics list several films as his best in terms of performance. However, according to the actor, his career best was Kappalottiya Thamizhan.\\" Tamil film historian S. Theodore Baskaran said, \\"Though Sivaji Ganesan's portrayal of Chidambaram Pillai is affected in the earlier part of the film, later in the prison sequences and during the trauma of disillusionment, his acting is natural.\\" On Ganesan's performance, Chidambaram's son Subramaniam said it was like seeing his father alive on the screen, a statement Ganesan considered his \\"highest award\\".  Box office  Kappalottiya Thamizhan was released on 7 November 1961, and failed commercially, losing 7,00,000. Tax exemption was offered during its re-release in 1967, making it the first Tamil film to get tax exemption from the government of India. About the film's failure, Ganesan felt that since the Congress did not understand artistic sensitivities, Kappalottiya Tamizhan, which was a film made for the Congress, was a box office failure. He also stated that he was not upset for losing money making the film to kindle the national spirit, but rather happy that he could harness the medium to remind people of the Indian freedom fighters of the bygone era.

In 2002, Antar had directed a documentary film devoted to his mentor, the photographer Jean-Luc Moulène. In 2000, he acquired a 1948 Kodak Reflex and 10 rolls of black-and-white film that had expired in 1976. He began using this outdated material, producing a blurred and almost abstract effect on his photographs.

However, the forms shapeshift wildly without relaxing into anything resembling a conventional storyform: synopsized movie scripts leeched of film language so it's easier to read, flash fiction, or even creative non-fiction that resembles a confessional essay.

Khavn is generally better known as an experimental digital filmmaker, and this aesthetic: the manufactured reality, the editing techniques, the self-referentiality, the pungent prose, the grimy imagery — even down to how Khavn cuts his lines — is found in Ultraviolins. \\"Amerika\\" is an angry and self-conscious contemplation of the meaning of Amerika, initially reminiscent of Allen Ginsberg's long-form piece of basically the same name, although Ginsberg's anger is met with sarcasm in Khavn's story. \\"Dedbol\\" is a series of disjointed dagli about random people — a serial killer, some kidnappers, a four-piece band, and girls on a shower party — converging for a split second in the Divine Intersection before splitting up again to conclude their narratives, borrowing Guillermo Arriaga’s narrative conceit from the seminal McOndo movie Amores perros, only lacking the social and political implications of the original. \\"Ang Ipis Sa Loob ng Basurahan\\" is a post-Kafka humanized depiction of a cockroach stuck inside a trash can deciding to build a home for itself in the interim before its expected escape and sudden death by way of slipper-squashing. ==Reviews and analysis== F.

However, critic Alexis Tioseco praised the film as a highly political \\"dystopian view of the modern Filipino family.

Eva’s grandson would later claim her body. ==Biography and crime== Born in Salisbury, Missouri, in 1878, Dugan resided in Juneau, Territory of Alaska, after trekking north during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896–1899 and became a cabaret singer. She subsequently moved to Pima County, Arizona, where she worked for an elderly chicken rancher, Andrew J. Mathis, as a housekeeper. Shortly after her employment was terminated for unknown reasons, Mathis disappeared, as did some of his possessions, his Dodge coupe automobile and his cash box. Neighbors reported that Dugan had tried to sell some of his possessions before she disappeared as well. The trial of Eva Dugan was held in the Second Pinal County Courthouse located in 135 Pinal St. in Florence. The police discovered Dugan had a father in California and a daughter in White Plains, New York. She had been married five times, and all her husbands had disappeared. She sold the Dodge coupe for $600 in Kansas City, Missouri. She was arrested in White Plains when a postal clerk, alerted by the police, intercepted a postcard to her from her father in California. She was extradited back to Arizona to face auto theft charges. Convicted of auto theft, she was imprisoned. Nine months later, a camper found Mathis' decomposed remains on his ranch. Dugan was then tried for murder in a short trial based mostly on circumstantial evidence. During her testimony, Dugan said that Mathis believed that she had poisoned his breakfast food, though she claimed that he ate rotten meat in the form of a rabbit that had boils on it.362, State of Arizona vs Eva Dugan #A4500, February 20 1928, Box 2, Pima County, Superior Court, Criminal RG 110 SG 08 S3, History and Archives Division, Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records. Dugan also admitted she had sex with Mathis on a weekly basis and performed prostitution at the ranch.358-359, 392, State of Arizona vs Eva Dugan #A4500. According to her, if Mathis \\"saw any of the men on the street [in Tucson] that he thought was all right he would call them off and tell them to come on out to the house.\\"360, State of Arizona vs Eva Dugan #A4500. She would perform sex acts for three dollars and give Mathis fifty cents from each transaction. Dugan claimed that \\"Jack,\\" a teenage boy who had come to the ranch for work, accidentally killed Mathis with a retaliatory punch after Mathis beat him for refusing to milk a cow.377, State of Arizona vs Eva Dugan #A4500. According to her, Jack came to the house to tell her what he had done and she and Jack both attempted to revive Mathis with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation after removing his false teeth. When that failed to revive him, they loaded the body into the coupe and Jack drove it out alone to dump it, coming back at five o'clock in the morning. The prosecution proved to the jury's satisfaction that Dugan had murdered Mathis with an axe. After her conviction, in her final statement, she told the jurors, “Well, I’ll die with my boots on, an’ in full health. An’ that’s more’n most of you old coots’ll be able to boast on.” She would remain defiant to the end. ==Imprisonment and execution== The noose used to hang Eva Dugan on February 21, 1930, in exhibit at the Pinal County Historic Society & Museum in Florence, AZ. Dugan gave interviews to the press for $1.00 each and sold embroidered handkerchiefs she knitted while imprisoned to pay for her own coffin. She also made for her hanging a silk, beaded \\"jazz dress\\", but later relented and wore a cheap dress as she was worried that her silk wrapper \\"might get mussed.\\" She remained upbeat, so much so that Time magazine called her \\"Cheerful Eva\\" in a March 3, 1930, story about her execution. The day before the hanging, there were rumors she planned to kill herself before being hanged. Her cell was searched and a bottle of raw ammonia and three razor blades hidden in a dress were confiscated. Dugan's appeal for clemency on the grounds of mental illness was denied and she was taken to the gallows at 5 a.m. on February 21, 1930. She was the first woman to be executed by the state of Arizona, and it was the first execution in Arizona history in which women were permitted as witnesses. According to a newspaper account, Dugan was composed as she mounted the gallows. She told the guards, \\"Don't hold my arms so tight, the people will think I'm afraid\\". She swayed slightly when the noose was put around her neck and shook her head in the negative when asked if she had any final words. The trap was sprung at 5:11; at the end of the drop, the snap of the rope decapitated her, sending her head rolling to a stop at the feet of the spectators. The grisly scene caused five witnesses (two women and three men) to faint. Dugan was one of the last persons to be hanged by the State of Arizona, with only two more hangings – those of Refugio Macias on March 7, 1930, and Herbert Young on August 21, 1931 –– taking place.https://corrections.az.gov/public-resources/death-row/executions- prior-1992-execution-methods The gallows were replaced in Arizona by the gas chamber in 1934 and lethal injection in 1993. To date, Dugan is the only woman ever to be executed by the State of Arizona. ==References *1930: Eva Dugan, her head jerked clean off, Executed Today * Category:1878 births Category:Place of birth missing Category:1930 deaths Category:1927 crimes Category:20th-century executions by Arizona Category:American robbers Category:Deaths by decapitation Category:20th- century executions of American people Category:People executed by Arizona by hanging Category:People executed for murder Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American female murderers Category:American female criminals Category:Executed American women Category:Axe murder Category:People from Pima County, Arizona Category:Stabbing attacks in the United States ","title":"Eva Dugan"},{"id":"35205365","text":"Nathan Louis Pond (born 5 January 1985) is a professional footballer who playes as a defender or defensive midfielder for club AFC Fylde. He previously played for Fleetwood Town over a fifteen-year period, whilst also having spells with Lancaster City, Kendal Town, Grimsby Town and Salford City. Internationally, he represents Montserrat, earning his first caps in 2019. Having played in seven divisions for Fleetwood through the course of six promotions, Pond was recognised by Guinness as holding the world record for appearing in the most different divisions with a single football club. ==Career== Club career Pond began his career with Northern Premier League side Lancaster City in 2003. Later that year he transferred to Fleetwood Town. Pond was the club's current longest-serving player, having played a club record of 423 matches since 2003. including six promotions, most notably the club's promotion to the Football League in 2012. He joined Kendal Town on a month's loan in December 2010, making two appearances for the club. The loan was part of an agreement, due to the sale of Danny Rowe to Fleetwood. On 10 August 2012 Pond joined Grimsby Town on an initial one-month loan. Having made his first appearance on 11 August 2012 against Southport at centre back, during the following game on 14 August 2012 he scored a 69th-minute opening goal in the 1–2 home defeat against Stockport, a right-footed overhead kick in off the crossbar. After playing three times for Grimsby, Pond extended his loan stay until January 2013. On 8 September 2012 he scored his second goal for Grimsby in a 1–0 victory against Forest Green Rovers, a glancing header from a Frankie Artus free-kick. Following a successful loan spell, Grimsby looked into extending Pond's loan beyond January or possibly securing him on a permanent deal but on 1 January 2013 they admitted it was unlikely because Fleetwood were interested in taking the player back to look at him. Pond's final appearance for Grimsby in his loan spell brought his fifth goal of the season against Hereford United, two minutes into the game. Pond commented before his final game that the loan spell had been successful for both himself and the club and that he would relish the prospect of returning to Grimsby on a permanent deal in the January transfer window if he was unable to win back his place in the Fleetwood team. He passed Jack Ainscough's record of 421 appearances for Fleetwood in the penultimate game of the 2015–16 season, ending the season on 423 appearances. Fleetwood exercised a one-year contract extension for him at the end of the 2017–18 season. In May 2018 he joined Salford City.

This object is from the collection of the Indiana State Museum Kylix before and after conservation - restoration. Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects is a process dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from ceramic. Typically this activity of conservation-restoration is undertaken by a conservator-restorer, especially when dealing with an object of cultural heritage. Ceramics are created from a production of coatings of inorganic, nonmetallic materials using heating and cooling to create a glaze. Typically the coatings are permanent and sustainable for utilitarian and decorative purposes.Ceramic Tile and Stone Standards . Ctioa.org. Retrieved on 2012-03-28. The cleaning, handling, storage, and in general treatment of ceramics is consistent with that of glass because they are made of similar oxygen-rich components, such as silicates. In conservation ceramics are broken down into three groups: unfired clay, earthenware or terracotta, and stoneware and porcelain. == Deterioration of ceramics == It is in the nature of all the materials used for construction to eventually degrade and deteriorate. Degradation of an object occurs as a result of the interaction between the environment or with the materials that form the object however, in the case of ceramics, environmental factors are the major cause. There are several ways in which ceramics break down physically and chemically. Additionally the type of ceramic will affect how it will break down. Unfired clay, like mud and clay adobe, is clay that is fired under 1000 °C or 1832 °F. This type of clay is water-soluble and unstable. Earthenware is clay that has been fired between 1000–1200 °C or 1832°–2192 °F. The firing makes the clay water insoluble but does not allow the formation of an extensive glassy or vitreous within the body. Although water-insoluble, the porous body of earthenware allows water to penetrate. A glaze can be applied that will protect the vessel from water. Due to its porosity, earthenware is susceptible to moisture and creates problems including cracks, breaks and mold growth. Porcelain and stoneware is fired at the highest temperatures between 1200–1400 °C or 2192–2552 °F. Porcelain clay mixtures are fired to create a non-porous and very hard surface. However, the materials also create a very brittle surface which increases the potential for chips, cracks and breaks.  Physical degradation  Due to their fragility, damage to ceramics typically comes from mishandling and packing. However, other factors, such as vandalism, frost, mold, and other similar occurrences, can also inflect harm.  Manufacturing defects  Also known as inherent vice, the intrinsic instability of the fabric and components of an objects can lead to its own physical degradation. This is difficult to prevent because it occurs within the fabric of the material and therefore is a natural occurrence. Deterioration of an object can happen even before the object is used. How the piece is created can instil manufacturing defects in the piece. This means that objects can be damaged even before they are used. This would include a body that contains inadequate qualities of (filler (materials)). A second typical defect is from poor design and construction. An example of this would be a ceramic piece with a handle that is too thin to support the weight of the cup. A third manufacturing defect includes careless firing. A ceramic piece that has been fired too rapidly or allowed to dry too fast will crack or break.  Impact and abrasions  With its delicate nature, ceramics that have been used over a period of time will sustain cracks, nicks, and blemishes. Additionally in a museum environment, damages can occur from packing storing, and handling of objects.  Frost  Damage can occur when ceramics are exposed to freezing temperatures and frost. The problem occurs when ice crystals form inside of the pores of the ceramic piece. The frost inside of the pores will exert pressure onto the fabric of the pottery and cause the material to crack and break.  Mold growth  Opposite of frost is heat and humidity. When the humidity is high molds can begin to form on ceramic, particularly ones in which there is no glaze. Spores of molds are found throughout the atmosphere and will attached to any organic residues nearby, such as ceramics. Earthenware ceramics are frequently affected due to their porosity and lack of glaze.  Chemical degradation  Chemical degradation of objects occurs not in the physical structure of the object but rather in at the chemical or compound level. Compounds begin to breakdown into more simpler compounds and is often an undesired reaction. The degradation of the chemical component of an object will hinder or weaken the stability of the object when exposed to environmental factors such as water, air, pollution, heat, humidity, and the like.  Water  Water can dissolve or deform ceramics that have been low fired, i.e. temperatures around 600 °C. Ceramic fired in high temperatures may also be susceptible to water if their mineral particles are soluble in water, for example Gypsum or calcite. Additionally the different compounds in water can flux and react in different ways to different ceramics. In naturally occurring water, carbon dioxide is dissolved and can create a chemical reaction with minerals in clay bodies that may form calcium bicarbonate which is very soluble. Stagnant water is less damaging because the carbon dioxide is not exhausted.  Soluble salts  A common degradation issue in ceramics involves soluble salts. Soluble salts can either enter the clay body from the environment, for example from being buried underground for decades, or they are already naturally occurring due to the components of the materials or clay used. Non-archaeological objects, such as modern dishware, can acquire salts from normal use such as storing salt. Soluble salts respond to changes in humidity both high and low. In high humidity salts become soluble and in low humidity they crystallize. The changing from soluble to crystallization and back damages the surface of the ceramic because salt crystals are larger than liquid salt and therefore will shrink and expand the ceramic body. A white haze on the surface is the first indication of soluble salts, which is the salt crystallizing. Over time, the physical component of the body will crumble until it is completely destroyed. == Preventive care of ceramics == In the realm of conservation there are two distinct practices: non-interventive and active conservation. Non-interventive types of conservation are used to control the surrounding environment such as light, humidity, and temperature. Active conservation is when a conservator practices treatments to alleviate physical problems in the object such as fading, chipping, or breaks.  Display  Although ceramics are utilitarian, some pieces are made to be artwork and therefore displayed. Displaying an object improperly can cause damages either physical or chemically from the environment. One of the most common causes for damages is a ceramic piece falling over or off a shelf. To prevent this issue, many historic houses will line storage and display shelves with a thin layer of ethafoam (polyethylene foam) or bubble wrap.  Storage  This ceramic ring is housed in a blue board box with an acrylic plastic lid. The ring is laid upon a layer of carved ethafoam to prevent it from shifting during handling. Ceramics are very delicate in nature and damages can occur even when they are stored away. The most common way in which ceramics become damaged is when they are stacked one inside the other. Unless this is part of the original design, this will typically cause nicks, cracks, or breaks. Some ceramics, depending on their provenance, survive better in different temperature and humidity conditions. Pottery that has been buried, such as from an archaeological site, adheres better to storage at a constant low humidity. Low humidity will help to keep any salts from efflorescing which can mar the surface as well as remove the surface glaze. In general ceramics are typically inert and are not sensitive to elevated light levels. However, extreme changes in temperature and humidity can cause chemical and physical damage. Typically museums strive to store ceramics, as well as many other material types, in a stable temperature of 68 °F with ± 3°. Additionally relative humidity should be stabilized at 50% also with a ±5%. Storing objects near windows, heaters, fireplaces, and exterior walls can create an unstable environment with temperature and humidity fluctuation and increase potential for damages. Some storing materials can be harmful to ceramic objects. Wool felt attracts and harbors insects including moths and silverfish which can be potentially very harmful to other collection material types. Polyurethane foam deteriorates over time which leaves a by-product that are sticky and acidic.  Handling  One of the cardinal rules in object handling is to treat every object as if it is fragile and easily breakable. Museum technicians, curators, and conservators are trained to prepare a moving plan before an object is even touched that way minimal damage can occur when handling or moving an object. In the museum field is it a known fact that a vessel, or any object, should be held and handled by its strongest part, such as the base, and with both hands. Areas such as the handle or neck of a vessel tend to be the weakest points and may break if picked up by these components. == Removal of previous conservation actions == Damages also occur to ceramics from previous restoration. Although the intent was to repair the object for use or display, some dated practices are now known to increase damages either physically, from rivets or staples, or chemically, from old used adhesives that off-gas.  Removal of surface coating  Overpaint is a technique that is used to cover imperfection on the surface of a ceramic piece. Differences can be seen to the naked eye due to discoloration, being matched poorly, and change in texture or gloss. subtle difference can also been seen by restorers by using lighting and magnification. Overpaint and surface coatings can be removed either mechanically or with the use of solvents. Mechanical removal of overpaint include physical techniques to remove the coating from the surface. On a glazed surface a sharp needle or scalpel can be used. If mechanical removal is not possible without damaging the surface then solvents can be used instead. The archetype solvents typically used are water, white spirit, industrial methylated spirits (denatured alcohol), acetone, and Dichloromethane which is usually found in the form of a commercial paint stripper. The appropriate solvent works by being applied to the ceramic surface by a cotton wool swab and is rolled on the surface rather than being wiped. Wiping the solvent on the surface will push the paint into the surface rather than lift it off.  Removal of filling materials  Fill materials are used to fill in missing parts or breaks in a ceramic piece in order to stabilize the piece. A wide range of materials and techniques have been used to restore losses in ceramics. Today the most common filling materials are made from calcium- sulphate-based fillers or synthetic resins based on epoxy, acrylic, or polyester resin. These new resins are stronger and do not harm the object. Removing previous filling materials, either mechanically or chemically, and replacing them with new fillers can help keep the piece strong and stable. Fillers can be removed physically by mechanical ways, depending on the filler material type. Cement mortar can be chiselled away with a hammer and chisel gradually. Plaster is easily removed through mechanical methods such as chiselling and chipping away with sharp implements. Saws, drills, and other mechanical methods can be used to remove the bulk of protruding materials, however scratches, chips, and breaks can occur. A second option to removing filler material is chemically. Typically, chemical removal is used once the bulk of filler material is left and only a small portion is left. Unlike adhesives, fills tend to be easier to remove and dismantle from ceramics. Plaster of Paris is one example of a fill that comes apart easily with warm.  Removal of adhesives  A Minoan ceramic piece from the Archaeological Museum of Herakleion that has gone under restoration The selection for the proper solvent is based on the identification of the adhesive itself. Every adhesive has a particular solvent that work best to break down its chemical composition. Color, hardness, and other physical properties will allow for identification of the adhesive. The adhesive can be soften once exposed, either in a liquid of vapor form, of the solvent for some time. The length of time depends on the solubility of the adhesive and the thickness of the joint. Porous bodies, low-fired clays, are sometimes pre-soaked in water to prevent the adhesive from being drawn back into the body once it joins with the removal solution. If the adhesive that is being removed is part of the support for the object, then supports, such as tissue paper or propping up the object, will be used to make sure the object does not sustain damages once the adhesive is removed. Sometimes if the adhesive is not softened enough if will remove part of the surface on the ceramic if pressure is applied. The information on solvents for specific adhesives are found below, under each adhesive section. == Cleaning == Removal of surface dirt and deposits is beneficial for the health and longevity of an object because it will prevent the dirt from becoming drawn into the body. Dust and grease may be held on the surface loosely by electrostatic forces or weak chemical bonds and are easily removed. Some deposits, such as calcium salts, can be strongly attached to a ceramic surface, especially if the surface is unglazed. There are two main methods in which ceramics are cleaned and treated: mechanically and chemically. Not all ceramic pieces are dry when they need cleaning. Some ceramics, such as those that are excavated archaeologically, will be damp or wet in nature. Conservators tend to remove the surface dirt before the object is completely dry. This is done because it is easier to do before the dirt hardens and because as it dried the dirt may shrink and cause physical damage to the ceramic surface. Some ceramics are kept damp until treatment can be completed.  Mechanical methods  Mechanical methods include dusting, picking and cutting, and abrading. Mechanical cleaning is typically much easier to control than chemical treatments and there is no danger of dirt being drawn into a solution and then absorbed by the ceramic. The danger of mechanical cleaning is the potential for the surface to break or become scratched with a tool. Dusting is used when dirt is not strongly adhered to the surface of the ceramic and is carried out by either a brush or a soft cloth. Large ceramic vessels are cleaned with a delicate vacuum cleaner with a soft, muslin-covered head. Picking and cutting is used when there is hardened dirt, encrustations, or old restoration materials closely adhering to the surface. Needles, sharp scalpels, other custom made tools, usually made from wood, and electric vibrotools are used. The dangers with these tools are the increase potential for scratches, gouges, cracking, and breaking of the object due to pressure. Abrading is the process in which surface deposits are removed using abrasives. Abrasives come in both solid and cream forms. Solid forms of abrasives include glass fiber brush or a rubber burr on a dental drill. Cream forms are usually attached to paper or film. Polishing creams are commonly used to remove thin layers of insoluble surface deposits such as calcium. These creams can also remove surface dirt and marks made by tools. The best creams of ceramic do not have oil, grease, or bleach as additives and are used only on glazed ceramics.  Chemical methods  Chemical methods for cleaning ceramics involve water, solvents, acids, and alkalis. Prolonged soaking in water may be used as a conservation method. The goal is to either remove stains from the surface or to remove the soluble salts in the clay body. == Repair and restoration== The repair and restoration of ceramics has occurred since ceramics were invented including fillings, adhesives, reinforcements, and even patch work. The history of ceramic repair is vast and ranges from different methods and methodologies. For example, in 16th century China, people would repair broken ceramics by using pieces from other objects to disguise the patch. A sixteenth-century manuscript describes the process of patching broken ceramics: {  -  16th century - \\"Old pieces of porcelain from any famous kiln such as censers lack ears or feet or if vases have damaged mouth rims one can use old bits to patch the old; and if one adds glaze and then bakes it is just the same as the old. But the colour is weak at the patch. Yet people prefer this to the new stuff. And if one uses the method of blowing the glaze on to the patched parts there is still less of a trace\\". } Today there are new advances in ceramic restoration including consolidation, bonding, adhesives, dowels, rivets, and fillers.  Consolidation  Consolidation is the process in which the fabric of the ceramic is strengthened by introducing a material into the fabric that will bind together. The most common ceramics that need consolidation are excavated pieces because they tend to have lost their bonding fabrics due to leeching or have absorbed soluble salts. A consolidant works in two ways: it either links to the particles in the ceramic chemically or it may form a support system mechanically without reacting with the fabric itself. Chemical consolidants that are used in modern conservation include isocyanates, silanes, siloxnes, and methyl methacrylates, however the consolidants that create a mechanical support system are used more frequently.  Adhesives  Repaired ceramic bowl from the National Museum of Vietnam History A chemical compound that adheres or bonds items together, such as pieces of ceramic. In ceramic conservation there are several different types that range from natural to man- made adhesives. Conservators characterise the best adhesive as one which can be undone. = Animal glue = Animal glue is an adhesive that contains various animal parts such as bone, skin, or fish and is widely used. It is a soft adhesive and can appear white, but usually has a pale yellow or brown appearance. Animal glue is very soft and can easily be broken down and removed with warm water and steam. Although easily reversible, the relative ease with which the glue breaks down makes it a less strong bonding method. = Shellac = A widely used old adhesive that is orange or very dark brown in appearance. Once dried, the adhesive is very hard and becomes increasingly more brittle over time. Shellac does not break down easily with commercially available products. Additionally, the resin has naturally-occurring dyes that can stain ceramic pink or black. The solvent that works best on this resin is Industrial methylated spirit or (IMA). Shellac is prepared by dissolving flakes of shellac in hot alcohol. The properties of shellac make it vulnerable to climatic conditions and inclined to deteriorate over time. Damage can even occur to shellac under the hot light of photography. = Epoxy resin = This type of resin is typically used post-1930s and is an indication of modern conservation work. Generally epoxy is very hard but unlike shellac is not brittle. The color of epoxy resin can range from yellow/green to a dark yellow/brown. Yellowing of the resin is an indication of aging. Warm to hot water or acetone are known to be the solvents of this adhesive. = Rubber adhesives = Rubber cements are solutions of synthetic or natural rubber products in solvents, with or without resins and gums. Vulcanizers, accelerators, and stabilizers are considered problematic due to the nature of their compounds. One example is the additive of sulfur which is harmful to some types of material, including silver, because it can cause discoloration. Rubber adhesives can be confused with epoxy resins due to their similar appearance. However, unlike epoxy resins, rubber adhesives will stretch when pulled. Nitromors or Polystrippa solvent brands are used as a solvent but warm water can also loosen the bond. = Vinyl acetate polymers = Vinyl acetate polymers include polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetal; all come from reaction products of vinyl acetate. Some forms of acetates are known to be acidic and will do damage to an object with direct contact. Additionally, polyvinyl acetate mixtures tend to degrade in storage and release acetic acid, which in some cases can corrode lead. This compound's coloring ranges from clear/white to a soft yellow. As it ages, it will change to a deeper yellow. It can have a similar appearance to rubber adhesives but the difference is that PVA turns white when comes into contact with water. Warm water and acetone are typically used as solvents. = Cellulose nitrate = There are early and modern forms of this adhesive. While both tend to tinge with yellow as they age, the early form tends to become more brittle than the modern version, which contains a plasticizer to make the compound more stable. As with many adhesives, acetone is generally used as a solvent, however IMS can also be used. = Paraloid B-72 = B-72 is a thermoplastic resin that was created by Rohm and Haas for use as a surface coating and as a vehicle for Flexographic ink. However B-72 is now being used more as an adhesive specifically for ceramic and glass. One of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidate is that it is stronger and harder than polyvinyl acetate without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically-used adhesives and tolerates stress and strain on a join that most others can not. One major drawback to using B-72 is the difficulty of applying the acrylic resin as an adhesive, as is difficulty in manipulating the substance as a workable agent. The most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone. Unlike cellulose nitrate, B-72 does not need additives like plasticizers to stabilize its durability. Fumed colloidal silica is a chemical that can be added to help with the workability of the resin. Additionally research shows that the silica will better distribute stress and strain that occurs during evaporation of the solvent and during the setting of the adhesive film.  Dowels and rivets  Dowels and rivets are physical ways in which ceramics can be reinforced and strengthen beneath the surface. Dowels are cylindrical rods that consist of wood, metal, or plastic. They are drilled into the ceramic piece and usually are set in the hole with an adhesive that is used to repair the ceramic piece. Removing dowels can be hard because they lie under the surface and are usually hidden. Conservators will cut through dowels with a piercing saw and soften the area with a solvent, like acetone to remove two pieces of ceramic from one another. Riveting is a process in which holes are drilled in the surface of the ceramic, but does not go completely through the piece. The rivets are angled toward the joint and provide additional structural support. There are two methods to removing rivets: the 'cut' and 'pull'. The 'cut' method consists of cutting the rivets through the middle with a file and then pulled out. The 'pull' method involves placing a thin blade under the rivet and pushing out any plaster packing. This method uses leverage to pull the rivet from the ceramic piece.  Fillers  Fillers are used to replace gaps and losses from ceramic materials for either aesthetic reasons or for support. There are several different filler materials used in ceramics including plaster of Paris and other commercially available putties and fillers. Plaster of Paris is a material that consists of calcium sulphate hemihydrate power and is produced by heating gypsum to 120 °C. The chemical formula is as follows: :CaSO4·2H2O + Heat → CaSO4·½H2O + 1½ H2O (released as steam). When mixed with water, an exothermic reaction occurs and forms a hard white filling similar to density of fired ceramics. Different grades of plasters are available and vary based on their particle size, setting time, density, expansion, and color. A thermoplastic synthetic wax resin mixture developed by John W Burke and Steve Colton in 1997 can be used to compensate losses in objects from translucent materials such as alabaster, marble, calcite, diorite, and anhydrite. The mixture consists of polyvinyl acetate (PVAC) AYAC, ethylene acrylic acid (EAA) copolymers A-C 540, and 580, antioxidants Irganox 1076 or 1035, dry pigments, marble powder, and other additives which were all melted together. This wax resin is a better substitute to wax-resins because wax collects dust and dirt and make the fill noticeable. Polyester resin and epoxies are toxic and noxious. The wax-resin is fast and easy to use, making it a possible new alternative to fill materials in the conservation field. The wax-resin works best on losses that allow for large contact with the original, primed surface and on losses that are thicker than 1/16in. Shallow losses and small gaps are more difficult due to the ease in which the fill is pulled out.  Retouching  == Education and training == In France, conservators specialized in earthenware and glassware are trained at the Institut National du Patrimoine (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration. ==See also== * Conservation and restoration of metals * Conservation and restoration of copper-based objects * Conservation and restoration of ferrous objects * Conservation and restoration of glass objects * Conservation and restoration of ivory objects * Conservation and restoration of silver objects == References  * Care and conservation of ceramic and glass by The Institute of Conservation * Conservation of ceramics at the Victoria & Albert Museum * Ceramic and glass conservation at National Museums Liverpool Category:Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage Category:History of ceramics ","title":"Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects"},{"id":"35205414","text":"Breira may refer to: * Breira, Algeria * Breira (organization), a 1970s Jewish organization * Breira (Talmudic doctrine), a Talmudic doctrine ","title":"Breira"},{"id":"35205422","text":"Larry Warford III (born June 18, 1991) is an American football guard who is a free agent.

On behalf of Tonito Emiliani, then ISTEC Director, he oversaw the improvement from Laboratory to Institute, which was opened in 1979 by Gaetano Quagliariello, the then CNR president. In 1985 Babini was made director of ISTEC,PDF giving information about academic background (2001) a position which he retained until 2008. As ISTEC Director, he urged research in traditional ceramics for building (raw materials, paints, plants, bricks, ceramic tiles, sanitary ware and so on) and art craft, with the objective of identifying the most appropriate methods in order to attain the best quality in the field. Babini was also deeply involved in education and training at different levels. He promoted both vocational and post-graduate education and training in collaboration with the University of Bologna: presently a bachelor's degree in chemistry and technologies for the environment and materials is being offered at the Faenza Science and Technology Park. Babini carried many initiatives aimed at promoting innovation and technology transfer and devising ways to create high tech partnerships and links with businesses and communities. Among his contributions, one of the most important was his involvement in the organisation of, as a chairman of the Special CNR Operative Unit for Technology Transfer, the Technology Transfer Days carried out in agreement with ACIMAC (Association of Italian suppliers of plant, machinery, equipment, semi-finished products, raw materials and services for the ceramic, heavy clay and refractories industries) and the establishing of the Evanelista Torricelli – Faventia technology incubation centre to link academia to industry. The centre bridges the gap between the two by following the idea of technology incubation. His broad range of activity resulted in him publishing over 100 papers, in taking part in many popular/scientific meetings and events as a prominent expert and in granting patents for industrial applications.

While not Montreal's first orchestra, the MO is considered by music historians to be the first professional symphony orchestra in Montreal. Previous orchestras in that city were much smaller in size and, unlike the MO, utilized amateur musicians. The MO was the first ensemble in Montreal that employed only professional musicians, and the orchestra introduced Montreal's audiences to full symphonic programs for the first time. The ensemble gave the Montreal premieres of numerous works from the standard orchestral repertoire, including pieces by Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Rachmaninoff, and Sibelius among others. ==History== The MO was the brain child of clarinetist Giulio Romano who banded together the 70 member orchestra after the advent of sound films put many of Montreal's theatre musicians out of work. Douglas Clarke served as the orchestra's conductor and Maurice Onderet served as the orchestra's concertmaster for the ensemble's entire 11-year history. The MO gave its first performance at the Orpheum Theatre located on Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest on October 12, 1930. For this first concert the musicians made just $4 a piece. As the orchestra grew in popularity, members were eventually paid $15 a concert, a considerable amount of money during the Great Depression. During the MO's first season of 25 concerts, the orchestra relocated to Her Majesty's Theatre, Montreal (HMT) which remained the orchestra's home for the remainder of its history. The MO produced 10 annual seasons at the HMT, giving more than 200 performances at that theatre. In addition, the orchestra was featured in 10 concerts on the Canadian Pacific Railway radio network in 1932, and was heard on several broadcasts on CBC Radio during the late 1930s. The orchestra also produced a series of popular concerts for children at the Mount Royal Hotel from 1935-1939. As principal conductor, Clarke led the orchestra in most of its performances and was the driving creative force behind the ensemble's choice of repertoire and programming. Clarke notably conducted the Montreal premiere of Healey Willan's Symphony No. 1 in 1937 and the world premiere of Violet Archer's Scherzo Sinfonico in 1940. The MO also occasionally utilized guest conductors. In 1932 Gustav Holst conducted 'Jupiter' from his The Planets and in 1933 Claude Champagne led the Canadian premiere of his Suite canadienne. Other notable composers who conducted the orchestra in performances of their own works included Reginald de Havilland Tupper (1934 performance of his Suite of Old English Pieces), Henri Miro (his Symphonic Praeludium in 1935), Percy Grainger (his Green Bushes and Colonial Song in 1938), and Alexander Brott (his Oracle in 1939). Conductor Bernard Naylor also led the orchestra in two concerts in 1941. In 1934 one of the MO's executive board members, Madame Athanase David, left the board after disputes between the anglophone and francophone members of the board came to a head. In order to create a symphony that gave a more substantial place to Quebec soloists, conductors, and composers, she founded the Société des concerts symphoniques de Montréal (SCM) which eventually became the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. Many musicians played in both the SCM and the MO from 1934-1941. The competition between the SCM and the MO had a negative impact on the finances of both orchestras. With the onset of World War II and increasing health issues suffered by Clarke, the MO disbanded after the 1940-1941 season. ==Notable soloists== Many notable musicians appeared as guest soloists with orchestra, including the following: *Webster Aitken *Ellen Ballon *Harold Bauer *Cédia Brault *Harriet Cohen *Etta Coles *Lionel Daunais *Jeanne Dusseau *George Enescu *Emanuel Feuermann *Ria Ginster *Gertrude Huntly Green *Leslie Holmes *Paul de Marky *Nathan Milstein *Séverin Moisse *Kathleen Parlow *Ross Pratt *William Primrose *Felix Salmond *E.

Subsequent, defections from the Syrian Army, following a crackdown in the wider Aleppo region against anti-government activists, led to the town becoming a battleground between the Syrian Army and the Free Syrian Army, made up of defectors and armed civilians in late March 2012. Three soldiers were killed by the FSA in fighting in March. On May 23, the government launched an assault on Azaz. As their armored columns approached the city from the west supported by helicopters and artillery, they encountered stiff rebel resistance from the combined forces of the Free North Brigade and the Muthanna ibn Haritha Battalion. Over the next three days, government forces attempted to take rebel-held neighborhoods. By the evening of May 26, rebels pushed the government out of the city, destroying five armored vehicles in the process.Holliday, Joseph (September 17, 2012), Campaign for North Syria, September 2012, Institute for the Study of War ==The second Azaz offensive== At the beginning of July, the Assad government began its second major offensive operation in northern Aleppo. Once again, the focus of this offensive was Azaz, which the government began to shell on July 2. A week later, the Syrian observatory for Human Rights reported heavy clashes in several of the city's neighborhoods. The struggle for Azaz continued until July 19, when rebel groups finally re-established control of the city. The government retreated to Minnakh Air Base, which remained operational. On 23 July, it was confirmed that the FSA had finally taken control of Azaz. They said that 17 government tanks had been destroyed and one captured, although a journalist in the area counted 7 destroyed tanks. There is video evidence of the battle itself to explain the mechanism of the rebels' success against government armor in this battle. A number of factors have contributed to their success. One account of the clashes indicated that rebels used rocket propelled grenades against the tanks. If this is the case, then rebels in Azaz have cultivated substantial anti-armor tactical proficiency. RPGs are not typically capable of penetrating the thick armor of main battle tanks. The rebels would have had to utilize complex tactics, carefully employing their anti-armor assets to achieve mobility kills before striking against weak points in the tanks' armor. The same account also points to the government blunders in the employment of its tanks, explaining that the government positioned its armored elements in a courtyard surrounding the mosque, pointing their guns outward towards the city in a defensive stance without infantry support aside from sniper over-watch from inside the mosque. Also critical to the rebels success was the quantity of ammunition they possessed. Thanks to Azaz's proximity to the Turkish border, rebels there could easily access weapons, ammunition, and reinforcements via the Kilis Border Crossing. The Tawhid Brigade claims to receive support from foreign states. A Tawhid Brigade spokesman in Azaz by the name of Abdulaziz Salama reported that the brigade received some 700 RPG rounds, 300 rifles, and 3,000 grenades in two shipments coordinated by the US and Turkey. ==Further developments== On 16 December, Syrian government warplanes bombed the town. Most of the bombs hit the centre of Azaz, around three kilometres (two miles) from the Turkish border in an area dominated by Syrian rebels, but at least one landed 500 metres from Turkish soil, one official said. It also stirred panic at a Syrian refugee camp just inside Turkey. Hundreds of residents from Azaz were trying to cross the border. Azaz was again hit from the air on 26 January 2013. ==References Bibliography == * * Azaz Category:Aleppo Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Syrian government Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Free Syrian Army Category:March 2012 events in Asia Category:April 2012 events in Asia Category:May 2012 events in Asia Category:June 2012 events in Asia Category:July 2012 events in Asia Category:Battles of the Syrian Civil War ","title":"Battle of Azaz (2012)"},{"id":"35205751","text":"Monte Bove is an ice-capped mountain at the eastern end of the Cordillera Darwin, Chile.

In a career that lasted from spring 1846 to summer 1848 he ran eleven times and won four races. As a three-year- old in 1846 he won two of the three races which became known as the Triple Crown, taking the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket and the St Leger at Doncaster. He was considered by some to have been unlucky when he was narrowly defeated in The Derby. The rest of his career was a disappointment as he won only one race in the next two seasons. After being retired to stud he had some success as a sire of winners. ==Background== The colt who would become Sir Tatton Sykes was bred near Driffield by a farmer named Hudson. He was a bright bay horse standing 15.2 hands high with large, drooping ears, a white blaze and one white foot and was described as having a \\"quiet and docile\\" temperament. He was sired by Melbourne, a member of the Godolphin Arabian sire-line who went on to get the Triple Crown winner West Australian and the outstanding filly Blink Bonny. His dam, an unnamed mare by Margrave went on to produce the important broodmare Lady Elizabeth. As a young horse he was bought for £10 by Bill Scott. Scott had recently quarreled with his brother John Scott, the leading racehorse trainer of the time, and had set up his own stable near Malton, North Yorkshire, with the day-to-day conditioning of the horses being handled by William Oates. Bill Scott, who rode many of his own horses, was one of the most successful jockeys of his era, although he was also noted for his heavy drinking and rough riding tactics. Scott named his bay colt Tibthorpe, after a village near Driffield. ==Racing career== 1846: three-year-old season Tibthorpe did not run as a two-year-old but showed a great deal of promise in training: according to one story Bill Scott dismounted after an early gallop and dropped to his knees to thank God \\"that he has sent me a bloody clinker at last\\". In early 1846 the name of Tibthorpe began to appear in the betting lists for The Derby: after being quoted at odds of 100/1 in late January, he was backed down to 25/1 over the next month. Tibthorpe made his first racecourse appearance in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on 28 April, starting at odds of 5/1 in a field of six runners. Bill Scott produced a \\"perfect\\" display of jockeyship to win a slowly run race on his own horse, foiling a major gamble on a horse named Tom Tulloch. Tibthorpe's appearance and performance led to suspicions of foul play. During this period there were several cases of four-year-old horses having their identities faked and running in races, notably the British Classics, which were confined to three- year-olds. Tibthorpe's win at Newmarket was only confirmed after an examination of his teeth, demanded by Tom Tulloch's owner Lord Maidstone, which established that he was indeed a three-year-old colt. The Yorkshire- trained horse was promoted to second favourite for the Derby, and Scott renamed him after Sir Tatton Sykes, 4th Baronet a notable breeder of Thoroughbreds based at Sledmere. Sir Tatton Sykes is led in by his human namesake after the 1846 St Leger At Epsom on 27 May, Sir Tatton Sykes started at odds of 10/1 for the Derby in a field of twenty-seven runners. Bill Scott had reportedly been drinking heavily on the morning of the race and had a long and noisy argument with the racecourse starter, which resulted in him missing the start and being left behind by the other runners. Scott made up the lost ground and was able to bring Sir Tatton Sykes through the field to challenge for the lead in the straight. In the closing stages, however, it became clear that Scott was in no condition to ride a strong finish and despite briefly taking the lead his colt was caught and beaten by Pyrrhus The First. After the race Scott was reported to the racecourse stewards and fined £5 for \\"disobeying orders\\" and \\"using improper language\\". While many blamed Scott for his horse's defeat, others pointed out that Sir Tatton Sykes was a difficult horse to ride and may well have been beaten on merit by the winner. On his first start after his Epsom defeat, Sir Tatton Sykes started 4/7 favourite but failed to finish the course in the North Derby Stakes at Newcastle Racecourse on 23 June after slipping on the turn and throwing his jockey. At York in August, Sir Tatton Sykes won the Knavesmire Stakes, beating Wrestler \\"in a canter\\". At Doncaster in September, twelve horses ran in the St. Leger Stakes, with Sir Tatton Sykes being made joint favourite with Brocardo at odds of 3/1. Bill Scott's condition was closely monitored, with William Oates prepared to take the ride in case of drunkenness, but he arrived at the start completely sober. Scott tracked the leaders on Sir Tatton Sykes, then moved forward in the straight to dispute the lead with Iago, a colt from the stable of his brother John Scott. The two Scott horses drew clear of the other runners, with Sir Tatton Sykes prevailing by half a length after making a \\"tremendous rush\\" in the closing stages. The win was well-received, with Scott being loudly cheered by the Yorkshire crowd. The original Sir Tatton Sykes, who was then seventy-five years old and a popular racecourse figure, led his equine namesake into the winner's enclosure. On his final start of the season, Sir Tatton Sykes was beaten by Iago in the Grand Duke Michael Stakes at Newmarket after he had \\"swerved at the finish\\". 1847-1848: later career Sir Tatton Sykes stayed in training as a four-year-old but failed to reproduce his best form. In April he ran in the Port Stakes over two miles at Newmarket's Craven meeting, but was easily beaten by Sting, after which he was sold by Scott to Captain O'Kelly. At Ascot in June he contested the Emperor's Plate in which he finished unplaced behind The Hero over two and a half miles. Later that summer he won a £500 match race against The Traverser over one mile at York. 1848 saw further deterioration in the form of the double Classic winner. At Ascot he finished unplaced in the Royal Hunt Cup carrying a weight of 125 pounds. Later that year he ran in a race at Hampton in which he finished second to an unnamed three-year-old filly over one mile. He was then retired to stud. ==Stud career== At stud, Sir Tatton Sykes sired a few good winners, but was not a great success. He was based at a stud farm owned by Mr Eyke at Stanton, near Shifnal in Shropshire. The best of his progeny were the filly Ronzi, who won the Prix de Diane and Mr Sykes, who won the Cesarewitch Handicap. Sir Tatton Sykes died in May 1860 at Stanton from \\"an inflammation of the bowels\\". ==Pedigree== *Sir Tatton Sykes was inbred 3x4 to Comus, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree. ==References== Category:1843 racehorse births Category:1860 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 8-e Category:Godolphin Arabian sire line Category:2000 Guineas winners Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Sir Tatton Sykes"},{"id":"35205847","text":"Hal Yorke (also Lord Harry or Henry Yorke ) is a fictional vampire in the comedy-drama TV series Being Human, portrayed by Damien Molony. The male lead for the duration of the show's last two series appeared in 14 episodes of the drama. ==Television series== Background Within the series narrative, Hal serves as a soldier in the Battle of Orsha on 8 September 1514, when he is turned into a vampire by an army surgeon. In his early years as a vampire Hal is one of the most evil vampires in existence and is tearing through Eastern Europe and its historic wars in the 1700s and 1800s. Hal is a member of Old Ones, a group of ancient and royal vampires. In the early 20th century Hal joins forces with the werewolf Lady Cathrine, and the ghost Emil, to defeat the devil, who benefits from the war between vampires and werewolves. Instead of using his own blood for the ritual, Hal sacrifices one of his men. Therefore, the trio is incomplete and instead of being defeated the devil is only weakened and escapes in the vessel of a mad man. In the 1950s Hal is starting to get tired of the killing and the way he has lived during the last decades. Hal hosts some werewolf fights where he meets the werewolf Leo who has never lost a fight and is very taken by him. He saves his werewolf friend, who in return helps him keep him off blood for the following five-and-a-half decades. Hal develops some techniques that help him to stay clean and keep his bloodlust at bay. So he plays dominoes, does exercises and press-ups.  Series 4  At the beginning of the series Hal lives in a barbershop in South End, together with Leo, a werewolf, and Pearl, a ghost. Together the friends come to Barry to save Leo's life. However, Hal ends up alone and decides to stay with the ghost Annie and the werewolf Tom. While Hal considers Annie as a friend, Tom and Hal don't really get on at first but their friendship develops during the series.

However, Damien Molony adds that Alex also represents the bad in Hal that he has been running from. On one hand he fancies her on the other hand their meeting up is the reason for the death of Alex and for her to become a ghost. So he feels responsible for this which is also painful for him. Because Hal is reminded of his bad side Hal finds it easier to push her away in order to cope with his guilt of what he’s done to her. Kate Bracken adds that Alex sees her relationship with Hal as complicated. She realises how hard it is for Hal to resist his bloodlust. She knows that it is like an illness which he can not control. So she is quite forgiving, but for her it is a battle of emotions when it comes to Hal.  Annie Sawyer  According to Damien Molony Hal looks up to Annie. He relies on her and needs her help to stay clean. She is a friend to him.  Tom McNair  According to Michael Socha and Damien Molony Hal and Tom hate each other at the beginning. Tom is afraid that the vampires are coming and that Hal might be one of them. However, they start to get closer to each other and finally they even ask each other for help and advice. They become friends. ==Casting== Damien Molony plays Hal Yorke. After the departure of Aidan Turner (Mitchell), Russell Tovey (George) and Sinead Keenan (Nina), the producers of Being Human decided not to cancel the series but to renew it. Damien Molony did a drama showcase in February 2011 when the casting director of Being Human made a visit. She offered Molony to read for the part of Hal. At the recall Molony first met Michael Socha. They both got along and three days later Molony got a call from his agent and was told that he got the part. Molony moved to Cardiff the following week and stayed there for the next six months to do costume fittings, rehearsals and the filming of Being Human. In October 2011 it was announced to the public that Damien Moloney was cast as the vampire Hal. Before the new series was shown on television, a short online prequel with Hal was released in early January 2012. The prequel introduced the character to the Being Human fans and showed a bit of his background story. For Molony playing Hal was his first TV role. He had to learn how to work in front of the camera and was supported by the crew and his co-stars. Every evening he practised playing the vampire in his apartment. At first, he felt a big pressure, replacing former actor Aidan Turner and his character Mitchell, but then he realised, that Hal was completely different to Mitchell and had another background story. He said that it was nice to have been given the chance to play a completely different character. Before playing the role of Hal Damien Molony has researched on the Russian and Eastern European history and tried to find out where Hal might have been. For the prequel he wanted to find more information about Orsha, because Hal has been turned into a vampire during the Battle of Orsha. Molony thought that the bloodlust of vampires is similar to addicts. To understand Hal's bloodlust Molony did a lot of research on drug addicts and alcoholics and rehab and falling off the wagon, which helped him to get into Hal's world. Furthermore, Molony started to watch as much classic vampire films as he could. Films within the Bram Stoker, Nosferatu era helped him to play the vampire Hal, who doesn’t really know how to live a modern life. ==Characterisation== Within the series narrative, Hal is an OCD-afflicted blood-abstaining vampire. The producers mentioned that Hal would be very different from Being Humans previous lead vampire Mitchell. Damien Molony described his character Hal as \\"Very, very posh. Very upper class. A stiff upper-lipped Brit\\". According to Molony Hal's biggest challenge is blood and trying to keep away from blood. Hal is a very dangerous character who was, in his evil time, a legendary figure amongst the vampires. It is very difficult for Hal to have a relationship with a woman, as sex and bloodlust are linked. Molony thinks that during his dry 50 years Hal has been avoiding any kind of intimacy. In the series he has to face all these temptations, because he suddenly finds himself within the modern world. According to Molony, Hal can be quite calm, quite contained and live a very basic life for several decades, but then he suddenly turn into his former self and be aggressive, rape, torture and kill everything he sees. Similar to Jekyll & Hyde, but within a single blink of his black, vampire eyes. Lenora Crichlow mentioned that Damien Molony brought \\"a whole different intensity to the vampire\\". She said that Hal is intelligent and wise similar to Mitchell, but in a very different way. She added that Hal's wisdom comes from managing his bloodlust and that his intensity comes from his discipline. Loma Jowett compares Hal to Angel from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Similar to Angel/Angelus Hal has a split personality \\"with a bad side that eventually comes forward however hard Hal tries to repress him\\"Lorna Jowett: ‘Centuries of evil… wacky sidekicks… yadda, yadda’: vampire television, vampire time and the conventions of flashback. In: Lorna Jowett, Kevin Robinson & David Simmons (2016): Time on TV: Narrative Time, Time Travel and Time Travellers in Popular Television Culture. Bloomsbury Publishing, P. 121-133, ==Reception== After the broadcast of Hal's prequel Keith Watson from Metro said that Being Human has \\"promising signs of fresh life\\" and that the \\"chief among them is Damien Molony's vampire Hal\\". When the first episode of series four was released on television the reactions to the new leads and the new series were already very positive. According to Mark Oakley from Den of Geek Damien Molony \\"delivers every line with a gravitas that lights up any scene he’s part of.\\" He adds that it was a pleasure to listen to his speeches. Mandy from The Media Addict enjoyed getting to know Hal. She loves Hal’s whole stiff and proper old English gentleman act and adds that she adores Damien Molony as Hal and thinks he is gorgeous. Ian Berriman from GamesRadar thinks that Hal falling off the wagon in the end of series five is horrible to see and Damien Molony’s performance is \\"perfection itself\\". Malcolm Stewart from the Cultbox believes that Hal's and Tom's double act is one of the highlights of the show. Morgan Jeffrey from Digital Spy adds that the characters are fantastic individually, but are unbeatable when they are together. He mentioned that television critics as well as Being Human fans, were sceptical that anyone could fill the \\"charisma void left by Aidan Turner, but Molony slotted in seamlessly\\". According to Aubry D'Arminio from Entertainment Weekly Hal has his own charms. He has sensitivity to Annie’s pain, is loyal to Leo and has a very pretty face. Mark Oakley from Den of Geek says that he had loved watching Hal evolve as the series had evolved with him. George Ivanoff thinks that Hal is \\"a much more interesting and complex vampire than Mitchell\\". In February 2012 Damien Molony was featured along with Michael Socha on Glamour's TV's Hottest New Stars list, which contained eight new stars. Hal was described as sexy.Glamour (2012): TV's Hottest New Stars. Michael Socha and Damien Molony Edition: February 2012.

It is located at A.H. Lacson St., Sampaloc, Manila. The school is located near the University of Santo Tomas. ==History== The school was founded in June 1958 by the Religious Missionaries of St. Dominic in response to the need to provide Catholic education to the children who live in the vicinity of UST, particularly its employees. Under the leadership of Sr. Jesus Ibargoitia, the superior of Sta. Catalina Girls' Dormitory and Sr. Esperanza Melgar, the secretary general, a two-room structure was constituted in May 1958. A month later, the school opened St. Dominic's Kindergarten School with 79 boys and girls as enrollees. The rooms had all the facilities needed for the children to know and develop their skill and knowledge. To fulfill its mission of proving good Catholic education, its curriculum has religion as its core with Christ as the center. Their devotion to Christ and Mary was awakened and strengthened through religious activities. In 1963, this structure was demolished to give way to the construction of a two-storey concrete building that can accommodate pupils from kindergarten to grade IV. From a thousand pupils in 1964, its population in 1996 increased. In 1967, the school was changed to Dominican School, the name by which all congregation-owned schools are known in compliance with a directive of the DRMSD chapter of 1965. That year was marked by further improvements in the school's academic standard and engagement in an outreach program of providing catechetical institution to public school children in the neighborhood on Sundays. Towards the end of 1973, the school erected 18 classrooms more. A community of sisters who will manage the school solely was also created between 1976 and 1979. Prior to this, the school and the Sta. Catalina Girl's Dormitory (now Sta. Catalina Ladies' Residence) were managed as one. In 1987, the administrative building was renovated into a four-storey building with a building with a gymnasium at top floor. It also provided adequate living quarters for the Dominican community. To meet the demand for better education, the administration and faculty members made various changes in the school curriculum. Aware of its responsibility as an agent for change, DS opted for the harder task of aiming at the emergence of a new Filipino, equipped with functional knowledge, desirable values, attitudes and habits and skills necessary to cope and creatively participate in the improvement of the quality of life for themselves and others. On October 14, 1996, the cornerstone for a three-storey building was laid. The Building was another way of upgrading the services offered by the school. This building housed the school canteen and other offices. More equipment and materials were procured for the use of the pupils and the staff. Academic programs were evaluated and revised. Assignments and teaching loads were also examined to find out whether the pupils were receiving the best instruction. Additional personnel for the library, guidance office, canteen and teaching staff were also hired. DS continues to improve its facilities, and its academic program inspired by St. Dominic and guided by their shared mission of promoting the integral formation of the youths. In School Year 2006-2007, DSM started operations for the secondary level in the newly constructed seven-story building. This is in response to the request of our parents and student who wanted to finish their education in their alma mater. True to its vision-mission of developing holistically the youths entrusted to our care, DSM Kept abreast campus training and seminar-workshops for Administrators, faculty and staff are conducted every year. In June 2010, DSM made the decision to adapt the Alternative Learning System Program to assist out-of-school youths who desire to finish Basic Education. By June 2015, the school was also able to support a number of Grade 7 Students through the ESC Voucher Program sponsored by the national government and the Fund for Assistance to Private Education (FAPE). DSM is also one of the schools, colleges and universities that opened its door to the Senior High School enrollees in 2016. These students were assisted by the Voucher Program of the Department of Education and the Fund for Assistance to Private Education (FAPE). As an institution committed to providing quality education, Dominican School Manila continues its journey in promoting Truth, Compassion and Love for learning among its community members and stakeholders. Its diligent and tireless pursuit towards academic excellence is now recognized through the accreditation granted to the institution by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges And universities (PAASCU).

St. Mary School closed in 2016. A new pastor, Fr Shawn Daly was appointed in 2016 to oversee the restructuring of the new Annunciation Parish, combining St. Mary Church with Holy Spirit Church in Newington. ==History== St. Mary Parish began as a portable, one-story chapel mission of St. Brigid Parish in Elmwood. Constructed in just two days, the chapel was able to accommodate only 200 parishioners at once. The chapel's first mass was celebrated on June 6, 1920 by Reverend William F. Odell. In 1924, Rev. Edward Shaughnessy, formerly a chaplain at Mount St. Joseph's Academy in Hartford, was assigned to the mission. Father Shaugnessy served the parish mission for six years until failing health forced him to retire in 1930. Throughout the 1920s, the town of Newington reflected the nationwide migration of families from the cities to the suburbs. Over the decade, the town's population jumped by 65%, spurring a rapid growth of Catholicism and the need for more spiritual guidance closer to home than the parish church in Elmwood. The rising population as well as the construction of a large Veteran's Hospital in Newington pushed Bishop John Nilan of the then Diocese of Hartford to acquire a site on Willard Avenue for the construction of a new parish church. The new Georgian-style structure would accommodate 450 worshippers, doubling the capacity of the old chapel. It was designed by Whiton & McMahon and constructed by Joseph Clark under the supervision of Rev. Francis Nolan, pastor of St. Justin Parish in Hartford. Upon its completion, it was dedicated by Bishop Nilan on 20 November 1935. The newly appointed pastor of the parish was to be Reverend George Clark, who began a number of ambitious construction plans upon being appointed in 1936. During his time as pastor, a new tower, choir loft, and bell tower were erected. Father Clark's crowning achievement was the construction of a nine-room convent in 1952. Just four years later, in December 1956, he died, yet he left Newington Catholics with their own parish church. Following Father Clark as pastor was Reverend Joseph F. Buckley, who had been appointed on 3 September 1955. Father Buckley quickly realized that the population of his parish was continuing to grow rapidly. He attributed this growth to the shift from agricultural to industrial employment in Newington and its surrounding suburbs. Determined to meet the needs of the expanding population once and for all, Father Buckley began a $225,000 capital building fund campaign in October 1955. Just over two years later, in December 1957, the parish had raised over $300,000 which would fund the parish's ten-year construction plan. First on Father Buckley's list of parish improvements were a parochial school and auditorium-gymnasium, both completed in 1958. The school could accommodate 450 students and was complete with ten classrooms, a library, a science room, and a medical room. In addition to the school, Father Buckley also oversaw the construction of a new convent of brick and limestone which would house the five Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur who would staff the newly constructed school. Both the school and the convent were dedicated on 2 November 1958 by Archbishop Henry J. O'Brien of the Archdiocese of Hartford. The school first opened in 1958 as a junior high school, serving 165 students in grades seven and eight.St. Mary School History In addition, 1,800 children of the parish participated in public Catholic instruction classes. Continued expansion allowed the addition of the ninth grade in 1959 and the sixth grade in 1961 with the next lowest grades added each year thereafter. By 1966, St. Mary School served children in all nine grades. Father Buckley next set his sights on a new rectory. The old rectory was first moved from Willard Avenue to a new site on Cedar Street, only to be replaced by a contemporary, two-story rectory in 1960. This rectory still serves the parish today and is complete with all the necessities of a contemporary parish. The last structure to be erected was a new church, one which would once and for all meet the needs of the parish. In 1965, Father Buckley began the last and most ambitious undertaking of his ten-year construction plan for the new church, hiring the distinguished young architect Richar Quinn of Russell, Gibson, von Dohlen Architects, AIA. Just two years later, on 2 April 1967, the new church was dedicated by Archbishop Henry J. O'Brien, who laid the cornerstone and blessed the new structure at 11:30 a.m. surrounded by 1,200 worshipers. In addition to Father Buckley, the now prosperous parish was staffed by Father John O'Connor, Father Leslie Fogarty, Father Joseph Sheehan, Father Nicholas Cesaro, and Father Martin Scholsky, some on a part-time basis. Father Buckley retired in 1970 due to his health, yet he had surely left his mark on the parish. What was once a tiny parish mission in 1920 had now grown into a full-fledged modern complex which would eventually encompass 26 acres and be valued at four million dollars — all in just over four decades. Today, Annunciation Parish, comprising both St. Mary Church and Church of the Holy Spirit, serve nearly 4,000 registered families in Newington, Connecticut. ==Bibliography== * ==Notes *Annunciation Parish, Official Website *St. Mary Church, Parish History *Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford Category:Roman Catholic churches in Connecticut Category:1924 establishments in Connecticut Category:Newington, Connecticut Category:Churches in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Roman Catholic parishes of Archdiocese of Hartford ","title":"St. Mary Parish (Newington, Connecticut)"},{"id":"35205938","text":"Engineering studies is an interdisciplinary branch of social sciences and humanities devoted to the study of engineers and their activities, often considered a part of science and technology studies (STS), and intersecting with and drawing from engineering education research. Studying engineers refers among other to the history and the sociology of their profession, its institutionalization and organization, the social composition and structure of the population of engineers, their training, their trajectory, etc. A subfield is for instance Women in engineering. Studying engineering refers to the study of engineering activities and practices, their knowledge and ontologies, their role into the society, their engagement. Engineering studies investigates how social, political, economical, cultural and historical dynamics affect technological research, design, engineering and innovation, and how these, in turn, affect society, economics, politics and culture. Engineering studies's mission is to further develop many different aspects of studies of engineers and engineering, it investigates in areas such as: history, culture, polity etc. These studies will have influence on world's engineering level and productivity.

The rector typically sits as chief executive and chair of the university board of trustees. He exercises policy-making as well as general academic, managerial, and religious functions over all university academic and non-academic staff. His term lasts for four years and he is qualified for re-election for two or more terms. In theory, the highest official of the University is the Chancellor, but his role is largely ceremonial and he does not exercise authority over the day-to-day operations of the University. The current Master of the Order of Preachers is the ex officio Chancellor of the University and the Head of the Dominican Province in the Philippines serves as his de facto vice. The incumbent rector is the Rev. Richard Ang, O.P. == Selection process ==  Eligibility  Since the establishment of UST in 1611, in order to serve as Rector Magnificus of the University, one must be: * a member of the Order of Preachers; * a professor; and * a holder of a Doctorate degree (Normally, and in most cases a sacred theology or canon law holder).  Election   Early years  During the early years of UST, the selection of new rector took place during the elective chapters meetings which were formally assembled in every two years. These board meetings were constituted by the different superiors of the Dominican houses throughout the Philippines. Among themselves, the heads of the Dominican convents then nominate their three candidates. The list of three candidates selected for rectorship is called a ternia. The ternia shall be then conveyed to the Master General in Rome for his approval once the provincial chapter has generated the list of nominees. The pontification of the during the eighteenth century was coded by the statute similar to that being used at the University of Mexico during that time.  Current method  Nowadays, a new rector is being selected by process of election. The outset of the election is the selection of three candidates for rectorship through a secret balloting among the members of Saint Thomas Aquinas Priory in UST. The group shall then communicate with the Vice-Grand Chancellor the list of candidates they had selected. Also the prior of the Dominicans in the Philippines, the Vice-Grand Chancellor will pass the list to the Academic Senate and to the Board of Trustees. Through this process, rank of preference for the candidates is being determined with their credentials and eligibility being evaluated. The Board of Trustees will then present decision and recommendations to the Vice-Grand Chancellor for dissemination to the Roman Curia, headed by the Master General. A candidate will be designated by the Master General, who requests the Congregation for Catholic Education in the Vatican City for the required confirmatio and, eventually, for the final approval of the nomination. Once nothing impedes the nomination (after conducting the usual procedures of inquiry regarding the candidate's merits and suitability), a pertinent rescript is issued by the Congregation for Catholic Education. This document is sent to the Master General of the Order of Preachers, who communicates the act to the competent authorities of the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas. This custom of electing rectors, which usually takes three to four months, was observed when UST was bestowed the title of \\"Pontifical University\\". This election method was first implemented as Fr. Manuel Arellano, O.P. was elected rector of the University in 1923.  Tenure  Although records show that tenures lasted two years during the 1600s to the 1800s, the term of office for the University's is four years. He is eligible for re-election for two or more terms.  Vacancy  Vacancies in the office of the rector may arise under several possible circumstances: death and resignation. As stated in Article 11 of the General Statutes of UST, an acting assignment applies to a vacant position by which the Vice-Rector of the University de facto assumes the acting post until the duly appointment of a new . == Regalia ==  Collar  The collar of the rector signifies the joint powers of the Holy See and the Philippine Government, which collaborate to sustain this historic University. It is also symbolic of the supreme teaching authority of the rector as a professor of the University. The collar was first used during the installation of the first Filipino rector, Archbishop Leonardo Legaspi, O.P., S.Th.D., in 1971.  Maces  The two maces symbolize the spiritual and temporal powers of the as the highest authority of the University. Made of pure silver and measuring 95 x 15 centimetres in diameter, the maces have existed since the 17th century and has been used in academic processions ever since. Candidates for doctoral degrees were accompanied by the Rector in a parade called Paseo de los Doctores from Intramuros to Santo Domingo Church, where University commencement exercises were held until the 17th century. Today, members of the Academic Senate hold processions at the opening of each academic year and during solemn investitures in academic gowns, following the style of Spanish academic regalia. The maces are borne by bedeles (mace-bearers) and are included in the parade for their academic symbolism. == List of rectores magnifici == Since its foundation in 1611, the University of Santo Tomas has been under the leadership of 110 rectors including acting rectors and double term service. Thirteen of which are rectors prior to its conversion to university status in 1645, and the remaining 97 are university rectors. Fr. Domingo González, O.P. was the first college rector while Fr. Martin Real de la Cruz, O.P. served as the first university rector and chancellor. The university had acting rectors, whose service lasted for at least one academic year, have been appointed as afterwards, namely: Fr. Francisco Gómez (1714–1716), Fr. Juan Álvarez (1722–1723), Fr. Eugenio Jordan (1944–1948), and Fr. Rolando de la Rosa (2008–2012). The rector who served the longest term, but not necessarily consecutively, was also the first rector of the then Colegio de Nuestra Señora del Santísimo Rosario, Fr. Domingo González, O.P. He served for four terms, for a total of 15 years. The second longest term, though not consecutively, was held by Fr. Rolando de la Rosa, O.P. who served from 1990 to 1998, and from 2007 to 2012 for a total of 13 years. Meanwhile, it was Fr. Francisco Ayala, O.P. who served the longest consecutive term, his rectorship having lasted for 12 years, from 1829 to 1841. ; Color key: : – Rector without double term service but served for two or more terms : – Rector with double term service and served for three or more terms : – Rector with double term service only : – Acting rector : – Served for nth term {  style=\\"font-size: 100%; text-align:center;\\" ! width=\\"30px\\"# !!

To decide the case, a three-judge panel was appointed by Mary Beck Briscoe, the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit: Briscoe appointed herself, along with two judges from the District Court for Kansas: Chief District Judge Kathryn Hoefer Vratil, and District Judge John Watson Lungstrum. According to the Court: > While legislators publicly demurred that they had done the best they could, > the impasse resulted from a bitter ideological feud--largely over new Senate > districts. The feud primarily pitted GOP moderates against their more > conservative GOP colleagues. Failing consensus, the process degenerated into > blatant efforts to gerrymander various districts for ideological political > advantage and to serve the political ambitions of various legislators. Once redistricting was finalized in federal court, primary elections were held on August 7, 2012. ==District 1== The redrawn 1st district will continue to encompass all or parts of 62 counties in western and central Kansas, and also taking in a sliver of the Flint Hills region. The district will now also include Pottawatomie and Riley counties, including Manhattan and Kansas State University, but will no longer include Barber, Comanche, Edwards, Kiowa, Pratt, and Stafford counties, and parts of Greenwood, Marshall, Nemaha, and Pawnee counties. Republican Tim Huelskamp, who has represented the 1st district since 2011, is running for re-election. Huelskamp is running without challengers from any party. Republican primary Primary results General election Results ==District 2== The redrawn 2nd district will continue to encompass Allen, Anderson, Atchison, Bourbon, Brown, Cherokee, Coffey, Crawford, Doniphan, Franklin, Jackson, Jefferson, Labette, Leavenworth, Linn, Neosho, Osage, Shawnee, Wilson, and Woodson, and parts of Douglas, Miami, and Nemaha counties. The district will now also include Montgomery County, parts of Marshall County, and the remainder of Douglas and Nemaha counties, but will no longer include Pottawatomie, Riley, and parts of Miami counties. The district lost Kansas State University to the first district, but gained the state's other major college, the University of Kansas. Republican Lynn Jenkins, who has represented the 2nd district since 2009, is running for re-election.

After Angelini's death in 1731, the work, including the Rococo facade, ornamented with Istrian marble, continued by 1741 under Alfonso Torreggiani. He designed the palaces ornate and peculiar Rococo windows with almost undulating arches superiorly. The palace lacks the typical porticos seen in older Bolognes palaces. One house over on Via Galliera 4, the Palazzo Torfanini has a Renaissance architecture ground arcade, but a piano nobile refurbished with windows by the same architect Torreggiani. Further down the street on Via Galliera 10 is the church of Santa Maria Maggiore. The cardinal's once large art collection mainly made its way to the National Gallery of London. The library was dispersed by the middle of the 19th century. In the 19th century the Aldrovandi family had a majolica factory in a section of the palace.

He inherited Tianxiong Circuit (天雄, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) from his grandfather Luo Hongxin and father Luo Shaowei, who controlled Tianxiong in a semi-independent manner late in Later Liang's predecessor state Tang Dynasty as military governor (Jiedushi). Luo Zhouhan, however, was in a position of weakness due to his young age after inheriting the circuit, and soon, the Later Liang general Yang Shihou, who had coveted Tianxiong, forcibly seized it. Luo was transferred to Xuanyi Circuit (宣義, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) and died there shortly after. == Background == It is not known which year Luo Zhouhan was born — although, as referred to below, he died some time from 913 to 915 at the age of 13, so he must have been born sometime between 900 and 902.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 39. His grandfather Luo Hongxin had taken over Tianxiong Circuit, then also known as Weibo Circuit (), late in the Tang Dynasty after a successful rebellion against then-ruling military governor Le Yanzhen. His father Luo Shaowei would later inherit the circuit and become a reliable ally of the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered, in modern Kaifeng, Henan), allowing the Luo family to safely hold Tianxiong after Zhu seized the Tang throne and started a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 14. Luo Zhouhan had one older brother, Luo Tinggui (), who died early, and two younger brothers, Luo Zhoujing () and Luo Zhouyin (). In 909, Luo Shaowei, who then held the title of Prince of Ye, suffered a paralysis to his limb(s). He wrote Later Liang's Emperor Taizong, in an explicit offer to surrender physical control of the circuit:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. Emperor Taizu was touched, and, while appreciative of Luo's offer, commissioned Luo Zhouhan as the deputy military governor and put Luo Zhouhan in temporary command, stating to Luo Shaowei's messenger: Luo Shaowei did not recover, however, and died in 910. Emperor Taizu made Luo Zhouhan acting military governor, and full military governor in 911.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. Concerned that Luo Zhouhan was too young and his officers too independent to control against an attack by Later Liang's northern rival Jin, Emperor Taizu temporarily assigned the official Li Zhen to Tianxiong as its deputy military governor and also sent the officer Du Tingyin () to Tianxiong's capital Wei Prefecture () to assist Luo and Li in defending the city. == As military governor of Tianxiong and Xuanyi == As Wei Prefecture remained the most important city north of the Yellow River still in Later Liang hands against the expansion of Jin's prince Li Cunxu, the Later Liang major general Yang Shihou was eventually stationed there, too, to defend it. He was impressed by its wealth and wanted to take Tianxiong for himself, but was apprehensive of Emperor Taizu's strictness toward generals, and therefore did not dare to do so. In 912, however, Emperor Taizu was assassinated by his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying, who then took the throne. Yang took this opportunity to take action. He summoned the Tianxiong officer Pan Yan (), who had been the key decision maker at Tianxiong headquarters due to Luo Zhouhan's youthfulness, and then killed Pan at the meeting. He then entered the headquarters and took over. Zhu Yougui, then new to the throne, did not dare to act against Yang, and instead made Yang the military governor of Tianxiong. Luo was moved to Xuanyi Circuit (which Yang had been the military governor of) to serve as its military governor. Luo was said to have died shortly after while still serving as the military governor of Xuanyi — but the year was not completely clear. He was still alive in 913, when Zhu Yougui's younger brother Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun instigated a countercoup and took over the throne himself, because he married Zhu Zhen's daughter Princess Shouchun and was referred to in an edict later in 913 in which he was given, inter alia, the title of Fuma Duwei (), a title common to princesses' husbands.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 8. However, he must die in 914, as the epitaph of his younger brother Luo Zhoujing indicted. == Notes and references == * History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 14. * New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 39. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 267, 268.

Of the original regiment, only the 1st Battalion remains an active National Guard unit. As of 2018, the 1st Battalion, 138th Infantry Regiment is a light infantry battalion currently assigned to the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. ==History== The 138th Infantry Regiment traces its lineage from the St. Louis Greys, a volunteer militia company organized in 1832 and the first militia regiment of Missouri. The company's first combat action was during the Mexican War while serving with the St. Louis Legion, a battalion-sized element composed of independent St. Louis-area companies. The unit mustered into federal service on 18 May 1846 along with the Native American Rangers, Boone Guards, Montgomery Guards, Missouri Fusiliers and Riflemen, Morgan Riflemen, and the Texas Free Corps. By 1853 the Greys expanded to five companies to form the 1st Battalion, 1st Missouri Regiment but underwent a series of reductions until 1857 when all but one company of Greys remained. During the Missouri- Kansas border crises in 1860, the First Missouri Infantry Regiment (of which the Greys were a part along with several other St. Louis area militia companies), patrolled the border to prevent Free-Stater (Kansas) settlers from entering the state, an action called the Southwest Expedition. Civil War Many of the Greys ignored President Lincoln's issued proclamation for the states to call up their militia and provide troops to the Federal Government to suppress the Rebellion after the bombardment of Fort Sumter and mustered into service at the call of Governor Jackson outside of St. Louis at Camp Jackson, where St. Louis University now sets. Accused of plotting to capture the St. Louis Arsenal as part of the Camp Jackson Affair, now the location of the Budweiser Brewery, the 1st Missouri Volunteer Militia, with its two companies of St. Louis Greys, were captured by Union troops and marched to the arsenal. Upon being paroled, the Greys and the remainder of the old First Missouri broke their parole and were reformed into the Missouri State Guard. They then went to Memphis, Tennessee and created a Confederate regiment known as the 1st Missouri Infantry Regiment, 1st Missouri Brigade, otherwise known as the “Camp Jackson Boys” and was commanded by Col. John S. Bowen. With casualties came amalgamation, and after fighting in the Shiloh, Mississippi River, Vicksburg, Atlanta, Nashville, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama campaigns, the 1st Missouri surrendered at Fort Blakely, Alabama on 9 April 1865. The 1st Missouri Infantry Regiment marched on foot more than 4,000 miles and traveled more than 1,500 miles by railroad and streamboat during their 40 month journey across seven states on both sides of the Mississippi. It was also a part of the best drilled and finest combat unit of the Confederate States Army and one of the most elite units in the entire Civil War, the 1st Missouri Brigade \\"the South's Finest\\".Tucker, Phillip T.

Smith let the bookkeeper resign, did not disclose the theft, and charged the loss against the bank's surplus.

He became personal secretary to King Alfonso XII of Spain in 1875. He became a highly admired figure in artistic circles of late nineteenth century Madrid, and for his service to the Crown of Spain. He was a friend of Isaac Albéniz, who he arranged a grant for to study at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. He served as director of the Royal Concert Society at the Teatro Real in Madrid until 1891. ==Biography== Born in Madrid on February 29, 1836, he was of Irish descent, son of Joseph Morphy. He spent his childhood traveling through France, Italy and Germany, among other countries, where he had a European renaissance education becoming a lover of art and literature. He lived for two years in Germany between 1846 and 1848. In 1858, he took over his father's law firm. In 1863 he took classes under the composer François- Joseph Fétis in Brussels. When he returned he entered the Royal Palace of Madrid on November 28, 1863 as a gentleman of the then Prince of Asturias and future King Alfonso XII of Spain, a position he held until the Revolution in 1868 that overthrew Isabel II. He moved to France to engage in musicology, and during the Franco-Prussian War he traveled to Vienna to be with Prince Alfonso. There he composed the opera Lizzie and other orchestral parts. On the Bourbon Restoration, he returned to Spain with the King, who appointed him his personal secretary on January 18, 1875 and granted him the title Count Morphy on May 3, 1882. He published several studies and translated into Spanish a biography of Beethoven, and in 1892 entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando. He also served as director of the Royal Concert Society at the Teatro Real in Madrid until 1891. Morphy was also an acquaintance and benefactor of several notable musicians of the time, such as Tomás Bretón, Pablo Casals and Isaac Albéniz. The count was a close friend of Albéniz in particular and was highly enthusiastic towards his talent, and it was Morphy who arranged for a grant for him to study at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. Morphy also arranged for violinist Enrique Fernández Arbós to study under Henri Vieuxtemps in Brussels. Albéniz dedicated his composition Sevilla to Count Morphy's wife when he premiered in a piano performance in Paris on January 24, 1886. In late 1883, a number of musicians, led by Count Morphy, sharing the same concerns regarding the regeneration of Spanish art, gathered together in a society in Madrid to found the Philharmonic Institute with the aim of offering musical training at the same level as other European centres. The regenerative nature of their educational project, compared to the teachings of the Conservatory of Madrid, is highlighted. In particular, the bel canto school run by Napoleón Verger helped to improve the standard of singing in Spain and to endow opera stages with renowned figures, thus paving the way for the establishment of Spanish lyric drama. From 1886 to 1895, the Count of Morphy assumed a leading role as president of the Fine Arts section, he engaged with the activities of the society by giving lectures and by introducing the Ateneo to his own aesthetic principles, including his regenerationist agenda and his musical nationalism. He also extended invitations to some of the most relevant international figures and to a young generation of Spanish artists, with the intention of bringing the public closer to the European cultural scene. The Ateneo experienced a period of splendor with a new impulse in vocal, instrumental and chamber music, and a renewed repertoire with contemporary works by Spanish and Central European composers ==Bibliography== ;Notes ;References * * \\\\- Total pages: 256 * \\\\- Total pages: 360 * \\\\- Total pages: 488 Category:1836 births Category:1899 deaths Category:People from Madrid Category:Counts of Spain Category:Musicologists Category:Spanish composers Category:Spanish male composers Category:Spanish music critics Category:Spanish music educators Category:Spanish politicians Category:Spanish people of Irish descent Category:19th-century journalists Category:Male journalists Category:19th- century composers Category:19th-century male writers ","title":"Guillermo Morphy"},{"id":"35206157","text":"Makwane is a village in Thabo Mofutsanyane District Municipality in the Free State province of South Africa.

It is situated near Llanrwst. ==History== A Cistercian community was founded at Rhedynog Felen near Caernarfon in 1186 by a group of monks from Strata Florida Abbey. In 1190/91, they moved to Conwy, establishing Aberconwy Abbey, and in 1283, they transferred to Maenan after a forced move by order of Edward I, this abbey's founder, who had decided to build a castle on the site of the monks' former home at Aberconway. The Abbey was dedicated to Saint Mary and All Saints. The abbey at Maenan continued to exist until c.1538, when it was suppressed as part of Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries. At this point, the abbey's revenue was valued at £179 10s. 10d. In 1563, the site of the abbey was given to Elizeus Wynne, who was also granted the township of Maenan itself. Wynne demolished many of the abbey's buildings, and used the materials to construct a new mansion on the site. Reused materials from the abbey were also incorporated in Gwydir Castle. The stone coffin of Prince Llewelyn the Great was moved from the abbey to the Gwydir Chapel at the church in Llanrwst. Only a small arch remains of the original edifice, which was described in Samuel Lewis' topographical dictionary as \\"remarkable for the pleasantness of its situation and the beauty of its architecture\\". In 1885, the Cambrian Archaeological Association noted discrepancies regarding the subsequent history of the Maenan Abbey estate: The grounds were excavated in 1963. In modern times, the site was developed into the Maenan Abbey Hotel. In 2011, three medieval walls were found in the grounds at Maenan Abbey Hotel while workmen were working on the drainage. They are believed to be the cloister walls, about 6 ft thick, dated to 1282. Cadw visited the site to assess the excavations. ==References * Official website Category:Llanddoged and Maenan Category:1530s disestablishments in Wales Category:Cistercian monasteries in Wales Category:Hotels in Conwy County Borough Category:Medieval Wales Category:Christian monasteries established in the 13th century Category:Monasteries dissolved under the English Reformation ","title":"Maenan Abbey"},{"id":"35206239","text":"Chance Warmack (born September 14, 1991) is an American football guard for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL).

The lyrics are inspired by Leck mich im Arsch, a scatological canon by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (K. 231/382c), while the music is based on a canon called Leck mir den Arsch fein recht schön sauber (K. 233/382d). The latter has for two centuries been attributed to Mozart but evidence has shown that the music of the piece was composed by Wenzel Trnka and Mozart merely replaced the original lyrics with his own. ==Background== In August 2011, Insane Clown Posse was contacted by Jack White, who invited Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler to his mansion, because he wanted to collaborate with them. White played the track he was working on, an arrangement of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's \\"Leck mich im Arsch\\" with live instrumentation by JEFF the Brotherhood, for Bruce and Utsler and explained that the title of the track translated to \\"Lick My Ass\\". Insane Clown Posse were surprised that White wanted to work with them, and said that they had respect for White, who is also from Detroit. Violent J said, \\"The most respected musician in the world and one of the most hated musicians in the world. We didn't expect that call, brother. I told him, 'I gotta know—why us?'. He said, 'I find myself going to your web site and looking at it. Some stuff I think is genius, some stuff I don't understand at all, but I always find myself going back there and seeing what you're up to.\\" ==Song information== Bruce perceived that the scatological nature of the composition was the reason why White asked Bruce and Utsler to appear on the song, but once White explained Mozart's sense of humor, they became excited to work on it. Insane Clown Posse went back to their hotel room to write their lyrics, and returned to record with White and JEFF the Brotherhood in White's home recording studio. Bruce and Utsler's vocals were recorded in one take. Insane Clown Posse said that the song was a collaboration and that White asked them for their feedback throughout the recording process. The song was released as a single on September 13, 2011 by White's label Third Man Records. ==References== Category:German profanity Category:2011 singles Category:Songs about buttocks Category:Insane Clown Posse songs Category:Songs written by Jack White Category:Jack White songs Category:2011 songs Category:Off-color humor Category:Third Man Records singles Category:Works about feces ","title":"Leck mich im Arsch (Insane Clown Posse song)"},{"id":"35206296","text":"Nkowankowa is a township in the Greater Tzaneen Local Municipality of the Mopani District Municipality in the Limpopo province of South Africa.

Before Waterval, next to Elim Hospital was developed, Tiyani used to housed the Hlanganani Regional court and the Hlanganani Police station. Today it houses the second Magistrate court in the former Hlanganani district, the New Tiyani Magistrate court, which was inaugurated in 2016 by the deputy minister of Justice and Constitutional development, Mr John Jeffrey and replaced the now defunct Tiyani branch court, which was established in 1960.The Tiyani Branch Court was, for a short period (between 1982 and 2015), an outpost of Hlanganani Regional Court in Waterval, Elim. The Hlanganani Police station has remained at Tiyani, while the new Waterval Police Station, together with Hlanganani Regional court were established by the Gazankulu Administration at Waterval township in 1980, next to Elim Hospital. Officially the place is known as Tiyani, but the area is popularly known (by both the Venda and Shangaan people) as Magoro and was named after a Venda Chief Magoro, who occupied the area before the Tsonga people arrived. The Tsonga people arrived here as refugees from Mozambique during the wars of Manukosi, also known as Soshangane. Forced removal of Venda people took place during the 1960s when Tiyani was declared a Tsonga area and incorporated into Gazankulu homeland. Magoro was also a site where a group of 60 Boer commandos, directed by Joao Albasini and Head chief of VaTsonga, Chief General Nwa-Manugu (the Commander in chief of Joao ), attacked its people, massacred more than 300 people and killed Chief Magoro's son. The military campaign was carried out because chief Magoro had refused to pay tax levied by Joao Albasini and his continued support for King Makhado. ==Borders of Tiyani== Tiyani is bordered by Middle Letaba River on the south, Ntsuxi Village on the East, Ribungwani Village on the North, Masakona Village on the North West, Mamaila on the West and Olifantshoek (Holofani) on the South West. ==Sections of Tiyani== Tiyani consist of different Chiefdom's who were placed on the area after the removal of Magoro. These are Chief Xihimu, Chief Mdono, Chief Manghove, Chief Mangurwani and Chief Nkanyani. The names of the original sections are derived from the Chiefs name based on their section of settlement. Second generation sections were created with people from different chiefs depending on which Chief granted permission for the stand the stand owner will be a subject of that particular chief. The Second generation sections are Vata Fika, Tsema ra ha vona(pass-over before the sun sets,ghosts), Russia, Manyunyu, Hluvula Baji and Wisa Galaza. Education Facilities There are a number of pre-school centres. Five Primary Schools are based at Tiyani namely: Goza Primary School; Kulani Primary School; Vulani Primary School, Vungela Primary School and Nkanyani Primary School. Secondary Education is catered for by Four schools namely: Akani High School, Mahlorhi High School, Tiyani Secondary School and N'wamalobye High School. ==Health Facilities== Two health facilities are available to service the community, a clinic in the eastern side at Xihimu Section and a Main Health center (to be formally named after the late Nurse Betty Nkanyani Hospital )on the western side.

It is found in northern and central Europe, parts of Asia,Archer, Michael E. (1997, July 31). TAXONOMY, DISTRIBUTION AND NESTING BIOLOGY OF THE SPECIES OF THE EURO-ASIAN VESPULA RUFA GROUP (HYM., VESPINAE). ENTOMOLOGISTS MONTHLY MAGAZINE, 133.

Vespula rufa is characterised by red-brown markings and body segmentation, with the appearance varying amongst the different roles of individuals in the species. These wasps build small nests in dry banks underground that are not far below the surface. The colony cycle begins in the fall. Vespula rufa feed on live insects. One interesting fact about Vespula rufa is that the queen policing occurs in the species, and that worker policing occurs at much lower rates than other species in the genus Vespula.Wenseleers, T., Badcock, N., S., Erven, K., Tofilski, A., Nascimento, F., S., Hart, A., G., Burke, T., A., Archer, M., E., & Ratnieks, F., L., W.

Evolution, 59 (6), 1306-1314. https://www.jstor.org/stable/344890 There are predators and parasites of the species. The species goes through a series of events before leaving the nest. ==Taxonomy and phylogeny== Vespula rufa is a member of the genus Vespula. Within the genus, this species is most closely related to Vespula squamosa. Other species in Vespula include V. germanica, V. maculifrons, and V. vulgaris. Outside of the genus, Dolichovespula is the next most closely related genus. The northern red-banded yellowjacket was referred to as V. intermedia in North America. This differs from typical Red Wasps, V. rufa, of the western Palearctic that have ivory rather than yellow markings. Eastern Palaearctic populations also have ivory markings and this form has been called V. rufa schrenckii. Due to the variability of the brownish markings, which can be seen from specimens throughout its range, V. intermedia has become equivalent to V. rufa schrenckii. However, pale-marked populations also occur within the range of the V. rufa in Scandinavia and Central Asia.Kimsey, L. S. (2012). The Vespinae of North America (Vespidae, Hymenoptera). Journal of Hymenoptera research, 28, 51-53. There are various wasps within the ‘subspecies’ of V. rufa, including Vespula acadica, however they are now viewed as little more than colour forms rather than formal taxa, and the species is regarded as monotypic. More recently, it has been proposed that V. rufa is a Palearctic species and that the name Vespula intermedia be resurrected for the Nearctic species, this name was originally coined as V.r. var intermedia by du Buysson in 1905. Red wasp queen on a log ==Description and identification==  Morphology  V. rufa can be distinguished by its reddish-brown markings on the back.Buck, Matthias, Marshall, Stephen, A., and Cheung, David, K.,B. (2008, February 18). Identification Atlas of the Vespidae (Hymenoptera, Aculeata) of the northeastern Nearctic region. Retrieved from http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/bsc/ejournal/bmc_05/95v_rufa.html Specimens of this species with reduced spots on the abdomen have tissue that is segmented into three parts and four “anteriorly directed lobes.” Duncan, Carl, D. (1939, February 1). A Contribution to the Biology of North American Vespine Wasps. Stanford University, California: Stanford University Press There are three main types of colour patterns in the species. V. rufa lack the long, yellow lines that V. squamosa and V. sulphurea have. Workers and queens differ in their colour patterns. While the basic colour scheme appears to be the same in workers and queens, there are some slight differences. Workers have more expansive black colour and less yellow or white than queens. That is, the queens have a greater display of yellow colour than the workers. In the workers, the yellow tissue of the abdominal segment is thin and triply divided, while the yellow tissue segments in the queen are larger. In queens lateral divisions become black spots. However, this is not always the case as often workers have divisions replaced by black spots, and queens occasionally have the less patterned appearance characteristic of workers. The differences in colour pattern correspond to the size, with more coloured workers being more likely to be large and less coloured ones more likely to be small. Workers have the smallest fore wing length (10.0-11.0 mm), followed by males (11.0-12.0 mm), and females have the longest fore wings (12.5-13.0 mm).  Nests  Nests are typically composed “of one comb of small worker cells and up to three combs of larger cells used for rearing males and queens, surrounded by multiple layers of envelope”. The nests (investigated in Archer’s experiment) were small with a mean of 57 workers, as cited in “A Test of Worker Policing Theory in an Advanced Eusocial Wasp, Vespula rufa.” However, mature colonies can have as many as 282 workers. The nests are generally found in dry banks underground but close to the surface. Subterranean nests have nest cavities just below the surface or just beneath the layer of moss. There are also nests that are positioned in the stumps of old, hollow trees, as well as nests that are hanging from the roots of trees. In a group of 19 subterranean nests the average depth of such nests was 2.9 centimeters. On rare occasions, aerial nests can be spotted in dense bushes. Aerial nests can exist \\"in a cavity ...or covered above.\\" facial pattern ==Distribution and habitat== V. rufa can be found in the “Palearctic” and in the northern parts of North America. Examples of locations with V. rufa include England, Ireland, the Netherlands, Russia, Turkey, Mongolia, and China. In general, this species builds its nests below ground, often in cavities or along the underside of a roof. V. rufa nests are generally found underground near the surface of dry banks. Nests are made using mineral soil and leaf litter in a shaded environment. Old tree remains and tree roots can also be utilised to make nests. V. rufa is a common wasp species. ==Colony cycle== The lifecycle of a V. rufa colony begins in the fall as queens leave their home colony and, after fertilization, enter over-wintering sites. In early spring the queens emerge from hibernation to look for a nesting cavity. The nest is usually constructed underground in an abandoned rodent burrow or similar cavity, more rarely in cavities above ground (hollow stumps, wall cavities, and bird boxes), under moss, in dense bushes, under eaves of houses or in attics. The queen commences the process by building the \\"queen nest\\" and raising the first workers, such that these workers can begin to forage, engage in \\"nest-building and brood rearing activities,\\" rather than the queen. In the meantime, the queen can lay eggs. The queens and workers overlap in foraging for at least two days in \\"one colony and three days in another.\\" The burden of feeding the larvae and enlarging the nest is on the workers. Colony expansion continue rapidly, with thousands of workers being produced in a large nest in approximately a 9-week period.Edwards, Robin. (1980). Social Wasps: Their Biology and Control. W. Sussex, Great Britain: Rentokil Limited. Eggs, that are laid in the cells, hatch to become larvae. When the last larval stage is near its end, \\"the gut contents are evacuated to form the meconium at the bottom of the cell.\\" The larva spins a cocoon, thereby entering the pupal stage. Workers and the majority of males are reared in the first cells, which are small with a diameter for approximately 4 mm. Large cells of about 6 mm in diameter are constructed later in the season and queens and a few males are reared in these cells. Because queens and males, but not workers, were observed in a few frigid regions, Birula asserts that workers are not reared in extremely cold areas and that only queens and males are reared in such environments. Once the new males and queens leave the colony, workers slowly die out and the colony ceases to exist. Founded in spring and dying out in August, nests have a short annual cycle. The nest of the Red Wasp is relatively small with a diameter which rarely exceeds 20 cm. It is made from paper produced by chewing old and weathered, but dry wood. ==Worker-queen conflict == It is common for a conflict to exist between individuals in social groups as they often have different goals, which spurs conflict. Through evolution, mechanisms to encourage group effectiveness and minimise individual's selfish interests have evolved. Social policing is an important example in which \\"mutual enforcement limits the success of selfish individuals.\\" Differences in objectives for queens and workers bees can be attributed to differences in relatedness between them. Worker policing is a consequence of this difference.  Differences in relatedness  Although workers are generally unable to mate, they have functional ovaries that allow them to lay eggs. Because these eggs are not fertilised, they would become male wasps. Workers would want to produce such wasps as they would be more closely related to their own sons than to their mothers' sons, or brothers. However, it is not in the queens best interest for workers to produce offspring. This is because a queen would be more closely related to her own offspring (r=1/2) than to her offspring's sons (r=1/4). When the queen mates with many males, workers are more closely related to their brothers (queens' sons) since r=0.25, than to the sons of other workers since r<0.25 for half- nephews and nephews). The differences in relatedness of offspring between workers and queens represents a conflict of interest between workers and queens, as both workers and queens want to maximise the survival of the offspring more closely related to themselves, according to the selfish gene perspective.  Worker Policing  With regard to conflict over who bears males, policing refers to the process in which individual workers are precluded from reproducing. Policing can be carried out by the queen or by workers. Two different approaches can be taken to achieve policing: worker- laid eggs can be eliminated or reproductive workers can be treated aggressively. According to kin selection theory, queens should carry out policing because queens are closer relatives to their own sons than to their workers' sons - that is their daughters' sons. When queens mate with multiple males, workers should police because workers are generally closer relatives of the queen's sons than to the workers' sons. Vespula rufa has much lower rates of worker policing than other species in its genus. Moreover, the queen polices a substantial percentage of worker-laid eggs in the species. == Interactions with other species==  Parasites  Parasites of Vespula rufa include the beetle Metoecus paradoxus (a larval parasitoid and the fly Conops flavipes (an endoparasite). The larvae of Volucella pellucens (a hoverfly) act as scavengers. Vespula austriaca is an obligate social parasite on V. rufa in Europe and Asia.\\" Because of its parasitic behaviour, V. austriaca does not produce workers, but relies on the host workers for rearing. The queen of V. austriaca invades the V. rufa host colony, and drives away the V. rufa queen.  Predators  Badgers (Meles meles) destroy Vespula rufa nests, consuming the occupants, combs, and envelope. The wasps stings don't threaten badgers as thick skin and body hair protect them from stings. Great tits (Parus major) are also predators of V. rufa, digging their nests out of cavities. The larvae of Volucella pellucens (a hoverfly) act as scavengers. == Leaving the nest == There are many factors affecting whether worker wasps will leave the nest. Important considerations include temperature, light intensity, and the existence of other wasps. Relative humidity and atmospheric pressure do not affect V. rufa's decision of whether or not to leave the nest. Orientation flights occur so that V. rufa can familiarise themselves with the entrance to their nest and recognise it when they return. By removing roadblocks, V. rufa would be able to enter and exit more smoothly.  Light intensity  The amount of light present in the morning or evening is most critical element affecting wasp movement. In the evening, light intensity plays a key role in determining the time that the last movements to and from the nest occur. For V. rufa, the minimum value for sorties to leave the nest in the morning is 4.0 lux or 0.37 ft cs. The amount of light required for the last sorties to return to the nest is 6.0 lux or 0.56 ft cs. The level is related to the compound eye length, 2.4 mm in this species. For comparison Vespa crabro (the European Hornet) has a much larger body and thus a greater eye length of 3.7mm enabling it to forage in moonlight at 0.2 lux.  Temperature  If the temperature is too low, then wasps will not leave the nest. There has not been sufficient research on this topic, but the current research suggests very different temperatures for different species.  Presence of other wasps  Whether there is another wasp present at the exit to the nest will affect V. rufa decision about leaving the nest. For V. rufa, \\"five wasps must be present to act as a 'releaser' for foraging.\\" Only when there are insufficient insects in the nest entrance can wasps passing in the opposite direction serve as releasers. This phenomenon of \\"social facilitation\\" means that V. rufa leave nests in clusters rather than in a continuous trickle. The releaser behaviour pattern of V. rufa is more readily noticeable than that of other British species.  Orientation flights  When a young worker leaves the nest for the first time, it will generally make 2 to 3 'orientation flights' in order to familiarise itself with the entrance to the colony amidst the surrounding landscape. In the first flight, the worker flies approximately 25 cm out of the nest at once and then quickly turns around to face the entrance. The wasp slowly flies back and forth to the nest several times, surveying an angle that is approximately 90 degrees, while facing the entrance. Then, the wasp promptly returns to the nest, the whole flight lasting only about one minute or less. Soon after returning from the first flight, the wasp will leave the nest in a similar fashion, but this time ventures out approximately 15 to 20 meters and covers an angle of approximately 280 degrees. Once 2 meters away, V. rufa will fly back and forth repeatedly in a figure-eight pattern, while facing the entrance to the nest. In some cases, after this second flight the wasp will have gathered all of the knowledge necessary to fly off. Other wasps must make a third orientation flight that is like the second one. At first, the worker may miss the entrance to the nest many times; however, after six to twelve trips, the wasp gains its bearings; flights become longer, and reentry into the colony becomes more precise. ==References== Category:Insects described in 1758 Category:Vespidae Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Vespula rufa"},{"id":"35206310","text":"Vuwani is a town in Vhembe District Municipality in the Limpopo province of South Africa. == Demarcation dispute == In 2015, the Municipal Demarcation Board decided to excise Mashau and Masakona settlements from Makhado, and merge them with the Malamulele, Tshikonelo, Mulenzhe, Pietboy, and Khakhanwa areas of the Thulamela Local Municipality in order to create a new municipality.

Clifton (February 5, 1924 – September 14, 2003) was an American psychologist, educator, author, researcher, and entrepreneur. He founded Selection Research, Inc., which later acquired Gallup Inc., where he became chairman, and developed CliftonStrengths, Gallup's online psychological assessment. Clifton was recognized with a presidential commendation from the American Psychological Association as \\"the father of strengths-based psychology and the grandfather of positive psychology\\". == Early life and education == Clifton was born in Butte, Nebraska, in 1924. He attended University of Nebraska–Lincoln, earning a degree in mathematics and two in educational psychology. Later in life, Clifton received honorary doctorates in humane letters (1990) and laws (2001) from University of Nebraska and Azusa Pacific University, respectively. Clifton joined the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, where he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross. == Career == Clifton taught and researched educational psychology at University of Nebraska–Lincoln from 1950 to 1969. During this time, Clifton researched university tutors to study talent and what distinguished talented people from others. According to Clifton, psychologists typically studied what was wrong with people, not why they excelled. He also identified that successful people had certain personal attributes that benefited them in their work. When Clifton left the university, he founded Selection Research Inc. (SRI) in Lincoln, Nebraska, helping private and public entities with employee selection. Clifton's firm SRI acquired Gallup in 1988 and Clifton became chairman. Under Clifton, Gallup expanded beyond public opinion polls, entering the management consulting business. Gallup consulted with companies on ways to improve their businesses by homing in on their employees' strengths. In 1999, Clifton created the online assessment tool Clifton StrengthsFinder (now known as CliftonStrengths) that focuses on 34 themes that make up the user's personality. He co-authored the 2001 book Now, Discover Your Strengths with Marcus Buckingham, offering advice on determining employees' strengths and using those qualities for success at work. In 2007, the book was updated by Tom Rath and called StrengthsFinder 2.0, which is among Amazon's 20 bestselling books of all-time. Gallup's books helped grow the company's consulting division's revenue from $2 million in 1998 to $50 million in 2001. In 2002, the American Psychological Association honored Clifton with a lifetime achievement award as \\"the father of strengths-based psychology and the grandfather of positive psychology\\". After retiring as chairman of Gallup, Clifton was chairman of Gallup's International Research and Education Center and senior archivist of its World Leader Study. Following his death, Gallup and the Clifton Foundation donated $30 million to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln to create the Don Clifton Strengths Institute, focusing on early identification and development of future entrepreneurs. ==Published works== *Soar with Your Strengths with Paula Nelson, .

According to his biographer, Shams-ud-din's major contribution was his support of strong anti-Ahmadiyya feelings among Muslims at the risk and sacrifice of his life.Rujl-u-Rashid by Mauluana Zahid Al-Rashidi == Early life and education == He was born on 4 May 1944 (21 Jumada al-awwal 1364 AH) in Balkh Province of Afghanistan to a family of religious scholars. His father Muhammad Zahid Harifal was a sufi theologian. He was the founder and teacher of the Madrasa Shams-uloom at Fort Sandeman in Zhob. Shams-ud-din received elementary religious education from his father. He continued both secular schooling and religious education. He matriculated from a government high school in Zhob in 1960. He then attended a madrassa boarding school in Akora Khattak, Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa. He stayed there for two years and continued his education under the guidance of Abdul Haq (father of Sami-ul-Haq, the chief of the JUI). He then attended the Madrasa Arabia New Town Karachi, where he studied under Muhammad Yousuf Binori for two consecutive years. He then went to Khanpur, Rahim Yar Khan and studied at the Madrasa Arabia Makhzan-ul-uloom wa fayuz Eidgah, headed by Pakistani religious scholar Abdullah Darkhawasti. Realizing the highest spiritual position of his teacher, he immediately became his spiritual student by taking the Bay'ah (oath of allegiance) of the Naqshbandi order of Sufism. After two years stay he proceeded to his last institution, the Madrasa Nasratul Uloom Gujranwala, to complete the remaining one-year course of Darse Nizami. At that madrasa, Shams-ud-din studied course of Hadiths (narrations of the words and deeds of Muhammad). He gained knowledge of tafseer, Hadith, spiritualism, mysticism, metaphysics, and logic. Thus completing a traditional Dars-i-Nizam course, he acquired his sanad (degree in Islamic knowledge and sciences of Hadith). After completing his graduation he returned to his native city of Zhob, where his father advised him to engage in revitalizing his madrasa. He became the patron of Madrasa, Shams-ul-Uloom following his father's wishes. == Ancestral background == Shams-ud-din belonged to the Harifal tribe. Shams-ud-din's forefather had been religious scholars for many generations. His first cousin, Obaid-ullah Khan Harifal, was the sardar (tribal chieftain) of the Harifal tribe. His grandfather, Muhammad Rafique, was a saint and had many disciples, as did his father. Another grandfather, Abdul Haq Harifal, had resisted British occupation, in present- day Shinghar.Syed Shams-ud-din by Ashfaque Hashmi p 58 == Political career == Shams-ud-din was a member of Tehreek-e-Khatme Nabuwwat, which demanded the government of Pakistan declare Ahmadis as non-Muslims. During the general election of 1970, Shams-ud-din participated and contested the election at PB 10, Fort Sandeman (as Zhob was then known), on the platform of his political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam.Election Commission of Pakistan He came in first in the election with 7,578 votes, more than double the total of the second-place finisher, Nawabzada Taimur Shah Jogezai, of the Muslim League (Qayyam), who received 3,726 Votes. On 2 May 1972, chairman Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai opened the first session of the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan, in the town hall, Quetta. During this session, Nawab Muhammad Khan Barozai of the National Awami Party (NAP) was elected as Speaker of Assembly. The very next day, 3 May 1972, Shams-ud-din was unanimously elected Deputy Speaker.http://www.pabalochistan.gov.pk/html/1193632308_e.shtml (Ataullah Mengal had already been elected on 1 May as chief Minister.) It was a coalition government of NAP and JUI. Shams-ud-din was the youngest member of the assembly at age 28. Unfortunately, the assembly only lasted for ten months, before the Federal Government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto dismissed the Provincial Government of Balochistan on 13 February 1973. Arrest On 15 July 1973, Shams-ud-din held a rally in Zarif Sheed Park, Zhob. He delivered a speech against the dissemination of tampered Qurans and literature in his native city, allegedly by Ahmadis. Tampering news inflamed the emotions of the people, which lead to riots and lynchings. Between 17 and 18 July 1973, Shams- ud-din's Zhob residence was cordoned off by a heavy contingent of Frontier Corps, who arrested him. The next morning, news of his arrest spread through the city, and tribesmen from all around blocked the outgoing roads to prevent him from being taken away. As the public protest grew out of control, authorities took him away by helicopter. This only further inflamed unrest all over the country.Tarjaman-e-Islam 31 August 1973 Several days after Shams-ud- din's disappearance, Mufti Mehmood demanded on the floor of the National Assembly that his whereabouts be revealed, even if he were dead. On that demand the Interior Minister Abdul Qayyum Khan confessed that Shams-ud-din was alive and in custody at Ma-wand (Kohlu) District, Balochistan. His arrest was controversial throughout the province. During his detention period, his father Muhammad Zahid Harifal received a message from then Governor Akbar Bugti, through his special emissary Saleh Muhammad, seeking a meeting at Quetta, so that the release of Shams-ud-din could be worked out. Muhammad Zahid declined to accede to this proposal. A writ petition of habeas corpus was filed in Sindh-Balochistan High Court, Karachi, challenging his illegal confinement and petitioning for his release, on the premise that the prisoner had been detained incommunicado. Shams-ud-din was released on 18 August 1973. He received a grand reception when he returned to Zhob. A couple of days after his release, he held a rally in Central Jama Mosque, Zhob, and expressed his determination to go ahead with his mission. Meanwhile, his two colleagues, Saleh Muhammad Mardanzai of Muslim Bagh and Hassan Shah, who were elected on the JUI ticket, switched over to the ruling Pakistan People's party. Their actions conjured up illusions of victory in the minds of many hawkish politicians, who believed that Shams-ud-din would also switch parties. He was even offered the position of provincial Chief Minister as a reward, but refused. == Death == In the first week of March 1974, Shams-ud-din left Zhob for Quetta, and along with Muhammad Zaman Khan Achakzai (Provincial General Secretary of the JUI) called on the governor of Balochistan, Khan of Kalat Mir Ahmed Yar Khan, and conveyed him the message of Darkhawasti, and reminded him his commitment for implementing Islamic laws. The governor replied positively, stating, \\"we seek your cooperation\\". After his meeting with the governor, Shams-ud-din left Quetta for Khanpur, where he met with his mentor Darkhawasti, who prediction to Shams-ud-din, \\"it could be our last meeting\\". A few days prior, an attempt had been made on Darkhawasti's life at his official residence in Quetta and Darkhawasti was concerned. On 10 March 1974, Shams-ud- din addressed his last gathering near the vegetable market in Rahimyarkhan, Punjab Pakistan. Later that same day he left for Sibi and stayed overnight. On 13 March 1974, Shams-ud-din was driving home to Zhob along with one of his friends. On the way to Zhob, Shams-ud-din stopped in Akhterzai for his noon prayers. After prayers were over, Shams-ud-din resumed the drive. Thirty-five kilometers from Akhterzai, near a village called \\"Khulgai\\" (Killa Saifullah District), where his friend shot him thrice in the head from behind the driver's seat.Jang Quetta,14,March 1974 Later that same day, Malik Gul Hassan, who also happened to be on way to Zhob, saw an abandoned car on the side of the road and went to investigate. He found the body of Maulana Shams-ud-din, and the whole interior of car stained with blood. He turned back to Killa Saifullah and informed police and district authorities. It was learnt later that Shams-ud-din's friend had visited him at Quetta and stayed with him for three days before insisting on accompanying him to Zhob. Aftermath The next day, people took to the streets in Quetta, chanting slogans against his assassination. At Bacha Khan crossroads, police clashed with demonstrators, opening fire on the crowd, killing six and injuring more than one hundred people; however, the unrest didn't subside. His funeral prayer became a massive demonstration of popular acclaim. The next day, 14 March 1974, he was laid to rest at Zhob graveyard. At 29 years old, Shams-ud-din was survived by his widow and a daughter, his parents, and his brothers. ==Legacy== Shams-ud- din's death created such a wave of sympathy that it left political repercussions in the province. North Balochistan is the current political heartland of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, who control not only large numbers of radical Madrassas, but a majority of the legislative seats at both the national and provincial level. A main crossroads in Zhob was renamed \\"Maulana Shams-ud-din Shaheed Chowk\\" in 2012 by the people of Zhob. Numerous legends and popular songs have grown around his personality. People still believe that on his burial there was a shower of petals, and his blood continued to ooze from his body 24 hours after his body, with a fragrant smell. ==References== Category:1944 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Deobandis Category:Pakistani Sunni Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Pashtun people Category:People from Zhob District ","title":"Shams-ud-din Harifal"},{"id":"35206471","text":"Phelps Franklin Darby (October 17, 1881 – April 23, 1957) was a player and coach of Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team in 1902. == Indiana player–coach == Phelps Darby, a law student and starting center on Indiana's first basketball team, returned in 1901-02 as the captain, a role that, with no designated coach, made him a virtual player-coach.

For more than 40 years, the loss to Purdue was the highest score ever against the Hoosiers, until George Mikan and DePaul beat Indiana 81-43 on December 18, 1943. == Indiana Athletes Association == Phelps Darby was a leader in the Western Conference (also known as the \\"Big Nine\\"), which would later become the Big Ten Conference. In its second year, a decision was made to change control of athletics at Indiana from a faculty committee to what was called \\"a more general body, in which faculty, students and alumni would be represented.\\" \\"To further this end the Athletes Association was organized and assumed complete control of all athletics, and it was stipulated that no man, unless a member of the association, could represent Indiana in any athletic event. Over 250 shares were immediately sold.\\" Darby served as the association's first president. == Later life == A few years after graduation, Darby returned to join Indiana's law school faculty as a specialist in bankruptcy laws. Darby practiced law in Evansville, Indiana for 53 years, and he served in the Indiana legislature. He died in Evansville on April 23, 1957. ==Head coaching record== Source: ==References== Category:1881 births Category:1957 deaths Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball coaches from Indiana Category:Basketball players from Indiana Category:Indiana Hoosiers football players Category:Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball coaches Category:Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball players Category:Indiana lawyers Category:Sportspeople from Evansville, Indiana ","title":"Phelps Darby"},{"id":"35206484","text":"A CYYM array, with 4 sub-arrays, each with one cyan, one magenta.

Bird may have killed as many as 46 people. In 1991 criminologist Eric W. Hickey, Ph.D, Director of Alliant International University's Center for Forensic Studies, wrote about how the Bird case challenges stereotypes of serial killers, who are mostly thought to be Caucasian males, whereas African-American killers typically are associated with urban violence. Hickey wrote, \\"Revelations that Jake Bird, a black man, had actually stalked and killed dozens of white women in the 1940s in dozens of states...continue[s] to challenge traditionally held profiles of serial killers.\\" ==Background== The 45-year-old Bird was a transient who had been born in Louisiana in a location he could not remember. He supported himself as a manual laborer and railroad gandy dancer, who laid and maintained tracks. The work on the railroad kept him moving from place to place. He had an extensive criminal record, including burglary and attempted murder, and had been incarcerated for a total of 31 years in Michigan, Iowa and Utah. ==The Bird hex== After his conviction was announced, Bird was allowed to make a final statement. He spoke for 20 minutes, noting that his request to represent himself had been denied and that his own lawyers were against him. Bird then said, \\"I'm putting the Jake Bird hex on all of you who had anything to do with my being punished. Mark my words, you will die before I do.\\" Allegedly, six people connected with the trial died: Judge Edward D. Hodge of a heart attack within a month of sentencing him to death, as did one of the officers who took his first confession. A police officer who took a second confession died, as did the court's chief clerk, and one of Bird's prison guards. J.W. Selden, one of Bird's lawyers, died on the first anniversary of his sentencing. ==Reprieve, appeals and execution== The execution at the Washington State Penitentiary was scheduled for January 16, 1948, but Bird claimed he had committed 44 other murders which he was willing to help the police solve. Washington governor Monrad C. Wallgren granted him a 60-day reprieve. Police from other states interviewed Bird, and eleven murders were substantiated. He was knowledgeable enough about the 33 other murders to be considered a prime suspect. The interviews with Bird enabled the police departments of many states to declare many unsolved murders as solved. In addition to his Washington state murders, the transient Bird apparently had killed people in Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wisconsin. He mostly preyed on Caucasian women. Bird had dispatched his victims with an axe or hatchet. During his reprieve, Bird lodged an appeal but a retrial was denied by the Washington State Supreme Court. His appeals to the federal courts, including three petitions to the United States Supreme Court, also were denied. He was hanged on the morning of July 15, 1949, at 12:20 a.m., before 125 witnesses. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the prison cemetery. == See also == * List of serial killers in the United States ==References * History Link, Jake Bird is hanged for the murder of two Tacoma women on July 15, 1949 Category:1901 births Category:1949 deaths Category:1947 murders in the United States Category:20th-century executions by Washington (state) Category:20th- century executions of American people Category:People executed by Washington (state) by hanging Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American serial killers Category:Executed American serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:Violence against women in the United States Category:People convicted of murder by Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Axe murder Category:Executed African-American people Category:American people convicted of burglary Category:American people convicted of attempted murder Category:Prisoners and detainees of Iowa Category:Prisoners and detainees of Michigan Category:Prisoners and detainees of Utah Category:Stabbing attacks in the United States ","title":"Jake Bird"},{"id":"35206841","text":" The Goodwin Tri-Moto is an American powered parachute that was designed and produced by FL Goodwin of Phoenix, Arizona and introduced in 1997.Cliche, Andre: Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide 8th Edition, page D-17.

It is known by a variety of names in different regions (e.g. jataí, yatei, jaty, virginitas, angelitas inglesas, españolita, mariola, chipisas, virgencitas, and mariolitas). A subspecies, Tetragonisca angustula fiebrigi, occupies different areas in South America and has a slightly different coloration. T. angustula is a very small bee and builds unobtrusive nests, allowing it to thrive in urban areas. It also produces large amounts of honey, and is thus frequently kept in wooden hives by beekeepers. T. angustula hives are often overlooked, and since the bee lacks a stinger, it is not seen as a threat to humans. alt= Many of their behaviors are concerned with colonizing a new nest and producing offspring, demonstrated by their swarming and nursing behaviors, however a special caste of T. angustula are soldiers who are slightly larger than the workers. The soldiers in a T. angustula nest are very good at protecting the hive against intruders which makes up for not having a stinger. Some of these soldiers hover in mid air outside the nest, which is seen in the adjacent picture. ==Taxonomy and phylogeny== T. angustula is a member of the order Hymenoptera, which is one of the four largest insect orders. It is in the family Apidae, subfamily Apinae. Along with other species in the tribe Meliponini, T. angustula is a eusocial stingless bee. There are approximately 500 known species in this tribe, a majority of which are located in the Neotropics. T. angustula has two described two subspecies, T. angustula fiebrigi and T. angustula angustula which have different coloration on their mesepisternum and occupy slightly different regions. ==Description and identification== T. angustula is an exceptionally small bee, about 4-5 mm. Along with all other bees in the tribe Meliponini, it is stingless and has a reduced wing venation and penicilla (bristles on the leg). The subspecies T. angustula fiebrigi has a light yellow mesepisternum, while T. angustula angustula has black. Guard bees, which make up about 1-6% of each hive, weigh more than foragers by about 30% and have smaller heads, as well as longer hind legs. Remarkable for the stingless bee clade, T. angustula has a pronounced size dimorphism between the queen and worker castes. == Distribution and habitat== T. angustula has a large habitat distribution across Central and South America. The species has been found as far north as Mexico and south as far as Argentina. It has been labeled \\"one of the most widespread bee species in the neotropics.\\" The subspecies T. angustula fiebrigi is found more in the southern hemisphere, occupying parts of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and other southern countries. The subspecies T. angustula angustula has a larger presence in Brazil and is found more in the northern hemisphere, occupying Panama, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Nicaragua etc. T. angustula distribution overlaps with many other stingless bee species, with an especially large correlation with Paratrigona subnuda distribution across Mesoaerica. In the Atlantic rainforest, deforestation for sugar cane plantations is extensive and contributes to the rarity of T. angustula in that area, as well as the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris. Nests for T. angustula are found in many different settings. Their nests are the predominant bee nests in recovering forest habitats, but are also present in structured forests, depleted forests, and urban settings. Like other stingless bees, T. angustula finds pre-existing cavities, such as holes in tree trunks, cavities in walls, or even abandoned ant or termite nests, for their new nest sites. ==Colony cycle== A T. angustula colony will only reproduce once a year, as opposed to many honeybees that can reproduce three or four times in a year. The largest colony cycle occurs during the summer in South America, with most of the new brood hatching between December and March. This time of the year coincides with the best foraging conditions, which ensure enough food can be provided for the larvae. Each colony has one reproductive queen to mate and lay eggs. Swarming Colonies are founded by swarming; a young queen and a small fraction of workers leave the mother nest for a new nest site. Before swarming, scout bees explore suitable cavities in the area surrounding the mother nest. This scouting often lasts between two days and two weeks. The new nest sites are within a few hundred meters of the mother nest to allow continued contact with the mother nest, which can last from a week up to six months for T. angustula, which is longer than many other bee species. Resources are transferred from the mother nest to the new nest, including pollen, honey, and cerumen, but the new nest continues to have very small stores compared to the mother nest. Cerumen, which comes from the mother nest, is a wax used to seal cracks and holes in the new nest site. A swarming colony can have as many as 10,000 bees, but less than 10% relocate to the new nest. Some workers help settle at the new nest site and then return to the mother nest within a few days. The mother colony cannot produce another swarm while the new nest is dependent on it, so once the new nest is settled, connection is severed. Nest building T. angustula bees at the wax entrance to their hive Once a nest site is found, the existing cavity must be cleaned. After the pre-existing container is ready to be inhabited, the workers build several horizontal brood combs in the center of the nest. This brood chamber is surrounded by layers of cerumen, called the involucrum, which helps maintain a constant climate in the brood chamber. Stingless bees add a distinct entrance tube to their nests. This tube is also made of wax and is thought to assist in protection from predators. The tube is on average 2 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter and is often closed during the night. Soldier bees are seen guarding this entrance at all hours. ==Behavior== Mating After the nest is cleaned and built, the virgin queen leaves to find a mate. Before she leaves, the queen performs an ‘orientation flight’ to help her find the hive after mating. This flight is a series of circles in the air with the queen’s head facing the entrance to the nest. The virgin queen leaves on her nuptial flight around 7 to 15 days old. In a few cases, queens go out on a second nuptial flight, mating with another male. Males are thought to come together from many different colonies to form reproductive aggregations composed of hundreds of males, which would provide a queen with the opportunity to compare multiple mates and find the best candidate. Larger aggregations might also be more successful in quickly attracting a queen due to the increased amount of male pheromone present, making the nuptial flight shorter. Queens tend to return to the nest 2–7 days after leaving to start oviposition. Division of labor Like many other stingless bee species, T. angustula workers take part in different activities based on their age. The average lifespan of the worker bees is around 21 days, but many live up to about 60 days. The first tasks that worker bees perform include courting the queen (surround her in the hive) and helping with oviposition (see section on nursing). Young bees (1 to about 15 days old) also assist with putting cerumen on brood combs and cleaning the nest. Foraging behavior starts about 16 days after a worker emerges and will continue for the rest of its life. Grooming behavior and resin manipulation are most common in ‘older’ bees, about 20 to 55 days old. Worker bees perform many actions throughout their lives, and while age divides workers between different tasks, a large overlap of jobs are still being done at one time. Worker bees do not guard the hive, though, since this job is left to soldier bees, which are larger. While the existence of a soldier caste is well-known in ants and termites, up until 2012 the phenomenon was unknown among bees, when it was discovered that T. angustula has a similar caste of defensive specialists that help guard the nest entrance against intruders. Subsequent research has shown at least 9 other species possess such \\"soldiers,\\" including T. fiebrigi and Frieseomelitta longipes, with the guards not only larger, but also sometimes a different color from ordinary workers. Nursing Nursing behavior, along with oviposition, is known as the provisioning and oviposition process, shortened to “POP”. Before oviposition occurs, workers fill the cells in the hive with food. Once the egg is placed in the cell, it is covered and not tended to again. So, any differences among bees during their initial development must come from differences in the environment within their cells. The size of the cells and the amount of food in each cell is the main determining factor in the size and role of the bee that develops in the cell. Therefore, T. angustula workers fulfill their biggest role before an egg is even placed in a cell. Workers, males, soldiers, and queens are all morphologically distinct in T. angustula and these differences result from the varied developmental environments found in the cell. Workers The average percentage of workers in a T. angustula brood is about 83.6%. While the ratios may change slightly from nest to nest, workers make up the majority of each brood. Their cell size and food allowance is generally seen as the baseline for comparisons since most cells in a nest are for workers. Soldiers Of the workers produced, about 1-6% are soldier-sized. Soldiers occupy the cells in the center of the comb and worker bees fill these cells with extra food compared to normal workers. This is an example in which nutritional availability during development impacts larval development. Males A trade-off is seen between worker and male production within a brood. Males are produced at higher levels when food availability rises, because they are given more food in their cells, which means that males are often produced in late summer (February to April) when food is plentiful. About 16.3% of a brood consists of males, but this changes depending on the season. Males do not help around the hive after they have matured, but instead leave the nest to reproduce and never return. The investment in their growth is aimed at the possibility of males passing on their genes (and therefore the queen and worker’s genes) during reproduction with virgin queens from other hives. Queens Queens are rare among a brood since only one mated queen is needed for each hive. An estimated 0.2% of a brood is made up of queens and this rate does not vary with the seasons. Queens are raised in the largest cells, known as royal cells, which are built on the edge of a comb. Communication T. angustula bees do not have an easily observable form of communication. While they must cooperate in the hive to perform various tasks as a group, many tasks are performed individually. Olfactory cues have been tested in relation to both nestmate recognition and in foraging location, but no strong links could be made. Chemical cues do play a role in foraging activities, with individuals choosing to pollinate plants that have been previously visited by other foragers, but this is an indirect form of communication. Foraging Foragers mostly collect nectar, pollen, and plant resin. Foraging activity levels are similar for pollen, nectar and resin foragers: highest activity levels were found around noon. Foraging distances have been estimated to be below 600m, which is relatively short compared to larger bee species. In many species of stingless bees foragers recruit nestmates to profitable food patches of pollen or nectar. In T. angustula, however, this recruitment is weak. Instead, foragers use chemical cues to locate a good food source as well as visual stimuli remembered from previous foraging trips. Experiments have shown that forager bees will respond to odor priming when put in direct contact with the odor during the experiment, but will not learn the odor if it is simply present in the hive. This shows that T. angustula foragers learn from their own personal experiences but do not pick up information from their fellow foragers. This dependence on personal experience to find food along with the lack of observable group foraging activity labels T. angustula as solitary foragers. ==Interaction with other species== Diet T. angustula bees visit a large number of plants to find food. Stingless bees in general are very important in pollinating 30 to 80% of the plants in their biomes, and T. angustula is one of the most widespread stingless bees in South America. In one study in Brazil, T. angustula bees were seen at 61 different plants, 45 of them being visited by almost exclusively this species of bee. The most important food source for T. angustula is believed to be Schinus terebinthifolius in the Anacardiaceae. Plants from the Asteraceae and Meliaceae were also visited in large numbers. Pollen types from different plants vary in their size and surface texture, which makes T. angustula honey distinct compared to honey with different pollen grains. Nest defense T. angusula soldiers standing or hovering at the nest entrance The wax tube entrance to each T. angustula hive provides a great advantage in respect to protection against invaders. Between two and 45 soldiers are stationed at this entrance at all times. There are two types of T. angustula soldiers. One type will stand on the tube and detect bees of the same species that do not belong in the hive. The second type will hover near the entrance of the tube and defend against flying intruders that are not T. angustula. ==Kin selection== Nestmate recognition T. angustula guard bees are extremely good at differentiating between foreign individuals. A study in 2011 found that T. angustula is better at nestmate recognition than all other bee species that have been studied to date. They made no errors in recognizing the bees that belonged and never once turned away a nestmate. They were fooled by approximately 8% of non-nestmate bees who sought to enter the hive which is quite low in comparison to other bees. T. angustula guards are also much better than the average worker bee at recognizing their nestmates at the hive entrance. When they are experimentally put in other contexts away from the hive entrance, recognition errors increase greatly. This demonstrates the importance of individual recognition during specific times, but also shows that T. angustula bees do not generally distinguish between their nestmates and other members of their species. Research is still being conducted on how guards differentiate between bees, but odor of resin seems to have no effect on recognition. Worker queen conflict While the queen in a T. angustula hive will lay most of the eggs in a brood, some workers also have the ability to develop and lay eggs. Unlike reproductive eggs, these worker eggs do not have a reticulum and thus develop into males. The worker queen conflict arises over competition to lay eggs in the fixed number of cells in the nest. When the queen produces more eggs, there will be more workers to build more cells, and the workers will be able to lay an egg in the open cells. However the queen lays eggs irregularly throughout the year so the number of cells fluctuates. The queen will try to lay eggs in as many cells as she can, decreasing the opportunity for workers to lay their eggs. They work fast during oviposition and in some cases will eat the workers’ eggs to make more room for her own. The queen is dominant in this conflict and ends up controlling the availability of oviposition sites. ==Human importance== T. angustula are very adept at living in urban settings. They can build their nest in a variety of places, including holes in buildings. More often than not, humans are not even aware of the presence of T. angustula nests and therefore leave them unharmed. This same study showed that bees took refuge inside their nest when humans approached, making them even less conspicuous and decreasing direct contact between human and bee. Many beekeepers take advantage of T. angustula for its stinglessness and discreetness. Nests are widely traded in Latin America, making T. angustula among the more cultivated species of stingless bees. Honey The honey produced by T. angustula is known in some regions as ‘miel de angelita’, which means ‘little-angel honey.’ The honey is said to contain medicinal properties, which has been studied in relation to preventing specific infections. In places like Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador, the price of ‘miel de angelita’ can be as much as ten times more than the price of honey produced by common honey bees. Composition Like most honey, T. angustula honey is made up of simple sugars, water, and ash. The specific ratio of these three components makes each honey unique however, and can be affected by season, climate, and other factors that affect flora availability. T. angustula honey contains more moisture than honey from typical honey bees and is also more acidic, giving it a complex flavor. Antibacterial activity Honey and propolis, a glue like substance that bees use as sealant, collected by T. angustula have some health benefits for humans. The honey and propolis contain various chemicals that show antibacterial activity towards an infection causing bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus. Honey and propolis gathered from different geographical areas have different chemical compositions yet they all exhibit some type of antibacterial activity. Another bee, Apis mellifera, produces honey and propolis with very similar qualities. Environmental concerns Forests are being destroyed all over the world, including the Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil. The Atlantic Rainforest has very high levels of biodiversity but human fragmentation of the forest is leading to huge loss. Due to the interconnectedness of the environment the loss of one plant or insect could cause many others to go extinct. As seen above, T. angustula bees are quite important for pollinating many plants and providing good quality honey. Steps are taken to understand the diet of these bees and their nest sites in order to keep them from dying out in an area. Conservation of the forest is a priority of many scientists and preservationists, and the survival of stingless bees plays a factor in the importance of keeping these forests. ==References Category:Meliponini Category:Hymenoptera of North America Category:Hymenoptera of South America Category:Insects of Central America Category:Insects described in 1811 ","title":"Tetragonisca angustula"},{"id":"35206880","text":"Sampara is a village and seat of the commune of Bassirou in the Cercle of Mopti in the Mopti Region of southern-central Mali..

Interior with clientele, c.1930s. Sloppy Joe's Bar is a historic bar located in Havana, Cuba. The bar reopened in 2013 after being closed for 48 years. The advent of Prohibition in the United States spurred its original owner, Jose Abeal Otero, to change the emphasis from food service to liquor service when American tourists would visit Havana for the nightlife, the gambling and the alcohol they could not obtain back home. Sloppy Joe's welcomed tourists for over four decades, and offered over 80 cocktails in addition to the bar's own brand of 12-year-old rum. During the 1940s and 1950s it was a magnet for American celebrities as well as tourists wanting to mingle with them.\\"Cuba's Sloppy Joe's died and it will stay that way\\", Reuters, cited at The Leader-Post, July 11, 1981 It has been described by the Los Angeles Times as \\"one of the most famous bars in the world\\" with \\"almost the status of a shrine.\\"\\"Sloppy Joes Really Sloppy Now--and Empty, Too\\", Los Angeles Times, August 27, 1981 The Cuban Revolution of 1959 saw the bar's business nosedive, as some 90% of Sloppy Joe's clientele was American. A fire in the 60s closed the establishment for good. The building in which the bar was housed remained intact, resembling a ghost town with its single-piece mahogany bar and photos of celebrities. The slow-paced, extensive restoration, undertaken by The Office of the Historian of Havana, began in 2007. It is located on the corner of Calle Animas and Zulueta in Havana Vieja (Old Havana). The building is located behind (on the same block as) the Plaza Hotel. The bar, in its heyday, can be seen in the movie Our Man in Havana starring Alec Guinness as it is the bar in which the character (Jim Wormold) is attempted to be recruited into the secret service. It supposedly inspired the deli sandwich sold in northern New Jersey for over half a century by the same name, sloppy joe. Renovation work on Sloppy Joe's was completed in early 2013, and its doors opened to the public on April 12 of that year. The facade closely resembles the images from the 1950s, even down to the sign on the corner, above the arches. ==References * Sloppy Joes Bar, Old Havana, Cuba (website) Category:Drinking establishments in Cuba Category:Buildings and structures in Havana ","title":"Sloppy Joe's Bar, Havana"},{"id":"35206936","text":"The Russian women's national rugby sevens team () is one of the strongest women's rugby teams in Europe.

After two years at the Detroit Teachers College (now Wayne State University), she began teaching school at seventeen, and published two articles in the \\"Detroit Journal of Education (Sept. and Nov. 1921), while still in her teens. She enrolled in the University of Michigan and received B.A. and M.A degrees. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was the recipient of a (major) Hopwood award the first year they were offered. In 1931, she married Walter Donnelly, of Battle Creek, an earlier Phi Beta Kappa and M.A. at the University of Michigan, where he had taught in the Dept. of Rhetoric and had recently taken an editorial position with the University of Michigan. They resided at 612 Lawrence, Ann Arbor for the rest of their lives. Dorothy stayed at home writing while raising her three sons, Stephen, Jerome, and Denis. She declined offers to teach for the U. of Michigan Dept. of English, preferring to concentrate on her work at home. Numerous visitors to the Donnelly household, which had become an accidental salon, included poets, professors, and even incipient politicians. A student discussion group on Thomas Aquinas led by Dorothy and Walter, included the future Senator Philip Hart (after whom the Hart Senate Office Building is named). For a time, the mystery writer, Henry Branson, who visited the Donnelly's regularly, lived next door. The Renaissance drama scholar Leo Kirschbaum, another visitor, had an apartment in the adjacent house. When art history professor (later curator of the Smithsonian's Freer Gallery) Richard Ettinghausen learned that the Nazis had wiped out his entire family, it was to 612 Lawrence St. that he sought solace. When, during a fierce thunder storm, Walter and Dorothy invited in a stranger, who had taken refuge on their porch, it turned out to be the young poet Robert Hayden. Although Dorothy and Walter were not social gadabouts, they were hosts to many serious thinkers. Raymond Nogar, philosopher/scientist/Dominican priest and author of such books as The Wisdom of Evolution and The Lord of the Absurd, would stay at the house whenever he was able to detour from his lecture tours. (Dorothy wrote an obituary for him in the Herder Book Supplement [June, 1968].) Edgar Smothers, S.J., a classical scholar working with the University's collection of papyri, (see for example his Two Readings in Papyrus Bodmer II) spent one Monday evening a month at the Lawrence St. address. Rosamond Haas, a local poet, (see for example Delay is the Song) was also a regular visitor. There were occasional visits from University museum curators, Jean-Paul Slusser (after whom the Jean Paul Slusser art gallery at the U. of Michigan is now named) and Enoch Peterson, the Director of the Kelsey Museum of Archeology. A more frequent visitor was the Donnelly's good friend, Peter Ruthven, son of the university president Alexander Grant Ruthven. Peter had spent time at the museum's digs in Egypt and later substantial contributions to the university's collection of artifacts. Other less frequent visitors to 612 Lawrence St. were numerous. After giving a campus reading (May 3, 1950), Dylan Thomas chose to spend his evening there, accompanied by Patrick Boland, a close family friend and poet, who came for stays from Detroit twice a year. The British couple, philosophers Peter Geach and Elizabeth Anscombe, became Donnelly friends during their visiting professorships. Paul Henry, S.J. the Belgian Plotinus scholar, (see for example Plotinus: Volume I, Porphyry on Plotinus, Ennead I), was another sometime guest, who always made a point of detouring from his U.S. speaking trips to stay with Dorothy and Walter. The English poet and critic, John Heath-Stubbs, became a lifelong friend, after he was introduced to the Donnelly household while a visiting professor in the U. of Michigan Dept. of English. He always stayed at 612 Lawrence St. on return visits to Ann Arbor. Dorothy contributed, “Music from a Grand Piano,” an appreciation of Heath- Stubbs in a special issue of Aquarius (London, 1978) in his honor. University of Michigan architecture Professor Joe Lee and his wife Elsie were long- standing visitors and close friends, while psychologist Rudolf Arnheim (best known for Toward the Psychology of Art) and his wife became friends and visitors in later years. In addition, at one time or another, other various poets and writers who paid visits included Joe (X.J.) Kennedy, Keith and Rosmarie Waldrop, Donald Hall, and Anne Stevenson. == Career == Before her marriage, Dorothy published in Eugene Jolas's journal transition (Paris), which was also publishing James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, Franz Kafka, Gertrude Stein, Hart Crane, and Samuel Beckett; it was later to be recognized as one of the most important of the avant garde little magazines. (Jolas wrote to her requesting her to send more of her work, telling her, “You are the only writer in America going in the right direction.”) The first of her books, the highly praised, The Bone and the Star, described by Mortimer Adler as “a study of primitive man, looked at from the points of view of Christian theology,” adding that “Mrs. Donnelly has that rare ability which can penetrate myths to the truths they contain.\\" Her next book, The Golden Well: An Anatomy of Symbols was published simultaneously in America and England, where the reviewer for the (London) Times Literary Supplement (TLS) called it “remarkable” and “unusually rich.” Following these publications, she turned to concentrating on poetry. Soon, she had poems published in the most prestigious poetry venues, such as Poetry, The New Yorker, and The Hudson Review.

It is Crowley's fifth published novel and the first novel in the four-volume Ægypt series. The novel follows Pierce Moffett, a college history professor in his retreat from ordinary, academic life to pastoral life of Faraway Hills. While in the area, Pierce comes up with a plan to write a book about Hermeticism, in the process finding several parallels with his own project and that of the nearly-forgotten local novelist Fellowes Kraft. The novel takes place in two time periods and features three main protagonists; that of Pierce's in the late twentieth century, and that of John Dee, Edward Kelley and Giordano Bruno as from the historical novels of Kraft in the Renaissance. The difference is marked stylistically by dashes indicating dialogue for events that happened in the Renaissance and events in the twentieth century marked by dialogue in quotation marks. The novel was nominated for the 1988 Arthur C. Clarke Award, and the 1988 World Fantasy Award. ==Background== The novel is structured basically as a künstlerroman (\\"artist's novel\\"), following the late-life development of Pierce Moffett in his attempts to finish a fictional book combining speculative history, fiction and a fictional world he created as a child called Ægypt. Pierce's two main sources for the book include the work of his graduate professor and speculative historian Frank Walker Barr, and the highly productive historical novelist Fellowes Kraft. Barr's theories are likely based on the speculative historians Crowley cites in his short note at the beginning of the novel, which names the work of Robert Graves, the nearly forgotten Pre-Raphaelite Katharine Emma Maltwood, and especially Dame Frances Yates, who Crowley cites as a deliberate influence, calling the novel a \\"fantasia on her themes\\". Kraft, on the other hand, is a historical novelist native to Blackberry Jambs in whose novels Pierce first reads about Giordano Bruno, and whose uncompleted novel about John Dee and Bruno meeting is interspersed throughout the novel. His novels are known for their interesting sources, but Rosie finds in them colour and style with little driving force to illustrate their histories, and Pierce finds too simplistic in their settings, but a useful starting point in illuminating the minds of their subjects. Kraft has been widely speculated to be based on the life and work of David Derek Stacton, of whom Crowley is a notable admirer, though Stacton is never known to have written on the subjects of either John Dee or Bruno. On his blog, Crowley identified Kraft as an \\"intentional creation\\" who nevertheless resembles how Crowley imagines Stacton \\"if he'd lived to be old\\". The project of a long uncompleted work on Bruno has many similarities to The Last Confession by Morris West. This novel of the sequence is sectioned based on the first three astrological houses. Vita, signifying life; Lucrum, signifying wealth; and Fratres signifying brothers or brotherhood. ==Plot== The novel begins, like Goethe's Faust, with a \\"Prologue in Heaven\\", depicting John Dee and his scryer Edward Kelley–who Dee as yet only knows as Edward Talbot–watching Angels in a crystal. Suddenly, to their dread, the angels scatter and a child appears in the glass, \\"holding a space\\" Doctor Dee knows to be absolutely immense, into which both feel their souls being drawn. During a \\"Prologue on Earth\\" immediately following, a young Pierce Moffett, preparing to serve as an altar boy reads a novel about Giordano Bruno (later revealed to be by Fellowes Kraft), the sixteenth century Dominican Friar, and finds himself sharply identifying with the narrator. The novel proper begins under the sign of Vita, with Pierce now in middle age, taking a bus to apply for a job at Peter Ramus College. Along the way he is reading a new translation of Las Soledades of Luis de Góngora. The bus stops in the Faraway Hills, where Pierce meets Spofford, a previous student of his. Impulsively, Pierce decides to forget the interview and leave with Spofford for the town of Blackberry Jambs nearby. While there, Pierce comes to conceive of a novel combining his vast knowledge of history along with speculations about Hermetic philosophy, his interest in Giordano Bruno, as well as local author's Fellowes Kraft's unfinished series of novels involving Bruno and John Dee. In the meantime, he is drawn closer to Rosie Mucho. At the same time Rosie moves the painful first steps of divorcing her husband Mike. Interspersed throughout the novel are scenes from Kraft's novels, involving John Dee's first experiments with the occult, and his first meetings with other figures including William Shakespeare and Edward Kelley, as well as a second novel, featuring Giordano Bruno's education, rise to fame, and ultimately to his wandering years under the threat of death from the Church. ==Characters== As earlier stated, the novel follows both characters in the present, as well as those in the Historical novels of Fellowes Kraft ;Characters in the present *Pierce Moffett - The widely educated protagonist of the novel. Pierce has mild synesthesia as to numbers and has a very easy time remembering historical dates. Holding a degree in \\"Renaissance Studies\\" Pierce's story generally follows his attempts to both satisfy his curiosity and find meaningful employment for the knowledge he has thus far accumulated. *Rosie Mucho - A long-time resident of the Blackberry Jambs, and eventually Pierce's close friend. Throughout the novel she goes the first painful steps of divorcing her husband Mike Mucho while trying to keep her daughter Samantha from being exposed to the process. Her surname may be a reference to the husband of Oedipa Maas in Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49. *Boney Rassmussen - Rosie's uncle, and a member of the board managing Kraft's estate. He eventually offers Rosie the job of keeping Kraft's house. *Val - The town fortune teller, whose divinations are startlingly accurate. *Julie Rosengarten - Pierce's one-time girlfriend and literary agent. After pitching the idea for his novel, Julie first interests Pierce in marketing the idea towards New Age sensibilities. *Beau Brachman - Rosie's close friend, and frequent babysitter of Sam Mucho. Beau is an enthusiastic disciple of New Age philosophy, and widely admired throughout the town. Throughout the novel his appearance is humorously misread, first by Rosie noticing how much he resembles an iconographic Christ, and by Pierce as the god Pan. ;Characters of the Renaissance *John Dee - The Elizabethan cryptographer, doctor, alchemist and skryer. His character is revealed in two novels by Kraft, the first being Bitten Apples about the early life of Shakespeare, and the second being Kraft's unpublished novel. *Giordano Bruno - The Dominican friar, first encountered in the novels that Pierce reads as a young boy and later in the unpublished work Pierce finds in Kraft's estate. *Edward Kelley - John Dee's assistant, going by the name Edward Talbot. Dee however, is constantly suspicious of Talbot. Brief appearances are also made by William Shakespeare and his family, and Queen Elizabeth. ==Reception== A review in the Times Literary Supplement found in the novel \\"its own vivid reality is an absorbing one, and it leaves the reader impatient for the second volume.\\" In a review for the last novel in the Ægypt cycle in the Boston Review, James Hynes noted that the book's original reception was \\"widely and respectfully reviewed\\". Harold Bloom included the novel in the last \\"Chaotic\\" Canon in the appendices of Western Canon. ==Selected editions== * * ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== *The Solitudes at Worlds Without End Category:American fantasy novels Category:Novels by John Crowley Category:Metafictional novels Category:American magic realism novels Category:1987 fantasy novels Category:1987 American novels Category:Cultural depictions of Giordano Bruno ","title":"The Solitudes (novel)"},{"id":"35207017","text":"The University hospitals of the Ruhr University of Bochum, German Universitätsklinikum der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, abbreviated UK RUB is a syndicate of six university hospitals and associated facilities of the Ruhr University of Bochum.

The garden suburb at Romford comprised 140 fully- furnished houses and cottages, each designed and funded by the architects who designed them, in either the Arts and Crafts or Art Nouveau styles. Upon completion an exhibition was organised to showcase the dwellings for prospective buyers, and a competition to find the best building, with a first prize of £250 and a gold medal being awarded to the winning architect. The best detached houses were awarded Class I status, which would allow the property to be sold for £500, while Class II buildings were marketed for £375. The buildings were judged on their utility and economy of management and maintenance. One hundred architects and urban planners took part in the Gidea Park development, including William Curtis Green, Philip Tilden, Raymond Unwin, Richard Barry Parker, and Baillie Scott. The exhibition opened in the spring of 1911, and with it came the establishment of several roads, including Balgores Lane, Squirrels Heath Avenue and Crossways to the south of Hare Street (now Main Road) and Heath Drive, Meadway, Reed Pond Walk, Heaton Grange Road, Risebridge Road and Parkway to the north. In 1934, using land left over from the first competition, a second exhibition was held in the Romford Garden Suburb, this time hosted by Raphael's nephew. Each of these houses were designed in the Art Deco style, a taste that was dominant in the 1930s. Six of the 1911 exhibition houses were later designated as Grade II listed buildings by Historic England. The suburb was designated as a conservation area in 1970. The winner of the 1934 competition, 64 Heath Drive, by Francis Skinner, a founding member of Berthold Lubetkin's Tecton Group, was also listed at Grade II in 1997. ==History== An engraving of the Gidea Hall estate, by Humphrey Repton, 1797 Thomas Cooke, a Yorkshireman who became London Mayor in 1462, was granted a Royal Charter for Havering-atte-Bower. This enabled him to build a country house, which he named \\"Geddy Hall\\". The word \\"geddy\\" derived from the lake and its livestock; ged, meaning pike, and ea (water). The house remained unfinished for at least a century because of his numerous incarcerations within the Tower of London for High Treason. Upon his death in 1478, the estate was passed down through the Cooke family and eventually to his great- grandson, Anthony Cooke, tutor for Edward VI,The Book of the Exhibition of Houses and Cottages: Romford Garden Suburb, Gidea Park, p. 42. in October 1579.McIntosh, Marjorie K.

After a brief period abroad, Anthony returned to Havering-atte-Bower and completed the building of Geddy Hall, which became Gidea Hall.The Book of the Exhibition of Houses and Cottages: Romford Garden Suburb, Gidea Park, p. 43. In 1657, the hall and its grounds were sold to Richard Emes, a local businessman, for £9,000. Upon the Restoration in 1660, the estate was bought back by the Crown and passed through the ownerships of various nobilities; it was eventually sold through public auction, before the Coronation of Queen Victoria.The Book of the Exhibition of Houses and Cottages: Romford Garden Suburb, Gidea Park, p. 35. Gidea Hall sold to the Black family in 1802 under whose ownership it remained until 1883 when it was bought for redevelopment by a company that was associated with Jabez Balfour. The company was unsuccessful in its plans and in 1893, Gidea Hall was again put up for sale.\\"Manors and other estates\\", British History Online (BHO), accessed 1 February 2020.

It came set within and Raphael purchased a further , which he then divided up, giving , which included a lake, for use as a public park; the park opened and Raphael lent his name to it in 1904.Romford: Manors and other estates, A History of the County of Essex: Volume 7, ed. W R Powell (London, 1978), British History Online, accessed 4 October 2019. He formed the idea for a garden suburb after the construction of Hampstead Garden Suburb, which was established by Henrietta Barnett in 1906, on land purchased from Eton College. Barnett had set up the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust Ltd and appointed Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin as its chief architects. Raphael decided to capitalise on the success seen at Hampstead, and other garden suburbs, including Ealing, Tottenham and Tooting, and set about organising an exhibition.\\"Romford Garden Suburb\\", The Illustrated London News, 6 August 1910, p. 200. Raphael enlisted the help of John Tudor Walters, an architect and surveyor, and Charles McCurdy, who had been a director for the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust, to set up the Gidea Hall Development Company, the head office for which was based at 33 Henrietta Street, in Covent Garden, London.\\"Housekeeping made easy at Gidea Park\\", Barking, East Ham & Ilford Advertiser, Upton Park and Dagenham Gazette, 05 August 1911, p. 3.

The object of the new suburb, according to the Liberal Member of parliament John Burns, who was then the president of the Local Government Board, was \\"to provide families with a well-built, modern home, regardless of class or status\\", and \\"to bring the towns into the country, and the country into the towns\\".\\"The Garden Suburb\\", Leigh Chronicle and Weekly District Advertiser, 5 August 1910, p. 2.

By the late spring of 1911 the project was complete, and featured 140, fully furnished houses and small cottages, in the Arts and Crafts style. The entire development cost £60,000 with a further £20,000 being put aside for the building of roads, pavements and street furniture.The Book of the Exhibition of Houses and Cottages, Romford Garden Suburb, Gidea Park, p. 14. The landscaping was carried out by William Barron & Son, Ltd.\\"William Barron & Son, landscape gardeners\\", Leicester Daily Post, 1 February 1911, p. 35. To visualise what each house would look like, Raphael took inspiration from Henrik Ibsen's The Master Builder, which used the motto \\"Houses for people to live in\\"The Book of the Exhibition of Houses and Cottages: Romford Garden Suburb, Gidea Park, p. 17. and from Francis Bacon's The Essayes Or Covnsels, Civill and Morall, of Francis Lo.

Vervlam, Viscovnt St. Alban p. 11. Bacon's link to Gidea Park - his grandfather, Sir Anthony Cooke, occupied Gidea Hall in the 16th century - was used to advertise the new suburb. The Book of the Exhibition of Houses and Cottages: Romford Garden Suburb, Gidea Park was written to accompany the Exhibition and to detail each building for the benefit of prospective buyers. A number of important people were asked for their opinion on what made the perfect house and how modern day living could be improved, including Thomas Hardy, Sir Edward Poynter,The Book of the Exhibition of Houses and Cottages: Romford Garden Suburb, Gidea Park, p. 18. Millicent FawcettThe Book of the Exhibition of Houses and Cottages: Romford Garden Suburb, Gidea Park, p. 20. and Arnold Bennett. The interiors were designed to make domestic living as economic as possible. There was much tiling throughout, especially in the kitchen and scullery, where surfaces could be cleaned easily. Some of the dwellings were furnished by the architect, and others by leading companies of the day, including Heal & Son who were based in Tottenham Court Road.The Book of the Exhibition of Houses and Cottages: Romford Garden Suburb, Gidea Park, p. 14. The construction of each house was either funded solely by the architect or in partnership with the builder.Cherry, O'Brien, Pevsner, p. 204. ==Competition== Upon completion, a competition was held in the summer of 1911 to find the best building, an event that was witnessed by Raphael, Walters, McCurdy, and Sir Frederick Treves, among others.\\"Romford Garden Suburb\\", Shoreditch Observer, 13 May 1911, p. 8. A first prize of £250 and a gold medal was awarded to the winning architect and builder.The Book of the Exhibition of Houses and Cottages, Romford Garden Suburb, Gidea Park, p. 145. The judges, Guy Dawber, Henry Vaughan Lanchester and Mervyn Macartney, gave the best detached houses a Class I status, which would allow the property to be sold for £500. The best detached cottages were given a Class II status which allowed them to be marketed for £375. Smaller prizes were given for best internal decoration, best town plan, best garden design, drawings, and excellence in craftsmanship and construction. Admission to the public, and prospective buyers, was free.\\"Exhibition Romford\\", Barking, East Ham & Ilford Advertiser, Upton Park and Dagenham Gazette, 08 July 1911, pp. 3–4.

The response was good with 100 architects signing up, with some completing several houses on the development. Of the notable architects, William Curtis Green, who had established his office just ten years previously, designed two properties, as did Baillie Scott, who was long established. Others included Robert van 't Hoff, Philip Tilden, Norman Jewson, and Raymond Unwin and Richard Barry Parker,The Book of the Exhibition of Houses and Cottages, Romford Garden Suburb, Gidea Park, pp. 10. who were both instrumental in the design of the garden suburb at Hampstead.\\"Town planning and holding\\", Hendon and Finchley Times, 30 October 1914, p. 3. Of the 140 dwellings that were built, six were designated as Grade II listed buildings by Historic England. On 14 September 1979, 16 and 27 Meadway; 36 and 38, Reed Pond Walk; and 43, Heath Drive, were added to the national register of protected buildings. 41 Heath Drive was added on 30 June 2000. Purchasing The first plot sold in July 1910, soon after the exhibition opened; on another plot, the first house was being built, at a cost of £850. By the following year, 153 plots had been sold and £63,000 had already been invested in house building.The Book of the Exhibition of Houses and Cottages, Romford Garden Suburb, Gidea Park, p. xi. Interested buyers were offered a special deal on the plots in the summer of 1911 by the Gidea Hall Development Company. The deal would include complete funding of the plot and dwelling in exchange for a £5 upfront payment followed by monthly or quarterly payments over a 7-year period. The purchaser could either choose the plot to invest in, or live in the house themselves. Each plot was sold for £100 with the promise of the land being worth a lot more by the time the instalment term had expired. The directors of the Gidea Hall Development Company agreed to pay the conveyancing costs, including the tax, and a Deed of Conveyance certificate was given to the purchaser on completion. Building on the plots was not a requirement; advice was given that the space could be used for plantation, until such a time when the purchaser wished to build a dwelling. Funding for a house was also offered by the company, in exchange for monthly payments over a 10, 15, or 20-year term. The offer included a 4% discount that would be applied to each purchase and should the purchaser die during the contract, all monies would be paid back to the deceased's estate. ==Gidea Park Modern Homes Exhibition== Francis Skinner for the Gidea Park Modern Homes Exhibition in 1934 A second competition, separate from the first, was held in Romford Garden Suburb between 31 July and 20 August 1934 and was called the Gidea Park Modern Homes Exhibition.\\"Gidea Park Modern Homes Exhibition Open July 31 to Aug 20 10AM-9PM\\", Victoria and Albert Museum, retrieved 14 January 2020. It was the idea of Raphael's nephew, Major Ralph Raphael MC,Cherry, O'Brien, Pevsner (2005) p. 207. who shared his uncle's 1911 vision; to build affordable, economical houses which benefited from the concept of rational design by leading architects of the day who were in competition with each other. The competition was won by the 26-year-old Francis Skinner, who had been articled to Berthold Lubetkin two years previously and who was a founding member of Lubetkin's Tecton Group.Obituary: Francis Skinner, The Independent, 17 January 1998. Retrieved 14 January 2020. The dwelling, 64 Heath Drive, was built at a cost of £900 and was one of Tecton's first designs. The exhibition was opened by the Earl of Crawford and it was visited by the Prince of Wales. It ran for 18 days\\"Prince of Wales coming to Romford\\", Chelmsford Chronicle, 30 November 1934, p. 10. but failed to achieve the kind of success that the 1911 exhibition did.

At various times, Clédat's expeditions was sponsored by (the Suez Canal Company), the Supreme Council of Antiquities, the , and the itself. ==Biography== Clédat was born in in 1871. Thanks to the archaeological program instilled by Gaston Maspero, head of Egyptian Antiquities, Clédat was sent in search of Christian monuments of Egypt. In 1901, he began excavating Bawit (French: Baouît) and in the winter of 1903–4, he uncovered the Bawit monastery of Apa Apollo, founded in the fourth century. He made further excavations at Bawit until 1905; the ostraca and papyri that he unearthed are now housed in the and the Ismalia Museum of Cairo. He was responsible for excavating many prestigious archaeological sites in Egypt, including Deir Abu Hennis, St. Simeon Monastery, Aswan, Asyut, Akhmim, Sohag, Luxor, Elephantine, Tell el-Herr, Tell el-Maskhouta, Mahemdiah and El Qantara. At Qasr-Gheit (North Sinai), Clédat concluded that it had been a Nabataean station on a secondary caravan route from Arabia to Egypt. In the second half of 1904, Prince Augustus of Arenberg, on behalf of the Board of Directors of the , committed Clédat as director of the company's archaeological excavations. In 1910, Clédat excavated at Pelusium in Tell el-Farama, and made a sketch map of the site and also discovered an inscription mentioning Emperor Hadrian. At various times, Clédat's expeditions were sponsored by others, including the Supreme Council of Antiquities, the Comite, and the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale. Clédat was a prolific author. In his essay, \\"\\" (1919), he described Egyptian methods of defense and offense upon the present Suez Canal route in ancient times. In (1910), the remains of a Byzantine fortress at the same locality are illustrated by a plan, and the Israelite passage of the Red Sea includes an excellent map. Clédat was quite well known for his drawings and outlines. He was a talented artist, and regularly published his work, leaving valuable books still being studied today. After his death in 1943, his archives were donated to the Louvre by his daughter.

To secure a wider field, Nordheimer emigrated to New York in 1835. He held the professorship of Hebrew and cognate languages at the University of the City of New York from 1836 to 1842, and received the appointment of instructor in sacred literature at Union Theological Seminary, where he remained from 1838 until 1842. He enjoyed the friendship of notable biblical scholars of his time, and many of his pupils later occupied posts of eminence. ==Literary works== Among his contributions to the Biblical Repository, \\"The Philosophy of Ecclesiastes\\" (July 1838) was particularly notable. In 1838 he published the first volume of his elaborate Hebrew grammar, and in 1841 the second volume (2d ed., with additions and improvements, 2 vols., New York, 1842). Another work was A Grammatical Analysis of Select Portions of Scripture, or a Chrestomathy (New York, 1838). Nordheimer left several works in manuscript; a Chaldee and Syriac grammar and an Arabic grammar in German; a larger Arabic grammar in English; a Hebrew concordance, incomplete; Ecclesiastes translated and explained, in German; and a mass of philological notes. ==See also== * Samuel Nordheimer ==References== * * Category:1809 births Category:1842 deaths Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:German Jews Category:New York University faculty Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni Category:American biblical scholars ","title":"Isaac Nordheimer"},{"id":"35207251","text":"Deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a significant transnational issue. In the DRC, forests are cleared for agricultural purposes by utilizing slash and burn techniques. Aside from the visible depletion of resources, deforestation of the DRC also leads to a lost habit for the mountain gorilla among other rare species like the okapi, resulting in decreased biodiversity, soil erosion, and contribute to climate change. Since 1990 till 2015, the rate of deforestation in the DRC has remained constant at 0.20%, which equates to the loss of 311,000 hectares, or roughly 1,200 square miles, annually. This amounts to destroying forests the size of Delaware every two years. The fact that the rate of deforestation has remained constant over more than twenty years is misleading as one might believe that government or non-government organizations (NGO) interventions have been responsible for the decline, but reports indicate otherwise. Three reasons have been postulated as to why deforestation rates had remained relatively low: 1) the road network within the country has been gradually in decline making access to more remote areas more difficult, 2) political and regulatory changes have disincentivized investment in the country, and 3) agriculture has expanded outside of forest areas. Additionally, while the rates remained constant, wood removal (measured in cubic meters) continues to dramatically increase annually. Industrialized roundwood has increased from 3.05 million cubic meters in 1990 to 4.45 million cubic meters in 2010; fuelwood has increased from 44.2 million cubic meters to 75.44 million cubic meters annually in that same time. From 2015 to 2019 the rate of tree-felling in the Democratic Republic of Congo has doubled. The rainforest in the Congo Basin is the largest rainforest in Africa and second only to the Amazon Basin in size, with 300 million hectare compared to the 800 million hectares in the Amazon. Roughly fifty percent (154 million hectare) of the remaining rainforest in the Congo Basin lies within the boundaries of the DRC. The DRC is one of the most Flora rich countries on the continent. It is home for more than 10,000 types of plants, 600 timber species, as well as 1,000 bird species, 280 reptile species, and 400 mammal species, including the forest elephant, gorilla, forest buffalo, bongo, and okapi. Many of these wildlife species are threatened animals such as large lowland gorillas and chimpanzees. The deforestation destroys the biological diversity in the Congo Basin forest. Specifically, 60 percent of the forest elephant population drops due to the loss of shelter caused by illegal logging. ==Causes of deforestation== The direct causes of deforestation within the DRC are well understood and have been identified consistently by many sources. The direct causes are as follows: 1) road infrastructure development, 2) slashing and burning the forests to transform forest land into agricultural land, 3) the collection of fuelwood and charcoal, and lastly 4) unregulated artisanal and small-scale logging. The United Nations Environment Programme has identified the priority in which the causes should be addressed as slash and burn agriculture first, the collection of fuelwood second, unregulated artisanal and logging third, and road infrastructure development fourth. Road construction A typical logging road in Africa. Both mining and logging create similar secondary deforestation through road construction. Specifically, logging companies construct new roads into previously inaccessible forest areas which facilitates the conversion of logged forests by into agricultural land. This has led to the immigration of landless farmers, in particular from eastern savanna regions, to enter primary forest areas through logging roads. Incoming farmers cause extensive land degradation in converting the natural forest into farmlands. Further, it has been suggested that increases in returns can lead to substantial increase in farm sizes and shortening of the fallow period, which in turn eventually leads to large-scale and severe natural forest area destruction. Deforested lands in the DRC, which used to be forest. Transformation into agricultural land The United Nations Environment Programme has identified slash and burn agriculture which produces reduced fall periods, as the most pressing issue related to the deforestation of the DRC. This is the process of clearing land for agricultural use through burning the forest. This problem has deep roots as much of the DRC's population is dependent on this sort of slash and burn rain-fed agriculture for its sustenance. Practicing this style of intensive agriculture with short periods of soil rest leads to soil degradation and desertification. This has resulted in increasing levels of food insecurity, and as much as 70 percent of the population of the DRC is estimated to be malnourished according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Food Programme. As the soil degrades and desertification occurs, farmers are forced to continually move farther out to find new land to farm which repeats the process all over again; thereby, farmers are exacerbating the clearing of natural forests. Furthermore, current farming practices are inefficient and unsustainable. When farmers move farther out to workable land, they are at the same time increasing the distance between themselves and markets where they can sell their produce. With almost no facilities for refrigeration, post-harvest crop losses can reach up to 80 percent. Currently the DRC is heavily reliant on imported food, which further places pressure on the forest lands to be cleared for agricultural purposes. In 2010, the DRC's top import from the United States was meat, while they exported oil resources. Fuelwood and charcoal collection Fuelwood and charcoal collection has been classified as a key driver for deforestation as it is used to account for 95% the population's energy needs. The population's dependence on fuelwood for energy creates rings of fragmented forest around urban areas, which in turn calls for longer and longer forest excursions to supply a never ending demand for fuelwood. The United Nations Environment Programme's Post-conflict Environmental Assessment Synthesis for Policy Makers reported that approximately 89 hectares of forest was lost each day due to illegal fuelwood harvesting during the peak of the post-Second Congo War conflict. It is estimated that 72 million m3 of fuelwood and charcoal are \\"produced\\" annually. Charcoal, or Makala, is inefficient to produce but is a preferred source of energy in the DRC. While it is virtually free to use fuelwood as a source of energy, charcoal increases in popularity as an energy source due to several advantages over fuelwood. Charcoal has higher calorific value per unit weight (31.8 MJ per kg) compared to fuelwood (16 MJ per kg); and charcoal is smaller and easier to store. Charcoal is also mostly smokeless and is not liable to deterioration by fungi or insects which attack fuelwood. With these benefits, charcoal is particularly popular in cities. However, even in rural areas in Goma, North Kivu for example, charcoal is also widely used. On average, each person uses 1 to 1.6 cubic meter of fuelwood and 80 to 95 kg of charcoal annually. Regardless of the purposes, commercial or personal, fuelwood and charcoal are mostly collected by women and children in most regions in Africa. The price of charcoal increases especially in large cities, such as Kinshasa, because vast amounts of forest are deforested close to the city and the cost of transportation increases as the distance of wood sources are farther away. Artisanal and industrial logging Artisanal Artisanal logging in the DRC is characterized as logging activities without concession from the government at the national level. Unregulated artisanal and small-scale logging is estimated to represent 75% of the total timber exports from the DRC and happens at a rate of 5 to 8 times greater than industrial logging. However, this practice is still dwarfed in comparison to the total amount of wood being gathered annually for fuelwood and charcoal production, which happens at an amount 30 times greater than artisanal logging. There are three types of forest codes in the DRC—public institutions, private, and community forests. Artisanal logging takes place under community forest area. Community forests are owned by community chiefs or landlords who have the power to grant small-scale logging that are not regulated by the national government. Many of these community owned forests where artisanal logging are located in the northeast part of the DRC. Artisanal logging is profitable but it is also deemed to be illegal. However, corruption in the local government allows the logging to continue. To perform artisanal logging, the logger needs to obtain permit from the local government. With approval by the community chief, loggers can obtain a permit; yet, they have to report the harvest to local forestry technicians. These local forestry offices are considered the appropriate entity for approving the logging permits while they do not have the capacity to conduct forest inventory and forest mapping. Since the forest code does not have comprehensive mechanism to stop such logging activities, loggers continue to purchase logging rights from the local community. Depending on the scale of the logging, the community would demand different types of payment from loggers. One community in the North Kivu area, they demanded the logger to give them a 4x4 truck and upgrade the public infrastructures, which are not well provided for by the local government. Although the logger did not accept the request, this illustrates why locals want artisanal logging to exist. Although artisanal logging provides some income for the community in the short-run, it ultimately does not improve local living conditions. In the end, the communities receive payments which are not large enough to cover the loss of their natural resources. Since there is no monitoring mechanism, the loggers report lower harvested amounts than they actually do in order to pay less tax to the local government. Some loggers cut one tree within the woods and leave the rest intact to mimic natural disturbance. To improve the situation, the DRC government needs better monitoring and better forest code to manage the logging activities. An industrial logging operation in the Congo Basin. Industrial Relative to agricultural land transformation, fuelwood and charcoal collection, and artisanal collection logging, industrial logging has a minor direct impact on forest destruction in the DRC in recent years due to the collapse of local markets in the early 1990s. However, logging has significant indirect effects as mentioned previously because of the roads constructed for it. The collapse of the logging industry in the 1990s has changed the industry into one of selective logging where only very large trees of high value are being extracted for export. As of 1999, 87% of the total volume of wood harvested was one of five species of African mahogany. These selective logging practices yield only 8.7 cubic meters (the volume less than that of one tree) per hectare. This creates a scenario where many roads are created to move very few selected trees from the forest. This creates access to previously secluded areas which expedites the rate of forest accessibility thereby allowing populations to move in to collect fuelwood, hunt bushmeat, and start clearing the land for agriculture. It is important to consider who is driving the demand for industrial logging operations within the DRC and the sustainability of the industry. Currently in the DRC, it is estimated that as much as 80% of all timber that is officially exported by the DRC heads to the European market. The majority of the exports are shipped to Portugal, Germany, and France. Thus, it is not surprising to see that historically the largest forest concession owner in the DRC had been a German company, Danzer, which held 2.1 million hectares of the active concessions which total 8.2 million hectare (recently this company's subsidiaries who held the logging concessions was sold the American-based Groupe Blattner Elwyn (GBE)). When looking at the sustainable practices of the large logging companies in the DRC, they are less than sustainable. According to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), a leader in certification for sustainable forestry practices, GBE will not be pursuing FSC certification for their practice in the DRC. In addition to the country's major logging companies not pursuing sustainable logging practices, it is common place for logging to take place illegally within protected forest areas. A report by Forests Monitor and Rainforest Foundation published in 2007 found that there is little evidence that industrial logging alleviates poverty, but instead actually contributes to it. This is mainly due to access to forest areas becoming restricted and money not filtering down to local people. \\"Keeping in mind that the Law only provides for conservation of 15% of the DRC’s forests and that more than 40% are earmarked for commercial logging, we still do not know what percentage of Congolese forests are to be returned back to the indigenous communities to enable them to practice their cultural and socio-economic activities\\" (Byayuwa). Industrial logging concessions stop indigenous people having access to their forests, which they traditionally rely on for their livelihood through NTFPs (non-timber forest products, such as food products, plants of medicinal value, fuelwood and fallow fields). In addition to the restricted access to these resources, there are other damaging effects caused by the damage to the water courses that logging can create, which cuts fish resources and water that could be used for crop irrigation. Industrial logging brings a lot of people in to the area to work for the logging companies, who are often given only short-term contracts. Once these contracts are finished, they then have to find new jobs in the area. This influx of logging workers can create competition for bushmeat resources. For locals who do get jobs with the logging companies, the working conditions can be bad and the pay low, some paying only 50 US cents a day. ==Consequences of deforestation== Climate change There are two ways that deforestation can cause changes in climate – by changing greenhouse gas emissions and eco- climate impact, or by changing the eco-service patterns, in this case, rainfall. Forests are sinks for carbon. Rainforest, in particular, hold great amounts of carbon with their complex and robust ecosystems. Forest within the DRC currently hold 17 million tons of carbon, which is the largest stock in Africa. Reductions to this carbon amount are occurring as a result of deforestation. When considering a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario of the development in the DRC, using current demographic and socioeconomic development trends, future environmental impacts caused from land degradation and deforestation can be evaluated. Researchers estimated that in the BAU scenario deforestation will claim 12-13 million hectares by 2030 which equates to 149 Million tons (Mt) of CO2e not being treated. And due to deforestation, the net annual emissions will grow from 71 Mt CO2e in 2007 to 149 Mt CO2e by 2030. Further, research has demonstrated that increased replacement of tropical rainforest vegetation with savanna grasslands can produce undesired climate changes in Africa. Forests are also providers of rainfall. The destruction of forest prevent such eco-services and lead to change in landscape. In areas that are heavily deforested, rainfall can decrease throughout the year; and specifically if over deforestation occurs in southern Africa, it may result in increased rainfall in the southern region of the DRC. This intensifies the loss of topsoil, prevents tall plants from growing back (changing the landscape permanently), and furthers the eco-climate change pattern. Naturally, this change does not only affect plant life but animals as well. Researchers have also begun running simulations to predict future conditions and concluded that great biodiversity loss will result if the DRC continues its current deforestation patterns. The Salonga National Park, for example, stands to lose around 7 species of mammals by 2050, and 19 species by 2080 if the DRC population do not reduce their heat-trapping emissions which result from deforestation. Bushmeat An example of bushmeat, meat that is from the \\"bush\\". In the Congo over 1.7 million tons of bushmeat are consumed annually. While road access has been shown to increase land clearing for farming, it also has other indirect yet significant implications for hunting and the bushmeat trade. Bushmeat refers to wildlife that live in the forest. In Africa, the forest are often referred to as \\"the bush\\", thus creating the term bushmeat. Bushmeat may include any sort of animal that lives in the forest that is hunted for its meat. In the DRC, the majority of bushmeat consists of artiodactyla species and make up almost 90% of all bushmeat trade. After artiodactyla species, primates consist of the next largest group at about 5% of all traded bushmeat. Even elephants which are known for being hunted for ivory are considered targets for bushmeat trade as a single elephant can provide thousands of kilos of meat which can be easier to sell than its ivory. From 2002 to 2013, the DRC elephant population decreased dramatically from roughly 62,000 to 5,000.Vera, Varun and Ewing, Thomas (April 2014) Ivory's Curse Born Free USA and C4ADS, Retrieved 17 May 2014 In the DRC, with the wide expanses of forest, high income can be obtained from the meat trade; consequently, almost no sort of wildlife protection enforcement can prevent the consumption and trade of bushmeat, which continues to rise. Road construction from logging and mining operations decreases the distance hunters have to walk to reach a given section of the forest to hunt, making what was previously a multi-day trip possible to complete within a day. Additionally it has been shown that as logging increases, wages and demand for bushmeat increases as well; this leads to the increased export of bushmeat from the forest. Further, loggers themselves consume high amounts of bushmeat, eating it at a rate of two to three times more often than rural families who eat bushmeat roughly two days per week. Logging also allows hunters to kill many more animals on each hunting trip as the hunters no longer need to carry the dead animals such long distances as logging vehicles can transport the animals. Currently, it is reported that over 1.7 million tonnes of bushmeat are consumed each year in the DRC at an estimated value of over US$1 billion. The bushmeat trade, besides having a direct effect on the animal populations which are being hunted, has disastrous effects on the ecosystem as a whole. Depletion of animal populations directly threatens the ability for some of the larger forest carnivores. Additionally, decreases in the populations of seed- dispersing animals directly affects tree regeneration rates, forest structure, and composition. Soil erosion Deforestation leads to serious problems with soil erosion as can be witness at Mont Mangengenge near Kinshasa. Soil erosion happens in the deforested areas of the DRC, which are mostly in the southern part of the country; and it is most intense in populous cities such as the capital Kinshasa, territory of Luberu, and the surroundings of Kasenyi near southern Lake Albert. Soil erosion has a mixture of causes, including mismanagement of land, climate change, intensive agricultural practice, and lack of adequate protection infrastructure/maintenance for soil. Land mismanagement is a substantial problem in the DRC and contributes to soil erosion. The cities in DRC have not adopted any new urban plans for decades and now many cities are facing fast urban sprawl which is a major contributor of the deforestation in these areas (via fuelwood and charcoal collection). The city of Kinshasa, for example, is still using the physical environment created from the colonial era but it now has a population of more than 10 million people. Urbanization is typically associated with more opportunities for employment and economic growth. This is not the case in Kinshasa and other cities in the DRC which are experiencing population stress largely due to migrant refugees coming from the armed conflict zones in the east. As noted by Nelson Mandela, former president of South Africa, the only region in the world where urbanization is associated with negative economic growth in the world is Sub-Saharan Africa. Due to inadequate infrastructure to accommodate their surging population, informal settlements on the outskirts of the cities are being formed. Many refugees deforest the unexplored land and build squatters settlements, or slums, on the steeps, exploiting many hilly areas. Development of these hilly lands not only increase the rate of erosion but also put the inhabitants vulnerable to the risk of landslide, adding factors of insecurity to the already underprivileged community. Although these settlements are illegal, the government does not have the will nor power to form urban plans, strategies to stop people from migrating, or to regulate the migrants' behavior. Without formal sources of income, these communities practice slash- and-burn agriculture, resting the land only every 2 to 3 years, to make their ends meet. With intensive agriculture, the lands are quickly depleted and desertified. Without letting the forest regenerate, farmers cut down new forests and in turn expand the amount of desertified land which is very prone to erosion. Although the problem of soil erosion in these city areas are known, little has been done to address the issue. Few small-scale projects have demonstrated an ability to help protect the integrity of the soil, but no scalable ones have been implemented due to lack of funding. Soil erosion is also considered such a serious matter that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has sent agents to inspect the reactor in Kinshasa and concluded that soil erosion could soon threaten the safety of nuclear power plants. Landscape change can also alter weather patterns. The Congo basin used to be covered by rainforest, yet an expansion of savannah in Central Africa has extending the sandy soil area because of deforestation. The generation of oxygen by forest are contributors to the rainfall system. However, deforestation has disrupted the ecosystem services and created an eco-climate issue. The rainfall pattern in this area has been characterized as a heavy rain season and a severe dry season. The missing forest has intensified the already dichotomy climate, increasing the episodes of violent rainfall and extending the dry season. With long dry spells, the vegetation in these areas can become sparse. This results in no soil protection during the rainy season and creates more soil erosion problems. ==Response== Observers in neighboring countries have mixed feelings of the overall deforestation of the Congo Basin. Some fear of famine as \\"farmers prefer to cut trees down to make charcoal and sell it ... rather than wait two years to harvest a field of cassava\\". Also as a result of deforestation, hunting has decreased locally as animals are forced to move to new areas. Yet, others view the deforestation as simply a means of survival. Selling firewood can bring the equivalent of $1000 each month for those farmers able to produce one hundred 15-kilo sacks which sell for approximately $10 in most areas. Average citizens of the DRC are reliant on fuelwood as are many citizens across Africa. Within the DRC, the government has implemented initiatives such as the Agricultural and Rural Sector Rehabilitation Support Project (PARSAR). Yet corruption within the law enforcement sector of the government allows deforestation to continue. Laws have been passed to stop the wholesale demolition of the basin, yet bribes to government officials have been speculated as to the reason why little has changed. Additionally, most of the parties involved in the sale of wood and charcoal are former militiamen, which add elements of fear that a civil war might resume if their products were to be seized. The international community has taken an interest on this issue. On April 2, 2009, the World Bank's board of directors approved a grant targeted at improving the DRC's Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation and Tourism to handle forest projects and increase collaboration between civil society, government institutions, and other stakeholders. On July 14, 2011, the World Bank's board of directors approved a Global Environment Facility Trust Fund Grant of $13M to fund a project focused on strengthening the capacities of Congo Basin countries on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) issues. The REDD campaign aims to extend the usage of ameliorated ovens to about 5 million urban households. Another way the government plans to address the issue of deforestation due to fuelwood is by providing electricity over certain territories to meet 60% of the needs by 2030. Private organizations such as Mercy Corps and WWF have begun to address the crisis in terms of fuelwood caused deforestation by introducing fuelwood plantations (such as the EcoMakala reforestation projectEcoMakala Project) as well as provide training for rural people to build fuel efficient cooking stoves (i.e. Goma StoveThese handmade cookstoves save fuel—and help save gorillas). Certain organizations are looking into biomass briquette substitution in order to reduce the demand for fuelwood. Sustainable fuelwood production techniques are also being implemented. The EcoMakala reforestation project under the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has pledged to reforest 4500 ha by 2012 to provide the people of Goma with fuelwood. In the project, the trees are planted on soil belonging to local farmers, with the farmer's permission. The farmer hence becomes owner of the trees, and is able to make his own charcoal from these using a clamp. This amount of wood being planted to offset fuelwood collection is minimal when considering that over 300,000 ha of forest are destroyed each year alone. The REDD campaign is aimed at addressing climate change as all of it projects are working towards an overall world reduction in its emissions by approximately 17 Gt CO2e by 2020 in order to arrive at the GHG atmospheric concentration target of 445 parts per million (pm) of CO2e. While these efforts surely will help, they are by no means a solution to the problem. With citizens so dependent on fuelwood and charcoal for their energy basic needs (i.e. cooking) and livelihood, until the country is able to provide citizens with alternative sources of energy (i.e. electricity and alternative jobsVirunga: jobs protecting forests) the situation will likely not improve. Some jobs have recently become available through projects undertaken by the Virunga Alliance.What is the Virunga alliance ? These include a hydroelectric plant, (Virunga Energies), a chocolate factory (Virunga Origins Chocolate) and a soap factory Sicovir soap factory.Virunga: jobs protecting forests There is also chia seed factory nearbyChia seed factoryCompagnie des Produits Agricoles du Kivu. Preliminary agreements have been reached between the Minister for the Environment of the DRC and the European Union Commission to launch a program named Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade agreement (FLEGT). This program aims to develop a system to improve the traceability and ensure legality of wood being imported to Europe. The use of independent observer programs of forest law enforcement and governance (IM-FLEG), carried out by organizations such as Resource Extraction Monitoring, can enhance the credibility of timber legality verification, and supports the efforts of those governments officially committed to cleaning up corruption in the sector. ==See also== * Mining industry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since they need a large scale for them to mine they end up cutting the trees hence promoting soil erosion * Fair trade cocoa * Emmanuel de Merode * Shea butter: alternative for palm oil * BOS Foundation * == References == Congo, Democratic Republic of the Category:Environment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Forestry in Africa ","title":"Deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"id":"35207275","text":"Peter Platt (23 January 1883 – 1921) was an English footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Liverpool in The Football League.

The band's current line-up is Imre Poniklo (vocals, guitars), Oleg Zubkov a.k.a Tooff (bass) and Bence Bátor (drums). Amber Smith were one of the most prominent groups of the Budapest indie music scene in the 2000s. ==History== Amber Smith were formed by singer-songwriter Imre Poniklo in 2000 as a side-project in Budapest, Hungary. Imre Poniklo was the guitarist of the Hungarian alternative band Fanzine. At that time the singer of the Fanzine was José Simon, a professional graphic designer, who is currently the stylist of Amber Smith. In 2000 Imre Poniklo asked his fellow Fanzine mates (Ákos Örményi, Péter Egyedi, Ádám Földes) help him recording a demo entitled Above the Clouds. Later the German Firestaion Records released four songs from this early demo entitled There's No Way. After releasing one studio album entitled Nincs Ránk Szükség (There's No Need for Us), and a five-song demo entitled Pozitív (Positive), Imre Poniklo left Hungary and moved to London, England and then to Ireland. The remaining members of the band formed the band, Annabarbi. In 2002 Oszkár Ács (previously played in Időrablók from Szeged) joined the band and in the same year Amber Smith recorded their first studio album in English language entitled My Little Servant. At the same time the line-up was changed four times (Nathan Johnson, Pete Pawinski, Tamás Faragó and Tibor Simon). The album My Little Servant was released in 2003 followed by a tour in Germany, France, Spain and Croatia. In addition, Imre Poniklo presented the album in Tokyo, Japan as a solo artist. Imre Poniklo wrote the song Were You Thinking of Me for Yonderboi's Splendid Isolation album in 2005. Later Zoltán Kőváry arrived and they recorded their first successful record entitled rePRINT in 2006.

The producer of the album was Amber Smith and additionally Robin Guthrie (from Cocteau Twins) except the song rePRINT which was produced by Hungarian indie artist Yonderboi. The album was mastered by Jácint Jiling and mixed by Robin Guthrie and Gábor Deutsch. This time additional musicians contributed to the creation of the album. Violins were played by Dóra Maros and Györgyi Tihanyi while viola was played by Tímea Kerekes. The album was released by Kalinkaland Records. Introspective At the end of 2006 Amber Smith started working on their next album entitled Introspective. This time with a different producer called Chris Brown, who previously worked on Radiohead's The Bends as an engineer and on Muse's Origin of Symmetry. The eponymous first single Introspective was released in November 2007.

The band recorded four full-length studio albums with Ács, who also contributed to the songwriting with songs like Welcome To C.I.A., Bourbon and Soda, Faster Than The Speed of Light, Your Life Is My Death, Hong Kong Falls. Ács spent about 10 years with the band and later determined the sound of the band with his unique bass playing style. Another Way On 29 November 2013, Amber Smith released their EP entitled Another Way. The EP contains the title track and Merciful Sea written by Poniklo and Zubkov. The album was recorded at Supersize Studio and Echo Studio in Budapest and it was mixed by György Ligeti and mastered at Abnormal Studios in Pesterzsébet.

During the 1950s, as a Captain, he was a 2 i/c of the Support Company and also Rifle Company Commander in the Baloch Regiment as well as a Battalion Adjutant as a Major, and for a time his Battalion was posted in East Pakistan. He was promoted to Major in 1952 and to Lieutenant Colonel in 1957. He attended the Senior Staff Course (for Division level staff officers) at the Staff College Quetta in 1954-55. After serving briefly as Brigade Major and as aide-de-camp to Iskandar Ali Mirza in 1955-56 and as an Instructor and Adjutant at the Pakistan Military Academy between 1956 and 1958, he was the Commanding Officer of the 11th Battalion of the Baloch Regiment between 1958 and 1960 and CO of the 12th Battalion between 1960 and 1961. In his capacity as Battalion Commander he was for a time also the Martial Law Administrator of Pakpattan District. In 1961 he was selected for a Military Intelligence appointment under the Directorate-General of Military Intelligence. He was promoted to Colonel in 1963, and in 1965 he was the Military Intelligence Field Officer attached with the 6th Armoured Division at Chawinda, and he was awarded with the Sitara-e-Jurat for his combat support service during the war. He was promoted to the rank of Brigadier in 1967 and was for most of the time after that a Departmental Director in the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, except for a short stint as Commandant of the Baluch Regimental Centre & Recruit Depot (BRC&RD;) at Abbottabad in 1969-70. During 1971 he was with the Pakistani forces fighting Bangladeshi independence which suffered painful defeats at the hands of the Indian Army.Abhijit Bhattacharyya, THE TURBULENT HISTORY OF THE STATE WITHIN A STATE from The Telegraph dated 12 February 2012, at telegraphindia.com, accessed 6 April 2012 With the rank of Brigadier he was Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-chief of Eastern Command until the middle of 1971, when he was promoted Major-General and posted to Pakistan's principal intelligence agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, as Director General.Hasan Zaheer, The Separation of East Pakistan: the rise and realisation of Bengali Muslim Nationalism (Oxford University Press, 1994), p. 505: \\"Brigadier Ghulam Jillani, Chief of Staff to the Commander Eastern Command until the middle of the year... From 1971 to 1978 Jilani headed the ISI, being the third man to hold the position.Sabir Shah, Lieutenant General Zaheer 18th DG ISI since 1959 dated 10 March 2012, at thenews.com.pk, Retrieved 24 March 2012: \\"The 17 Pakistan army officials who have headed the ISI to date, are: Brigadier Riaz Hussain (1959 to 1966), Major General (then Brig) Mohammad Akbar Khan (1966 to 1971), Lieutenant General (then Major General) Ghulam Jilani Khan (1971 to 1978)...\\" In that role, he served three Pakistani governments, those headed successively by Yahya Khan, Z. A. Bhutto, and Zia-ul-Haq.Ashok Kapur, Pakistan in Crisis (Routledge, 2002), p. 128 In 1976, when Tikka Khan retired as Chief of Army Staff, Jilani was the fifth most senior army officer. Tikka Khan considered those in the first, second and fourth positions unsuitable to replace him, so recommended the third most senior officer, Akbar Khan, to Prime Minister and Defence Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. In the event, Bhutto ignored this recommendation and chose instead General Zia-ul-Haq, seventh in the list of seniority. Jilani, who lacked the experience of combat formation command above higher than an infantry Battalion, was thus passed over, but in fact he had lobbied Bhutto to appoint Zia, and Bhutto later wrote that he had been influenced in the matter by General Jilani Khan.Ḥusain Ḥaqqānī, Pakistan: between Mosque and Military (Carnegie Endowment, 2005), pp. 111, 112 In April 1976, and again in October, Jilani sent reports to Bhutto which recommended the holding of fresh elections sooner rather than later, and Bhutto agreed with this advice.Ḥaqqānī (2005), p. 114 The 1977 general election had been expected in the second half of the year, but on 7 January Bhutto announced that the election would be held on 7 March.Surendra Nath Kaushik, Pakistan under Bhutto's leadership (1985), p. 259: \\"Bhutto stated in the National Assembly on January 7, 1977 that general elections in Pakistan would be held on March 7, 1977.\\" When he was later awaiting execution, Bhutto hinted that he might have been trapped in a conspiracy. ==Public life== In October 1977, a few months after Zia-ul-Haq's \\"Operation Fair Play\\" coup d'état had removed Bhutto and his government from office, with Zia himself becoming Chief Martial Law Administrator, Jilani joined Zia's government as Secretary General at the Ministry of Defence. In February 1979, he led a Military Goodwill Delegation to the People's Republic of China, where he had discussions with Chairman Hua Guofeng and Vice Premier Li Xiannian.Peter Cheng, Chronology of the People's Republic of China, 1970–1979 (Scarecrow Press, 1986), p. 486Beijing Review, vol. 22, no. 7, dated 16 February 1979, p. 142 Jilani remained at the Ministry of Defence until 1 May 1980, when he was appointed to succeed General Sawar Khan as Governor of the Punjab Province, a powerful post which he retained until the end of the Military administration in December 1985.Punjab Assembly, 1988–90 (Punjab Provincial Assembly, 1990), p. 27: \\"19. Lt. General Ghulam Jilani Khan 1-5-1980 30-12-1985\\" Unlike Zia-ul-Haq, Jilani was not particularly pietistic in his private life.Ḥaqqānī (2005), p. 112 In political life, he became well known for his conviction that most of Pakistan's political troubles were due to feudal influences, which he was anxious to weaken. He was suspicious of most politicians from rural areas, so he attempted to encourage and promote new urban leaders. Among these was Nawaz Sharif, an industrialist to whom Jilani gave his first political appointment, as Finance Minister in the Punjab provincial government. In 1985 he nominated Sharif as Chief Minister of the Punjab, and Sharif went on to become Prime Minister of Pakistan.Aminullah Chaudry, 'The Army in Pakistan's Politics' in Hijacking from the Ground: The Bizarre Story of PK 805 (2009), p. 14 When the Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang visited Pakistan for talks in June 1981 it was Jillani who greeted him at Lahore airport.Daily Report: People's Republic of China, issues 104–114 (United States Foreign Broadcast Information Service, 1981), p. 61 On 31 July 1981 an express train from Karachi to Peshawar crashed near Bahawalpur with more than thirty dead, and Jilani announced the same day that he suspected sabotage.Hasan Akhtar, 'Sabotage may have caused rail crash which killed 30' in The Times, issue 60995 dated 1 August 1981, p. 5, col.

A On 30 December 1985 he stood down as Governor of the Punjab, to be succeeded by Makhdoom Muhammad Sajjad Hussain Qureshi. ==Retirement== In retirement, Jilani took up the cause of the proposed new independent Chand Bagh School, to be a Pakistani boarding school inspired by his own alma mater, the Doon School. After several years of effort, he succeeded in founding the new school, which opened at Muridke in September 1998.Nauman Tasleem, Punjab govt donates Rs 60m to an elite school from Pakistan Today dated 17 June 2011 online at pakistantoday.com.pk, Retrieved 24 March 2012 Jillani occasionally wrote on military subjects, and on 5 June 1999, not long before his death, the newspaper Pakistan published an article under his name which analysed the conflict in Kashmir in terms of the region's strategic roads.Summary of world broadcasts: Asia, Pacific, issues 3549–3561 (British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring Service, 1999), p.

I was thinking about it and I started to kind of hating tennis for a while, and I wanted to get away from the pro tennis deal.

Central City Opera Beginning in the early 1970s, Wolfe served as chorus master and a staff conductor at Central City Opera Festival, working closely with conductor John Moriarty. He also served the organization in various administrative capacities, maintaining a twenty-year relationship with the festival. Colorado Children's Chorale As a conductor at Central City, Wolfe was responsible for establishing a children's choral ensemble for a 1974 production of Benjamin Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream. With this group of singers he founded the Colorado Children's Chorale, a youth choir based in Denver, Colorado. Under Wolfe's leadership and preparation the group achieved national recognition, appearing on NBC’s Today Show, CBS Christmas specials and BBC broadcasts of The Proms at Royal Albert Hall with the BBC Orchestra and Chorus of Wales. Other performances have included collaborations with Opera Colorado, Colorado Ballet, Opera Omaha, Toledo Opera, the Grand Teton Music Festival and the Aspen Music Festival, where they sang the children's chorus in a 1994 performance of Mahler's Symphony No. 8, in addition to appearances with many famous classical and popular musicians.Berger, Bruce.

He sang a number of important roles in the operas of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and other composers. ==Life== Historical background and early career He was born c. 1745 in Livorno and began his early career there around 1768.Link (2004, vii) The start of Benucci's career took place in an already flourishing world of opera buffa, which provided an existing role type, the comic bass singer or buffo, at which Benucci came to excel. The historical background is described by Rice: :In one of his earliest appearances (Livorno 1768) Benucci sang Tritemio in Il filosofo di campagna. That he began his career in an opera by Galuppi and Goldoni and in a role created by Carattoli is emblematic of his place in the history of opera buffa. He took up the tradition ... to which Goldoni, in collaboration with composers as Galuppi and such singers as Carattoli, had contributed so much in the late 1740s and 1750s; he maintained and developed that tradition for a new generation of operatic audiences, many of whom had never seen Carattoli perform.Rice (1998, 341) He performed in Florence in 1769. No record survives of Benucci's activities between spring 1769 and 1774. He spent the years 1774 to 1777 in Madrid,Link (2009:91) and starting in autumn 1777, there is documentation of performances in the major opera houses of Italy, including Venice, Milan, and Rome.Link (2004, vii). Link pp. xiv–xvi provides a full list of the roles Benucci is known to have performed. Move to Vienna In 1783 the Austrian Emperor Joseph II founded a new opera company specializing in Italian opera buffa. At the time Benucci was singing at the Teatro San Samuele in Venice. Count Giacomo Durazzo, who was both an experienced former theater director and the Emperor's ambassador,Heartz (1986, 256) was able to secure his services. At the same time Durazzo recruited the outstanding English soprano Nancy Storace, who was also singing at San Samuele. Storace was later to sing the role of Susanna when Benucci sang the title role at the premiere of The Marriage of Figaro.Parker (2001, 108) Both singers were offered high salaries, over 4000 florins. With further recruitment (notably the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte), an outstanding ensemble was formed.Parker (2001, 109) writes: \\"During the two years leading up to the premiere of Figaro, these singers were welded into the finest buffa ensemble anywhere.\\" Silhouette of Francesco Benucci and Nancy Storace by (1786) The new company opened 2 April 1783 with a performance of Antonio Salieri's La scuola de' gelosi; Benucci took the buffo role of Blasio. This opera was an immediate success, with over 25 performances, and a critic wrote, \\"the buffo is so natural that he is regarded as the best ever seen here. The others are not worth mentioning.\\"Abert (2006, 802) Mozart evidently attended, and on 7 May wrote home to his father Leopold, \\"The Italian opera buffa has started up here again and is proving very popular. The buffo is particularly good, he's called Benucci.\\" Benucci continued with the Emperor's company for a total of twelve years. Among other roles he played: *Rosmondo in Gli sposi malcontenti by Stephen Storace (1785) *Trofonio in La grotta di Trofonio by Salieri (1785) *Tita in Una cosa rara by Martín y Soler (1786) *Axur in Axur, re d'Ormus by Salieri (1788) His participation in the company appears to have been so important that it would not have survived without him. On 7 June 1783, the Emperor wrote to the theater director, Count Franz Orsini- Rosenberg, \\"Since it appears to me that the singer Benucci finds favor with the public, I would like you to try to convince him to stay until Easter and then for one year further; if he agrees to this in a new contract, and if Storace, who also is liked by the public, says, then you can keep the best from among the rest of the troupe; if Benucci and Storace do not stay, then the others need not be kept on.\\" During his earlier years in Vienna Benucci also performed in private concerts in collaboration with Nancy Storace. The diarist Count Zinzendorf noted that each singer served as the other's keyboard accompanist.Raeburn (1956, 15) Twice during his tenure in Vienna Benucci traveled to perform elsewhere. In 1783 he visited Rome to fulfil a commitment already made when he had been hired at Vienna; his \\"enormous popularity\\" there (Link) was witnessed by the Emperor, traveling there at the time. In August 1788, the Emperor, having launched an expensive and futile war with Turkey, proposed to abolish his Italian opera company. On hearing this, Benucci asked for leave and obtained an engagement at the King's Theatre in London, where he performed with Storace, who had returned there in February 1787.Link (2002:9) He achieved only mixed success. One opera in which Benucci and Storace appeared was La vendemmia by Giuseppe Gazzaniga. They interpolated into it a performance of a duet from The Marriage of Figaro, \\"\\".Cambridge Mozart Encyclopedia (2006), p. 410 Benucci returned to Vienna in the same year, as the emperor had relented of his decision to abolish the company. Mozart roles Mozart had no affiliation with the Emperor's Italian opera company and had to work for some time before he could get an opera commission. A failed early effort was the fragment Lo sposo deluso (1783), for which he wrote five numbers before abandoning the project. The marginal notes in the score indicate that Mozart was writing with specific singers in mind, including Benucci.Zaslaw and Cowdery (1998:57) In the years that followed, three completed operas by Mozart were performed by the Emperor's Italian company. All three number among the composer's most celebrated works, and Benucci took an important role in each. In the premiere of The Marriage of Figaro (1786), Benucci performed the title role; Storace played his betrothed Susanna. The rehearsals for this work gave rise to an anecdote related by the tenor Michael Kelly (who was in the cast) in his 1824 memoirs, attesting to Mozart's esteem for Benucci: :I remember Mozart was on the stage with his crimson pelisse and gold laced cocked hat giving the time of the music to the orchestra. Figaro's song, \\"Non piu andrai, farfallone amoroso\\" Benucci gave with the greatest animation and power of voice. I was standing close to Mozart who, sotto voce, was repeating' 'Bravo, bravo! Benucci;' and when Benucci came to the fine passage 'Cherubino, alla vittoria, alla gloria militar,' which he gave out with stentorian lungs, the effect was electricity itself, for the whole of the performers on the stage and those in the orchestra, as if actuated by one feeling of delight, vociferated 'Bravo! bravo! maestro. Viva! viva grande Mozart!Kelly memoirs quoted from Holmes (1854, 281) The \\"electric\\" moment involved a rising major third near the top of Benucci's range, a musical gesture that Link sees as having been later repeated in other music composed for Benucci, by Mozart as well as Salieri.Link (2004, pp. viii–ix) Don Giovanni (1787) was not premiered in Vienna but in Prague. For the subsequent Vienna premiere (1788) Benucci took the role of Leporello. Mozart wrote three new numbers for the Vienna version, including the duet \\"\\", K. 540b, which Benucci performed with the soprano Luisa Laschi-Mombelli. Così fan tutte premiered in 1790; Benucci performed the role of Guglielmo. The high standing of Benucci, both within the company and in Mozart's own estimation, led to difficulties in the composition of the opera. Mozart's original version included a long and elaborate first-act aria for Benucci, \\"Rivolgete a lui lo sguardo\\", K. 584,Link (2004, ix) which ultimately had to be discarded as dramatically inappropriate. In what Woodfield calls a \\"drastic step\\" it was replaced by the more lightweight \\"Non siate retrosi\\".Woodfield (2008:81) Woodfield suggests that it may have been in compensationWoodfield (2008:55) that Mozart altered Benucci's second act aria, the flamboyant \\"Donne mie\\", adding new musical material and parts for trumpets and timpani.Woodfield (2008:51) Later life Benucci continued in the Italian opera in Vienna until 1795.New Grove His greatest success during this period was in Il matrimonio segreto by Domenico Cimarosa (1792). He performed at La Scala in Milan in 1795, in operas by Giuseppe Sarti and by Angelo Tarchi.Eisen (2006, 50) He returned to Livorno in 1797, and eventually stopped performing around 1800. He died in Florence 5 April 1824. ==Assessment== In 1793 a critic for the ' wrote: :Benucci, one of the premier buffos in opera buffa, combines unaffected, excellent acting with an exceptionally round, beautiful, and full bass voice. He is as much a complete singer as a choice actor. He has a rare habit that few Italian singers share: he never exaggerates. Even when he brings his acting to the highest extremes, he maintains propriety and secure limits, which hold him back from absurd, vulgar comedy. I like him particularly in the opera Il matrimonio segreto. He acts and sings the role of the Count in a masterly fashion. I wouldn't have believed that, in spite of being a comedian, he nonetheless still manages to portray Axur by Salieri in a rather serious manner.Quoted from Link (2004, viii) The modern scholar Christopher Raeburn describes Benucci thus: :He had a round, beautifully full voice, more bass than baritone; probably he was the finest artist for whom Mozart wrote, and as a buffo outshone his contemporaries as singer and actor. ==References== Notes Sources *Abert, Hermann (2007) W.

In partnership with William Wallace he re-established the mill in 1873 on lower Main Street in Stroudsburg. Within ten years Kitson became the sole owner and the mill increased from 13 employees to 115 employees with an annual profit of $400,000. By 1886 the mill produced 14,000 yards of 54 inch wide wool cloth per month that was sold in New York City. The mill was originally run by water power and the mill race is located under the mill. Partial steam power was added in 1888 and full steam power in 1893. New construction nearly doubled the size of the mill in 1898. Kitson and the mill are known for setting an unusual world record on May 18, 1898, the shortest time to make a suit of clothes starting from un-sheared sheep. The previous world record was an even 8 hours, set by a Scottish mill. At 6:30 a.m. 6 sheep were brought in to be sheared by six employees. A total of 18 workers sorted, cleaned, dyed, dried, and carded the wool, then spun it into yarn. Cloth, in a black and white checkered pattern, was then woven from the yarn. The next step in the process was to have the cloth made into a suit. Jacob Marks, a Stroudsburg tailor, sewed the suit in 2½ hours with the help of five assistants. The suit was delivered to Kitson's house in a total of 6 hours and 4 minutes. He then wore the suit to a party at the Washington Hotel, with the participating workers and prominent local businessmen joining in. Lamb was served for dinner. After Kitson died in 1900, his son, Thomas J. Kitson, took over the business until 1920 when he died. The mill was sold at a Sheriff's sale in January 1930 and stood vacant for a few years. In 1933 the Holland Thread Company acquired the building and operated in it until 1978. ==References== Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1904 Category:Buildings and structures in Monroe County, Pennsylvania Category:National Register of Historic Places in Monroe County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Kitson Woolen Mill"},{"id":"35207860","text":"Joseph Edgar Blanchard (December 7, 1928 – March 22, 2012) was an American football player, professional wrestler and promoter.

Within all the territories he wrestled, he had the most success in Hawaii for 50th State Big Time Wrestling (twice winning the NWA Hawaii Tag Team Championship with Lord James Blears) and in Texas for NWA Big Time Wrestling (twice winning the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship). In 1978, Blanchard founded Southwest Championship Wrestling (SCW) in San Antonio, where he retired from active competition later that year after 25 years. Blanchard ran the promotion until selling it to Fred Behrend in April 1985, changing its name to Texas All-Star Wrestling (TAW). In 1989, he joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA), replacing Stanley Blackburn as President of the company.

However, Adams was able to master his weight class in his final two seasons. In 1971, Adams was 9-2-1 in duals and won his first NCAA title by beating Oregon State's Mike Jones 18-5 in the championship match.http://nwhof.org/NCAA-Brackets/PDF/NCAA%201971.pdf Adams did not lose a dual match in his senior season (16-0-1) and capped off his second consecutive individual national title with a 7-4 decision against Stan Dziedzic from Slippery Rock.http://nwhof.org/NCAA-Brackets/PDF/NCAA%201972.pdf He was one of three Cyclone individual national titlists in 1972 (Ben Peterson, Chris Taylor), as the Cyclones were national champions for the third time in Adams' four seasons with the Cyclones.

He played from 1882 to 1905 with several Cuban ballclubs, including Almendares, the Fe club, Habana, and the All Cubans. He was elected to the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. According to Cuban baseball historian Jorge Figueredo, García was \\"considered by many as the best all-around player of the early years\\" of the Cuban League. When John McGraw visited Cuba in 1889, he reportedly wanted to sign García to a contract with Baltimore. García refused because he was being paid more in Cuba than what Baltimore offered.Figueredo 2003, p. 9. ==Playing career== García debuted with Almendares in the Cuban League in the winter season of 1882/83. The league was suspended the following winter, and when it resumed play in the spring of 1885, García was playing for Habana, which won the league championship. The following winter, he played for Fe, which finished third in the five-team league.Figueredo 2003, pp. 9–12. In 1886/87, García returned to Habana, which again won the championship. The next season, he won the batting championship with a batting average of .448; he also led the league in hits (26) and doubles (6). Nevertheless, his Habana team lost the pennant race to Fe, ending the season one game behind.Figueredo 2003, pp. 13–17. In 1888/89, García's batting average dropped to .238, but his Habana team regained the pennant.

Having written and co-written numerous books and articles, the most notable being Tiwi Wives (1971), To Sing with Pigs Is Human (1995), The Two-Party Line (1996), Goodale's achievements and contributions to her field continue to have major importance in the sociological role of women as well as in continuing the field of ethnography today. Goodale received her BA and MA from Radcliffe College and later her PhD from the University of Pennsylvania. Goodale began her teaching career at Bryn Mawr College as a part-time instructor in 1959, becoming a full professor in the department of Anthropology in 1975, and served there until her retirement in 1996, when she became Professor Emerita. She also held teaching positions at Barnard College, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Darwin Institute of Technology. Goodale worked to bring attention and notability to the ethnographic research, dedicating her work and encouraging her students in the collection of facts and information on other cultures during a time when many felt the practice was outdated and ineffective.University of Illinois Press http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/74kpd2km9780252032677.html ==Early life and education== Jane Carter Goodale was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1926. The daughter of Susan Bainbridge Sturgis and Robert Lincoln Goodale, a prominent New England physician, Goodale grew up in a highly intellectual environment that greatly contributed to her interests, abilities, and later, to her career. Goodale’s interest in genealogy, which was later emphasized in her work with the Tiwi, began at an early age within her own family lineage. Able to trace her family history back to the early 1630s in the New England area, Goodale was proud of her ancestors’ adventurous spirits and attributed her own ambitious nature to them. Her uncle, Eddie Goodale,Laura Zimmer-Tamakoshi and Jeanette Dickerson-Putnam (2008) Pulling the Right Threads journeyed with Admiral Byrd, the revolutionary American naval officer, explorer and aviator on his expeditions to the South Pole, which in part inspired Goodale’s desire for travel and adventure. Goodale also noted the importance of other “illustrious ancestors” who influenced her ideas and ambitions early on in life such as Lucy Goodale Thurston, a missionary relative who travelled to Hawai’i in the early 1880s.Laura Zimmer-Tamakoshi and Jeanette Dickerson-Putnam (2008) Pulling the Right Threads The field of anthropology allowed Goodale to travel in a time when many women were not given such opportunities.Association for Social Anthropology in Oceania http://www.asao.org/pacific/honoraryf/goodale.htm The skills that Goodale acquired from her were further encouraged and cultivated at Oldfields School, an all-girls school in Maryland from which she graduated in 1944. During her time at Oldfields, Goodale struggled as a student due to undiagnosed dyslexia. Her struggles at Oldfields greatly prepared Goodale for her future education, career, and especially mentorship that she would face later on in life. Goodale was able to get through her years at Oldfields with the help of her teacher Miss AndersonUniversity of Illinois Press http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/74kpd2km9780252032677.html who acted as Goodale’s mentor during her time in school. The mentoring Miss Anderson was able to provide for Goodale at Oldfields prepared her not only for her undergraduate and master's degreesAssociation for Social Anthropology in Oceania http://www.asao.org/pacific/honoraryf/goodale.htm but also when Goodale herself became mentor to her own students. Goodale received her B.A. in 1948 and M.A. in 1951 from Radcliffe College. When she first started her undergraduate studies at Radcliffe University, she intended to study medicine or geography.Laura Zimmer-Tamakoshi, Jane Carter Goodale (1926–2008). American Anthropologist, 19 MAY 2010 DOI: 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01241.x. Volume 112, Issue 2, pages 344–347 She was encouraged by classmate Carleton S. Coon who was also a Harvard anthropologist and in her sophomore year she enrolled in anthropology, a move that changed her life tremendously.Laura Zimmer- Tamakoshi, Jane Carter Goodale (1926–2008). American Anthropologist, 19 MAY 2010 DOI: 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01241.x. Volume 112, Issue 2, pages 344–347 While still at Radcliffe University she co-founded the Harvard-Radcliffe Anthropology club with Robert Dyson and served as its first president. Goodale received her Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1959. While still a student at the University of Pennsylvania, she served as the newsletter editor for the venerable Philadelphia Anthropological Society. She would later on help found and preside over the Association for Social Anthropology in Oceania (ASAO), the premier organization of Pacific anthropologists. Before receiving her Ph.D. Goodale worked as Carleton Coon’s assistant. When Coon declined Charles Mountford's invitation to join his National Geographic Society expedition and go to Melville Island to study the Australian Aboriginal population, Goodale took his place. She began her ten-month doctoral research in Australia in 1954 and she got her Ph.D in 1959.Laura Zimmer-Tamakoshi, Jane Carter Goodale (1926–2008). American Anthropologist, 19 MAY 2010 DOI: 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01241.x. Volume 112, Issue 2, pages 344–347 ==Publications== Goodale published a variety of articles and texts during her career. The publishing of “Tiwi Wives,” allowed Goodale to develop her reputation and was one of her major works that demonstrated her research Zimmer-Tamakoshi, Laura; Dickerson-Putman, Jeanette. 2008. “Pulling the Right Threads: The Ethnographic Life and Legacy of Jane C. Goodale” University of Illinois Press Goodale discusses the lives of Tiwi Women concerning the rituals throughout their lifetime Goodale, Jane C. 1994. “Tiwi Wives: A Study of the Women of Melville Island, North Australia” Waveland Pr Inc. Important rites of passage are discussed throughout the text and detailed material describing marriage and death traditions are mentioned Goodale, Jane C. 1994. “Tiwi Wives: A Study of the Women of Melville Island, North Australia” Waveland Pr Inc. This text has become relevant throughout anthropology; this work is often referenced as support in a variety of academic articles regarding traditions involving Northern Australian women when researched on academic search engines. “To Sing with Pigs is Human: The Concept of Person in Papua New Guinea” is another publication surrounding the research that Goodale undertook. The finding that Goodale discovers, when researching in New Guinea, is the importance of everything in the development of the recognition of human beings within the particular culture of the Kaulong.Goodale, Jane C. 1995 “To Sing With Pigs is Human: The Concept of Person in Papua New Guinea” University of Washington Press. Every event, relationship, and transaction is considered to be important in the eyes of the Kaulong; Goodale researches to understand what makes an individual human.Goodale, Jane C. 1995 “To Sing With Pigs is Human: The Concept of Person in Papua New Guinea” University of Washington Press. The Kaulong concerns, surrounding the identity of an individual, caused the creation of a continuum that ranges from non-human to the most respected level of humanity Goodale, Jane C. 1995 “To Sing With Pigs is Human: The Concept of Person in Papua New Guinea” University of Washington Press. To achieve a greater placement on the scale, an individual must obtain higher knowledge Goodale, Jane C. 1995 “To Sing With Pigs is Human: The Concept of Person in Papua New Guinea” University of Washington Press. Goodale researches this system through rituals such as song and dance explored in an ethnographic manner Goodale, Jane C. 1995 “To Sing With Pigs is Human: The Concept of Person in Papua New Guinea” University of Washington Press. “The Two Party Line, Conversations in the Field” is another publication completed by Goodale along with the co-author Ann Chowning. This text repeats the theme of ethnographic research that has been so relevant in the career of Goodale. The importance of ethnographic data is presented throughout the publication. The book describes the details of learning about a specific culture through participant observation and interactive discourse.Goodale, Jane C; Chowning, Ann, 1996. “Two-Party line: Conversations in the Field” Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc. The text discusses the different occasions in which Goodale participated in research with other members of the anthropology society and gives details on her time spent in both Australia and New Guinea. Richard Scaglion, in association with the American Anthropologist describes the text as unique and capable of stimulating discussion on a vast array of topics among a contemporary audience.https://www.amazon.com/The-Two-Party-Line-Jane- Goodale/dp/0847682641 ==Influence== Goodale died on November 5, 2008, after suffering from complications due to pulmonary hypertension. Continuing her research until the day she died, Goodale had been living in hospice care while maintaining her work on Tiwi genealogies with the help of her assistant.Concord Funeral Home http://hosting-6450.tributes.com/show/Jane- Carter-Goodale-84952313 After having taught in and helped to establish anthropology departments in various institutions across the US, Goodale’s contribution to the field of ethnography was of considerable significance. Pulling the Right Threads, edited by Laura Zimmer-Tamakoshi, was published later in 2008. Written and contributed to by former students and colleagues of Goodale’s, the final publication was meant as a collection of Goodale’s ethnographic work and mentoring methods.Association for Social Anthropology in Oceania http://www.asao.org/pacific/honoraryf/goodale.htm The title came from Goodale’s own explanation on how to best solve ethnographic and cultural questions. Pulling the Right Threads acts to commemorate Goodale’s work as well as delve further into ethnographic work quoting: :As striking as Jane’s considerable body of writings on her research in Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) have been her generous commitment of time and ideas to students and colleagues and her evident empathy for the people she studies. The writers in this volume recognize and build on these seminal aspects of Jane’s work. They investigate the ways Jane has helped shape ethnographic and theoretical contributions in such fields as gender studies, the anthropology of aging, Pacific ethnography, and applied and development anthropology.Association for Social Anthropology in Oceania http://www.asao.org/pacific/honoraryf/goodale.htm Goodale’s personal interests and work in the area of gender studies brought attention to the changing roles of women, as well as having a long-lasting influence in the discipline of anthropology. This influence has been continued on by Goodale’s students focusing on the importance of collecting accurate ethnographic data. ==References External links == * Jane Goodale Papers MSS 643.

Moving to Berlin, he became a teacher of religion at first. Like many intellectuals around the turn of the century, he felt oppressed by the restrictive morals then reigning German society. He quit teaching in 1902 and founded the League for Human Rights (Bund für Menschenrecht, in German) in 1903.Fähnders 1995, pg. 125 He decided to devote himself entirely to writing and political activism from an anarchist standpoint. In 1904, he published a booklet entitled \\"Das dritte Geschlecht\\" (\\"The Third Gender\\"). In it, he attacked homophobia, laying most of the blame on religion. Above all, the text was intended to be educational and covered evolution, biology and issues then facing homosexuals. From 1904 to 1905, Holzmann edited the journal Der Kampf: Zeitschrift für gesunden Menschenverstand (The Struggle: Journal for Common Sense). Though it was not published by any particular organization, the journal was anarchist in outlook. In addition to fictional stories, Der Kampf published articles on various topics, including many about homosexuality. Among its writers were Else Lasker-Schüler, Peter Hille, and Erich Mühsam and, at its best, it had a circulation of up to 10,000. During this time, Holzmann wrote an article entitled \\"Die Homosexualität als Kulturbewegung\\" (\\"Homosexuality as a Cultural Movement\\"). He argued that the right to privacy entailed that \\"no one has the right to intrude in the private matters of another, to meddle in another's personal views and orientations, and that ultimately it is no one's business what two freely consenting adults do in their homes.\\" He attacked Paragraph 175 of the German criminal code which criminalized homosexual acts.Fähnders 1995, pg. 125-127; Otto 2007 To him, the struggle against the prohibition of homosexual acts was part of a larger struggle for emancipation. He disagreed with the mainstream socialist movement, namely the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), that viewed the repeal of Paragraph 175 as a minor issue. He also opposed the SPD's tactic of forcefully outing gays, such as the steel magnate Friedrich Alfred Krupp, in order to bring about the repeal of Paragraph 175. He called this tactic an \\"indecent weapon\\", saying that anyone who practices it \\"is willing to remove ground under his own feet by practicing the very injustice that he opposes\\". He also disagreed with many other German gay rights activists such as Adolf Brand who did not see their struggle as part of a wider movement.Fähnders 1995, pg. 127-128. Holzmann's views were not entirely uncontroversial in the German anarchist movement either. Max Nettlau and Gustav Landauer, both well-known anarchists, criticized Der Kampf's sexual politics.Cohn 2009, pg. 1609. During his time in Berlin, knew a number of well-known writers and bohemians. He was very close friends with Else Lasker- Schüler, a famous Expressionist poet. She was the one who gave the nickname Senna Hoy, a reversal of his first name, but also had several other pet names for him. Erich Mühsam also had great respect for Holzmann, though he sometimes criticized him for his \\"somewhat fanciful and adventurous demeanor\\". The Austrian anarchist Pierre Ramus called him \\"the most indefatigable Bohemian proletarian of the German-speaking anarchist movement\\".Otto 2007. Holzmann's work was repeatedly the target of censorship by the Prussian authorities. Of the 25 issues of Der Kampf, 11 were banned. In 1905, Holzmann fled Prussia and moved to Zurich, Switzerland. Sources disagree on what led him to flee. According to Walter Fähnders, a professor for German literature, it was because he wrote a short text that could interpreted as a depiction of a homosexual encounter. It was to be published in Der Kampf. However, the issue was banned and confiscated, because it was deemed obscene. At the same time and for the same reason, the government confiscated nude drawings by the artist Fidus and banned the poem \\"Die Freundschaft\\" (\\"Friendship\\") by Friedrich Schiller, one of the best known poets in German history. Holzmann was sentenced to either pay a fine or spend six days in prison. Instead, he decided to flee Prussia and move to Switzerland.Fähnders 1995, pg. 125, 130. According to Stefan Otto, a journalist, however, he had been monitored by the police. Annoyed by this, he wrote a letter to the chief of the Berlin police, threatening to punch the next person he caught spying on him in the face. For this, he was sentenced to four months in prison, but he decided to flee rather than serve the sentence, according to Otto.Otto 2007. ==Zurich== Once in Zurich, he worked for a newspaper called Der Weckruf (The Wake-up Call). He was arrested once more and deported. He sneaked back into Switzerland. He tried to stay in hiding by faking his own death. He wrote an obituary for himself claiming that he had been killed in the course of a prisoners' escape. After this was exposed, he was disgraced, even within the anarchist scene. Therefore, he decided to leave Zurich. After spending a couple of months in Paris, he decided to move to Russia.Otto 2007. ==Russia and death== He opted for Russia, having reported on the 1905 Russian Revolution in Der Kampf, because he thought Europe's future depended on the outcome of revolutionary developments in that country. He joined an anarchist federation in Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. He assisted that organization for several weeks, robbing rich merchants to fund the group's activities. In June 1907, he was caught and sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor. Back in Germany, lawyers and Holzmann's friends set off a campaign to secure his freedom, above all Else Lasker-Schüler. She also collected money so she could travel to Russia and visit him. She did so in 1913. She was able to meet with him in an insane asylum near Moscow. Having struggled for his release for years, his supporters finally managed to convince the Russian authorities to let him go. However, the German authorities refused to let him back into the country, so he was forced to remain incarcerated in Russia. Meanwhile, Holzmann's health deteriorated. He suffered from malnutrition and typhus and died on April 28, 1914.Otto 2007. After Holzmann's death, Karl Liebknecht, a socialist leader and member of the Reichstag, launched a parliamentary inquiry into why Holzmann was not allowed to return to Germany. Franz Pfemfert dedicated an issue of the socialist journal Die Aktion to Holzmann. Lasker-Schüler wrote a poem about her visit, entitled \\"Der Malik\\". Holzmann's body was returned to Berlin and he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in Weißensee.Otto 2007. ==NotesBibliography== * * * Category:1882 births Category:1914 deaths Category:People from Tuchola County Category:People from West Prussia Category:German anarchists Category:German Jews Category:LGBT rights activists from Germany Category:LGBT history in Germany ","title":"Johannes Holzmann"},{"id":"35208118","text":"Bob Boykin is an American musician, session musician, composer, and producer, best known as a guitarist.

Adolf Miethe (; 25 April 1862, Potsdam – 5 May 1927, Berlin) was a German scientist, lens designer, photochemist, photographer, author and educator. He co-invented the first practical photographic flash and made important contributions to the progress of practical color photography. ==Early life== Adolf Miethe grew up in a middle-class family. His father was a chocolate manufacturer and city councillor in Potsdam. After studying physics, chemistry and astronomy in Berlin, he moved to Göttingen, where in 1889 he received his doctorate for a thesis on the actinometry of photographic astronomic fixed star exposures. ==Career== In 1887 he co-invented (with Johannes Gaedicke) the photographic magnesium powder flash-light. After earning his doctorate, he worked for Edmund Hartnack's optical workshop in Potsdam designing microscope objectives. In 1891, after the death of Hartnack, he moved to Rathenow and took a job with the optical company Schulze & Barthels, where he developed telescopes, binoculars, and one of the first tele lenses for cameras. In 1894 he went to Voigtländer & Sohn in Braunschweig, where he held the post of technical director and also worked on improving rifle scopes. In 1899 he succeeded Hermann Wilhelm Vogel at the Royal Technical University in Berlin as professor of photography, photochemistry, and spectral analysis. Miethe was the designer of a camera for color photography, the first photographic product made by the Berlin cabinetmaker Wilhelm Bermpohl. Introduced to the public in 1903, it produced sets of three separate black-and-white images on glass plates by making a series of three photographs of the subject through red, green and blue color fliters, a method of color photography first proposed by James Clerk Maxwell.Professor Dr. Miethe's Dreifarben-Camera (retrieved 12 October 2012) features several photographs of the 9 x 24 cm model and a more detailed description of its operation, along with an abundance of related information. The Miethe-Bermpohl Dreifarbenkamera (\\"three-color camera\\") should not be confused with the much later Bermpohl Naturfarbenkamera (\\"natural color camera\\"), a very different \\"one-shot\\" type that simultaneously exposed three separate plates and was manufactured from 1929 until circa 1950. These were used to reconstitute the full original range of color by projecting transparent positives made from them through similar filters and exactly superimposing the images on the projection screen (additive color),Wagner, Jens (2006). \\"Die additive Dreifarbenfotografie nach Adolf Miethe\\" . Text in German only. This scholarly thesis illustrates, describes and analyzes Miethe's equipment in some detail, with a particular focus on the Miethe-Goerz three-color projector and the characteristics of the color filters used. Examples of Miethe's photographs, some possibly as early as 1902, can be found in the color illustration section that follows the main text. or by making three prints consisting of transparent pigment or dye images in the complementary colors and superimposing those to make a single full-color transparency or print on paper (subtractive color). They were also used to prepare printing plates for illustrating books, periodicals and other mechanically printed media, the only form in which early color photographs were likely to be seen by the general public. There were a number of technical issues with the system, including the relatively long time required to make each sequence of three exposures and the difficulty of correctly balancing them to obtain accurate color values under different lighting conditions. In 1901, Miethe had introduced \\"Ethyl Red\\", a sensitizing dye that greatly improved the characteristics of panchromatically sensitized photographic emulsions, which in turn obviated the very long exposures previously needed to photograph red-filtered images, simplified color filter design, and generally cleared the path for future progress.\\"Frühe Farbfotografie: Bunt fürs Leben\\". In Spiegel Online. April 6, 2011. Miethe's innovations provided the technological foundation used by such photographic pioneers as the Russian Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky, who studied with Miethe for several weeks in 1902.The chronology at Prokudin-Gorsky.org (accessed 26 September 2012) reports six weeks of study with Miethe in 1902. Other accounts give the year as 1889, but a primary source for that extremely early date is not apparent and it does not accord with the circa 1889 biographical details of either man. A 1902 color photograph by Miethe, as reproduced photomechanically in Photographische Rundschau in 1903 In 1909, Miethe began working with an observatory for astrophotography. This interest led him to participate in several overseas expeditions, such as one in 1908 to Upper Egypt to examine twilight phenomena and the ultraviolet end of the solar spectrum. In 1910 he took part in a shipborne expedition to Spitsbergen led by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin that focused primarily on meteorological issues but also considered the viability of exploring the polar regions by airship. In 1914, he led an expedition to Norway to observe the 21 August solar eclipse. In 1921, he set up a research institute for cinema technology for which he served as chairman of the board of trustees. Miethe wrote several books and close to a hundred articles on photography. He took over the editorship of Photographischen Wochenblattes (Photographic Week) in 1889, and in 1894 he founded the magazines Atelier des Photographen (Photographer's Studio) and Photographische Chronik (Photographic Chronicle). Miethe died in Berlin in 1927 from the lingering after-effects of an injury suffered in a train accident a year and a half earlier. ==References * Category:German chemists Category:German inventors Category:1862 births Category:1927 deaths Category:People from Potsdam Category:Technical University of Berlin faculty Category:University of Göttingen alumni Category:19th-century German photographers Category:19th- century German scientists Category:Photographers from Saxony ","title":"Adolf Miethe"},{"id":"35208207","text":"Häxan Surtant (The Sour-Hag Witch), also called \\"Världens suraste och elakaste häxa\\" (The Sulkiest and Meanest Witch in the World), is a Swedish fictional character who appears on SVT.

Every morning Häxan Surtant stops a young prince going to kindergarten, who lives in an apartment near Häxan Surtant's. She asks him what he'll do at kindergarten and in one episode he answers \\"Spela fotboll\\" (\\"Play football\\"). Then Häxan also wants to play football and goes out to play it, but it doesn't go as she planned and she becomes very angry, so she conjures away everything which is relevant to football. When the prince comes home from kindergarten, he and the princess (his bigger sister), watch the TV program Sagonytt (\\"Story News\\") where they inform that something has been conjured away, for example footballs. The boy and his sister know Häxan did it, so they tell her to conjure it back and play with them so she understands that playing football can be fun and isn't as bad as she thought. In the end, Häxan always becomes angry anyway; she listens to what the prince and the princess say through the walls: *(The Prince) \\"Vad gör man om hon fortsätter vara dum fast man är snäll?\\" (\\"What do you do if she continues being mean even if you are kind?\\") *(The Princess) \\"Ja då kan man kalla henne för 'fisrumpa'.\\" (\\"Yeah, then you can call her 'fart-butt'.\\") Aktiebolaget Häxan Surtant This TV series was broadcast as Jullovsmorgon 2006/2007 in 15 episodes. Häxan Surtant has nothing to do. She wants to work but hates mates, so she works alone for herself in her newly founded company Aktiebolaget Häxan Surtant (The Häxan Surtant Joint-stock company), without knowing just what the company should do.Character Häxan Surtant: Vad gör jag här? Ja, vad gör jag här egentligen? Jag gör väl vad JAG vill! (What am I doing here? Yeah, what am I really doing here? I do whatever I want to do! Every day, she arranges something random for the display window without reason, a pizza box in this case. She then hopes that no one will enter.Pratgubben: ...och hoppades att det inte skulle komma några kunder.\\" (\\"...and hoped that no customers would come.\\") Trollet Trygve happens to pass the shop every day and upon seeing the pizza box decides to enter.Häxan Surtant: \\"Hoppas, hoppas, hoppas... Nej, inte Trollet Trygve...!\\" (\\"I hope, hope, hope... No, not Trollet Trygve...!) Trollet Trygve walks up to Häxan and says that he saw a pizza box by the window, so is it maybe possible that this is a pizzeria? Häxan tells him to come back at afternoon to pick up his order. She then goes outside to find someone (Riddaren Ragnar in this episode) who can help her make the pizza. This scenario happens in each episode but with different goods. In the pizza episode, the pizza was finished long before afternoon, so she ate it while it was warm. Then when she realized that she hasn't got the pizza for Trollet Trygve as she promised, she became so angry, that she conjured away every pizza in the world. The TV program Sagonytt reporter Älvan Ellen comes to the shop and tells Häxan that if the things have disappeared, she can't do something \\"bad\\" with the things. Häxan understands that she must make the things that have disappeared come back. She then realizes that she must fix pizza before Trollet returns for his order. Depending on the episode, Häxan often goes away to another place and leaves it to others to fix the problem. She then returns to her shop just before Trollet Trygve arrives, upon Trygves arrival he asks Häxan how much it'll cost, which she replies with \\"12 000 kronor\\".Pratgubben: \\"Vad ska du jobba med imorgon då?\\" (\\"So what are you going to work as tomorrow?\\"); Häxan Surtant: \\"Imorgon ska jag inte jobba alls, då ska jag koncentrera mig på att vara otrevlig mot kunderna.

Häxan Surtant hasn't paid her apartment for more than 200 years and Gråtmilda Gråvätten Greger, Häxan's landlord, wonders if she'll pay soon. Häxan doesn't want to pay and it's difficult to find a new apartment so she must move back to her mother, Halvgalna Häxmamman Harriet. But she's not so \\"halvgalen\\" (half-mad), she is very kind and Häxan hates that she is kind and nice and goes away. Häxan wants to go to work but can't because it's Sunday and Sundays are work-free days. Then she gets a \\"play-time-hobby\\" (for example ceramic in the 2nd program) and goes to Sagofolkets hus (\\"House of Fairytale People\\") where Trollet Trygve works as chief and 2 other story-figures are there and have fun with the same hobby as Häxan. But suddenly it doesn't go as Häxan planned and she becomes angry and conjures away everything which has to do with the hobby. When she suddenly doesn't have some hobby, she must go home to her mother who tells her that they said on TV that someone conjured her favourite things, so she can't go out and have fun. Häxan wants to be alone and her mother promises to leave her alone at home if she conjures the things back, so she does it. After that she sleeps in her mother's sofa until the next Sunday, she finds a new hobby, but becomes unhappy about the hobby because it didn't go as she planned. And when she sleeps, she dreams about \\"elaka saker man kan göra mot barn\\" (\\"mean things one can do to children\\").

Work-free is the absolutely worst one can be!\\") Häxan Surtant och landet Häxania \\"The Sour-Hag Witch and the country Häxania\\" was broadcast first during January-March 2012 and had ten episodes. Häxan Surtant hates nice people on the streets etc. She is so angry that she goes to a forest where she believes she can be alone, but suddenly she finds two princesses and a prince who stop her from coming into their country Kojania where they live in a tree house (koja in Swedish). Then she also wants to start a country where she can be alone. She buys Gråtmilda Gråvätten Greger's holiday village and pays only a banana and forces away Greger and calls the new country Häxania. But suddenly she isn't alone, she is together with Riddaren Ragnar, Fen Felicia, Trollet Trygve and Trollmor who are on holiday in the \\"former\\" holiday village. Riddaren Ragnar says that they may stay in Häxania because they are citizens and citizens can't be forced away. But Häxan has an own house where she lives alone and sulk. The next day Häxan becomes angry when she wakes up and sees something \\"nice\\" so she angrily goes to the forest. She meets the children in Kojania who say that they are doing something and then Häxan goes back to Häxania and says that the citizens of Häxania should do it too. In the final episode, Greger gets his holiday village back, but Trollet Trygve thinks it's \\"expensive\\", because Häxan Surtant says that \\"it costs 12 000 SEK\\". In the final program Kojania is also cancelled; the children say that they miss their home and are \\"trötta på att leka land\\" (\\"tired of playing country\\").

He is also vice president of Renew Europe and vice president of the European political party Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE Party). Before working in Brussels, he has been professor of strategy and economics at the Business School of the Business Institute and at the London School of Economics (LSE). == Life and academic career == Luis Garicano was born in Valladolid. He is the son of Ana Gabilondo and Luis Garicano. He studied at the San José School, a Jesuit school, in his hometown. Garicano obtained bachelor's degrees in economics (1990) and Law (1991) from the University of Valladolid. Subsequently, he obtained a master's degree in European economic studies from the College of Europe in Bruges (Belgium) in 1992 and a second master's degree in economics from the University of Chicago in 1995. He received his doctorate (PhD) in economics from the same institution three years later, in 1998. At the University of Chicago, his thesis supervisor was Sherwin Rosen, one of the leading labor economists of the 20th century. During his time there he was also the teaching assistant of Gary Becker and Kevin M. Murphy, two of the main exponents of the theory of human capital; the economic theory which argues for the quality and education of workers as the main factor in fostering economic growth. After obtaining his doctorate he was hired as an assistant professor at the Booth School of Business, where he continued to study the economics of knowledge within labor markets. He would go on to become an associate professor in 2002 and a full professor (tenured) in 2006. During his stay in Chicago, he was also a visiting professor at the Sloan School of Management, the Pompeu Fabra University and the London Business School. In 2007, he received the Banco Herrero Foundation Award to the best Spanish economist under 40 years of age. In 2008 he transferred to the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) as a professor (chair) of economics and strategy and as the director of research as a part of the founding team of the new Management department. In November 2008, at the inauguration of the new building of this department, after giving a presentation on the financial crisis Queen Elizabeth II asked Garicano what would become an infamous question: Why did nobody see the crisis coming? At LSE he also founded and directed the master's program in economics and management and, in 2011, became the group head of the Managerial Economics and Strategy Group. In May 2017 he joined the Business School of IE University as professor of economics and strategy. There he is also the director of the Center for the Digital Economy, which supports the development of the academic fields of economics, business, sociology and law. Additionally, he is a researcher at the Center for Economic Policy Research and is affiliated with the Center for Economic Performance. Garicano has worked as an economist for the European Commission (between 1992 and 1993), for the consulting firm McKinsey & Company (1998) and for the Foundation for Applied Economics Studies (2010), where he held the McKinsey Chair. Between January 2012 and April 2016, he was also an independent member of the board of directors of Liberbank. In line with his influences at the University of Chicago, his research focuses on productivity, technological innovation and the organization of work; also focusing on inequality, economic growth and banking systems. His first academic article (2000) \\"Hierarchies and the organization of knowledge in production\\", argues that hierarchies within companies are tools to manage knowledge and promote specialization. In another article with Esteban Rossi Hansberg (2006), \\"Organization and inequality in the knowledge economy\\", they explore this theory of the firm further to see how information and communication technologies might differently affect business organization and inequality: while information technologies decentralize and increase the returns to knowledge throughout the distribution, communication technologies centralize and, consequently, have the opposite effect. This theory was successfully tested in his 2014 article with Nick Bloom, Raffaella Sadun, and John Van Reenen: \\"The distinct effects of information technology and communication technology in the organization of the company\\". This innovative vision of organizations goes further than other theories (such as that of firms as aligning incentives) and has been highly recognized, Garicano having published in the main economic journals, including the Quarterly Journal of Economics, the Journal of Political Economy, the Review of Economic Studies, the American Economic Review and the Journal of Economic Perspectives. In his spare time, Garicano enjoys cooking, reading (especially biographies) & hiking. == Activism == For years, Luis Garicano has actively promoted structural reforms to Spanish institutions and the economy, especially in the labor market and the health and pension systems. His activism is often compared the activist regenerationism of José Ortega y Gasset. In this line, he is a frequent contributor of opinion and analysis to main news outlets, including the Financial Times, El País and El Mundo. In 2009 he founded the blog Nada Es Gratis to promote a more sophisticated public discourse grounded on evidence and economic methods, and the blog has grown to become the main economics blog in Spanish. Two years later, and together with 5 other experts, Garicano published his first book (under the same name as the blog) in which they argued for reforms to the Spanish economy to ensure productivity and promote growth. In 2012 he was part of a commission of 11 experts to reform the Spanish university system. In 2013 he published a manifesto in conjunction with Carles Casajuana, César Molinas and Elisa de la Nuez advocating for a reform to political party regulation, which ended up being supported by around a hundred Spanish intellectuals. In 2014 he published his first solo book, El dilema de España (Spain's dilemma), in which he argues Spain must choose between becoming the Denmark or the Venezuela of southern Europe. Specifically, the book proposes educational and institutional reforms to encourage meaningful growth and avoid the perverse incentives that caused the 2008 financial crisis. Taking part in groups such as Euro-Economics and the Council for the European Crisis of the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET), Garicano has also been one of the leading economists advocating structural reforms to the European financial system. He was a member of the group of economists led by Markus Brunnermeier that developed the European Safe Bonds (ESBies) proposal for the creation of securities backed by a diversified portfolio of euro area central government bonds. This innovative financial instrument was proposed as a solution to help banks diversify their sovereign exposures and further weaken the link between them and their home governments. The proposal was taken up by the European Commission under the name SBBS in 2018. == Politics == On 8 February 2015, he announced his entry into politics by joining Ciudadanos – Partido de la Ciudadanía (Citizens – Party of the Citizenry), a Spanish center-right liberal party. Since then he has been the party's chief economist. He was in charge of drafting the party's economic program ahead of the 2015 and 2016 general elections and has been the main architect behind Ciudadanos’ main economic proposals, including a Spanish equivalent of the American earned income tax credit and the \\"single contract\\" (a proposal to abolish structural inequalities within the labor market). After being the Head of Economy, Knowledge and Industry, since 2017 he has been the Head of Economy and Employment. His work on Ciudadanos’ program is summarized in his book Recuperar el Futuro (Reclaiming the Future), with Toni Roldán (now spokesman for the economy of Ciudadanos and an academic disciple of Garicano at the London School of Economics). Garicano has also been one of the central advocates of liberalism within the party; and was a key factor in the party's ideological transition in 2017 from social democracy towards progressive liberalism. On 2 December 2016, in Poland, he was appointed Vice-President of ALDE Party, the alliance party of liberal democrats at the European level. == Selected publications == Garicano, Luis (2000).

It is the only family within the suborder Cavernicola. Currently the family contains only seven species distributed in five genera, although the total number of species is thought to be much higher. == Description == Hausera hauseri showing the common ovovitelline duct (cod) perpendicular to the female genital duct (dgf) The morphological features uniting species of Dimarcusidae are related to the reproductive system. Their ovaries are located more posteriorly than in most triclads, which usually have them close to the brain. The penis in species of Dimarcusidae contains glandular elements and the common ovovitelline duct is perpendicular to the female genital duct. == Taxonomy == The family Dimarcusidae was erected in 1972 by Mitchell and Kawakatsu to include a new species, Dimarcus villalobosi. However, the same species had been briefly described by Benazzi in the same year as Opisthobursa mexicana and this name had priority, with Dimarcus villalobosi becoming a junior synonym. As a result, the family is called Dimarcusidae despite the absence of a valid genus Dimarcus. == Phylogeny == Historically, species of Dimarcusidae have been classified as members of the suborders Maricola (marine triclads) or Paludicola (freshwater triclads). They received their own suborder, Cavernicola, in 1990, although their relationship to other triclads had not been settled. Recent molecular studies, however, suggest that Cavernicola is the sister group of Maricola, thus being more closely related to marine than to freshwater triclads. == Genera == Currently the family Dimarcusidae includes the following five genera: *Balliania Gourbault, 1978 *Hausera Leal-Zanchet & Souza, 2014 *Novomitchellia Özdikmen, 2010 *Opisthobursa Benazzi, 1972 *Rhodax Marcus, 1946 == References == Category:Cavernicola (worm) ","title":"Dimarcusidae"},{"id":"35208324","text":"Childhood and Society is a 1950 book about the social significance of childhood by the psychoanalyst Erik H.

His distribution of other photographer's work for publication created one of the first photo press agencies, based in Paris. Chusseau-Flaviens' by-line appeared on numerous photographs from all over Europe as well as from Africa, the Middle East, the Far East and North America. Subject matters included formal and informal portraits of European royalty, political figures and celebrities in addition to scenes of daily life. According to researchers, no biographical information about Chusseau-Flaviens is known. A substantial portion of his photographic collection, represented by nearly 11,000 glass negatives, was donated by Kodak Pathé to the George Eastman House (GEH) International Museum of Photography and Film in 1974. GEH noted that Chusseau- Flaviens also acquired copies of photographs from other photographers, annotating their names on his glass negatives. They speculated that this accounts for the inclusion of photographs in his collection from various far- flung nations, such as Japan and New Zealand. According to the French Ministry of Culture, his release of the other photographer's work under the Chusseau- Flaviens name created the first photographic press agency of the 20th century. Countries represented in the GEH photographic collection include: Algeria, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Ceylon, China, Denmark, Djibouti, Egypt, England, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Majorca, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Palestine, Philippines, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, United States and Yugoslavia. Due to the relative lack of photographs representing France, it has been speculated that a large portion of Chusseau- Flaviens' work remains undiscovered. Journals in which Chusseau-Flaviens images appeared include Ilustraçāo Portugueza, L'Illustration, The Illustrated London News, Le Monde and The Graphic. ==Collections== In addition to the George Eastman House (with ca. 11 000 glass negatives), photos attributed to Chusseau-Flaviens are preserved in the Musee Nicéphore-Niépce (ca. 4 500 prints), Musée d'Orsay (22 authochromes), and the Bibliothèque Marguerite Durand (150 photographs). == References  *Finding Aid for Ch.

The campaign is the result of a partnership between Tesco (The UK's biggest retailer) and the RSPB (Europe's largest wildlife conservation charity). It was first publicly announced on 23 February 2012. The Together for Trees campaign aims to raise awareness and support for the RSPB's rainforest programme 'Saving Tropical Forests Together' which is a collaborative partnership to save 'nearly 240,000 hectares of tropical forest in seven countries around the world.' In doing so it hopes to raise over £1 million for the RSPB in the first year which will be used to support essential on-the-ground conservation work from replanting native tree species to offering employment for local people in rainforest conservation. ==Strategic aims== Some of the many aims of the Tesco retailer in the 'Together for Trees' campaign include: * Making companies in the Tesco supply chain more eco- friendly * Providing funds to the RSPB in Wales as part of their Saving Special Places project * To liaise with the RSPB on improving the eco-friendly business practices * To raise awareness of deforestation and its effects on ecological systems * To generate income through corporate and customer donations to support the RSPB's rainforest programme. As part of Tesco's continuing advances towards an eco-friendly business model, the retailer anticipates that somewhere around £500,000 will be raised in the first year (2012) towards the RSPB in Wales as a result of the Welsh bag levy which puts a charge on single-use carrier bags to reduce their excessive use. Wales had become the first UK nation to introduce such a levy, with customers paying a minimum of 5p per bag (October 2011 figures). ==References== Category:Tesco Category:Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Category:Environmentalism in the United Kingdom Category:Customer loyalty programs Category:2012 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Together for Trees"},{"id":"35208376","text":"Hamori may refer to: ==People== *András Hámori, Hungarian film producer *Ferenc Hamori (born 1972), former Hungarian footballer *Jenő Hámori (economist), Hungarian economist *Jenő Hámori (fencer) (born 1933), Hungarian fencer *József Hámori (born 1932), Hungarian biologist and politician ==Places== *Lake Hámori, lake in Hungary *Hamori, South Korea, a town on the south coast of Jeju island * Hamori (crater), a large crater in the southern hemisphere of the dwarf planet Ceres Category:Hungarian-language surnames ","title":"Hamori"},{"id":"35208379","text":"Mark Andrew Boothman (born 6 June 1977) is an Australian Liberal National politician who is the Member of Parliament for Theodore in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, having defeated government whip Margaret Keech to win Albert at the 2012 state election. ==References== Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Liberal National Party of Queensland politicians Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly Category:People from the Gold Coast, Queensland Category:21st-century Australian politicians ","title":"Mark Boothman"},{"id":"35208401","text":"\\"Woody Interruptus\\" is the twelfth episode of Cheerss ninth season. It first aired on NBC in the United States on December 13, 1990.Bjorklund 1993, p. 415. \\"Season Nine: 1990-91.\\" In the episode, Kelly returns from France with a male friend who says he's going to steal her from Woody. Woody deals with this by deciding to sleep with Kelly. This episode earned its director James Burrows accolades for Best Directing in 1991 and gained high viewership at its first airing. ==Plot== Kelly (Jackie Swanson) and Henrí (Anthony Cistaro) return from France. Henrí, who Sam later learns is an arrogant womanizer during a conversation with him at the bar, swears to Woody (Woody Harrelson) that he is attempting to steal Kelly from Woody. Woody becomes angry as he realizes that Henrí is serious about his claims to take Kelly from him, while the naïve Kelly often dismisses Woody's concerns, claiming Henrí's attempts as jokes. When Woody becomes worried about losing her to Henrí, Sam (Ted Danson) suggests a motel to improve Woody and Kelly's relationship. Woody takes Kelly out to a cheap motel for their evening together, but Carla (Rhea Perlman) arrives to stop them. Carla tells them that making out in a cheap motel is a bad idea, that she got pregnant when she was sixteen in the same motel, and that their love is too precious for such a setting. Then the couple decide to save their moment for the right time, so they leave, while Carla brings in and then tries to seduce Henrí. Meanwhile, Cliff tells his friends that he plans to freeze his head after death, but they mock him and his plans. Therefore, Cliff and Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) pull a prank on bar patrons by bringing a box of apparently a frozen head, which turn out to be only a microcassette. At the end, Norm and Paul pull a prank on Cliff by pretending to be decapitated. ==Reception== The episode earned director James Burrows the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series at the 43rd Primetime Emmy Awards in 1991,Bjorklund 1993, p. 462. \\"Emmy Nominations and Awards.\\" as well as the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series at the 43rd Directors Guild of America Awards.

Campbell was a South Carolina Supreme Court case regarding the constitutionality of a provision in the South Carolina Constitution requiring an oath to God for employment in the public sector. ==Details== In 1992, Herb Silverman was a mathematics professor at the College of Charleston who applied to become a notary public. Silverman is an atheist who had earlier run for the post of Governor of South Carolina. His application was rejected after he crossed off the phrase \\"So help me God\\" from the oath, which was required by the South Carolina State Constitution. Silverman filed a lawsuit naming Gov. Carroll Campbell and Secretary of State Jim Miles as defendants. After a lower court made a ruling in favor of Silverman, the state appealed to the Supreme Court contending that the case was not about religion. The South Carolina Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, ruled that Article VI, section 2 and Article XVII, section 4 of the South Carolina Constitution--both of which state, \\"No person who denies the existence of a Supreme Being shall hold any office under this Constitution\\"--could not be enforced because they violated the First Amendment protection of free exercise of religion and the Article VI, section 3 of the United States Constitution banning the use of a religious test for public office. Current precedent holds that these provisions are binding on the states under the 14th Amendment. Herb Silverman in 2018.

The Portland Trail Blazers, commonly known as the Blazers, are an American professional basketball team based in Portland, Oregon. They play in the Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Trail Blazers originally played their home games in the Memorial Coliseum, before moving to the Rose Garden (renamed the Moda Center in 2013) in 1995. The franchise entered the league in 1970, and Portland has been its only home city. The franchise has enjoyed a strong following; from 1977 through 1995, the team sold out 814 consecutive home games, the longest such streak in American major professional sports. The Trail Blazers are one of two teams in the major professional North American sports leagues located in the state of Oregon, with the other being the Portland Timbers. The Trail Blazers are also currently the only NBA team based in the binational Pacific Northwest, after the Vancouver Grizzlies relocated to Memphis and became the Memphis Grizzlies in 2001, and the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008. The team has advanced to the NBA Finals three times, winning the NBA Championship once, in 1977. The other NBA Finals appearances were in 1990 and 1992. The team has qualified for the playoffs in 35 seasons of their 49-season existence, including a streak of 21 straight appearances from 1983 through 2003, tied for the second longest streak in NBA history. Six Hall of Fame players have played for the Trail Blazers (Lenny Wilkens, Bill Walton, Clyde Drexler, Dražen Petrović, Arvydas Sabonis, and Scottie Pippen). Bill Walton is the franchise's most decorated player; he was the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player in 1977, and the regular season MVP the following year. Four Blazer rookies (Geoff Petrie, Sidney Wicks, Brandon Roy, Damian Lillard) have won the NBA Rookie of the Year award. Two Hall of Fame coaches, Lenny Wilkens and Jack Ramsay, have patrolled the sidelines for the Blazers, and two others, Mike Schuler and Mike Dunleavy, have won the NBA Coach of the Year award with the team. The following is a list of players, both past and current, who appeared in at least one game for the Portland Trail Blazers NBA franchise. __NOTOC__ ==Players== { -  G  Guard  G/F  Guard-forward  F  Forward  F/C  Forward-center  C  Center } A to B -

The program was started in 1944 by the New Jersey Council of Garden Clubs to honor World War II service members and was adopted nationally in 1945 by the National Council of State Garden Clubs. It now honors service members of all time periods. This garden and marker are located in Oregon. A garden club is an organized group of people with a shared interest in gardening, gardens, and plants. A flower club is a similar group with a focus on flowers. ==History== The first and oldest organized garden club in the United States is the Ladies' Garden Club of Athens, Georgia. It started in 1891 with a gathering of twelve women friends who shared plants and plant cuttings. It was formally organized the following year. Garden clubs formed in other American communities. The growth of garden clubs was one manifestation of the broader women's club movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1913, the first national federation of garden clubs, the Garden Club of America, was established. It was followed in 1929 by the National Council of State Garden Clubs, now National Garden Clubs, Inc. By the 1930s, local garden clubs had formed in communities throughout the United States. Initially a women's activity, over time the garden club movement also engaged men, leading in 1932 to the establishment of the Men's Garden Clubs of America organization (now The Gardeners of America/Men's Garden Clubs of America). Garden clubs did not limit themselves to the improvement of members' private gardens. Many clubs took an interest in civic beautification, planting trees along public streets, maintaining flower gardens in public spaces, and campaigning against billboards, which were considered \\"eyesores\\". The Garden Club of America began to crusade against billboards in 1919. Highway beautification and roadside improvement were a focus of attention for the Garden Club of Georgia from the time of its founding in 1928. In 1938 the Mississippi state garden club federation combined with the state federation of women's clubs and state roadside improvement council to campaign for state legislation to \\"get rid of ... unattractive signs and billboards that clutter the roads\\". Many club members engaged in flower arranging as an activity. Clubs sponsored flower shows and club members participated in competitions as contestants and judges. This aspect of the American garden club movement led indirectly to the flower club movement in the United Kingdom in the years after World War II, when Julia Clements and other U.K. women who had observed flower arranging activities in North America returned home and encouraged their countrywomen to engage in similar activities. ==Federations== Many local garden clubs in the United States are affiliated with one of three national federations: the Garden Club of America, National Garden Clubs, Inc. (originally the National Council of State Garden Clubs), and The Gardeners of America/Men's Garden Clubs of America. In the United Kingdom, many local flower clubs are affiliated with the National Association of Flower Arrangement Societies. The U.S.-based National Garden Clubs claims 447 affiliates outside the United States, in countries including Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, and Japan. ==See also== *Archives of American Gardens *Blue Star Memorial Highway ==References * 1891 First Garden Club historical marker * America's First Garden Club historical marker Category:Horticultural organizations ","title":"Garden club"},{"id":"35208443","text":"Jenő Hámori may refer to: * Jenő Hámori (economist), Hungarian economist * Jenő Hámori (fencer) (born 1928), Hungarian Olympic fencer ","title":"Jenő Hámori"},{"id":"35208448","text":"Wang Aiping may refer to: * Wang Aiping (baseball) (born 1972), China national baseball team coach * Wang Aiping (physician) (born 1958), Chinese pharmacologist and toxicologist ","title":"Wang Aiping"},{"id":"35208496","text":"Árni Páll Árnason (born 23 May 1966) is a former Icelandic politician, who served in the government of Iceland as Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security from 10 May 2009 to 2 September 2010, and as Minister of Economic Affairs from 2 September 2010 to 31 December 2011.

It was begun in the mid-13th century or earlier and additions were made in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. Restoration work was carried out on the church in the late 19th and late 20th centuries. The church is a Grade I listed building. ==Building== The west tower from the south-west with the stair turret, south aisle and south porch visible. Construction of the church had begun by the mid 13th century and continued in phases over the next three centuries. Restorations were carried out in 1897-98 and 1984-95. The church is constructed of roughly coursed stone and has a plain tiled roofs. The 13th-century west tower comprises three stages with buttresses on the north-east, north-west and south-west corners and a taller attached stair turret on the south-east corner. String courses separate each stage and a battlemented parapet forms the top of the walls on each side. The west side contains a three-lighted traceried window in the first stage positioned above the small west door. The second stage contains small rectangular windows on the three outward-facing façades and the third stage contains two-lighted belfry windows on each side. The 14th century nave is flanked on each side by aisles added in the early 15th century. The external walls of both aisles are buttressed and have a moulded stone plinth and a string course topped by a battlemented parapet. The aisles are divided from the nave with arcades of four pointed arches with octagonal columns and moulded capitals and bases. The capitals differ on the two arcades. Each aisle contains two three-lighted arched windows. The aisles have shallow lean-to roofs, but evidence internally suggests that these were steeper before the 15th century. In the centre of the south aisle, the lower 15th-century porch contains single windows in the east and west sides and a battlemented parapet. The arched doorway contains quatrefoil decoration in the spandrels. The chancel is flanked by chapels on each side, divided from them by arcades of two pointed arches, again with octagonal columns. The gabled east end contains a three-lighted window installed in 1897. Each chapel is buttressed and has a steeply pitched roof taller than the chancel. The north chapel has an intricately traceried three-lighted window on the north side containing quatrefoils and sexfoils and stars. Each chapel is connected to the corresponding aisle with a single arch probably from the early 15th century. The roofs of the nave and chancel feature octagonal crown post trusses; the three in the nave have moulded capitals and bosses. The 13th century hexagonal font stands on seven plain columns on a hexagonal base. The south wall of the sanctuary, the south wall of the south chapel and the east wall of the north chapel each contain a piscina. The carved wooden pulpit is hexagonal and early 17th-century. The church is a Grade I listed building. ==Monuments and memorials== The church contains a large number of memorials to members of the Filmer family former owners of the adjacent house of East Sutton Park. These include Robart Filmer (d. 1585), Sir Robert Filmer (d. 1720), Sir Edward Filmer (d. 1755), Beversham Filmer (d. 1763), Dorothea Filmer (d. 1793), Sir John Filmer (d. 1797) and Rev.

In the 2007 Sunday Times Rich List, he was named the richest man in the City of London, with an estimated fortune of £860 million. As of March 2012, Forbes estimated his wealth at $1.3 billion. Cruddas was appointed Conservative Party co-treasurer in June 2011. In March 2012 it was alleged by The Sunday Times that he had offered access to the Prime Minister David Cameron and the Chancellor George Osborne, in exchange for cash donations of between £100,000 and £250,000. Cruddas resigned the same day. In June 2013, Cruddas successfully sued The Sunday Times for libel over its coverage of him, which the High Court found had been defamatory. However, in March 2015, an appeal court reduced the libel damages and made Cruddas repay £130,000 of the original £180,000 in damages, ruling that the Sunday Times's central allegation around \\"cash for access\\" had been borne out by the facts, while also ruling that a series of subsidiary allegations made in the same Sunday Times article were still false and defamatory. ==Early life== The son of a father who worked at Smithfield Market, Cruddas has an elder brother John and a twin brother Stephen, both of whom became taxi drivers. Born in the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney, the family initially lived on the Bracklyn Court Estate, before moving to Vince Court when the twins were six. Cruddas states his membership of the Boy Scouts as the reason for his early success, who taught him self-discipline and self- confidence: ==Career== He left Shoreditch Comprehensive with no qualifications, aged 15, and gained a job as a telex operator for Western Union in the City of London. After being made redundant, he worked in the foreign currency trading rooms of various banks, including the Bank of Iran and Marine Midland. By 1989, Cruddas was the head foreign exchange dealer at the City of London branch of the Jordanian-based Petra Bank. He left the same year to set up his own business, starting CMC Markets with £10,000 in the bank. CMC Markets is currently valued at between £750 million and £1.2 billion. ==Philanthropy== Cruddas has stated his intention to give away £100 million to enable children who have a background like his to succeed. To achieve this he set up the Peter Cruddas Foundation, which is chaired by the former Conservative cabinet minister David Young, Baron Young of Graffham. Cruddas is the largest individual donor to the Duke of Edinburgh Award International Association, a board member of the Prince's Trust, and has donated to Great Ormond Street Hospital. Cruddas supported the Royal Opera House and The Royal Ballet, and after becoming a member of the Chairman’s Circle, in March 2012 was invited to become a Trustee and join the Board of the Royal Opera House. ==Politics== In total, it is believed that Cruddas has donated over £350,000 to the Conservative Party. On 31 July 2013 on the BBC's Newsnight programme he stated that he had donated over £1,000,000. He donated £100,000 in the last quarter of 2010 and £50,000 in the first week of the 2010 general election campaign. Cruddas was appointed Conservative Party co- treasurer in June 2011 alongside Lord Fink, effectively the party's chief fund raiser, in succession to billionaire property tycoon David Rowland. In March 2012 it was alleged by The Sunday Times that he had offered access to the Prime Minister David Cameron, and the Chancellor George Osborne. The Sunday Times had secretly filmed Cruddas allegedly discussing what level of access different size donations led to: \\"£200,000 to £250,000 is Premier League - things will open up for you - you can ask him practically any question you want.\\" Cruddas resigned the same day. The undercover journalists were introduced to Cruddas by Sarah Southern, a lobbyist who is David Cameron's former aide. The undercover reporters posed as overseas financiers and claimed that their clients intended to buy distressed government assets and wanted to make political connections. In July 2012, the ConservativeHome blog reported that Cruddas was suing The Sunday Times for libel over its coverage of him. In June 2013, the High Court ruled in his favour and found that The Sunday Times articles had been defamatory. He was awarded £180,000 in damages on 31 July. However, in March 2015, all three judges of an appeal court ruled that the central allegation of the Sunday Times's story - that Crudas had offered \\"cash for access\\" to potential donors - was supported by the evidence, while they also ruled that a series of accompanying allegations made in the same Sunday Times article were still false and defamatory. Accordingly, they reduced the Sunday Times libel damages from £180,000 to £50,000, and ordered Cruddas to repay £130,000 of his £180,000 libel winnings. In June 2019, SkyNews reported that Cruddas handed £50,000 to Boris Johnson's Tory leadership campaign. ==Personal life== Cruddas has four children, two from each marriage. His second wife is Fiona. Cruddas was resident in Monaco for a period until March 2009, commuting daily from an apartment on Avenue de Spélugues to London City Airport. In an interview in early 2011 he stated that he had: \\"A £10m apartment in Monaco, a £5m house in Hertfordshire, a house in Antibes, a yacht and a private jet.\\" He plays golf with a low handicap, composes quatrains, and supports Arsenal F.C. In 2016, Cruddas and his wife Fiona paid £42 million in cash for Balfour House, a seven-storey Victorian mansion close to Park Lane in London's Mayfair, formerly owned by the Iranian-born art dealer Nasser Khalili, who lived there for 22 years. ==References *Peter Cruddas Foundation *CMC Markets Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:People from Hackney Central Category:English bankers Category:Businesspeople from London Category:English expatriates in Monaco Category:English philanthropists Category:British billionaires Category:Conservative Party (UK) officials Category:British Eurosceptics Category:Conservative Party (UK) donors ","title":"Peter Cruddas"},{"id":"35208653","text":"Andean woman with child. Programa Nacional de Población was a program conducted in Peru in the early 1990s to reduce population growth as a way of meeting international demographic standards. Compulsory sterilization, which is a method that forces individuals to partake in sterilization operations, was the main method employed by the Peruvian government to decrease population. While the motives and practices for such sterilizations vary, Compulsory Sterilization in the case of Peru under President Alberto Fujimori was a program strictly intended to lower national population growth by decreasing the fertility rate among women.Boesten, Jelke. \\"Free Choice or Poverty Alleviation? Population Politics in Peru under Alberto Fujimori.\\" European Review of Latin American and Caribbean Studies / Revista Europea de Estudios Latinoamericanos y del Caribe, No. 82 (April 2007), pp. 3-20 The program, titled Programa Nacional de Población (National Population Program), was directed at Peru's impoverished, indigenous, and marginalized communities and therefore implied the government's intention to diminish the rural population in order to enhance future economic growth. ==Political and economic background== The social and political climate of Peru in the 1990s at the time of the aforementioned sterilization program was the result of decades of class struggle and institutionalized inequality. Peru is a country that has long been subordinate to oligarchy in its society and as a result the class divide between a handful of \\"powerful individuals\\" and the remaining \\"poor and impotent majority\\" is significant.Gorman, Stephen M. \\"The Economic and Social Foundations of Elite Power in Peru: A Review of the Literature.\\" Social and Economic Studies , Vol. 29, No. 2/3 (June/September 1980), pp. 292-319 This issue of class - in addition to Peru's political instability and dependency on capitalist order from international governments - left the country in a vulnerable political, social, and economic position. In positions such as these, the poor are left inevitably to suffer from the failed policies of the upper class. This vulnerable state proved to be detrimental to Peru's constitutional government and civil society when the military overthrew President Fernando Belaúnde Terry in 1968 and remained in occupation of the government for an entire decade. Within this decade-long military regime under appointed President Juan Velasco Alvarado, Peruvian government made significant leftist reforms and intended to give justice to the poor. However, these reforms were unsuccessful and the poor and indigenous suffered as the country plummeted further into debt. It was not until 1979, under General Francisco Morales Bermúdez that Peru adopted a new national constitution and focused on regaining economic strength within the country.Coe, Anna-Britt. \\"From Anti-Natalist to Ultra-Conservative: Restricting Reproductive Choice in Peru\\" Reproductive Health Matters , Vol. 12, No. 24, Power, Money and Autonomy in National Policies and Programmes (Nov., 2004), pp. 56-69 Under this new constitution, population growth and families' rights to fertility were topics of political concern. As a result of this new focus, the Ministry of Health began to offer public services towards family planning in 1983. In 1985, the National Population Policy Law was passed and shortly thereafter the National Population Program was established. The population policy law, which continues to be in effect, intends to promote \\"a balanced relationship between population size, structure and distribution, and socio-economic development.\\" The law also specifically catered to the enhancement and protection of the human rights of Peruvian citizens with its promise to ensure voluntary and informed consent in issues regarding contraception and health services. However, Peru's government was still in the midst of internal conflict. Due to a lack of political support, there was not enough funding for the programs needed to carry out the National Population Policy Law. As a result, implementation of the law remained stagnant until the presidency of Alberto Fujimori in 1990. In 1991, a new National Population Program was developed, known as Programa Nacional de Población. Although Fujimori was an avid public supporter of family planning, the new National Population Program and its specific goals and strategies seemingly counteracted the law's initial purpose of preserving individual human rights. ==Demographics== As of 1992, Peru was ranked as having the fifth highest population in the Latin American region with an estimated number of 22,767,543 inhabitants.United States Library of Congress. Peru: Environment and Population. Washington: US Library of Congress, 1992. Web. The country is generally split into three geographic regions: the coastal region, the highlands, and the selva (Amazon region). As of 1990, the demographics for these areas were as follows: 53% of the nation's population in the coastal region, 36% percent in the highlands, and 11% in the selva. The National Population Program under Fujimori focused heavily on highland population, as it was the region inhabited by the largest amount of the country's indigenous peoples. The chart below portrays the demographic evolution of Peru since the year 1520. The green colored points on the chart mark the population at the time of the Inca Empire prior to Spanish conquest. The yellow marks the population during Spanish colonization. The red signifies population during the independent republic of what Peru is today, and the blue is the projected population by the National Institute of Statistics and Information Technology (Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática) up until the year 2050. alt=Demographic Evolution of Peru ==Population issues== The issue of population growth in Peru is directly connected with the social, political and economic inequality within the country. The average number of childbirths for Peruvian women is higher than that of Latin America's general average and also higher than the average of women in the United States.Schmidt, Bria. \\"Forced Sterilization in Peru.\\" Political Environments #6, 1998 As for the comparison of birth rates within the country, 1.7 is the average number of children per woman with a university or college education while the average is 6.2 children per woman for those who have little or no education. Women living in rural areas, mostly of indigenous descent, have the highest average birth rate at 7.1 children per woman. In the Andean countryside, the maternal mortality ratio is \\"very high for the region\\" at 185 deaths per 100,000 live births. In addition, there are 66 abortions for every 100 live births, even though abortion is illegal in Peru and therefore is most likely conducted with high risk. The issues that arise from this discrepancy in birth rates are troubling. When looking solely at statistics, it can be said that the high birth rate among the lower classes of society continues the cycle of poverty. The reason for such high birth rates is linked to factors such as the lack of access to education and income disparity. ==The National Population Program (1991-Present Day)== Goals With the newly drafted version of the National Population Program (Programa Nacional de Población) under Fujimori, goals were specified in the context of demographics. The Peruvian Ministry of Health's program manager stated that impoverished indigenous women are \\"poor and producing more poor people. The President is aware that the government cannot fight poverty without reducing the poor people's fertility. Thus, demographic goals are a combination of the population's right to access family planning and the government's anti-poverty strategy.\\" The program was targeted towards poor women who had \\"little or no formal education\\". Thus, the program intended to: *reduce population growth rate from 2.1% to 2% *reduce the total fertility rate from 3.5% to 3.3% *reduce maternal and child mortality rates *foster \\"equitable socio-economic opportunities\\" between men and women Strategies The National Population program called on both public and private sectors to assist in its strategic implementation. Furthermore, seven strategies were laid out as guidelines to reach the intended demographic goals: *reproductive health and family planning *communication and information dissemination *decentralization of population policy *education *production of research and statistics *advancement of women and youth *environmental protection Setbacks Because these strategies required the cooperation of various institutions, the program failed to be carried out with ease yet again due to the lack of coherence within the involved political sectors and agencies. Many agencies \\"lacked sufficient power to carry out [its] functions\\" and others were either \\"not interested\\" or opposed to working in agreement \\"due to inter-institutional rivalries\\". Peru's internal conflict from decades past continued to work against the overall productivity of the institution and its ability to sufficiently serve constituents. Funding was also a crucial issue that proved to be an additional setback to the National Population Program. In Peruvian government, as with many Latin American countries, the Catholic Church held significant power over issues both public and private. Essentially, the moral support of the distinguished members of the Church would result in financial support. However the Catholic community looked down upon the National Population Program due to its promise to provide modern contraceptives. Knowing fully well that his program would not be a success without the Catholic Church's approval, President Fujimori \\"toned down\\" the program's focus on contraception. Foreign Donors Without full support from the Catholic Church, outside funding was required for the program's success. International pressure to meet population standards became evident when the International Monetary Fund suggested that the Peruvian government cut funding for social services to allow for more spending in areas called for by the program. In addition, USAID (United States Agency for International Development) contributed US$85 million between 1994 and 1998. Because the financial support from foreign donors brought economic and political pressure upon Fujimori to meet international standards, the plan to decrease population growth consequently became more focused on quotas than individual rights and health issues. Implementation After the goals were defined and the funding for the National Population Program was in place, the number of annual sterilizations in Peru rose drastically. Prior to the program, there were less than 15,000 sterilizations performed per year and women could only have the operation performed \\"if they had a health risk, four or more children, or were above a certain age\\". However, after 1995 when sterilizations began to be performed, there were no pre-existing conditions necessary for sterilizations other than that women had to be considered part of Peru's poor and disenfranchised community. In addition, the number of annual sterilization procedures rose after the program's implementation from 15,000 to 67,000 in 1996 and 115,000 in 1997. The program's implementation also brought up several issues in terms of the quality and care of the procedures. Most of the personnel hired to perform sterilizations were not properly trained and much of the equipment used was outdated and lacking in quality. The counseling services provided to patients were also backed by poorly trained staff and many women were not given \\"quality information prior to procedures\\". When sterilizations were given, they were done so in a hurriedly manner. \\"Teams were dispatchd one day at a time to perform procedures\\" and therefore attempted to cover large masses of women in rural areas in very minimal amounts of time. As a result, patients were denied sufficient and proper treatment and rarely received follow-up care. Bribery, threats, and deception were methods used in the implementation of such procedures by medical personnel. A large number of the indigenous Peruvian population speaks Quechua and are unable to read, write, and sometimes even communicate in Spanish. Many women were deceived by personnel and told that the procedures were operations other than sterilization. There were also instances of men being told they would be fined or jailed if they did not order their wives to have the operation. A former physician for the Ministry of Health confirms these practices: \\"We were required to perform a certain number of sterilizations each month. This was obligatory and if we did not comply, we were fired. Many providers did not inform women that they were going to be sterilized - they told them that the procedure was something else. But I felt this was wrong. I preferred to offer women a bag of rice to convince them to accept the procedure and explained to them beforehand what was going to happen.\\" ==Public reaction== Because the procedures of the National Population Program went against Peru's constitutional law and violated human rights law, foreign donors threatened to suspend support for any aspects of the program that were sterilization related. Many public organizations, such as Centro de la Mujer Peruana Flora Tristán and the Comité de América Latina y el Caribe para la Defensa de los Derechos de la Mujer (CLADEM), began to voice their concerns for the program and attempt to obtain evidence against the Ministry of Health and the Peruvian government for their covert actions. In 1997, the newspaper La República reported on the human rights violations of the National Population Program and sparked a nationwide debate that brought the government's actions to the forefront of Peruvian media. ==Program reform== In 1998, the Peruvian government and the Ministry of Health agreed to reform the controversial aspects of the National Population Program. The elimination of numeric goals was arguably the most important change to the program as demographic goals and quotas were no longer needed. While sterilization was not eliminated entirely, the reforms for the implementation of the procedure included: *new counseling guidelines *new consent forms *two counseling sessions for patients *72-hour waiting period between second counseling session and sterilization *24-hour hospitalization after the procedure *certifications for health facilities and physicians Finally, the language of the National Population Program was also changed. Rather than a target of 2.5 births per woman as it was written in the original law in 1991, the reformed program intended to \\"reach a total fertility rate compatible with the individual reproductive intentions\\". == References == Category:1991 establishments in Peru Category:Sterilization (medicine) Category:Government of Peru Category:Demographics of Peru Category:Human rights abuses in Peru Category:Fujimorism Category:Compulsory sterilization ","title":"Programa Nacional de Población"},{"id":"35208657","text":"Boxing has been contested at every Pan American Games since the first edition of the games in 1951.Pan American Games boxing results.

In such cases, the integrand can be changed to a rational function by using the substitutions of Euler.N. Piskunov, Diferentsiaal- ja integraalarvutus körgematele tehnilistele öppeasutustele. Viies, taiendatud trukk. Kirjastus Valgus, Tallinn (1965). Note: Euler substitutions can be found in most Russian calculus textbooks. ==Euler's first substitution== The first substitution of Euler is used when a > 0. We substitute : \\\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c} = \\\\pm x\\\\sqrt{a} + t and solve the resulting expression for x. We have that x = \\\\frac{c - t^2}{\\\\pm 2t\\\\sqrt{a} - b} and that the dx term is expressible rationally in t. In this substitution, either the positive sign or the negative sign can be chosen. ==Euler's second substitution== If c > 0, we take : \\\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c} = xt \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{c}. We solve for x similarly as above and find x = \\\\frac{\\\\pm 2t\\\\sqrt{c} - b}{a - t^2}. Again, either the positive or the negative sign can be chosen. ==Euler's third substitution== If the polynomial ax^2 + bx + c has real roots \\\\alpha and \\\\beta, we may choose \\\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c} = \\\\sqrt{a(x - \\\\alpha)(x - \\\\beta)} = (x - \\\\alpha)t. This yields x = \\\\frac{a\\\\beta - \\\\alpha t^2}{a - t^2}, and as in the preceding cases, we can express the entire integrand rationally in t. ==Worked examples==  Examples for Euler's first substitution   One  In the integral \\\\int\\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{\\\\ dx}{\\\\sqrt{x^2+c}} we can use the first substitution and set \\\\sqrt{x^2+c} = -x+t, thus :x = \\\\frac{t^2-c}{2t} \\\\quad\\\\quad \\\\ dx = \\\\frac{t^2+c}{2t^2}\\\\,\\\\ dt :\\\\sqrt{x^2+c} = -\\\\frac{t^2-c}{2t}+t = \\\\frac{t^2+c}{2t} Accordingly, we obtain: :\\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\ dx}{\\\\sqrt{x^2+c}} = \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\frac{t^2+c}{2t^2}}{\\\\frac{t^2+c}{2t}}\\\\, \\\\ dt = \\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\frac{\\\\ dt}{t} = \\\\lnt+C = \\\\lnx+\\\\sqrt{x^2+c}+C The cases c = \\\\pm 1 give the formulas : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\ dx}{\\\\sqrt{x^2+1}} &= \\\\mbox{arsinh}(x) + C \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\ dx}{\\\\sqrt{x^2-1}} &= \\\\mbox{arcosh}(x) + C \\\\qquad (x > 1) \\\\end{align}  Two  For finding the value of :\\\\int\\\\frac{1}{x\\\\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}}dx, we find t using the first substitution of Euler, \\\\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4} = \\\\sqrt{1}x+t = x+t. Squaring both sides of the equation gives us x^{2}+4x-4 = x^{2} + 2xt +t^{2}, from which the x^2 terms will cancel out. Solving for x yields :x=\\\\frac{t^{2}+4}{4-2t}. From there, we find that the differentials dx and dt are related by :dx=\\\\frac{-2t^{2}+8t+8}{(4-2t)^{2}}dt. Hence, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\frac{dx}{x\\\\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}} &= \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\frac{-2t^{2}+8t+8}{(4-2t)^{2}}}{(\\\\frac{t^{2}+4}{4-2t})(\\\\frac{-t^{2}+4t+4}{4-2t})}dt \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= 2\\\\int \\\\frac{dt}{t^{2}+4}= \\\\tan^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac t2\\\\right) +C && t=\\\\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}-x\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\tan^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}-x}{2}\\\\right)+C \\\\end{align}  Examples for Euler's second substitution  In the integral :\\\\int\\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{dx}{x\\\\sqrt{-x^2+x+2}}, we can use the second substitution and set \\\\sqrt{-x^2+x+2} = xt + \\\\sqrt{2}. Thus :x = \\\\frac{1-2\\\\sqrt{2}t}{t^2+1} \\\\qquad dx = \\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{2}t^2-2t-2\\\\sqrt{2}}{(t^2+1)^2} dt, and :\\\\sqrt{-x^2+x+2} = \\\\frac{1-2\\\\sqrt{2t}}{t^2+1}t + \\\\sqrt{2} = \\\\frac{-\\\\sqrt{2}t^2+t+\\\\sqrt{2}}{t^2+1} Accordingly, we obtain: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\frac{ dx}{x\\\\sqrt{-x^2+x+2}} &= \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\frac{2\\\\sqrt{2}t^2-2t-2\\\\sqrt{2}}{(t^2+1)^2}}{\\\\frac{1-2\\\\sqrt{2}t}{t^2+1}\\\\frac{-\\\\sqrt{2}t^2+t+\\\\sqrt{2}}{t^2+1}} dt \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\frac{-2}{-2\\\\sqrt{2}t+1} dt = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\int\\\\frac{-2\\\\sqrt{2}}{-2\\\\sqrt{2}t+1} dt \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ln \\\\Biggl2\\\\sqrt{2}t-1 \\\\Biggl+C = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\\\ln \\\\Biggl2\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{-x^2+x+2}-\\\\sqrt{2}}{x}-1 \\\\Biggl+C \\\\end{align}  Examples for Euler's third substitution  To evaluate :\\\\int\\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{x^2}{\\\\sqrt{-x^2+3x-2}}\\\\ dx, we can use the third substitution and set \\\\sqrt{-(x-2)(x-1)} = (x-2)t. Thus :x = \\\\frac{-2t^2-1}{-t^2-1} \\\\qquad \\\\ dx = \\\\frac{2t}{(-t^2-1)^2}\\\\,\\\\ dt, and :\\\\sqrt{-x^2+3x-2} = (x-2)t = \\\\frac{t}{-t^2-1.} Next, :\\\\int \\\\frac{x^2}{\\\\sqrt{-x^2+3x-2}}\\\\ dx = \\\\int\\\\frac{(\\\\frac{-2t^2-1}{-t^2-1})^2\\\\frac{2t}{(-t^2-1)^2}}{\\\\frac{t}{-t^2-1}}\\\\ dt = \\\\int\\\\frac{2(-2t^2-1)^2}{((-t^2-1)^2)^3}\\\\ dt. As we can see this is a rational function which can be solved using partial fractions. ==Generalizations== The substitutions of Euler can be generalized by allowing the use of imaginary numbers. For example, in the integral \\\\textstyle \\\\int \\\\frac{ dx}{\\\\sqrt{-x^2 + c}}, the substitution \\\\sqrt{x^2 + c} = \\\\pm ix + t can be used. Extensions to the complex numbers allows us to use every type of Euler substitution regardless of the coefficients on the quadratic. The substitutions of Euler can be generalized to a larger class of functions. Consider integrals of the form : \\\\int R_1\\\\Big(x, \\\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}\\\\Big) \\\\, \\\\log\\\\Big(R_2\\\\Big(x, \\\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}\\\\Big)\\\\Big) \\\\, dx, where R_1 and R_2 are rational functions of x and \\\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}. This integral can be transformed by the substitution \\\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c} = \\\\sqrt{a} + xt into another integral : \\\\int \\\\tilde R_1(t) \\\\log\\\\big(\\\\tilde R_2(t)\\\\big) \\\\, dt, where \\\\tilde R_1(t) and \\\\tilde R_2(t) are now simply rational functions of t. In principle, factorization and partial fraction decomposition can be employed to break the integral down into simple terms, which can be integrated analytically through use of the dilogarithm function. == See also == * Integration by substitution * Trigonometric substitution * Weierstrass substitution ==References== Category:Integral calculus ","title":"Euler substitution"},{"id":"35208750","text":"Succinylation is a posttranslational modification where a succinyl group (-CO- CH2-CH2-CO2H) is added to a lysine residue of a protein molecule.

Subban was selected by the Boston Bruins in the first round (24th overall) of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. He played junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League with the Belleville Bulls. His older brother, P.K., is a Norris Trophy-winning defenceman with the New Jersey Devils. His younger brother, Jordan, is a former draft pick of the Vancouver Canucks, and currently plays for the Dornbirn Bulldogs of the Austrian Hockey League (EBEL). ==Playing career== Junior Subban made his Ontario Hockey League (OHL) debut with the Belleville Bulls during the 2009–10 season, appearing in a single game with the club. The next season, Subban spent the entire season with the Bulls, appearing in 32 games and recording 10 wins. Heading into the 2011–12 OHL season, Subban was a highly ranked prospect for the 2012 NHL Entry Draft, and finished the season as the number one ranked goaltender in North America. The Boston Bruins made Subban the 24th overall pick of the 2012 draft. He signed a three-year contract with the club just prior to the 2012–13 NHL lock-out. With the NHL shutdown, Subban returned to the Bulls for another season in the OHL, recording 29 wins in 46 games. Boston Bruins Subban attended his first NHL training camp with the Boston Bruins ahead of the 2013–14 season. He was cut shortly after appearing in a preseason game where he allowed 8 goals to the Detroit Red Wings, and assigned to Boston's American Hockey League affiliate in Providence. However, during the same preseason schedule, Malcolm had his very first opportunity to face his feisty defenceman brother P. K. Subban on the Habs squad on September 16, 2013, in a preseason match between the Bruins and Canadiens at Montreal's Bell Centre — Malcolm replaced Bruins rookie goaltender Chad Johnson at about 14 minutes into the game's second period, and managed to stop every single shot in the 31:49 he played in-net, en route to a 6–3 defeat of the Canadiens. Subban was the Providence Bruins' goaltender from 2013 to 2017. During the 2014–15 Boston Bruins season, due to the Boston team's backup goaltender Niklas Svedberg needing conditioning play with the parent team's AHL affiliate, Malcolm Subban received his first-ever NHL callup to back up Tuukka Rask on January 30, 2015. On February 20, 2015, Subban made his NHL debut against the St. Louis Blues. He was replaced by Tuukka Rask in the second period after giving up 3 goals on 3 shots, but returned later in the game. On February 6, 2016, he was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat during pre-game warmups. The organization announced Subban would miss at least 8 weeks due to this injury. After his fractured larynx healed during the 2016 off-season, Subban's play for the Providence Bruins during the 2016–17 AHL season resulted in an 11–14–1 record, with a 2.41 GAA and a 0.917 save percentage. By the 2017 off-season, Subban, along with fellow Providence Bruins goaltender Zane McIntyre, were each re- signed with the Boston Bruins for two years, at $650,000 per year. Vegas Golden Knights On October 3, 2017, Subban was claimed off waivers by the Vegas Golden Knights. He won his first NHL game on October 15, 2017, against his former team, the Boston Bruins. Subban started in place of the injured Marc-André Fleury. On October 22, 2017, Subban was placed on injured reserve with a lower body injury. He had been injured the previous day in a game against the St. Louis Blues. On November 17, 2017 Subban was lifted off injured reserve and was the backup for Maxime Lagacé in the following game against the Los Angeles Kings. The first time Malcolm played a regular season game against his brother P. K. was on December 8, 2017, where Subban made a then career-high 41 saves to help the Knights beat the Predators 4-3. In doing so, the Subban brothers became only the 10th set of brothers to play against one another with one a skater and another a goaltender. Subban was again placed on injured reserve, this time with an upper body injury, after being injured during practice on February 10, 2018. He recorded his first NHL shutout in a 5–0 victory against the Winnipeg Jets on March 21, 2019. Chicago Blackhawks On February 24, 2020, Subban (alongside Slava Demin and a 2020 second-round pick) was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for Robin Lehner and Martins Dzierkals in a three-team trade also involving the Toronto Maple Leafs. In the following off-season, due to salary cap considerations, Subban was not tendered a qualifying offer by Blackhawks on October 8, 2020. He continued with Blackhawks however, signing at a lower cap hit on a two-year, $1.7 million contract on October 10, 2020. ==International play== Canadian national junior team in the 2013 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He was goaltender for Team Canada in the 2013 World Junior Championships in Ufa, Russia. He appeared in six games, with four wins. Canada finished in fourth place at the tournament. ==Personal life== Subban's older brother P.K., won the Norris Trophy in 2013 and currently plays for the New Jersey Devils. His younger brother, Jordan, was selected in the fourth round by the Vancouver Canucks during the 2013 NHL Entry Draft and currently plays for the Dornbirn Bulldogs of the Austrian Hockey League (EBEL). His father, Karl, is the fifth leading scorer in Lakehead University basketball history. An older sister, Nastassia, played basketball at York University, ending her university career as the all-time leading scorer in Ontario University Athletics. ==Career statistics== Regular season and playoffs { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" ID=\\"Table3\\" style=\\"text- align:center; width:75%\\" - e0e0e0;\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" fff;\\" ! rowspan=\\"100\\" fff;\\"  ! colspan=\\"9\\" e0e0e0;\\" Regular season ! rowspan=\\"100\\" fff;\\"  ! colspan=\\"8\\" e0e0e0;\\" Playoffs - e0e0e0;\\" !

President of Slovenia Danilo Türk acted as an honorary patron, and the folk- rock musician Vlado Kreslin responded to a request and wrote the song \\"Okna na stežaj\\" that became an official hymn of the event. The World Cleanup 2012 initiative, which was started on that day by Portugal and Slovenia, will continue with clean-up actions in over 80 countries until September 2012. Over 270,000 people or 12% of the population participated in Slovenia. 5000 tons of waste were picked up. ==See also== * Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day! ==References * Category:Environmental volunteering Category:Environmentalism in Slovenia Category:Cultural history of Slovenia Category:2012 in Slovenia Category:Volunteering in Slovenia Category:Events in Slovenia ","title":"Let's Clean Slovenia 2012"},{"id":"35208786","text":"Sam Mitchinson (born 26 September 1992) is a left footed Australian football (soccer) player who currently plays for Gwelup Croatia. ==Club career== Perth Glory In 2009, he signed a youth contract with A-League club Perth Glory.

Incumbent Republican Governor Tom Corbett ran for re-election to a second term but was defeated by the Democratic nominee, Tom Wolf. Corbett was the first incumbent Pennsylvania governor to lose reelection since William Bigler in 1854.http://articles.philly.com/2014-11-06/news/56395405_1_exit-polls-mount- wolf-democrat-tom-wolf Corbett was considered vulnerable, as reflected in his low approval ratings. An August 2013 Franklin & Marshall College poll found that only 17% of voters thought Corbett was doing an \\"excellent\\" or \\"good\\" job, only 20% thought he deserved to be reelected, and 62% said the state was \\"off on the wrong track\\". Politico called Corbett the most vulnerable incumbent governor in the country, The Washington Post ranked the election as the most likely for a party switch, and the majority of election forecasters rated it \\"likely Democratic\\". Despite Corbett's unpopularity and speculation that he would face a primary challenge, he was unopposed in the Republican primary. The Democrats nominated businessman and former secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue Tom Wolf, who defeated U.S. Representative Allyson Schwartz, Pennsylvania Treasurer Robert McCord and former secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Katie McGinty in the primary election. In primary elections for lieutenant governor, which were held separately, incumbent Republican lieutenant governor Jim Cawley was renominated unopposed, and the Democrats selected State Senator Mike Stack. This is the first Pennsylvania gubernatorial election since 1982 in which the winner was of the same party as the incumbent president. ==Background== Democrats and Republicans have alternated in the governorship of Pennsylvania every eight years from 1950 to 2010. This has been referred to as \\"the cycle\\", but it was broken with a Democratic Party win in 2014. Pennsylvania has also voted against the party of the sitting president in 18 of the last 19 gubernatorial contests dating back to 1938; Democrats lost 16 of the previous 17 Pennsylvania gubernatorial races with a Democratic president in the White House, a pattern begun in 1860. The last incumbent governor to be defeated for re-election was Democrat William Bigler in 1854. Until 1968, governors could only serve one term; the state constitution now allows governors to serve two consecutive terms.Pennsylvania Constitution article IV, § 3. Libertarian nominee Ken Krawchuk failed to file the paperwork to be on the ballot in time and was excluded from the election as a result. ==Republican primary== Incumbent Tom Corbett filed to run, as did Bob Guzzardi, an attorney and conservative activist. However, Guzzardi failed to file a statement of financial interests as required by law, after being told by an employee of the State Department that it was unnecessary. Four Republicans, backed by the state Republican Party, sued to have him removed from the race. The case reached the state Supreme Court, which ordered that Guzzardi's name be struck from the ballot. NASCAR Camping World Truck Series veteran Norm Benning backed Governor Corbett during the later half of the NASCAR season with Re-Elect Tom Corbett placed on his truck.

J. Bonilla, Auti Angel, Laverne Cox, and Priscilla Lopez, and directed by Susan Seidelman. It is a romance involving a couple who participates in wheelchair ballroom dancing. In development for eight years before it was finally made, the film played at several festivals starting in 2011, including the Woodstock Film Festival. It was released on March 23, 2012. It played only a week in New York City, where it was entirely filmed, but as of March 30, 2012, opened in other locations in platform release. It premiered on cable TV (HBO) in December 2013. ==Plot== The story takes place entirely in New York. Armando (E. J. Bonilla) works part-time at his parents' restaurant and is also a custodian at a dance studio, where he secretly practices dance moves. He befriends the beautiful Mia Franklin (Leah Pipes), a dancer who is having a relationship with the studio's owner Daniel (Philip Willingham). She catches Armando dancing alone, likes what she sees, gives him a few tips, and they dance together briefly, but are discovered by Daniel. Trying to avoid an awkward situation, Mia leaves. When Armando realizes that Mia has left her scarf behind, he calls out to her from the studio's second floor window. On the sidewalk below, Mia turns to cross the street, when she struck by a taxi and rendered a paraplegic, paralyzed from the waist down. Upon learning of this, Daniel jilts her. Armando tries to boost her confidence and persuades her and other disabled people in the local rehabilitation center, including a \\"punky\\" Latina, Nikki (Auti Angel) and a wounded Iraq-war veteran, Kenny, (Morgan Spector) to enter a wheelchair ballroom dancing competition. Despite the opposition of his mother (Priscilla Lopez), Armando and Mia gradually fall in love and enter into a relationship, while Armando's uncle Wilfredo (Nelson Landrieu) falls in love with Chantelle (Laverne Cox), a disabled trans woman at the rehab center. Before the competition, Armando's mother, who has been maneuvering to get Armando hooked up with the beautiful Rosa (Angelic Zambrana), does her best to undermine (even to the point of \\"casting spells\\") the relationship between him and Mia, which has become sexually intimate by now. But Rosa understands, and generously breaks off with Armando. On the night of the competition, Mia panics when she sees Daniel in the audience watching her, and instead of dancing, rushes to her dressing room and begins to pack her things. Armando's mother sees what is happening, rushes to Mia's dressing room, admits that she was wrong, tells Mia that Armando loves her and encourages her to reunite with Armando and win the competition. Mia goes to Armando, tells him she loves him, and the two return to the competition and begin to dance. But just as the dance is at its height, Mia falls out of her wheelchair. As the stunned audience watches, Armando triumphantly picks her up and the two complete their dance with Armando holding Mia in his arms. The film ends without our knowing if they have won the competition. ==Media coverage and reception== The cast & crew of the film \\"Musical Chairs\\" at the 2012 Miami International Film Festival presentation of the film The motion picture, originally distributed by Paladin Films, opened in limited release with almost no mainstream media coverage and little publicity, except for some online interviews and articles. This was perhaps due to the media blitz given to the first Hunger Games film, which came to theatres on the same day as Musical Chairs and trounced every other film which opened that week. Musical Chairs did not do well financially, partly perhaps it played at only twelve theatres, but also perhaps because the buzz over The Hunger Games was so strong. However, in an interview on Deadline Hollywood, director Susan Seidelman said that she hoped the film would gain attention through \\"word of mouth\\", and that showings of the film were targeted at specific target groups (Latinos in its Florida showings, for instance; several Latino actors appear in the film). There was little if any national television coverage of it, and only a few major publications reviewed it, among them the New York Times, the New York Daily News, the Village Voice, and the Chicago Tribune. Neither Entertainment Weekly nor Rolling Stone magazine reviewed the film. It was left to online reviewers such as Harvey Karten to review it, though James Berardinelli did not. Roger Ebert also reviewed it. So far, 170 people have voted on the film at the Internet Movie Database as of March 2013, and its score there is currently low (the highest score possible on the Internet Movie Database is a 10). However, it has received considerably higher scores from the general public on sites such as Rotten Tomatoes, receiving an 85% favorable audience review. There has been some controversy over the fact that some of the disabled characters in the film were played by able-bodied actors. Mia, the leading female character, starts out as able-bodied, so an actress who is not disabled in real life had to be found for the role. However, whenever possible the producers and director hired disabled performers and dancers in key acting roles. This includes Auti Angel, professional wheelchair dancer and reality TV star of Push Girls. ==Awards== Musical Chairs was nominated for a Fred & Adele Astaire Award for Outstanding Feature Film in 2012,http://www.theastaireawards.org/2012-nominations.html but the award went to The Artist. On January 16, 2013, it was announced that Musical Chairs had been nominated for a GLAAD Award for Best Film in Limited Release. On August 13, 2013 the film received seven award nominations at the Massachusetts Independent Film Festival, including Best Film, Best Actress (Leah Pipes), Best Supporting Actress (Laverne Cox), and Best Director (Susan Seidelman) On August 19, 2013, it was announced that the film won six of those awards. ==Budget and gross== The film was made on a budget of $2,500,000 and made $31,478 in four weeks of its limited release. On April 25, 2012, the film was shown on the campus of High Point University in High Point, North Carolina. It was shown in Connecticut on May 18, 2012 as part of the Westport Cinema Initiative, and at Access Chicago on July 19, 2012. A scheduled August 22, 2012 showing at the Chatham Orpheum Theatre in Cape Cod sold out in a matter of hours. By popular demand it was brought back to Chatham, Massachusetts on September 15, 2012. It opened in Europe on October 3, 2012, where it was shown at the Hamburg International Film Festival in Germany. On December 10, 2012, it was shown in Havana, Cuba. On Valentine's Day 2013, it played at the Reel Abilities Film Festival in Fairfax, Virginia, and on March 22, 2013 it was shown in Hawaii for the first time. It was also shown on the island of Saint Martin on March 12, 2013 as part of Disability Awareness Week. ==Online== On December 17, 2012, the film became available for streaming free online at its website for a two-week period only. The magazine The Advocate proclaimed the event as one of the Top 10 Highlights of the year. ==Cable television== On November 15, 2013, Musical Chairs was shown uncut and without commercials, on cable television for the first time, by HBO Latino. It also finally became available on HBO video on demand. On HBO Latino, the film was not dubbed; instead, Spanish subtitles were provided for viewers who could not speak the language. Publicity for the showing was scant and limited only to the film's Facebook page. It was eventually shown on other HBO channels. ==References External links == * Category:2011 films Category:American films Category:American dance films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in the 2010s Category:Films directed by Susan Seidelman Category:Films about trans women Category:2010s dance films Category:2011 LGBT-related films ","title":"Musical Chairs (film)"},{"id":"35208951","text":"Ali Kayalı (born 29 January 1965) is a Turkish wrestler.

In > so strange a coincidence some improbability may surely be seen, but it is > heightened by the relations that are made to exist between the two couples: > for the wife whose letter had been misunderstood by her husband is supposed > to be enamored of the gentleman whose letter had been misunderstood by his > wife. The intrigue, such as it is, is ingenious, but the complications > obtained are those proper to the theatre, and, to say the least, infrequent > in the world. Nor, perhaps, are such deficiencies as the comedy displays the > less observable because the dialogue is often conducted with genuine wit.The > Academy, Volume 28, July- Dec, 1885; pg.17 ==Reception== A review in The Athenaeum, 1885, was as follows: > \\"Of many experiments recently made at morning performances the production of > Mr. Sydney Grundy's comedy The Silver Shield is the most hopeful. It is > doubtful, indeed, whether since the early plays of Mr. Albery any work of > the same class has obtained an equally favourable reception. Some farcical > comedies have met with no less cordial welcome. From a farcical comedy, > however, to a genuine comedy, such as The Silver Shield claims to be, is a > long step. Mr. Grundy's dialogue is not only amusing—it has the immeasurably > higher quality of appropriateness; his characters are true to themselves, > and are not mere victims of circumstance; his mirth has an underlying > suggestion of pathos; and his work has literary quality. In these respects > it stands above most successful effort of recent days. Now and then Mr. > Grundy stoops to the Byronic style of workmanship, and introduces a joke > which is inconsistent and improbable. When, for instance, concerning a half > finished dinner which the guests hurriedly leave, one of the characters > says, \\"It can wait,\\" Mr. Grundy unworthily makes another add, \\"The servants > could not.\\" Offences of this kind are few, and in one or two passages the > language is genuinely happy and worthy to be remembered. The plot is open to > objection. It is thin, and seems at one point to be going to pieces. That it > escapes from so doing is due to highly ingenious treatment, the result of > which is that the end is brilliant. A suspicion of artifice is, however, > suggested. Add to this that the plot deals with details of the behind-scenes > life of the theatre, which, whatever their success with the exceptional > audiences attracted to a first representation, are not calculated to appeal > to a more promiscuous public, and the chief elements of weakness are > indicated. These will probably be surmounted by the animal spirits of the > play, the ingenuity of its complications, and the cleverness of the > characterization. The fear whether the whole is not, like a clever toy, too > brittle, seems dispelled by the fact that the characters are at once amusing > and natural. Mr. Grundy owes much to his exponents. It is difficult to fancy > acting brighter or more effective than that of Miss Amy Roselle and Mr. > Groves, or more touching than that of Mies Kate Eorke, who at one point > attained a hold over the audience such as a girl of her age has rarely > achieved.

After the initiators had believed for some days end of March and beginning of April that the Syrian government was willing to comply with the peace plan, new signs of war and statements of politicians gradually cast discouraging shadows over those hopes. By the first of May 2012, the UN had to admit that the peace plan was in dire straits. Heavy government violence on 25 May, and the promise of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) on 1 June to resume its ‘defensive operations’, made clear that this peace initiative had, for the time being, run aground.

His career coincided with the early years of bebop. From 1942 to 1946 he was a trombonist, arranger and also backup piano-player for band-leader and pianist Earl Hines, alongside Dizzie Gillespie and Charlie Parker, also then in the Hines band which often broadcast seven nights a week on open mikes coast-to-coast across America.

The GIM never surpassed the planning stage however, though a MRK officer, Lieutenant (French: Lieutenant de vaisseau) Uon Chum was later sent to French- ruled Algeria in November 1958 to attend the 'Commando' course at the French marine commandos' Centre Siroco School (French: École des Fusiliers-Marins) in Cape Matifou near Algiers. The MRK naval infantry branch was officially established in 1960 but initial progress was slow – it was not until 1965 that a single marine rifle company (French: Compagnie de Fusiliers-Marins or CFM for short) was raised with a strength of just 150 Marines trained and led by Lt. Chum, subsequently enlarged to 200 men by 1969.Sutsakhan, The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse (1980), p. 35.Cambodia Navy - History at GlobalSecurity.org, Accessed 24 Nov 2013 They were never used in their intended amphibious role, being assigned primarily with guarding the MRK headquarters and main naval facilities at the Chrui Chhangwar Peninsula () close to Phnom Penh.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 255. Late that same year, the 200-strong CFM was amalgamated with 1,014 ex-Royal Khmer Army troops recently transferred to the MRK to form the nucleus of two new marine rifle battalions (French: Bataillons de Fusiliers-Marins – BFM). Raised for static defence and designated respectively 1st BFM and 2nd BFM, each battalion had an authorized strength of 607 men. Two further battalions – 3rd BFM and 4th BFM – were in the process of being formed by the time of the change of government in March 1970. The Marines in the Cambodian Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1970, plans were drawn by the rechristinized Khmer National Navy (MNK) Fleet Command to rapidly expand the CFMK to ten battalions in October, but only four BFMs totalling 3,000 men were fully operational by the end of the year. During the first three years of the war the Marines remained a small static defence force – by March 1972 the MNK Marine Corps' strength had decreased to 2,400 men after the disbandment of 2nd BFM, which reduced the number of its battalions from four to three. They were tasked with protecting the MNK main riverine base at Chrui Chhangwar and the coastal naval base at Ream in Kampot Province.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 23. During this period, at least one BFM comprising 493 men was sent in October 1972 to South Vietnam to be trained by US Marine advisors under the US Army-Vietnam Individual Training Program (UITG);Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 10-11. as for the remaining BFMs however, their training took place in Cambodia, at the Chrui Chhangwar naval base. Expansion 1973-74 This situation lasted until early 1973, when the MNK was once again authorized to double the strength of its Marine Corps, including an ambitious expansion to thirty battalions though the actual number of BFMs never came close. In May of that year, 2nd BFM was re-activated at Kaam Sam Naar near the south Vietnamese border, followed by the creation of four new battalions at Chrui Chhangwar – 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th BFMs – after a concerted recruiting effort and by the transfer of 3,000 soldiers from recently disbanded Cambodian Army (ANK) territorial companies to the MNK; two additional battalions – 9th BFM and 10th BFM – began to be formed in October. Initially intended solely for static defence, the BFMs deployment now paralleled the ANK, with the Marines being used more aggressively as intervention forces on offensive operations in conjunction with MNK riverine forces. By August 1974, all marine battalions were required to keep at least one of its rifle companies totally outfitted and ready to be deployed as a quick mobile intervention force (French: Force d'Intervention Mobile – FIM) for emergencies at all times. The BFMs fought as an interdiction force along most of the country's major waterways by spearheading amphibious assaults to secure beachheads and conducting clearing operations on islands located in the lower Mekong occupyed by the Khmer Rouge; they also patrolled the coastline and continued to provide harbour security to both military and civilian sea and river ports. In addition, the Marines provided cadre personnel for the new Cambodian SEAL Commando unit formed by the MNK Fleet Command in September 1973.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 258-259. By December 1973 the MNK Marine Corps aligned eight fully operational battalions: 1st BFM and 3rd BFM were at Ream and 4th BFM was allocated at Chrui Chhangwar, whilst the other four – 2nd, 6th, 7th, and 8th BFMs – were deployed in the Mekong Special Zone (French: Zone Spéciale du Mekong – ZSM; later re-designated 12th Tactical Zone or Zone Tactique 12), a MNK tactical area and special military zone that run along the lower Mekong- Bassac River corridors;Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces 1970-1975 (2011), p. 19. meanwhile, 5th BFM was still undergoing training at Chrui Chhangwar. That same month, 9th BFM was brought to strength at Kampong Chhnang and assigned patrol duties along the upper Tonle Sap River, engaging in counter-insurgency operations coordinated with the Cambodian Army's Lake Brigade in the namesake adjoining lake, though 10th BFM had yet to be filled by the year's end.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 255-256. Employed extensively in the offensive role for nearly a year and a half, by September 1974 the Cambodian Marines were starting to show signs of heavy strain. Casualties and manpower shortages seriously affected their tactical deployment, resulting in poor discipline and low morale. Due to budgetary restraints, the Marines received insufficient rice rations and were denied hazardous duty pay (French: Prime d'intervention) comparable to that paid by the ANK. This led to frequent desertions from the ranks of the BFMs and forced some of its members to leave their posts to moonlight on second jobs. Although the attribution of combat bonuses and the distribution of free rice did much to restore morale in the BFMs on several occasions, it did not completely stop the desertions, and the problem was never rectified.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 32-33.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 257. Final operations During the last three months of the War, the MNK Marine Corps reached a strength of 6,500 men on twelve battalions,Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 24. and aggressiveness and greatly increased mobility characterized their operations. The MNK riverine forces and the Marines conducted on January 18, 1975, Operation \\"Sailor\\", a last-minute effort to clear Khmer Rouge forces from a few strategic islands in the Mekong located close to Phnom Penh.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 258. It was to be the final amphibious operation of the Cambodian Marine Corps – despite their best efforts, the weakened BFMs posted in the Mekong Special Zone bore the brunt of the Khmer Rouge offensive and resistance crumbled, with desertions reportedly becoming rampant. By February 17, the MNK Fleet Command abandoned any attempts to re-open the lower Mekong and Bassac corridors,Dunham, U.S. Marines in Vietnam: The Bitter End, 1973–1975 (1990), pp. 102–04. and with the loss of Neak Leung on April 1, the strangulation of the Cambodian Capital was completed. The remaining Marine battalions were pulled back to Phnom Penh to help defending the city and the respective MNK riverine base at Chrui Chhangwar, while others withdrew to the Ream Naval Base. Only a few Marines and their civilian dependents managed to escape on April 17 from Ream with the vessels of the MNK Sea Patrol Force that reached Subic Bay in the Philippines on May 9;Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 33.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 243. their comrades at the Chrui Chhangwar riverine base who surrendered to the Khmer Rouge were not so fortunate. They were reportedly rounded up and either shot by firing squad, their bodies dumped into shallow graves dug in forest areas or were sent to be 're-educated' in labour camps (known as the \\"Killing Fields\\"), remaining there until the Cambodian–Vietnamese War of 1978–79. ==Structure and organization== The basic unit of the Cambodian Marine Corps was the battalion or BFM comprising 577 to 607 men, theoretically organized according to the French Army model into a battalion headquarters (HQ), three company HQs and three rifle companies. In reality however, the BFMs rarely matched this proposed organization, with most battalions actually falling below strength – some units fielded three incomplete rifle companies (with an average strength of 507 to 418 men), while others had two full-strength companies (365 to 312 men) or consisted of a single, understrength company that could field just 118 men.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 256. There were no major, long-standing formations above battalion level. Unlike the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and South Vietnamese Marine Corps (VNMC), the Cambodian Marines were never consolidated into Regiments, Half-Brigades (French: Demi-Brigades) and Brigades or even a single Marine Division. The BFMs were autonomous light infantry units that often operated independently from each other, though two or more companies from different battalions could be assembled to form temporary combat task-forces in amphibious assault operations, such as during the battles of Kampong Cham and Oudong.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 9; 24.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 242; 256. The Cambodian Marine Corps had no organic armour, artillery, motor transport, medical or engineer support units, so Marine battalions were completely reliant on the MNK, the Cambodian Army and the Khmer Air Force (KAF) for river and road transport, casualty evacuation and air, armoured and artillery support. In deep contrast to their VNMC counterparts who, although a component of the South Vietnamese Navy (VNN) belonged operationally to the Joint General Staff (JGS) of the Republic of Vietnam Military Forces as part of their General Reserve,Rottman and Bujeiro, Army of the Republic of Vietnam 1955-75 (2010), p. 11. the CFMK was not placed under the Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK) own JGS (French: État-Major Générale – EMG). Instead, it answered directly to the MNK Chief of Naval Operations, Commodore (later, Rear Admiral) Vong Sarendy, who acted as the de facto Marine Corps' Commander throughout the War.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 240.

After 1970, the BFMs employed the same standard weaponry and equipment of US origin issued to Cambodian Army infantry formations, though it remains unclear if they ever used captured Soviet or Chinese small-arms. * FN GP35 Pistols * Colt.45 M1911A1 Pistols * Smith & Wesson Model 39 Pistols * Smith & Wesson Model 10 Revolver * M16A1 Assault rifle * M1918A2 BAR Light machine gun * Browning M1919A4 .30 Cal Medium machine gun * Browning M2HB .50 Cal Heavy machine gun * M79 grenade launcherRottman, US Grenade Launchers – M79, M203, and M320 (2017), p. 20. * M72 LAW Anti-tank rocket launcher * M19 Mortar 60 mm * M29 Mortar 81 mm == See also == * Cambodian Civil War * Cambodian Navy SEALs * Commandos Marine * Khmer National Armed Forces * Lake Brigade (Cambodia) * Republic of Korea Marine Corps * United States Marine Corps * Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps * Troupes de marine ==NotesReferences== *Kenneth Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975, Equinox Publishing (Asia) Pte Ltd, Djakarta 2011. *Kenneth Conboy, Kenneth Bowra, and Mike Chappell, The War in Cambodia 1970-75, Men-at-arms series 209, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1989. *Sak Sutsakhan, The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse, U.S. Army Center of Military History, Washington D.C. 1980. – available online at Part 1Part 2Part 3Part 4.

The organization has its headquarters in Ljubljana, with members spread throughout the country. Members after the Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day! event (2010) In 2010 and 2012, the association organized the largest environmental volunteer action in Slovenia, which attracted over 13% of the residents (over 270,000 people out of ca. 2 million inhabitants), including the heads of the state, the military and hundreds of organizations. Both Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day! (2010) and Let's Clean Slovenia 2012 broke the record as the largest civic initiatives in modern Slovenia, each time joining over 13% of the country's population. For their achievement, the organization received the Order of Merit of Slovenia in 2010. In parallel, Ecologists Without Borders have been organizing other events for raising awareness about waste management issues and maintaining the register of illegal dumps that was developed in collaboration with Slovene mapping service Geopedia. Nives Dolšak, an associate professor at the University of Washington, researcher of common pool resources, characterised their work as phenomenal and an incredible success. The group ascribed their success to a tradition of care for environment in Slovenia. Nevertheless, they stated that the event will not be organized again. It was meant primarily for raising awareness, so repeating it would dilute the message and abet persistent polluters. They stated the same after the 2010 event, but then decided to organize it once more in order to support the global action World Cleanup 2012. Nonetheless, their focus had long shifted to prevention measures and promotion of the Zero Waste philosophy. ==References * Category:Environmental organizations based in Slovenia Category:Organizations established in 2009 Category:Organizations based in Ljubljana Category:Non- profit organizations based in Slovenia ","title":"Ecologists Without Borders"},{"id":"35209134","text":"Aydın Polatçı (born 15 May 1977) is a Turkish wrestler.

It is not related to the Indian sitar and its name is probably a corruption of setar a Central Asian and Iranian long-necked lute. The instrument has five strings in three courses, the middle course being of one string. Melody is played on the top two strings which are fretted together. The tuning of the instrument is unusual, as the single middle string does not go down the whole length of the neck of the instrument, instead it passes under the first four frets, where it then emerges and takes its place with the other strings. At this fret all the strings have the same note (g) - the actual tuning of the instrument is cc g cc. All the strings are of the same thickness, and are made of very thin metal wire, far thinner than the thinnest guitar string. The two bottom c notes and the g note act as a drone and the melody is strummed on the top two strings. The scale is a special scale of only seven notes to an octave and the player moves their hand up and down the neck, often quite rapidly to play the instrument. The thinness of the neck makes it very easy to move the hand quickly up and down the neck to reach different notes. The whole instrument is made of mulberry wood, the body being carved from a single block with a thin wooden table and a very low bridge about the height of a matchstick. The strings pass over this bridge and are often fixed to a metal eye at the bottom of the body. The mulberry wood neck of the instrument is fixed to the body and there is a mulberry nut at the top leading to five carved wooden winders for the strings. The instrument is not very loud, and is played by strumming the top course of strings with the forefinger while allowing the finger to also play the drone strings. It is related very much to instruments from Central Asia and similar long necked lutes (although not with the strange middle string arrangement which seems to be a regional invention) can be found over the border in the neighbouring countries to the West and North. ==Playing== It is often played in tea rooms in Chitral district. It can be played to accompany singing, sometimes along with drums, or beating on the jeer can (empty petrol jerry can). ==See also== * Pashto music * Photos at :ur:چترالی_ستھار ==References== Category:Pashtun music Category:Pakistani musical instruments Category:Chitrali culture Category:String instruments ","title":"Chitrali sitar"},{"id":"35209149","text":"Live & Inspired is the first live album by American rock band Godsmack.

The British Rail Class 91 are a 31-strong fleet of 140 mph (225 km/h), 6,300 hp (4,700 kW) electric locomotives and were the main express-hauling locomotive used on the East Coast Main Line (ECML) from London to Edinburgh and beyond. They have carried various nameplates throughout their operating career. During British Rail InterCity 225 ownership in the early 1990s the whole fleet was named. Themes included cathedrals, counties and places along the ECML, people (often with a railway connection), enterprises, charities and RAF-associated names. In the period immediately after repainting into Great North Eastern Railway colours in the late 1990s, all locomotives were briefly nameless before they were re- applied with vinyl lettering.Class 91 fleet nameplates , uktrainpics.co.uk, accessed 24 March 2012 GNER retained a number of the InterCity names, but also renamed several locomotives, and some were renamed multiple times during GNER's tenure. When the franchise was taken over by National Express East Coast in 2008, some names were re-applied on white vinyl (albeit in much smaller size) others were not. Their successor East Coast removed all names from locomotives, but in 2011, in response to customer requests, they resumed the practice. It began by naming No. 91109 as Sir Bobby Robson with cast-iron plates, unveiled in a ceremony at Newcastle station on 29 March 2011 by his widow Elsie and Alan Shearer.

NPA was a program of the Critical Literacy Institute, a non-profit organization founded by Luke Adams in 1989 to merge inquiry and action, and to sponsor young activist scholars, particularly those from marginalized populations. Cleve Jones, founder of the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt, co-founded NPA. Joe van Es-Ballesteros served as general manager, and Karyn Andrade served as program director. The curriculum covered the nuts and bolts of activism, LGBT history, organizing skills, health issues, and diversity. Adams and Jones saw the program as \\"basic training\\" for a new generation of LGBT activists, and as a way to address pressing issues including a rising incidence of HIV transmission among teens, a high suicide rate among LGBT youth, homophobia in school settings, and a \\"crisis of leadership\\" resulting from the loss of many movement leaders to AIDS. The student body included 50% men and 50% women; approximately half were people of color. NPA recruited them by placing ads in LGBT newspapers throughout the U.S. They were chosen on the basis of their commitment to LGBT social service or activism, and were not charged for their participation in the program. The students came from 45 states in the U.S. \\"I am going to do everything I can to get people my own age to get involved politically,\\" NPA student Madrid San Angelo, 24, of Denver, told the Bay Area Reporter. The students were housed in a dormitory at San Francisco State University, and classes were held at the Metropolitan Community Church in the Castro neighborhood. The faculty included a diverse array of veteran LGBT activists. Guest speakers included Supervisor Harry Britt, folksinger Holly Near, and the former executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Virginia Apuzzo. The students marched as a contingent in the San Francisco Gay and Lesbian Freedom Day Parade, and participated in various street actions including demonstrations and sit-ins. They organized a picket outside the offices of the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper to protest the publication of a column in which Herb Caen had written that \\"gays and lesbians do not have children, generally speaking.\\" NPA had a budget of $633,000, which was raised from corporations, foundations and individuals. Though organizers intended NPA to be an ongoing, annual program, they were unable to raise the $7 million endowment they estimated would be required, and the program ended after its inaugural year. == References == Category:History of LGBT civil rights in the United States Category:LGBT political advocacy groups in California Category:LGBT history in San Francisco Category:Organizations based in San Francisco Category:Organizations established in 1990 ","title":"New Pacific Academy"},{"id":"35209217","text":"Mad Dog Mcrea are a British folk band from Plymouth, Devon, England, their music blends a mixture of folk rock, pop, gypsy jazz and bluegrass.

It has smooth bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds usually in groups of three, white or creamy white flowers and smooth barrel-shaped to cup-shaped fruit. ==Description== Angophora leiocarps is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth pink to orange or greyish bark that is shed is small patches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves that are narrow lance-shaped, long and wide with a stem- clasping base, and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched, glabrous peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with three, rarely seven buds, on pedicels long. Mature buds are globe-shaped, long and wide with a smooth to slightly ribbed floral cup and petals about long and wide. Flowering has been observed from November to February and the fruit is a thin-walled, barrel-shaped to cup-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. ==Taxonomy and naming== Rusty gum was first formally described in 1986 by Gregory John Leach from an unpublished description by Lawrie Johnson and given the name Angophora costata subsp. leiocarpa from specimens collected near Warialda High School in 1976. In 1988 Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges raised it to species status as Angophora leiocarpa. The specific epithet (leiocarpa) is derived from the ancient Greek leios meaning \\"smooth\\" and karpon meaning \\"fruit\\", distinguishing this Angophora from others in the genus. ==Distribution and habitat== Angophora leiocarpa grows in open forest on sandstone hills and outcrops from Blackall and Mackay in Queensland, south to Narrabri and Grafton in New South Wales. ==References== leiocarpa Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Trees of Australia Category:Ornamental trees Category:Taxa named by Kevin Thiele Category:Plants described in 1986 ","title":"Angophora leiocarpa"},{"id":"35209258","text":"Valentín \\"Sirique\\" González (born 1876 - death date unknown) was a Cuban baseball center fielder in the Cuban League.

He attended the local Koranic school at first; then, with pressure from his father, he and his brother attended French school. He studied nursing and got his first job in 1966, staying in this profession until his retirement. In 1968 he married Meriem, a teacher; they have seven children. He lives in Rufisque, a fishing town about 20 kilometers from Dakar. The New African said of him, \\"It would be safe to bet that Abasse Ndione has seldom earned more than a pittance from any publisher. So he has made his living working full time as a hospital nurse.\\" ==Work== It took eight years for Ndione's first novel, La Vie en spirale (Life in a Spiral), to be released in Senegal. It discusses the use and trafficking of \\"yamba\\" (marijuana) by unemployed youth, police officers and whites in Senegal, discussing yamba as a social metaphor. It caused a stir and attracted the attention of the Parisian publishing house Éditions Gallimard, who published it in 1998. It is now studied in Senegal schools. Ndione's novel Ramata (2000) was also translated into Spanish. It tells of a beautiful and wealthy Senegalese woman who, aged 50, discovers the pleasures of the flesh in the arms of a little thug 25 years younger, causing her life to unravel. Ramata was the basis for a 2007 feature-length film directed by Léandre-Alain Baker, starring the model Katoucha Niane in the title role. Ndione's latest work, the novella Mbëke mi, describes the emigration of young Senegalese in pirogues trying to reach the Canary Islands and Europe. His novels show that Ndione thinks first in Wolof and then transcribes into French. ==Bibliography== A selective list, with dates for publication in France: *1984 – La Vie en spirale, première partie sortie de presses en 1984 au Sénégal *1988 – La Vie en spirale II aux Nouvelles Editions Africaines, second volet *1998 – La Vie en spirale, Gallimard *2000 – Ramata, Gallimard *2008 – Mbëkë mi, Gallimard ==References== Category:Living people Category:1946 births Category:Senegalese novelists Category:Male nurses Category:Male novelists Category:People from Thiès Region Category:20th-century novelists Category:21st-century novelists Category:20th-century male writers Category:21st-century male writers ","title":"Abasse Ndione"},{"id":"35209295","text":"Archduchess Magdalena of Austria Archduchess Magdalena of Austria (German: Magdalena von Habsburg) (August 14, 1532 in Innsbruck - September 10, 1590 in Hall in Tirol)Profile on Darlene's Family Genealogy was a member of the House of Habsburg, and the founder and first abbess of the convent in Hall in Tirol. ==Biography== Magdalena was the fourth daughter of fifteen children of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and his wife Anne of Bohemia and Hungary.

Jawn was a former slave of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari. When Abu Dharr was exiled from Medina by Uthman ibn Affan, Jawn went to Ali ibn Abi Talib who invited him to stay on as his companion. When Ali ibn Abi Talib was killed, Jawn stayed with Ali's son Hassan ibn Ali and after Hassan's death, he moved in with Husayn ibn Ali. When Husayn left Medina, Jawn insisted on accompanying him. ==Battle of Karbala== At Karbala, Jawn could always be seen at the side of Husayn. He was an old man, dark with gray curly hair. Because of his profound knowledge and pleasant manners he was greatly respected. On the night before Ashura, Imam urged Jawn to go away to seek his safety by telling him \\"You have accompanied us all the way but now you may go\\" to that Jawn replied \\"how is it fair that I benefit from your company and hospitality but abandon you in your hardship?\\" Jawn spent the whole night of Ashura sharpening his sword. On the following day he helped in repelling the first two attacks from Yazid ibn Muawiya's army. At mid-day, after the Zuhr prayers, Jawn came to Husayn, and stood silently. Husayn looked at Jawn and said, \\"Jawn, I know you have come for my permission to go to the battlefield. You have been a good and trusted friend. I will not deny you martyrdom for Islam. Go, Allah be with you!\\" Jawn smiled happily. He faced the enemy and recited a poem which said: > I am a soul willing to die for Allah, and have a sword thirsty of the blood > of his enemies Before I die I shall fight the enemies of Allah, with my > sword and my tongue serve the grandson of his prophet Jawn fought while reciting the poem. He received several mortal blows but his recitation of the poem continued. Jawn fell from his horse, he still continued to fight with his tongue by reciting the poem. And then a few horse men moved to where he lay.

Her works were frequently shown at the Leicester Galleries in London and she had her first solo show there in 1945. ==Biography== Born in 1900,Marsden, Christopher R. \\"Dorothy Annan and the Fleet Building Panels\\", pp 18-26 Journal of the Tiles & Architectural Ceramics Society Vol 18 2012. Annan exhibited with the Artists' International Association, and once featured in an art show in an air-raid shelter beside work by Augustus John during World War II. Annan was married to sculptor Trevor Tennant. She died in 1983. ==Legacy== Annan's paintings are in many national collections, she is also known for her tile murals, many of which have been destroyed in recent decades. Only three of her major public murals are believed to survive, the largest single example, the Expanding Universe at the Bank of England, was destroyed in 1997. Fleet Building telecom murals The murals, now relocated to the Barbican In November 2011 the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) granted Grade II listed status to Annan's murals on the front of the Fleet Building, 70 Farringdon Street, formerly the largest telephone exchange in London. English Heritage advised the DCMS that the nine ceramic tile murals, which depict pylons, cables, telegraph poles and generators, were of \\"historic interest\\" to the telecoms industry and had \\"relative rarity as surviving works of 1960s mural art\\". The listing was supported by the Twentieth Century Society and the Tiles & Architectural Ceramics Society, artist Frank Auerbach and Penelope Curtis, Director of Tate Britain. The murals were commissioned at a cost of £300 per panel in 1960. Annan visited the Hathernware pottery in Loughborough and hand-scored her designs onto each wet clay tile, her brush marks can also be seen in the fired panels. The building is owned by Goldman Sachs, who wish to redevelop the site and oppose the listing of the murals. In January 2013, the City of London Corporation agreed to take ownership of the murals, and in September 2013 these were moved to a permanent location in publicly accessible part of the Barbican Estate. They are displayed in their original sequence within an enclosed section of the Barbican Highwalk between Speed House and the Barbican Centre. ==External links== * *The Parade, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire by Dorothy Annan (1944) *Spittalfields Life blog on the Fleet street murals *PatternLondon blog post – April 2011 *Dave Hill's London Blog post – The Guardian April 2011 *Mike Dempsey's blog post – December 2010 *To Brighten the Environment: Ceramic Tile Murals in Britain 1950–70, by Lynn Pearson *Paper presented at the Tiles & Ceramics Society Postwar Murals study day – November 2007 ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1983 deaths Category:English women painters Category:People from Pará Category:20th- century English painters Category:20th-century British women artists ","title":"Dorothy Annan"},{"id":"35209465","text":"The men's tournament of the 2012 World Senior Curling Championships was held from April 14 to 21. ==Teams== The teams are listed as follows: White Group {  !style=\\"background: #FFFFFF;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #FFFFFF;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #FFFFFF;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #FFFFFF;\\" width=\\"200\\" -  Skip: Kelly Robertson Third: Doug Armour Second: Peter Prokopowich Lead: Robert Scales  Skip: Andras Rókusfalvy Third: Mihály Verasztó Second: László Tolnai Lead: György Kalmár  Skip: Antonio Menardi Third: Fabio Alvera Second: Giorgio Alberti Lead: Stefano Morona Alternate: Franco Morona  Skip: Yutaka Matsuura Third: Ryoichi Saito Second: Kikuo Kobayashi Lead: Toshiyuki Numata Alternate: Toshiharu Kamiya - !style=\\"background: #FFFFFF;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #FFFFFF;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #FFFFFF;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #FFFFFF;\\" width=\\"200\\" -  Skip: Wim Neeleman Third: Frank Kerkvliet Second: Jos Wilmot Lead: Bas Bennis  Skip: Hans Frauenlob Third: Lorne DePape Second: Al Langille Lead: Pat Cooney  Skip: Keith Prentice Third: Lockhart Steele Second: Robin Aitken Lead: Tommy Fleming Alternate: Archie Craig  } Red Group {  !style=\\"background: #FA8072;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #FA8072;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #FA8072;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #FA8072;\\" width=\\"200\\" -  Skip: Michael Sutherland Third: Tommy Campbell Second: John Summers Lead: Phil Barton Alternate: John Brown  Skip: Timo Kauste Third: Yrjö Franssila Second: Jorma Venâlâinen Lead: Seppo Malinen  Skip: John Jo Kenny Third: Bill Gray Second: David Whyte Lead: Tony Tierney Alternate: David Hume  Skip: Peteris Sviesbergs Third: Aivargs Purmalis Second: Janis Redlihs Lead: Ivars Cernajs Alternate: Girts Sils - !style=\\"background: #FA8072;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #FA8072;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #FA8072;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #FA8072;\\" width=\\"200\\" -  Skip: Sergey Korolenko Third: Mikhail Rivkind Second: Sergey Narudinov Lead: Oleg Badilin  Skip: Milan Kalis Third: Karol Pospichal Second: Ondrej Marček Lead: Pavol Trstan Alternate: Boris Kutka  Skip: Karl Grossmann Third: Hanspeter Nauer Second: Hansruedi Maag Lead: Heinz Meierhofer  Skip: Ian Journeaux Third: Dave Carlson Second: Tim Funk Lead: Ken Spatola Alternate: Mark Swandby } Blue Group {  !style=\\"background: #ADD8E6;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #ADD8E6;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #ADD8E6;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #ADD8E6;\\" width=\\"200\\" -  Skip: Hugh Millikin Third: John Theriault Second: Steve Hewitt Lead: Rob Gagnon Alternate: Wyatt Buck  Fourth: Herbert Planer Third: Josef Leputsch Second: Herbert Rabacher Skip: Ronald Niederhauser Alternate: Johann Raidl  Skip: Petr Kovač Third: Jaroslav Havel Second: Petr Fiřt Lead: Vladimír Foltýn  Skip: Hans Peter Schack Third: Bernd Hausted Second: John Hansen Lead: Erling Berg Thomsen Alternate: Alex Tordrup - !style=\\"background: #ADD8E6;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #ADD8E6;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #ADD8E6;\\" width=\\"200\\" !style=\\"background: #ADD8E6;\\" width=\\"200\\" -  Skip: Rainer Schöpp Third: Christoph Falk Second: Uli Sutor Lead: Karl Stiller Alternate: Adolf Geiselhart  Skip: Eigil Ramsfjell Third: Sjur Loen Second: Morten Søgård Lead: Dagfinn Loen Alternate: Stein Mellemseter  Skip: Connie Östlund Third: Morgan Fredholm Second: Lars Lindgren Lead: Glenn Franzén Alternate: Stig Sewik  Skip: Chris Wells Third: Hugh Meikle Second: Stewart Cairns Lead: Andrew Carr Alternate: Peter Sims } ==Round robin standings== Final Round Robin Standings {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !colspan=2Key -  ffffcc;

(; OSVED!) was a Slovenian environmental volunteer project organized by the environmental organization Ecologists Without Borders on 17 April 2010. Its goal was carrying out the largest environmental act in the history of Slovenia by joining 200,000 volunteers which would remove at least 20,000 tons of municipal waste from illegal landfills in the country. Cleaning of scattered garbage in urban areas was also organized. The project was inspired by the Estonian campaign Let's Do It 2008. In the months before the event, momentum was built up by various promotional and organizational activities. A large-scale inventory of illegal landfills was performed with the help of Slovene mapping service Geopedia. 115,000 such landfills were registered, containing an estimated of waste. In this phase, several other organizations joined the effort, such as the Administration for Civic Protection and Disaster Relief, Department of Geography at the Faculty of Arts (University of Ljubljana) and others. Around 300 members of the Slovenian Armed Forces participated in the experimental cleanup a week before the main event to sort out logistical problems. According to official data, around 105,000 people from all Slovene municipalities applied by the end of initial period of registration on 10 April, which was later extended to until the day of the event. Removal of of waste was planned; the remaining content of the inventoried landfills was hazardous waste or demolition waste. Such waste was not to be cleaned, only noted for informing the officials. On the day of the event, around 270,000 volunteers, or more than 13% of the Slovenian population participated, making Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day! the largest civic initiative in the history of independent Slovenia and setting the world record. They removed , or 12,000 tons of waste from 7000 landfills. For this achievement, Ecologists Without Borders were awarded the Order of Merit of Slovenia by the president Danilo Türk. == See also == * Let's Clean Slovenia 2012 * Let's Do It!

It has offices in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, and is getting close to having offices in all 364 districts. Afghan Post is responsible for providing courier services in Afghanistan. It is important to note that most homes in Afghanistan, particularly in older neighborhoods and in the rural areas, still do not have street addresses. Names and other descriptions may be used in place of street addresses. Afghanistan first established mail service in 1870, where it received international recognition. In late 1970s, it had grown into one of the stronger regional postal services, able to send and receive letters from anywhere in the world. During the 1990s, the Afghan postal service was suspended due to a civil war in the country. Sending a letter usually meant having to find someone traveling in the direction of the recipient willing to carry a note and hoping for the best. It gradually began to develop in the mid 2000s during the Karzai administration. ==History== The first postal arrangements in Afghanistan are credited to Sher Ali Khan, who established a postal service in the 1860s as part of a program to modernize the country.

It is located in Stensparken park in the neighborhood of Fagerborg, St. Hanshaugen borough. The urinal, built in a functionalist style, was used as a meeting place for homosexual men, in a time when homosexuality was both socially unacceptable and illegal in Norway. Its reputation as a place for gay cruising, combined with its round shape, gave it its nickname. Other nicknames included \\"The Wheel of Fortune\\", \\"The Round Barrel,\\" \\"The Mushroom\\" and \\"The Umbrella\\". In 2009, it was declared a Cultural Heritage Site for its place in Norwegian sanitary history. ==Construction== The urinal was designed by municipal architect Harald Aars (1875–1945), and was finished in 1937. There were three main considerations behind the building's design: it was supposed to give shelter for the rain, its open form should ensure ventilation and prevent bad odors, and users should be shielded from public view. In addition to this, it should also fit aesthetically into the environment of the surrounding park. The round shape of the building is typical of functionalist architecture. ==Meeting place of homosexuals== Homosexuality has traditionally been a taboo subject in Norway, and sex between men was illegal until 1972. For this reason, homosexual men had to find ways to convene, either privately, or secretly at specific public places. Several public urinals became meeting places for gay men, and these places were given humorous nicknames, such as \\"Bel Amis\\" at Sagene, and \\"The Wailing Wall\\" by the municipal library. Of all these places, Kjærlighetskarusellen in Stensparken is the only one still extant today. ==Cultural Heritage Site== The year 2009 was declared Norwegian Year of Cultural Heritage, aimed at highlighting the diversity and importance of Norway's cultural heritage for all sectors of the community. In connection with this, Kjærlighetskarusellen was declared a Norwegian Cultural Heritage Site. The Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage started the process towards protecting the building in mid-October 2008. Leif Pareli, curator at the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History, commended the decision, and commented both on the \\"simple and good functional shape\\" of the building, and on its status as \\"a well-known meeting place for gays and...therefore a trace of old gay history.\\" On 30 April 2009, a special ceremony was held for the declaration of the urinal as a protected building. Present at the ceremony were city conservation officer Marte Boro, Minister of the Environment Erik Solheim and Mayor of Oslo Fabian Stang. Nils Marstein, Norwegian Director for Cultural Heritage, said in a speech that \\"the purpose of the protection of the urinal in Stensparken is to preserve an important example in sanitary history of how the city arranged for trivial needs.\\" ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Public toilets Category:Buildings and structures in Oslo Category:LGBT in Norway Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1937 Category:1930s in LGBT history Category:1937 establishments in Norway Category:Functionalist architecture no:Stensparken#Urinalet «Kjærlighetskarusellen» ","title":"Kjærlighetskarusellen"},{"id":"35209516","text":"San Francisco Taiko Dojo, founded in 1968 by Grand Master Seiichi Tanaka, was the first taiko group in North America, and has been seen as the primary link between the Japanese and North American branches of the art form. Additionally, Tanaka's belief that learning to play taiko only requires a genuine interest in the art form (rather than Japanese ethnicity or heritage), has greatly contributed to taiko's success and growth outside Japan. ==Roots of “Tanaka Style” (History & Guiding Principles)== Tanaka's Background The dojo has been under the leadership of Tanaka-Sensei since he founded it in 1968. Therefore, to understand SFTD's style, one must first understand “Tanaka style”. Tanaka was born, raised, and educated in Japan. Not long after he graduated from Chiba University of Commerce (in 1964), Tanaka came to the United States for the first time (in 1967). While in San Francisco, Tanaka attended the annual Cherry Blossom Festival in San Francisco Japantown. He was somewhat disappointed, however, because it was missing “noise”; the drumming that he was used to hearing at every important occasion in Japan did not exist in San Francisco. Tanaka decided that he would be the one to bring taiko to North America and “make noise just like a Japanese festival”. Although he had received some basic taiko training in his home town, he had not received any of professional quality, so he returned to Japan and asked to become the apprentice of Grand Master Daihachi Oguchi (the man who combined traditional Japanese drum rhythms with a jazz influence to create the first ensemble taiko group, Osuwa Daiko). Tanaka became the first of Oguchi's apprentices from outside of the family, and after working hard to learn the principles of the art form, he returned to San Francisco to play in the 1968 Cherry Blossom Festival. Later that year, he opened the San Francisco Taiko Dojo. However, that initial training with Oguchi-Sensei is not the only influence contributing to the style of San Francisco Taiko Dojo. Tanaka has also trained with Master Susumu Kowase of the more modern Sukeroku Taiko in Tokyo (known for being the first ‘’professional’’ taiko group, and the group that first played taiko on slant stands) , as well as Grand Master Shosaku Ikeda, of the more traditional Gojinjo Daiko (which has been recognized as an Indigenous National Treasure). Tanaka has also trained in hogaku (traditional music of Kabuki dance and Noh drama) under Grand Master Sasazo Kineya, in yokobue (bamboo flute) under Master Kiyohiko Fukuhara, and in martial arts (including Shorinji Kenpo, Nihon-den Kenpo and Tsurugi) under Grand Master Tadao Okuyuma. All of these elements come together to give San Francisco Taiko Dojo that distinct \\"Tanaka style\\", which that allows audience members of an SFTD performance to not only hear the drums, but feel and be moved by them as well. Dojo Ideals While playing taiko, a player is expected to show the following 4 characteristics: shin/kokoro (spirit: self-control and playing from the heart), gi/waza (action: musicianship, skill, and technique), tai/karada (body: physical strength and endurance), and rei(etiquette: respect, courtesy and unity). In staying true to these principles and passing them on to others, Tanaka embraces any chance to work with a new person or group, and will not turn down a potential student because of that person's gender, ethnicity or past. However, students must be willing to put in the effort to follow through in all of the above principles. Tanaka is reported to never stop pushing his students so that they are always improving, because taiko is not about the end goal of mastering the art form (the art form is constantly evolving, so this goal is not practical anyway); instead, taiko is about the journey that one takes as he or she is learning. These ideals are not unique to San Francisco Taiko Dojo, but Tanaka follows and impresses them upon his students more than many others, such that new players or groups are often introduced to them and made aware of their power because of Tanaka or SFTD, whether directly (maybe through a workshop with Tanaka or one of his past students) or indirectly (possibly after being moved by one of SFTD's performances). ==Repertoire== SFTD plays original songs (\\"Tsunami\\",\\"Sokobayashi\\", and \\"California Wind\\") composed by Tanaka. However, the group's repertoire also includes songs from, or strongly influenced by, other groups, partially because, as mentioned above, Tanaka studied and became a skilled player of these styles and was therefore granted permission to play them outside Japan. Other pieces you may hear SFTD perform include the following: * “Yodan Uchi” and variations, “Shiraume Taiko” and variations (including “Matsuri Daiko”) from Sukeroku Taiko of Tokyo * “Hiryu Sandan Gaeshi” and “Isami Goma” from Osuwa Taiko of Nagano Prefecture, Japan * “Shichome” and “Nimba” (\\"Shishi Mai\\", or “Lion Dance”, accompaniment) * “Hachijo Daiko” (rhythms from Hachijo Island) * “Yataibayashi” (Chichibu Yomatsuri) * \\"Oni Daiko\\" (or \\"Demon Drumming\\") Retired piece \\"Space Noto\\" (a variation of Gojinjo Daiko of Noto Peninsula). ==Discography== San Francisco Taiko Dojo has released 5 albums: *Sounds Space Soul (released in 1983) *Inori (released in 1991) *Tsunami (released in 1997) *Sacred Drum (released in 1999) *Live at Cherry Blossom (released in 2015) Music from the group has also been featured on the soundtracks of the movies below. ==Noteworthy Events/Performances== Tanaka and San Francisco Taiko Dojo have been featured in four motion pictures: “Apocalypse Now” (Francis Ford Coppola, 1978), “Return of the Jedi” (George Lucas, 1982), “The Right Stuff” (Philip Kaufman, 1983), and “Rising Sun” (Philip Kaufman, 1993). The group was also the subject of a KQED special in March 2005. Tanaka and SFTD have had many other collaborations and performances with artists outside of Taiko, as well. These include the original Temptations in 1971; jazz drummer Art Blakey in 1975; Bobby McFerrin, Linda Ronstadt and the San Francisco Ballet in the first AID and Comfort Benefit (1987); Max Roach, Tito Puente, Mario Bauza, and Babatunde Olatunji at the first annual Sacred Drum concert in 1990; Dave Brubeck to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Peace with Japan in 2001; and Omulu Capoeira in Dancing Thunder (1995). Other important performances include the following (by date): In 1968, Seiichi Tanaka made his debut appearance as the only drummer in the San Francisco Cherry Blossom Festival. In 1975, Seiichi Tanaka was requested for a command performance by Emperor Hirohito in San Francisco, and San Francisco Taiko Dojo went on its first international taiko tour, to Mexico. In 1976, SFTD toured in France, Switzerland, Austria, and Japan. In 1978, SFTD held its first self-produced concert to celebrate San Francisco Taiko Dojo's 10th anniversary. In 1981, the first Japan-US Taiko Festival included Grand Master Daihachi Oguchi and Osuwa Daiko. In 1984, SFTD performed at the MLB All-Star Game Celebration in San Francisco. In 1985, Seiichi Tanaka performed at the Tsukuba World Expo in Japan, and SFTD held its first self-produced concert outside Japantown at the Palace of Fine Arts. In 1990, SFTD performed at the Nelson Mandela Freedom Celebration at the Oakland Coliseum. In 1994, SFTD performed at New York's Carnegie Hall. In 1995, SFTD performed at both the Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art opening in Haifa, Israel, and the Hiroshima 50th Anniversary Commemoration in Japan. In 1998, SFTD performed at Visa International's Nagano Winter Olympics celebration and at the Japanese Immigration to Cuba Centennial Celebration in Havana, Cuba. ==Youth Group: Rising Stars== The Rising Stars youth classes began at San Francisco Taiko Dojo in 1992 with children as young as 6 or 7 years old, and after joining, many of its members continued to receive instruction from Tanaka through the program for over 10 years. They have performed in Japan as well as across the United States, and they are reported to be “one of the finest Taiko youth groups in the country, and the most disciplined and traditionally trained Taiko youth group in the world”. ==Influence On Other Taiko Groups== Having been around for over 40 years, San Francisco Taiko Dojo has had a large impact on the taiko community. Two of the main mechanisms by which this occurs are 1. many of SFTD's former students have started their own taiko groups over the years, taking what they learned from the dojo with them, and 2. Tanaka has influenced many other taiko groups through workshops. Below are some former students who have started their own groups: * Kenny Endo (Kenny Endo Taiko Ensemble & Kenny Endo Contemporary Ensemble) * Russel Baba & Jeanne Mercer (Shasta Taiko) * Tiffany Tamaribuchi (Sacramento Taiko Dan & JO-Daiko) * Liz Berg (Taiko Maine Dojo) * Bruce \\"Mui\\" Ghent (Maikaze Daiko) * Yuri Morita & Susan Horn (Emeryville Taiko) * Hiroshi Koshiyama and Naomi Guilbert (Fubuki Daiko) Below are some taiko groups that have had workshops with Tanaka: * Soh Daiko had two week-long workshops with Tanaka-sensei after encouragement from Russel Baba. * Katari Taiko asked Tanaka-Sensei to give them a workshop in winter of 1979. This influence has even reached back to Japan. In 1993, Unosuke Miyamoto (“drum maker to the Emperor“) founded Nihon Taiko Dojo in Tokyo based on the teachings and philosophy of Seiichi Tanaka and San Francisco Taiko Dojo. ==References== Category:Drumming Category:Musical groups from San Francisco Category:Taiko groups ","title":"San Francisco Taiko Dojo"},{"id":"35209557","text":"Emily's Runaway Imagination is a children's novel by American writer Beverly Cleary, first published in 1961.

By the following season Qiu went on to establish himself as a regular within the squad and played in twenty games throughout the season as the club survived relegation and finished twelfth, however while he cemented his place within the team by playing in eighteen more games he could not help the team avoid relegation at the end of the 2008 league season when the club finished bottom of the league. While Qiu remained with the club he could not aid the club to an immediate promotion and they finished in a disappointing fifth within the group stages. At the beginning of the 2010 league season Qiu moved to top-tier side Shanghai Shenhua, however due to a broken arm he missed the majority of the season until November 6, 2010 when he made his debut for the club in a league game against Shandong Luneng in a 5-2 defeat where he came on as a late substitute.

She published the magazine Prosperos between the years 1949–1954, and Lear's Corfu in 1965. She was a close friend of Lawrence Durrell and had been awarded an MBE. ==Life== The Aspioti Mansion in Corfu Aspioti was born into a wealthy family who lived in the Villa Rosa mansion in a suburb of the old town of Corfu. She was the daughter of Konstantinos Aspiotis, a man who became wealthy by mass-producing, in his printing shop, a kind of exclusive playing cards illustrated by his grandfather Nikolaos Aspiotis who was a painter. Eventually his company moved to Athens and became Aspioti-ELKA, a well-known printing and publishing company and one of the largest of its kind in Greece. In 1930 Marie Aspioti published the book Corfu in French in co-operation with French writer René Puaux. Lawrence Durrell in the introduction of his publication Lear's Corfu in 1965 mentions: During World War II she became a volunteer nurse at the Corfu General Hospital. In January 1950 she published the magazine Prosperos, editions of Art and Literature of the British Council, inspired by Lawrence Durrell's work Prospero's Cell. In Corfu she was the director of the Corfu Branch of the British Council from 1946 to 1955, and was a family friend of Prince Philip. In 1955 she resigned her position as the director of the British Council in protest against the British policies in Cyprus against enosis in trying to suppress Cypriot self-determination. At the same time she returned to the Queen the MBE she had received. She also accused Durrell of betraying his philhellenism for a few coins. She also wrote poems and theatrical plays. In 1956 her first theatrical play O Κουρσεμένος Γάμος (The Pirated Wedding) was performed in Corfu. Her other literary works were published in Prosperos magazine and other publications in Corfu.

Poster for the fifth Salon de la Rose + Croix, 1896, depicting Perseus holding the severed head of Émile Zola. Designed by Armand Point and Sarreluys. The Salon de la Rose + Croix was a series of six art and music salons hosted by Joséphin Péladan in 1890s Paris. The Salon de la Rose + Croix grew out of Péladan's Mystic Order of the Rose + Croix, a cultic religious movement that he established in Paris. The avant-garde Salon artists included many of the prominent Symbolist painters, writers, and music composers of the period. ==History== French culture experienced a revival of intellectual interest in Roman Catholic religion during the fin de siècle period. While some intellectuals became anti-religious, others explored cultic religious practises and organized themselves into groups along the lines of Roman Catholic sects, with beliefs and practises outside the mainstream of orthodox Catholicism. One such following was established by Josephin Péladan, who was fascinated with Medieval Rosicrucian secret society. Péladan called his movement the Mystic Order of the Rose + Croix, and named himself High Priest, or Sâr, of the Order. Péladan's Order has also been described as an occult movement. Central to Péladan's doctrine was the promotion of the arts \\"especially of an esoteric flavour\\", hoping to \\"overcome European materialism\\". The main project of the Order was the organization of a series of art, literary, and music salons, the Salon de la Rose + Croix. There were six salons in total, held between 1892 and 1897.https://www.timeout.com/newyork/art/mystical-symbolism-the-salon-de-la- rose-croix-in-paris-18921897 The poster for the fifth salon (1896), designed by Armand Point and Sarreluys, depicted Perseus holding the severed head of Émile Zola,Jullian, Philippe. (1973) The Symbolists. Translated by Mary Anne Stevens. London: Phaidon Press, p. 234. in reference to the mythological story in which Perseus did the same to the Gorgon Medusa. Around 230 artists in total presented their works at the salons. Péladan wanted the Salon to create a forum for artists who rejected the officially approved academic art being exhibited by the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and the influential Impressionists. Péladan was a prolific art critic, publishing condemnations of the major contemporary art scene in Paris. He lauded artists whose work included mystic and idealistic aspects. The Salon gave him a way to put his cult beliefs into practise in the art world, with the goal of affecting change in the mainstream approach to art subjects. Péladan was clear about how he wanted to focus the works presented at the Salon. Subjects deemed thematically appropriate had to be overtly connected to religion and mysticism. Legends and myths, dreams, and allegory, were all considered suitable for the Salon, and the Symbolist painters were strongly associated with the Salon. Works that dealt with modern life, naturalist landscapes, realism, or decadence were not included in the Salon. Some major influences on Péladan were Arthurian legends, Italian Renaissance ideals and styles, the poetry of Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Baudelaire, and the music of Richard Wagner. ==Impact== The Salon de la Rose + Croix was vital in promoting works of the Symbolist movement, although many important non-Symbolist works were also presented. Among the most influential works included at the Salon were the \\"Gothic fantasies\\" of painter Arnold Böcklin, the music of Erik Satie, painters Fernand Khnopff, Ferdinand Hodler, Jan Toorop, Gaetano Previati, Jean Delville, Carlos Schwabe, and Charles Filiger. Not all Symbolist artists were enthusiastic about Péladan's Order and his Salon. Gustave Moreau and Odilon Redon rejected Péladan's doctrines and preferred a different, progressive approach. Péladan was a tireless and creative publicist for his movement and for the Salon in particular. The press and the public both flocked to the Salon's exhibitions when they were held. Péladan was as well known as his Salon, and his controversial personality may have overshadowed the Salon, leaving a more lasting impression. Although the Salon was popular with the public when it was held, the Symbolist movement failed to develop into a dominant trend in art. ==See also== *Expressionism *Post-Impressionism *Rosicrucianism *Symbolism (arts) ==References== Category:Rosicrucianism Category:Modernism (music) Category:French art movements Category:Symbolism (arts) ","title":"Salon de la Rose + Croix"},{"id":"35209851","text":"Wang Guanyi (Chinese: 王冠伊 born 9 April 1989) is a Chinese footballer who currently plays as midfielder for Hangzhou Greentown in the China League One. ==Club career== Wang Guanyi would start his professional football career with third tier football club Tianjin Locomotive before being scouted by top tier side Shanghai Shenhua, who he eventually joined at the beginning of the 2010 league season with team mates Feng Renliang and Song Boxuan.

It describes the evolutionarily determined instinct among humans toward territoriality and the implications of this territoriality in human meta-phenomena such as property ownership and nation building. The Territorial Imperative was an immediate success and remains a widely influential work of popular science. It extended Ardrey's groundbreaking anthropological work, contributed to the development of the science of ethology, and encouraged an increasing public interest in human origins. The Territorial Imperative is the second book in Ardrey's Nature of Man Series; it is preceded by African Genesis (1961) and followed by The Social Contract (1970) and The Hunting Hypothesis (1976). It was illustrated by Ardrey's wife, the South African actress and illustrator Berdine Ardrey (née Grunewald). Ardrey dedicated The Territorial Imperative to Henry Eliot Howard, who was noted for being one of the first to describe in detail the territorial behaviors of birds. ==Synopsis== The Territorial Imperative develops the theses originally introduced in African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man, which was published five years earlier. In African Genesis, Ardrey posited that man originated in Africa instead of Asia, that he is driven by inherited instincts to acquire land and defend territory, and that the development of weapons was a fundamental turning point in his evolution.Hunt, George P. \\"Provocateur in Anthropology.\\" Time 26 August 1966: 2. Print. The Territorial Imperative further explores these ideas with a special emphasis on man's distinct preoccupation with the concept of territory. It goes on to elucidate the role that inherited evolutionary instinct, particularly the so-called \\"territorial imperative\\", plays in modern human society in phenomena such as property ownership and nation building. ==Controversy== The Territorial Imperative caused significant scientific and popular controversy. In it Ardrey restated and developed his challenge to the reigning methodological assumption of the social sciences, that human behavior is fundamentally distinct from animal behavior. As he writes in The Territorial Imperative, \\"The dog barking at you from behind his master’s fence acts for a motive indistinguishable from that of his master when the fence was built.\\"Ardrey, Robert. \\"The Territorial Imperative: A Personal Inquiry into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations.\\" New York: Atheneum. 1966. Print. Robert Wokler wrote of Ardrey's challenge to the established life sciences: > What ought to be studied, according to Ardrey, are the relations between > individuals that stem from the innate and universal attributes of animal > life, whereas cultural anthropologists who detect a fundamental > discontinuity between mankind and other zoological species are just > impervious to the revolutionary ideas of Darwinism which have reverberated > throughout all the life sciences apart from their own.Wokler, Robert. > \\"Perfectible Apes in Decadent Cultures: Rousseau's Anthropology Revisited.\\" > Daedalus Vol. 107, No. 3, Rousseau for Our Time (Summer, 1978), pp. 107-134. > Print. In 1968, two years after the publication of The Territorial Imperative, Ashley Montagu organized fourteen scientists to write essays in opposition to Ardrey's work (and the similarly aligned work of Konrad Lorenz, On Aggression). That volume became Man and Aggression. Montagu would eventually edit another volume in opposition to Ardrey,Webster, Bayard. \\"Robert Ardrey Dies; Writer on Behavior.\\" New York: The New York Times. January 16, 1980. Print and the increasingly heated debate served to further stir popular interest in human origins. By Carmel Schrire's account, \\"Ashley Montagu edited two collections of writings aimed at countering the views of both Ardrey and Konrad Lorenz. ... Despite this, Ardrey's popularity did not flag, and his writings opened the fields of paleoanthropology, ethnology, and anthropology to a wide readership.\\"Schrire, Carmel \\"Ardrey, Robert (1908-1980)\\" in Spencer, Frank (ed.) History of Physical Anthropology, Volume 1. Taylor & Francis. Jan 1 1997. p. 100. Print. The opposition of these two viewpoints became a major theme in the social science of the time. Robin Fox, who authored The Imperial Animal (1972) with Lionel Tiger, wrote of the opposition: > I was a great friend of Robert Ardrey, and had been known publicly to defend > his name and honor from the assault of the anti-Ardreyites, including Ashley > Montagu. ... Ashley Montagu always carefully distanced himself from what he > thought were our erroneous conclusions about human aggression. We returned > the favor, even calling him and his school \\"the Christian Scientists of > anthropology\\" for their refusal to accept the reality of human evil: that it > was an essential part of being human and could not be just wished away. We > in turn were included eventually among the villains in his \\"new litany of > innate depravity.\\" And so it went.Fox, Robin. \\"Man and Aggression: A > Reconciliation.\\" pp. 233-43. In Reynolds, Larry T. et al Race and Other > Misadventures: Essays in Honor of Ashley Montagu in His Ninetieth Year. New > York: Rowman and Littlefield. Jan 1, 1996. Print. Some essays in the Montagu volume, as well as much other criticism of Ardrey's work, claimed that, because it asserted the role of instinctual aggression in determining man's behavior, his work excused aggression or saw the human as innately evil. Ardrey insistently refuted these critiques, claiming instead that an awareness of human nature was necessary to truly pursue civilization. For example, Ardrey, in a 1971 Penthouse interview, asserted \\"I don't think human beings are that bad at all—I think they are absolutely marvellous. We've got to stop kidding ourselves, stop lying to ourselves, living with a delusion about ourselves.\\"Segall, Harvey. \\"Robert Ardrey.\\" Interview with Robert Ardrey in Penthouse Volume 5, Number 11. pp. 28-33 ==Legacy== The Territorial Imperative was widely read and exerted a major cultural influence.Graves, Ralph. \\"A 'Scientific Amateur' Expands his Territory.\\" Time 11 September 1970: 1. Print: \\"Both of these books enjoyed, along with the scientific uproar they created, a wide general readership, and Ardrey, who describes himself as a 'scientific amateur,' today can claim major credit for having introduced the public to the new field of ethology, the study of animal behavior and its relationship to man.\\" It quickly became an international bestseller and was translated into dozens of languages.Dawkins, Richard. Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist. 2014. New York: Ecco. Print Ardrey's work in general, and The Territorial Imperative in particular, is often credited with arousing popular interest in ethology, anthropology, and human origins.Masters, Roger D. from \\"Professional Comments on Robert Ardrey's The Hunting Hypothesis New York: Atheneum. March 1967: \\"Specialists may well challenge details or observations here and there. But his overall contribution to public understanding of an enormous range of scientific research is of the greatest importance.\\" Geoffrey Gorer, for example, in his Encounter review of The Territorial Imperative, writes: \\"Almost without question, Robert Ardrey is today the most influential writer in English dealing with the innate or instinctive attributes of human nature, and the most skilled populariser of the findings of paleo-anthropologists, ethologists, and biological experimenters.\\"Gorer, Geoffrey. \\"Ardrey on Human Nature: Animals, Nations, Imperatives.\\" pp. 66-7. Encounter June 1967. Print. Gorer goes on to write: \\"[Ardrey] is a skilled writer, with a lively command of English prose, a pretty turn of wit, and a dramatist's skill in exposition. He is also a good reporter, with the reporter's eye for the significant detail, the striking visual impression. He has taken a look at nearly all the current work in Africa of paleo-anthropologists and ethologists; time and time again, a couple of his paragraphs can make vivid a site, such as the Olduvai Gorge, which has been merely a name in a hundred articles. His wide readership has been earned, at least in part, by his mastery of the writer's craft.\\" Ralph Graves claims \\"[Ardrey] today can claim major credit for having introduced the public to the new field of ethology, the study of animal behavior and its relationship to man.\\" Commenting upon Ardrey's legacy on the occasion of his death, the South African anthropologist Dr. Phillip Tobias stated, \\"He has made an incalculable contribution to the science of human evolution. Thousands of people around the world, especially in the United States, were made aware of the fascination and the importance of studies on man's place in nature [through his writing].\\"Tobias, Phillip. Quoted in Webster, Bayard. \\"Robert Ardrey Dies; Writer on Behavior.\\" New York: The New York Times. January 16, 1980. Print The work influenced several notable figures. Stanley Kubrick cited Ardrey as an inspiration for his films 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and A Clockwork Orange (1971). (From the Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke.) The strategic analyst Andrew Marshall and U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger are known to have discussed The Territorial Imperative in connection to military-strategic thinking.Somit, Albert. et. al. Human Nature and Public Policy: An Evolutionary Approach. 2003. Palgrave Macmillan. P. 24. Print Ardrey went on to publish two more books on human origins and the nature of man, The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder (1970) and The Hunting Hypothesis: A Personal Conclusion Concerning the Evolutionary Nature of Man (1976). He continued to publish influential works in the field of anthropology until his death in 1980. His theories are still widely discussed today. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Full text ==External links== *The Official Robert Ardrey Estate Website *The Nature of Man Series at the Robert Ardrey Estate Website Category:Books by Robert Ardrey Category:Nature of Man Series Category:Science books Category:Psychology books Category:1966 non-fiction books ","title":"The Territorial Imperative"},{"id":"35209865","text":"Dennis Aase (born February 23, 1944) is an American race car driver, a member of the All American Racers team.

The Falkestrasse rooftop extension was included as a part of the Deconstructivist Architecture exhibition held in the MOMA in 1988.http://www.moma.org/docs/press_archives/6526/releases/MOMA_1988_0029_29.pdf?2010 In his introduction essay to the deconstructivist exhibition, Mark Wigley describes the project as \\"The rooftop remodeling project in this exhibition... is clearly a form that has been distorted by some alien organism, a writhing, disruptive animal breaking through the corner. Some twisted counter-relief infects the orthogonal box. It is a skeletal monster which breaks up the elements of the form as it struggles out\\".Franz Schulze, 1996.

The second round was held one week later as an independent round of the championship, the only one of its kind on the 2012 calendar. The rounds were the first time the GP2 Series has visited the Bahrain International Circuit since 2007. The circuit was a regular fixture on the calendar of the now-defunct GP2 Asia Series from its inception in 2008 until 2011, when the race was cancelled due to anti-government protests. With the GP2 Asia series being discontinued at the end of the 2011 season and merged into its parent series, the Bahrain International Circuit returned to the larger GP2 Series as part of the series' expansion to include fly-away rounds. In the week before the first race, Barwa Addax driver Josef Král was replaced by Dani Clos. Brendon Hartley also replaced Ocean Racing Technology's Jon Lancaster. DAMS driver Davide Valsecchi qualified on pole for the first feature race, and won both the feature and sprint races. Valsecchi also won the second feature race, with Rapax driver Tom Dillmann taking his first GP2 Series win in the second sprint. The first race was also the first time that the series introduced the points system used by Formula One since 2010 for the feature race, with points awarded to the top ten drivers and twenty-five points awarded to the race winner. The points for the sprint race were changed too, with the winner receiving fifteen points and the top eight drivers scoring points.

This includes the structure of words, phrases, clauses and sentences. In Malay, there are four basic parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and grammatical function words (particles). Nouns and verbs may be basic roots, but frequently they are derived from other words by means of prefixes and suffixes. ==Word formation== Malay is an agglutinative language, and new words are formed by three methods. New words can be created by attaching affixes onto a root word (affixation), formation of a compound word (composition), or repetition of words or portions of words (reduplication). Affixes Root words are either nouns or verbs, which can be affixed to derive new words, e.g., masak (to cook) yields memasak (cooks, as a verb), memasakkan (cooks for), dimasak (cooked) as well as pemasak (a cook), masakan (a meal, cookery). Many initial consonants undergo mutation when prefixes are added: e.g., sapu (sweep) becomes penyapu (broom); panggil (to call) becomes memanggil (calls/calling), tapis (to sift) becomes menapis (sifts). Other examples of the use of affixes to change the meaning of a word can be seen with the word ajar (teach): * ajar = teach * ajaran = teachings * belajar = to learn * mengajar = to teach * diajar = being taught (intransitive) * diajarkan = being taught (transitive) * mempelajari = to study * dipelajari = being studied * pelajar = student * pengajar = teacher * pelajaran = subject, education * pengajaran = lesson, moral of story * pembelajaran = learning * terajar = taught (accidentally) * terpelajar = well-educated, literally \\"been taught\\" * berpelajaran = is educated, literally \\"has education\\" There are four types of affixes, namely prefixes (awalan), suffixes (akhiran), circumfixes (apitan) and infixes (sisipan). These affixes are categorised into noun affixes, verb affixes, and adjective affixes. Noun affixes are affixes that form nouns upon addition to root words. The following are examples of noun affixes: { - ! efefef;\\"  Type of noun affixes ! efefef;\\"  Affix ! efefef;\\"  Example of root word ! efefef;\\"  Example of derived word - Prefix pə(r)- ~ pəng- duduk (sit) penduduk (population) -  kə- hendak (want) kehendak (desire) -  juru- wang (money) juruwang (cashier) - Infix  tunjuk (point) telunjuk (index finger, command) -   kelut (dishevelled) kemelut (chaos, crisis) -   gigi (teeth) gerigi (toothed blade) - Suffix  -an bangun (wake up, raise) bangunan (building) - Circumfix kə-...-an raja (king) kerajaan (kingdom) -  pə(r)-...-an pəng-...-an kerja (work) pekerjaan (occupation) } The prefix per- drops its r before r, l and frequently before p, t, k. In some words it is peng-; though formally distinct, these are treated as variants of the same prefix in Malay grammar books. Similarly, verb affixes are attached to root words to form verbs. In Malay, there are: { - ! efefef;\\"  Type of verb affixes ! efefef;\\"  Affix ! efefef;\\"  Example of root word ! efefef;\\"  Example of derived word - Prefix bər- ajar (teach) belajar (to study)The root ajar retrieves a historic initial l after the suffixes ber- and pe(r)-. -  məng- tolong (help) menolong (to help) -  di- ambil (take) diambil (be taken) -  məmpər- kemas (tidy up, orderly) memperkemas (to arrange further) -  dipər- dalam (deep) diperdalam (be deepened) -  tər- makan (eat) termakan (to have accidentally eaten) - Suffix  -kan letak (place, keep) letakkan (keep) -   -i jauh (far) jauhi (avoid) - Circumfix bər-...-an pasang (pair) berpasangan (in pairs) -  bər-...-kan dasar (base) berdasarkan (based on) -  məng-...-kan pasti (sure) memastikan (to make sure) -  məng-...-i teman (company) menemani (to accompany) -  məmpər-...-kan guna (use) mempergunakan (to utilise, to exploit) -  məmpər-...-i ajar (teach) mempelajari (to study) -  kə-...-an hilang (disappear) kehilangan (to lose) -  di-...-i sakit (pain) disakiti (to be hurt by) -  di-...-kan benar (right) dibenarkan (is allowed to) -  dipər-...-kan kenal (know, recognise) diperkenalkan (is being introduced) } Adjective affixes are attached to root words to form adjectives: { - ! efefef;\\"  Type of adjective affixes ! efefef;\\"  Affix ! efefef;\\"  Example of root word ! efefef;\\"  Example of derived word - Prefix tər- kenal (know) terkenal (famous) -  sə- lari (run) selari (parallel) - Infix  serak (disperse) selerak (messy) -   cerlang (radiant bright) cemerlang (bright, excellent) -   sabut (husk) serabut (dishevelled) - Circumfix kə-...-an barat (west) kebaratan (westernized) } In addition to these affixes, Malay also has a lot of borrowed affixes from other languages such as Sanskrit, Arabic and English. For example, maha-, pasca-, eka-, bi-, anti-, pro- etc. Reduplication Reduplication (Kata Ganda or Kata Ulang) in the Malay language is a very productive process. It is mainly used for forming plurals, but sometimes it may alter the meaning of the whole word, or change the usage of the word in sentences. Forms There are four types of words reduplication in Malay, namely * Full reduplication (Kata Ganda Penuh (Malaysian) or Kata Ulang Utuh (Indonesian) or Dwilingga) * Partial reduplication (Kata Ganda Separa (Malaysian) or Kata Ulang Sebagian (Indonesian) or Dwipurwa) * Rhythmic reduplication (Kata Ganda Berentak (Malaysian) or Kata Ulang Salin Suara (Indonesian)) * Reduplication of meaning Full reduplication is the complete duplication of the word, separated by a dash (-). For example, buku (book) when duplicated form buku-buku (books), while the duplicated form of batu (stone) is batu-batu (stones). Partial reduplication repeats only the initial consonant of the word, such as dedaun (leaves) from the word daun (leaf), and tetangga (neighbor) from the word tangga (ladder). The words are usually not separated by spaces or punctuation, and is considered a single word. Rhythmic reduplication repeats the whole word, but one or more of its phonemes are altered. For example, the word gerak (motion) can be reduplicated rhythmically to form gerak-gerik (movements) by altering the vowel. The reduplication can also be formed by altering the consonant, e.g., in sayur-mayur (vegetables [bundled for the market]) from the root word sayur (vegetable/vegetables [what is found on plate]). ==Nouns== Common derivational affixes for nouns are peng-/per-/juru- (actor, instrument, or someone characterized by the root), -an (collectivity, similarity, object, place, instrument), ke-...-an (abstractions and qualities, collectivities), per-/peng-...-an (abstraction, place, goal or result). Gender Malay does not make use of grammatical gender. There are only a few words that use natural gender; the same word used for he and she is also used for his and her. Most of the words that refer to people (family terms, professions, etc.) have a form that does not distinguish between the sexes. For example, adik can refer to a younger sibling of either sex. To specify the natural gender of a noun, an adjective must be added: adik lelaki corresponds to \\"brother\\" but really means \\"male younger sibling\\". There are some words that are gendered. For instance, puteri means \\"princess\\" and putera means \\"prince\\"; words like these are usually borrowed from other languages (in this case, Sanskrit). Number There is no grammatical plural in Malay. Thus orang may mean either \\"person\\" or \\"people\\". Plurality is expressed by the context, or the usage of words such as numerals, beberapa \\"some\\", or semua \\"all\\" that express plurality. In many cases, it simply isn't relevant to the speaker. Reduplication is commonly used to emphasize plurality. However, reduplication has many other functions. For example, orang-orang means \\"(all the) people\\", but orang-orangan means \\"scarecrow\\". Similarly, while hati means \\"heart\\" or \\"liver\\", hati-hati is a verb meaning \\"to be careful\\". Also, not all reduplicated words are inherently plural, such as orang-orangan \\"scarecrow/scarecrows\\", biri-biri \\"a/some sheep\\" and kupu- kupu \\"butterfly/butterflies\\". Some reduplication is rhyming rather than exact, as in sayur-mayur \\"(all sorts of) vegetables\\". Distributive affixes derive mass nouns that are effectively plural: pohon \\"tree\\", pepohonan \\"flora, trees\\"; rumah \\"house\\", perumahan \\"housing, houses\\"; gunung \\"mountain\\", pe(r)gunungan \\"mountain range, mountains\\". Quantity words come before the noun: səribu orang \\"a thousand people\\", beberapa pe(r)gunungan \\"a series of mountain ranges\\", beberapa kupu-kupu \\"some butterflies\\". ==Pronouns== Personal pronouns are not a separate part of speech, but a subset of nouns. They are frequently omitted, and there are numerous ways to say \\"you\\". Commonly the person's name, title, title with name, or occupation is used (\\"does Johnny want to go?\\", \\"would Madam like to go?\\"); kin terms, including fictive kinship, are extremely common. However, there are also dedicated personal pronouns, as well as the demonstrative pronouns ini \\"this, the\\" and itu \\"that, the\\". Personal pronouns From the perspective of a European language, Malay boasts a wide range of different pronouns, especially to refer to the addressee (the so-called second person pronouns). These are used to differentiate several parameters of the person they are referred to, such as the social rank and the relationship between the addressee and the speaker. This table shows an overview over the most commonly and widely used pronouns of the Malay language: {  +Common pronouns - ! width=75 person ! width=75 clusivity ! width=75 respect ! width=75 singular ! width=100 plural - ! rowspan=31st person ! rowspan=2exclusive !informal, familiar  align=centeraku  rowspan=2 align=centerkami (we: they and I, s/he and I) - !standard, polite  align=centersaya - !inclusive    align=centerkita (we: you and I, we and you) - ! rowspan=2 colspan=2 2nd person !familiar  align=centerkamu  align=centerkalian - !polite  align=centerA/anda (you)  align=centerA/anda (sekalian/semua) (you, y'all) - ! rowspan=2 colspan=2 3rd person ! colloquial  rowspan=2 align=centerdia ~ ia (s/he ~ it)  align=centerdia orang (they) - ! formal standard  align=centermereka (they) } First person pronouns Notable among the personal-pronoun system is a distinction between two forms of \\"we\\": kita (you and me, you and us) and kami (us, but not you). The distinction is increasingly confused in colloquial Indonesian. Saya and aku are the two major forms of \\"I\\"; saya (or its literary / archaic form sahaya) is the more formal form, whereas aku is used with close acquittances like family and friends, and between lovers. Sa(ha)ya may also be used for \\"we\\", but in such cases it is usually used with sekalian or semua \\"all\\"; this form is ambiguous as to whether it corresponds with inclusive kami or exclusive kita. Less common are hamba \\"slave\\", hamba tuan, hamba datok (all extremely humble), beta (a royal addressing oneselves), patik (/pateʔ/, a commoner addressing a royal), kami (royal or editorial \\"we\\"), kita, teman (/təman/), and kawan (lit. \\"friend\\"). Second person pronouns There are three common forms of \\"you\\", anda (polite), kamu (familiar), and kalian \\"y'all\\" (commonly used as a plural form of you, slightly informal). Anda is used in formal contexts like in advertisements and business or to show respect (though terms like tuan \\"sir\\" and other titles also work the same way), while kamu is used in informal situations. Anda sekalian or Anda semua are polite plural. Engkau orang —contracted to kau orang or korang—is used to address subjects plural in the most informal context. Engkau (əŋkau, commonly shortened to kau) and hang (dialectical) are used to social inferiors or equals, awak to equals, and encik (/əntʃeʔ/, contracted to cik before a name) is polite, traditionally used for people without title. The compounds 'makcik and pakcik are used with village elders one is well acquainted with or the guest of. Tuanku (from tuan aku, \\"my lord\\") is used by commoners to address royal members. Third person pronouns The common word for \\"s/he\\" is ia, which has the object and emphatic/focused form dia; consequently ia has been recently used to refer to animals. Beliau (/bəliau/, \\"his/her Honour\\") is respectful. As with the English \\"you\\", names and kin terms are extremely common. Colloquially, dia orang (or its contracted form diorang) is commonly used for the plural \\"they\\" whereas mereka \\"they\\", mereka itu, or orang itu \\"those people\\" are used in writing. Baginda - corresponding to \\"his/her Majesty/Highness\\" - is used for addressing royal figures and religious prophets, especially in Islamic literature. Regional varieties There are a large number of other words for \\"I\\" and \\"you\\", many regional, dialectical, or borrowed from local languages. Saudara (masc., \\"you\\") or saudari (fem., pl. saudara-saudara / saudari-saudari / saudara- saudari) show utmost respect. Daku (\\"I\\") and dikau (\\"you\\") are poetic or romantic. Indonesian gua (\\"I\\") and lu \\"you\\" are slang and extremely informal. In the dialect of the northern states of Malaysia - Kedah, Penang, Perlis and Perak (northern) typically \\"hang\\" is used as \\"you\\" (singular), while \\"hampa\\" or \\"hangpa\\" are used for the plural \\"you\\". In the state of Pahang, two variants for \\"I\\" and \\"you\\" exist, depending on location: in East Pahang, around Pekan, \\"kome\\" is used as \\"I\\" while in the west around Temerloh, \\"koi\\", \\"keh\\" or \\"kah\\" is used. \\"Kome\\" is also used in Kuala Kangsar, Perak, but instead it means \\"you\\". This allegedly originated from the fact that both the royal families of Pahang and Perak (whose seats are in Pekan and Kuala Kangsar respectively) were descendants of the same ancient line. The informal pronouns aku, kamu, engkau, ia, kami, and kita are indigenous to Malay. Possessive pronouns Aku, kamu, engkau, and ia have short possessive enclitic forms. All others retain their full forms like other nouns, as does emphatic dia: meja saya, meja kita, meja anda, meja dia \\"my table, our table, your table, his/her table\\". { +Possessed forms of meja \\"table\\" ! Pronoun ! Enclitic ! Possessed form - aku  -ku mejaku (my table) - kamu  -mu mejamu (your table) - engkau  -kau mejakau (your table) - ia  -nya mejanya (his, her, their table) } There are also proclitic forms of aku and engkau, ku- and kau-. These are used when there is no emphasis on the pronoun: :Ku-dengar raja itu penyakit sopak. Aku tahu ilmu tabib. Aku-lah mengubati dia. :\\"It has come to my attention that the Raja has a skin disease. I am skilled in medicine. I will cure him.\\" Here ku-verb is used for a general report, aku verb is used for a factual statement, and emphatic aku-lah meng- verb (≈ \\"I am the one who...\\") for focus on the pronoun. Demonstrative pronouns There are two demonstrative pronouns in Malay. Ini \\"this, these\\" is used for a noun generally near to the speaker. Itu \\"that, those\\" is used for a noun generally far from the speaker. Either may sometimes be equivalent to English \\"the\\". There is no difference between singular and plural. However, plural can be indicated through duplication of a noun followed by a ini or itu. The word yang \\"which\\" is often placed before demonstrative pronouns to give emphasis and a sense of certainty, particularly when making references or enquiries about something/someone, like English \\"this one\\" or \\"that one\\". {  - ! Pronoun ! Malay ! English - ! rowspan=2ini  buku ini  This book, these books, the book(s) -  buku-buku ini  These books, (all) the books - ! rowspan=2 itu  kucing itu  That cat, those cats, the cat(s) -  kucing-kucing itu  Those cats, the (various) cats } {  - ! Pronoun + yang ! Example Sentence ! English Meaning -  Yang ini  Q: Anda ma(h)u membeli buku yang mana? A: Saya ma(h)u beli yang ini  Q: Which book do you wish to purchase? A: I would like this one -  Yang itu  Q: Kucing mana yang makan tikusmu? A: Yang itu!  Q: Which cat ate your mouse? A: That one! } ==Measure words== Another distinguishing feature of Malay is its use of measure words, also called classifiers (penjodoh bilangan). In this way, it is similar to many other languages of Asia, including Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, Burmese, and Bengali. Measure words are found in English two head of cattle, a loaf of bread, or this sheet of paper, where *two cattle, a bread, and this paper (in the sense of this piece of paper) would be ungrammatical. The word satu reduces to se- , as it does in other compounds: {  - ! measure word ! used for measuring ! literal translation ! example -  buah  things (in general), large things, abstract nouns houses, cars, ships, mountains; books, rivers, chairs, some fruits, thoughts, etc.  'fruit'  dua buah meja (two tables), lima buah rumah (five houses) -  ekor  animals  'tail'  seekor ayam (a chicken), tiga ekor kambing (three goats) -  orang  human beings  'person'  seorang lelaki (a man), enam orang petani (six farmers), seratus orang murid (a hundred students) -  biji  smaller rounded objects most fruits, cups, nuts  'grain'  sebiji/ sebutir telur (an egg), sebiji epal (an apple), sebutir/ butiran-butiran beras (rice or rices) -  batang  long stiff things trees, walking sticks, pencils  'trunk, rod'  sebatang sungai (a river), sebatang kayu (a stick) -  həlai, lai  things in thin layers or sheets paper, cloth, feathers, hair  'leaf'  sepuluh helai pakaian (ten cloths) -  kəping  flat fragments slabs of stone, pieces of wood, pieces of bread, land, coins, paper  'chip'  sekeping kertas (a piece of paper) - pucuk  letters, firearms, needles  'sprout'  sepucuk surat (a letter) -  bilah  blades: knives, spears  'lathe' sebilah pisau (a knife) } Less common are {  -  bəntuk  rings, hooks (with ringed 'eyes')  'shape' -  bidanɡ  mats, widths of cloth  'breadth' -  kuntum  flowers  'blossom' -  tangkai  flowers  'stem' -  kaki  long-stemmed flowers  'leg' -  urat  threads, sinew  'fiber, vein' -  pintu  houses in a row  'door' -  tangga  traditional houses with ladders  'ladder' -  patah  words, proverbs  'fragment' -  butir  smallest rounded objects smaller fruits, seeds, grains, rounds of ammunition, gems, points 'particle'  commonly replaced with biji -  puntung  stumps, stubs, butt ends of firewood, cigarettes, teeth  stump -  potong  slices of bread etc.  'cut' -  kərat   'fragment' -  utas  nets, cords, ribbons 'cord' -  carik  things easily torn, like paper  'shred' - papan bitter bean (petai) 'board' } Measure words are not necessary just to say \\"a\\": burung \\"a bird, birds\\". Using se- plus a measure word is closer to English \\"one\\" or \\"a certain\\": :Ada se-ekor burung yang pandai bercakap :\\"There was a (certain) bird that could talk\\" ==Verbs== Verbs are not inflected for person or number, and they are not marked for tense; tense is instead denoted by time adverbs (such as \\"yesterday\\") or by other tense indicators, such as sudah \\"already\\" and belum \\"not yet\\". On the other hand, there is a complex system of verb affixes to render nuances of meaning and to denote voice or intentional and accidental moods. Some of these affixes are ignored in colloquial speech. Examples of these are the prefixes di- (patient focus, frequently but erroneously called \\"passive voice\\", for OVA word order), meng- (agent focus, frequently but erroneously called \\"active voice\\", for AVO word order), memper- and diper- (causative, agent and patient focus), ber- (stative or habitual; intransitive VS order), and ter- (agentless actions, such as those that are involuntary, sudden, or accidental, for VA = VO order); the suffixes -kan (causative or benefactive) and -i (locative, repetitive, or exhaustive); and the circumfixes ber-...-an (plural subject, diffuse action) and ke-...-an (unintentional or potential action or state). * duduk \\"to sit down\\" * mendudukkan \\"to sit someone down, give someone a seat, to appoint\\" * menduduki \\"to sit on, to occupy\\" * didudukkan \\"to be given a seat, to be appointed\\" * diduduki \\"to be sat on, to be occupied\\" * terduduk \\"to sink down, to come to sit\\" * kedudukan \\"to be situated\\", \\"position\\" * bersekedudukan \\"to cohabit\\" * berkedudukan \\"to have position\\" Often the derivation changes the meaning of the verb rather substantially: * tinggal to reside, to live (in a place) * meninggal to die, to pass away (short form of meninggal dunia, \\"to pass on from the world\\") * meninggalkan \\"to leave (a place)\\", \\"to leave behind/abandon\\" (someone/something) * ditinggalkan \\"to be left behind, to be abandoned\\" * tertinggal \\"to be left behind\\" * ketinggalan \\"to miss (a bus, train)\\" (and thus \\"to be left behind\\") Forms in ter- and ke-...-an are often equivalent to adjectives in English.  Descriptive stative verbs There are no grammatical adjectives in Malay. Instead, stative verbs are used to describe various animate and inanimate objects, places and abstract concepts. {  - !Malay !Gloss (literal translation) !English !Remarks - Hutan hijau forest be-green The forest is green as in French la forêt verdoie - Kəreta yang merah car that be-red The red car  - Dia orang yang terkenal sekali he/she person which be-(most)famous He/she is the most famous person  - Orang ini terkenal sekali person this be-famous very This person is very famous  }  Negation  Four words are used for negation in Malay, namely tidak, bukan, jangan, and belum. * Tidak (not), colloquially shortened to tak, is used for the negation of verbs and \\"adjectives\\". * Bukan (be-not) is used in the negation of a noun. For example: {  - !Malay !Gloss !English - Saya tidak tahu I not know I do not know - Ibu saya tidak senang mother I not be-happy My mother is not happy - Itu bukan anjing saya that be-not dog I That is not my dog } * Jangan (do not!) is used for negating imperatives or advising against certain actions. For example, :Jangan tinggalkan saya di sini! :Don't leave me here! * Belum is used with the sense that something has not yet been accomplished or experienced. In this sense, belum can be used as a negative response to a question. :Anda sudah pernah ke Indonesia, or Anda sudah pernah ke Indonesia belum? :Have you ever been to Indonesia before, (or not)? :Belum, saya masih belum pernah pergi ke Indonesia'' :No, I have not yet been to Indonesia :Orang itu belum terbiasa tinggal di Indonesia :That person is not (yet) used to living in Indonesia.  Function words  16 types of function words in Malay perform a grammatical function in a sentence. Amongst these are conjunctions, interjections, prepositions, negations and determiners. == Word order == Stative verbs, demonstrative determiners, and possessive determiners follow the noun they modify. Malay does not have a grammatical subject in the sense that English does. In intransitive clauses, the noun comes before the verb. When there is both an agent and an object, these are separated by the verb (OVA or AVO), with the difference encoded in the voice of the verb. OVA, commonly but inaccurately called \\"passive\\", is the basic and most common word order. Either the agent or object or both may be omitted. This is commonly done to accomplish one of two things: ;1) Adding a sense of politeness and respect to a statement or question For example, a polite shop assistant in a store may avoid the use of pronouns altogether and ask: {  - ! Ellipses of pronoun (agent & object) ! Literal English ! Idiomatic English -  Boleh/bisa dibantu?  Can + to be helped?  Can (I) help (you)? } ;2) Agent or object is unknown, not important, or understood from context For example, a friend may enquire as to when you bought your property, to which you may respond: {  - ! Ellipses of pronoun (understood agent) ! Literal English ! Idiomatic English -  Rumah ini dibeli lima tahun yang lalu  House this + be purchased five year(s) ago  The house 'was purchased' five years ago } Ultimately, the choice of voice and therefore word order is a choice between actor and patient and depends quite heavily on the language style and context.  Emphasis  Word order is frequently modified for focus or emphasis, with the focused word usually placed at the beginning of the clause and followed by a slight pause (a break in intonation): * Saya pergi ke pasar ke(l)marin \\"I went to the market yesterday\\" – neutral, or with focus on the subject. * Ke(l)marin saya pergi ke pasar \\"Yesterday I went to the market\\" – emphasis on yesterday. * Ke pasar saya pergi, ke(l)marin \\"To the market I went yesterday\\" – emphasis on where I went yesterday. * Pergi ke pasar, saya, ke(l)marin \\"To the market went I yesterday\\" – emphasis on the process of going to the market. The last two occur more often in speech than writing. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * ","title":"Malay grammar"},{"id":"35210166","text":"A merosome is a recently described life stage of malaria parasites of the genus Plasmodium. After injection by mosquitoes into the human host, malaria parasites first migrate to liver cells (hepatocytes), where they replicate asexually inside the host cell. Afterwards, they go on to infect red blood cells. This transition is characterised by the 'budding off' of membrane-bound structures called merosomes, first characterised by Sturm and Amino et al. in 2006. It is thought that these structures, that are derived from hepatocytes including their membranes, aid in the parasites' evasion of immune cells known as Kupffer cells that are located in the liver. ==References== Category:Malaria ","title":"Merosome"},{"id":"35210167","text":"The Smiler is a steel roller coaster located at Alton Towers in Staffordshire, United Kingdom. Manufactured by Gerstlauer, it opened in 2013 as the world's first Gerstlauer Infinity Coaster. With 14 inversions, The Smiler holds the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster. However, it has experienced a series of incidents. A malfunction at a press preview event delayed the official opening date by two weeks, and in 2015, a major collision left five riders seriously injured. An investigation by the UK government's Health and Safety Executive was initiated, and the ride eventually reopened the following season with revamped safety standards. ==History== Plans to build The Smiler were submitted to the local authority in December 2011. Permission was granted on 15 March 2012 following a Staffordshire Moorlands Council meeting, despite some local opposition to its construction. Gerstlauer, a German manufacturing company, was hired to build the roller coaster. Less than a month after obtaining permission, Alton Towers launched a website announcing a new ride – codenamed Secret Weapon 7 (SW7) – for the 2013 season. Its codename followed a similar format used for other roller coasters during their teaser campaigns, such as SW4 for Oblivion and SW6 for Thirteen. In June 2012, a trademark filed by Merlin Entertainments, parent company of Alton Towers, hinted that the new ride would be named The Smiler. On 17 October 2012, a number of facts about the coaster were revealed to the public including its maximum speed, track length, ride time, passengers per train and ride cost. Despite the release, Alton Towers did not announce or confirm the name for the ride. Construction The site for the new ride was determined to be an area in the park being occupied by the tent that previously contained the Black Hole, a roller coaster which closed after the 2005 season. The park began dismantling the remaining Black Hole structure on 12 April 2012. The first pieces of track arrived at the park in late October 2012. Sections of track were later moved to the construction site on 6 December 2012. In January 2013, Alton Towers officially confirmed that the ride would be called The Smiler. In February 2013, the park revealed some of the ride's elements. The trains arrived in March 2013, as Alton Towers began posting images on both Twitter and their official Smiler website. Vertical construction was completed approximately one month later, as the final piece of track was installed at the top of the first lift hill. Marketing Marketing for The Smiler started around the same time as construction when, on 11 April 2012, a minisite was launched allowing visitors to register for updates on the ride's progress. A competition to be the first to ride the rollercoaster, at this time codenamed \\"SW7\\", started in July. To enter guests were invited to scan a QR Code with their smartphone, which subsequently redirected to Alton Towers Official The Smiler Minisite where guests entered their details. In September 2012, the park began the second stage of advertisement through the overnight spray painting of a stencil logo (which resemble a smiling face) all over the park. This was followed in October with new boards around the park, new 'subliminal' advertising on different sections of the main Alton Towers website, and a countdown timer on the Alton Towers mini-site. The countdown timer initially gave a scheduled opening date of 16 March 2013, but was removed however on 4 January 2013, as the ride hit delays. More overt advertising started in January 2013, when the \\"Smile\\" logo was used in various forms across the country. Including billboards in London; ticket barriers at Leeds railway station; projected onto various buildings including Big Ben; and sprayed onto flocks of sheep in areas including Leicestershire, Devon and Perthshire. The name of the roller coaster, The Smiler, was revealed on 21 January 2013, the Metro newspaper, and the opening date was set as May (previously it was 16 March). In February 2013 a free game app was released containing a full 3D recreation of the actual ride, and a preview of the rides merchandise was published online. John Wardley, a ride consultant on the project, confirmed in a radio interview on 19 April 2013 that The Smiler would feature more inversions than any other roller coaster in the world. Although construction had revealed this earlier, the statement was the first official confirmation that The Smiler would break the inversion record. In an earlier interview Wardley had said that The Smiler would have \\"...5 mind manipulating elements that play around with you on the ride, so it’s more than just a physical rollercoaster.\\" From early April and throughout May, Alton Towers published videos online giving snippets of the ride's fictional backstory. This was followed by footage of weather presenter Laura Tobin riding The Smiler, live on ITV's Daybreak programme and an advertising campaign on boxes of Krave cereal. Opening Initially, The Smiler was expected to make its public debut in March 2013 for the park's opening day, but due to construction delays, the date was pushed back to 23 May 2013. The date had to be pushed back further after technical issues were encountered during testing and a ride incident occurred during its preview event that stranded riders on the lift hill. Following the incident on 17 May 2013, Alton Towers explained on their website that The Smiler would not open on the originally scheduled date due to \\"unforeseen teething problems.\\" The ride's delayed opening initially caused controversy as many had booked advance tickets and stays at the Alton Towers Hotel in order to be among the first to ride the coaster. However, Alton Towers later announced it would allow those who had made advanced bookings to change their tickets and hotel reservations free of charge. The Smiler eventually opened on 31 May 2013. ==Description== A key feature of the ride is the large metallic spider-like structure that serves as a centrepoint for the coaster track. Called ‘The Marmaliser,’ it has 5 legs, each with a distinct function to manipulate riders into \\"smiling\\". It is also equipped with a wraparound screen, which displays graphics and video relating to the theme of the ride. The roller coaster intertwines within the structure causing greater interaction with riders to enhance the experience. The track is divided into 5 block sections, permitting up to 5 trains to operate on the ride at once, which would create a theoretical capacity of 1200 people per hour (pph).

Corkscrew - } Ride experience The train dispatches from the station, playing audio of a man saying \\"join us!\\" The train immediately enters into a sweeping drop 180-degrees to the left. Partway through this drop, riders encounter a heartline roll, the ride's first inversion. The train then comes to a stop on block brakes, before ascending the first lift hill. Upon reaching the top, the train drops into another 180-degree right turn before banking into the second inversion, a downward corkscrew. The train drops down into the next two inversions, two consecutive dive loops before travelling over a trimmed airtime hill into the ride's largest element, a Batwing (this element consists of a sidewinder and reverse sidewinder). The train then travels through another corkscrew before reaching the second set of block brakes, after a brief pause the train ascends the second lift hill, this time at a 90° vertical angle. The train then enters another drop, 180-degrees to the left, banking into a downward corkscrew. Riders then navigate through a sea serpent roll, followed by a short drop into another trimmed airtime hill. the train then dives into a cobra roll. Upon exiting the cobra roll, the train twists through two consecutive corkscrews before a short left turn into the final brake run. ==Incidents== The ride has experienced a number of structural and technical issues since its launch. The most serious incident occurred on 2 June 2015, when a loaded train collided with an empty test train, causing serious injuries to a number of riders. An additional train had recently been added to the circuit, when an empty train was dispatched for a test run and stalled mid-ride due to a gust of wind. The ride block system shut down the ride accordingly but was overridden by the engineers on duty, as they were unaware there was now an additional train present and stalled. This allowed the following train, loaded with passengers, to collide with the stalled train. Two riders sat in the front row required leg amputations.Four seriously hurt in Alton Towers Smiler crash - Ride Rater. 2 June 2015. Retrieved 23 August 2015. Subsequently, Merlin Entertainments decided to close The Smiler, Saw – The Ride at Thorpe Park, and two other roller coasters at Chessington World of Adventures (all of which have since reopened) while safety protocols and procedures were evaluated. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) served a Prohibition Notice upon the Smiler, preventing the ride's use until remedial action had been completed. On 27 July 2015, it was stated by Merlin Entertainments chief executive Nick Varney that The Smiler would \\"not be opening this summer\\". The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) initiated a criminal investigation.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/27/alton- towers-owner-fined-smiler-rollercaster-crash In the incident's aftermath, Alton Towers and its owner Merlin Entertainments allegedly observed a drop in revenue and visitor numbers, which they claim influenced their decision to eliminate up to 190 jobs at the theme park. Six rides were closed during the 2016 season as a result of the crash. Varney released a public statement stating: The ride eventually reopened on 19 March 2016 for the start of the 2016 season with additional safety features. Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd was prosecuted by the HSE at North Staffordshire Justice Centre on 22 April 2016, in which the firm pleaded guilty. On 27 September 2016, after a two-day hearing at Stafford Crown Court, Judge Michael Chambers QC fined Merlin Entertainments £5 million. In September 2018, Vicky Balch and Leah Washington, who lost their legs on the ride after the crash in June 2015, sued Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd for negligence and/or breach of statutory duty. {  style=\\"width:80%\\" - ! width=115  Date ! width=115  Reopened !

It correctly detected that the empty train sent previously had stalled. A ride engineer manually overrode the mechanism allowing a ride operator to dispatch the halted train, which led to the collision.  - } ==References== Category:2015 disasters in the United Kingdom ==External links== * Official Alton Towers mini-site Category:Alton Towers Category:Roller coasters in the United Kingdom Category:Roller coasters operated by Merlin Entertainments Category:Tourist attractions in Staffordshire Category:Buildings and structures in Staffordshire ","title":"The Smiler"},{"id":"35210178","text":"Major General Emmett R.

Cordray became the lead guitarist for The Children under the ATCO label and later on ODE records produced by Lou Adler. He co-wrote the song \\"Francine\\", which peaked at 69 on the Billboard Hot 100, with Steve Perron for ZZ Top's album Rio Grande Mud. Cordray performed and wrote music with Jaco Pastorious and played in Wayne Cochran and the C.C. Rider band at Pastorious' request. While playing with the C.C. Riders, Cordray backed up Jerry Lee Lewis on an episode of the Midnight Special and in concert. He moved to New Orleans to play with the former C.C. Riders and Edgar Winter's White Trash band members before forming his own group, Cordray. Members included Clay Hemphill, David Lee Watson, Allyn Robinson and Mark Campbell. Cordray's first national break came on January 6, 1986, in USA Today. In 1991, Cordray formed The Civilians and recorded a CD entitled Miracles. In late 1992, Cordray, Dave Foster and Todd Harrison formed a \\"Texas rockin' blues psychedelic power trio\\", calling themselves Kenny Cordray and Blue Science. In March 2012, he released It Takes Everything with his band called Love Street. The core rhythm section for the album consists of Mark Andes on bass guitar, Tyson Sheth on drums, Paul English on keyboards and Cordray on guitars. When the album was released, the Houston Chronicle called Cordray \\"one of Houston’s greatest guitarists\\". In November 2014, Cordray released his final work, C-R-C, as a part of the power trio C-R-C, Cordray-Robinson-Campbell, featuring Mark Campbell and Allyn Robinson. Cordray gave guitar lessons to children and adults for many years.

Similar, though more fragmentary, remains were also found on the neighbouring island of Porto Santo, which may be of the same, or a closely related, species. ==Description== The owl was similar in size to the Eurasian scops owl, though the leg bones were longer. Estimates of its body weight and wing loading suggest that it was largely ground-dwelling. The extinct São Miguel scops owl was similar but differs from the Madieran species by the smaller size of many of its bones, especially the ulna and tibiotarsus. ==References== mauli Category:Birds of Madeira Category:Fossil taxa described in 2012 Category:Holocene extinctions Category:Species made extinct by human activities Category:Extinct birds of Atlantic islands Category:Birds described in 2012 ","title":"Madeiran scops owl"},{"id":"35210190","text":"\\"Hill Street Station\\" is the first episode of the first season of the American serial police drama Hill Street Blues. \\"Hill Street Station\\" originally aired in the United States on NBC on Thursday January 15, 1981, at 10:00pm Eastern Time as part of a two-week five-episode limited-run pilot airing on Thursdays and Saturdays. The episode won numerous Primetime Emmy Awards (Directing, Writing, Sound Editing, and Cinematography), a Directors Guild of America Award, a Writers Guild of America Award, and an Edgar Award as well as Emmy Award nominations for film editing, music composition, and art direction. The episode was directed by Robert Butler and written by Michael Kozoll and Steven Bochco. Unlike other high-profile debuts from the 1980–81 network television season that had two- and three-hour premieres, such as Dynasty and Flamingo Road, this premiere episode debuted by itself as a one-hour offering. That season, even some holdovers, such as B. J. and the Bear and Buck Rogers, had multi-hour season premieres. The main storyline involves a hostage situation that arose from an attempted armed robbery. The episode also introduces a host of unique characters. At the time of the debut, Robert McLean described the cast as a \\"cast of unknowns\\". ==Plot== Background The episode introduces the audience to a precinct station and the challenges that its police officers face in a setting of urban decay in a large anonymous city. Although anonymous, the city could easily represent the South Bronx in New York City, Watts in Los Angeles, or Central District in Miami. The episode also presents the precinct's captain by demonstrating the wide variety of forces that challenge him continually, including superiors, gangs, an ex-wife, defense counsel and strongminded men. In an article published in The Miami News, Tom Jicha compares him to the title character in Barney Miller, and The New York Times Tom Buckley compares the show to Barney Miller and Kojak. The episode's storylines take five episodes to unravel cleanly. Details Opening seconds of the episode indicating the time of the roll call Hill Street precinct captain Frank Furillo (Daniel J. Travanti) deals with law enforcement issues while juggling personal crises. His precinct responds to a hostage situation at a local liquor store that becomes difficult when it evolves into a media circus, complicated by an aggressive SWAT team leader, Howard Hunter (James B. Sikking), who encounters nervous young gang members. Furillo attempts to negotiate with their gang leader. His secret lover, public defender Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamel), appears to be his nemesis as she hounds him about a client who is the lost victim of police bureaucracy. Furillo's ex-wife, Fay (Barbara Bosson), publicly demeans him in response to his bounced child-support check. Detective J.D. LaRue (Kiel Martin) attempts to woo Davenport using less and less ethical means, eventually calling her back to the precinct to pick up her lost client even though he was never found. When she realizes his ruse, she pours a cup of hot coffee in his lap. Undercover officer Belker (Bruce Weitz) arrests a bald-headed pickpocket at the hostage situation and processes him at the precinct. Belker's proclivity for biting the ankles of perpetrators redeems itself in this episode. Desk Sergeant Phil Esterhaus (Michael Conrad) confides in Fay about his teen-age sweetheart, Cindy. When officers Hill (Michael Warren) and Renko (Charles Haid) respond to a domestic situation, their police car is stolen, and they are shot after walking into a rundown building while trying to find a phone to call in the theft. ==Production== Regular cast *Captain Frank Furillo (Daniel J.

Ray Calletano (Rene Enriquez) *Fay Furillo (Barbara Bosson) Details The episode was directed by Butler and written by Kozoll and Bochco. Kozoll and Bochco previously developed Quincy, M.E., McMillan & Wife and Columbo. The pilot was produced by Mary Tyler Moore's MTM Productions, which had produced Lou Grant and The White Shadow. That season NBC was attempting to gain ground on the other two major networks (CBS and ABC) after having moved to \\"within striking distance\\" the prior year according to Brandon Tartikoff. At the time of the debut, Robert McLean described the cast as a \\"cast of unknowns\\". The series' January 15, 1981 debut, which was announced on October 22, 1980, occurred amid the industry's recovery from the 1980 Actors strike and NBC's recovery from the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. The show debuted on a night when both competing networks were airing reruns. Unlike other high-profile debuts from the 1980–81 network television season that had two- and three-hour premieres, such as Dynasty and Flamingo Road, this premiere episode debuted by itself as a one-hour offering. That season, even some holdovers, such as B. J. and the Bear and Buck Rogers, had multi- hour season premieres. The show was marketed as being \\"grittier than the average cop show\\" according to Tony Schwartz of The New York Times, who described the setting as a San Francisco precinct. The Boston Globe Jack Thomas described the show's debut as the \\"newest effort to dramatize the danger and frustration of police work\\" and as being set in the Midwest. William A. Henry III wrote in The Boston Globe that the show's marketing endured so much conflict and confusion that it would have been sufficient to keep most shows from ever being scheduled to air. With all the confusion, Henry's Globe colleague Bud Laughton described the pilot episodes and the series as \\"long-awaited, on-again, off-again\\". Henry noted that, \\"It is filmed to look like a documentary, with saturated color, a hand-held camera, quick cuts from scene to scene, high-decibel background noise, overlapping dialogue. The show creates atmosphere more than character. Like a documentary, it conveys a way of living more than a story.\\" The original version of the pilot had one mortal wound, but Henry correctly predicted that it would be re-edited to reduce the violence and allow both officers to return to work. ==Reception== \\"Hill Street Station\\" originally aired in the United States on NBC on Thursday January 15, 1981, at 10:00pm Eastern Time as part of a two- week five-episode limited-run pilot airing on Thursdays and Saturdays. Critical review Schwartz wrote in August 1980 that \\"...the pilot episode manages to stuff nearly every imaginable aspect of low life into its first hour: prostitution, panhandling, pickpocketing, hostage taking, drug addiction and, finally, the murder of two policemen.\\" William Beamon of The Evening Independent noted that the opening episode introduces the audience to a vast array of characters masterfully intertwined in the storyline in a way that gives the series a \\"powerful start\\". A review in the Spartanburg Herald- Journal commented that public defender Davenport's role adds professional intrigue that heightens the provocative nature of their illicit romance. However, The Miami News Jicha speculates that the romance was contrived to make the police show enticing to audiences. Jicha notes that the attack upon the police depicts the uncertainty of the daily life in law enforcement, but that the introduction of Belker's persona shows the writers are a bit out of touch with reality. Buckley's review in The New York Times claimed the episode \\"veers back and forth between comic situations that aren't funny, serious matters that aren't that convincing and a romance that is merely silly\\" and stated that various lighting and acting techniques were unsuccessful. The Boston Globe Henry III wrote that \\"The redeeming virtue is a visual style reminiscent of documentaries — hand-held camera, saturated color, deliberately ragged editing.\\" He also described the show as \\"a wacky, black-comic and frequently scary portrait of life in a big city police station\\". Buckley claimed that the show attempts to present an entire force of police officers with foibles that make them unfit for duty. Henry describes the shooting of the officers as an \\"appallingly realistic random shooting\\", but since they were not found for hours, he describes their survival and recovery in the next episode, \\"Presidential Fever\\", as miraculous. Accolades Butler won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series at the 33rd Primetime Emmy Awards and the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Drama Series at the 34th Directors Guild of America Awards. Bochco and Kozoll won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series at the same Emmy ceremony, an Edgar Award for Best Television Episode as well as a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Drama at the Writers Guild of America Awards 1981. In addition, Sam Horta, Bob Cornett, Denise Horta and Eileen Horta won an Emmy for Outstanding Achievement in Film Sound Editing and William Cronjager won an Emmy for Outstanding Cinematography for a Series. Other Emmy nominations received included Ray Daniels and A. David Marshall for Outstanding Achievement in Film Editing for a Series, Mike Post for Outstanding Achievement in Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore) and Jeffrey L.

Its initially identified areas of concern included anti-fascism, world peace, child welfare and improving the status of women. During the Cold War era, it was described as Communist- leaning and pro-Soviet. International Day for Protection of Children, observed in many countries as Children's Day on June 1 since 1950, is said to have been established by the Federation on its November 1949 congress in Moscow.Children's Day The WIDF published a monthly magazine, Women of the Whole World, in English, French, Spanish, German, and Russian, with occasional issues in Arabic.English copies of the WOWW magazine can be found at the International Institute for Social History: https://search.socialhistory.org/Record/1398843 WIDF was founded in Paris in 1945, but it was later banned by French authorities and relocated to East Berlin, where it was supported by the East German government. Its first president was Eugenie Cotton, and its founding members included Tsola Dragoycheva and Ana Pauker. Later leaders included the Australian Freda Brown. The WIDF was one of the largest and \\"probably most influential international women's organizations of the post-1945 era\\" in the eastern bloc. At various points in its history, the WIDF enjoyed consultative status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations. It was at the initiation of representatives of the WIDF in the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) at the United Nations that the UN declared the International Women's Year in 1975.Francisca de Haan, “A Brief Survey of Women's Rights from 1945 to 2009.” UN Chronicle. 2010, Vol. 47 Issue 1, p56-59 After the end of the Cold War, the organization lost its funding and most of its importance and membership as a result of the downfall of its primary sponsors, East Germany and the Soviet Union.

Originally published as a handbook in December 1948, it was revised and expanded in 1951, 1957, and 1961. The report listed organizations and publications cited as Communist fronts or \\"outright Communist enterprises\\" by federal, state, and municipal government agencies. In its original edition, 563 organizations and 190 publications were declared as subversive. Both private sector blacklisters and the FBI relied on the guide. == Revisions == The 1951 edition contained a preface with a brief history and definition of Communist fronts and a guide to detecting them. The final edition in 1961 expanded this preface into a two-part introduction with sections titled. The first section, \\"What is a Communist front?\\" contained the text of the 1951 preface, an added excerpt about the value of front organizations to the Communist Party and the operating techniques of a front from J. Edgar Hoover's book Masters of Deceit as well, and a summary of legislation relating to front organizations. The new second section, \\"Scope of the Guide\\", provided an outline of the contents of the guide and a summary of the Soviet Union's united front strategy for cooperation with non-Communist countries. The 1961 edition also separated the lists of organizations and publications into two sections each, one containing those designated as subversive by federal authorities and one containing those listed as subversive by state and municipal authorities. == Views on the civil rights movement == In its introduction, the 1961 edition stated that Communist fronts gained support from non-communists by exploiting non-communists' interests in world peace and civil rights. The nationwide organization Civil Rights Congress and several state and municipal civil rights organizations were listed in the guide as Communist fronts. == Relationship with the FBI == Even before its official publication in 1948, the FBI, and specifically senior FBI agent Lee Pennington, helped promote the report.

Edgar Hoover furnished each field office with two or more copies and referred citizens to the guide so that they could identify fronts and \\"not be fooled into giving them... support.\\" == See also == * J.

On March 15, 2014, he signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Islanders. During the 2015–16 season, Pelech received his first NHL recall by the Islanders. On November 13, 2015, he made his NHL debut, playing 13 minutes in a 4-1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks in California. Pelech was again recalled to the Islanders later in the season on January 1, 2016 after Johnny Boychuk was injured. In early 2016, Pelech left warmups prior to a game with a seemingly minor injury, and was subsequently diagnosed with an \\"undisclosed injury\\". Pelech was held out for over two months before returning to the Islanders' minor league affiliate, and upon his return his prior diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome was publicly announced. His treatment for this condition included surgery removing his first rib and portions of muscle and tissue. On July 24, 2017, the Islanders re-signed Pelech to a four-year, $6.4 million contract worth $1.6 million annually. ==Personal life== Adam is the brother of Matt Pelech.

The ministry was the only occasion when the Government was led by Stevens, as Premier; and fourth and final occasion where Bruxner served as Deputy Premier. Mair was first elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1932 and served continuously until 1946. Having served as a junior minister in the third Stevens ministry and subsequently promoted, Mair was elected leader of the United Australia Party (UAP) in New South Wales as a result of a no confidence motion against the 25th Premier, Bertram Stevens, for not running a balanced budget. Stevens resigned as Premier and Leader of the UAP and Mair won the leadership ballot and hence became Premier. Bruxner was first elected to the Assembly in 1920 and served continuously until 1962. Initially a member of the Progressive Party, he served as party leader in opposition between 1922 and 1925; and resumed leadership in 1932, following the resignation of his successor, Ernest Buttenshaw. By this stage, the party was renamed as the Country Party. The Mair formed a coalition with Bruxner, taking over where Stevens was previously in coalition with the Country Party. This ministry covers the period from 5 August 1939 until 16 May 1941 when the 1941 state election saw the defeat of the Mair–Bruxner coalition, and the Labor Party under the leadership of William McKell elected to government. ==Composition of ministry== First arrangement The composition of the ministry was announced by Premier Mair on 5 August 1939 and covers just eleven days until 16 August 1939 as an \\"emergency cabinet\\" pending formation of the full ministry as a result of the turmoil following the resignation of Stevens.

It was announced on 18 March 2012, co-inciding with the first race of the 2012 season. The game was released in September 2012. It uses the EGO Engine. This was also the first game by Codemasters released under their \\"Codemasters Racing\\" label, which was used until 2016. The Mac OS X version of the game was released by Feral Interactive on 20 December 2012. ==Features== The game features all twelve teams and twenty-four drivers competing in the 2012 season (except for mid-season changes), as well as the twenty circuits and Grands Prix — including the brand new Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas — included in the championship. The game also features a brand-new \\"Young Driver Test\\" mode, a tutorial mode designed to introduce new players to the handling characteristics of Formula One cars as a prologue to the career mode. As a demonstration, Codemasters approached several drivers — including Mercedes test driver Sam Bird and GP2 Series driver Stefano Coletti — at the real-life Young Driver Tests (for drivers who have never started a Grand Prix) in Abu Dhabi in November 2011, and asked them to drive the Yas Marina Circuit in F1 2012 instead of using the team simulators they would traditionally use to learn the circuit. All of the drivers who played the game reported that the game was realistic enough for them to learn the circuit to the point where they were confident enough to set competitive lap times. The game also presents a new main menu, with Codemasters saying it is now easier to navigate around the video game. The sound system has been modified, and players can now hear other cars around them. Gameplay and modes As well as the new young driver test mode, F1 2012 features a new \\"Champions Mode\\", in which the six World Champions competing in the 2012 season — Kimi Räikkönen, Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button, Sebastian Vettel, Fernando Alonso and Michael Schumacher — are styled after traditional end-of-level video gaming bosses, with the player challenged to beat them while racing in conditions that suit each driver. Another new mode introduced in F1 2012, is the \\"Season Challenge\\" mode. Feedback given to Codemasters was that players only played the game when they had a few hours to play. In response, Codemasters brought in this mode so that players could simply play for a short amount of time. In this mode the player will start as a team lower down the field, and over a ten race season the player will move teams mid-season, depending on their ability to beat rival drivers and objectives. Codemasters also introduced \\"One-Shot Qualifying\\", whereby a player has a single lap to qualify for the race. The One-Shot Qualifying is included in Quick Race, Season Challenge and Career Mode. The three stage knock out session is still an option, however the single 20 minute session is no longer available in career mode. There is no longer an option to include all three practice sessions in a race weekend, but instead only a single hour session is available. In career mode players are no longer able to play races of less than 25%. In career mode the player can choose a team from the six teams. They are Marussia, HRT, Caterham, Scuderia Toro Rosso, Force India and Williams. The player can join a team after completing the Young Driver Test. The player can choose a team that meets the minimum medal requirements. Players gets contract offers from teams as they continues their races in Career Mode. In the quick play mode the option to make a custom championship is no longer available, but instead the player selects a single race to play on. ==Reception== F1 2012 received generally favorable reviews, earning a collective score of 81 out of 100 from Metacritic. IGN gave the game a 9.0, underlining that while yearly sports releases are faced with the difficult battle of introducing new content when the sport remains relatively unchanged, F1 2012 introduced noticeable tweaks to the gameplay that steadily improved it. GameSpot were equally-complimentary (8.5/10), applauding the developer for making the game more approachable to newcomers, but bemoaning the removal of some gameplay modes that had been included in previous releases. ==References * Category:2012 video games Category:Codemasters games Category:EGO (game engine) games Category:F1 (video game series) Category:Feral Interactive games Category:Games for Windows certified games Category:MacOS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in 2012 Category:Video games set in Australia Category:Video games set in Bahrain Category:Video games set in Belgium Category:Video games set in Brazil Category:Video games set in Canada Category:Video games set in China Category:Video games set in Germany Category:Video games set in Hungary Category:Video games set in India Category:Video games set in Italy Category:Video games set in Japan Category:Video games set in Malaysia Category:Video games set in Monaco Category:Video games set in Singapore Category:Video games set in South Korea Category:Video games set in Spain Category:Video games set in Texas Category:Video games set in the United Arab Emirates Category:Video games set in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games ","title":"F1 2012 (video game)"},{"id":"35210982","text":"Rissling is a surname.

On March 23, 2012, Columbus Crew announced they had signed Schoenfeld after acquiring his rights from the Impact in exchange for a conditional pick in the 2013 MLS Supplemental Draft. He made his professional debut the day after his signing. He came on as a substitute for Emilio Renteria in the 69th minute against Montreal Impact, the team that had recently traded him. The Crew went on to win 2–0. While on loan with the Dayton Dutch Lions in 2014, Schoenfeld became the club's record holder for goals scored in a single season (12). Upon his return to the Columbus Crew, Schoenfeld scored a brace against the New York Red Bulls. He would later cite this as a highlight of his career, as after the match he received complimentary feedback from New York striker, Thierry Henry. In 2015, Schoenfeld signed with Maccabi Netanya following a brief trial. Schoenfeld was given temporary Israeli resident status by the Israeli Ministry of Interior on January 14, 2016, so he would not count as a foreigner for Netanya. Upon signing, Schoenfeld told the Israeli media, \\"having grown up in a Zionist Jewish family, I have always wanted to come and play soccer in Israel.\\" On January 23, 2016, Schoenfeld made his Premier League debut for Netanya, coming on as a substitute for Itzik Cohen in a 1-0 loss to Hapoel Kfar Saba at Levita Stadium. After just two matches with Netanya, Schoenfeld signed a two and a half year deal with Hapoel Tel Aviv and was sold together with Netanya youth player, Fadi Najar, in exchange for ₪1 million. Schoenfeld made his debut with Hapoel Tel Aviv in a Tel Aviv derby on February 7, 2016 scoring the opening goal in the second minute. He joined Maccabi Tel Aviv on Feb 2017. On February 12, 2020, Schoenfeld returned to Major League Soccer, signing with Minnesota United FC. Minnesota acquired Schoenfeld's MLS rights from Columbus Crew in exchange for a second round pick in the 2021 MLS SuperDraft and additional considerations. International Media reports of Schoenfeld being called up to the Israeli national team for a friendly against Croatia started to surface on February 14, 2016, but has to date never received an invitation by the Israeli team. ==Honours== Club Maccabi Tel Aviv * Israeli Premier League: 2018–19 * Toto Cup: 2017–18, 2018–19 ==Personal life== Schoenfeld is in relationship with fellow soccer player Abby Dahlkemper. ==See also== *List of select Jewish association football (soccer) players ==References* Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:American soccer players Category:GPS Portland Phoenix players Category:Columbus Crew SC players Category:Dayton Dutch Lions players Category:Maccabi Netanya F.C. players Category:Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C. players Category:Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C. players Category:Minnesota United FC players Category:Association football forwards Category:Sportspeople from Knoxville, Tennessee Category:USL League Two players Category:Major League Soccer players Category:USL Championship players Category:Israeli Premier League players Category:Montreal Impact draft picks Category:East Tennessee State Buccaneers soccer players Category:Soccer players from Tennessee Category:Jewish American sportspeople Category:Jewish Israeli sportspeople Category:Jewish footballers Category:American emigrants to Israel Category:Ashkenazi Jews ","title":"Aaron Schoenfeld"},{"id":"35211192","text":"is a 2000 Japanese jidaigeki action film directed by Sogo Ishii. In several English-speaking countries, it was released as Gojoe: Spirit War Chronicle. It is a historical fantasy martial arts film set in 12th-century medieval Japan before the Genpei War. ==Plot== After the apparent defeat of the Genji in the war for Japan, a mysterious demon lurking at the Gojoe bridge in Kyoto kills every Heike warrior that tries to cross it. Meanwhile Musashibo Benkei, a samurai turned Buddhist monk out of repentance for his past crimes, receives a divine signal from Acalanatha informing him that he only will be forgiven after slaying the demon. Borrowing a sacred sword from a yamabushi sect, and against the wishes of his mentor Ajari, Benkei sets out to destroy the monster. At the scene of one of the murders in Gojoe, Benkei encounters his old rival Tankai, and also meets a scavenger named Tetsukichi, a former weaponsmith who now survives from looting from battle corpses. One night, during a failed attempt by the Heike clan of killing the demon through large numbers of troops, Benkei discovers the supposed demon is actually three superhuman masked warriors. They are Shanao, a young mystic and heir to the Genji, and his two retainers Gojin and Keshimaru. Back in their cave refuge, Shanao is urged by his priest Sashinbo to take command of the disorganized Genji army to get revenge on the Heike. Benkei starts a search to locate Shanao's cave accompanied by Tetsukichi. It is then revealed that the latter used to be a legendary swordmaker, but he retired because his weapons were used by sōhei to indulge in bloodshed, and only follows Benkei under the promise of looting Shanao's collection of captured swords. However, he develops a grudging respect towards Benkei after the latter exorcizes a possessed parturient woman, Ashagiri. Later in their quest, they reach a forest cursed by evil spirits, who Benkei tries to banish, but he is stopped by spells sent by Shanao. Benkei and Tetsukichi are then arrested by Heike soldiers, who take the former to their leader Taira no Tadanori. Tadanori asks for Benkei's help to solidify the Heike dominance over Japan, but Benkei refuses, having dedicated his life to Buddha. Tadanori orders Benkei to be tied under the sun to torment him, and then arrangers for him to duel Tankai, wanting Benkei to show his true power. However, having sworn off his warrior past, Benkei refuses, and he is to be executed when Shanao and his retainers attack the place, which causes a three-way battle in which Tadanori dies. Cutting down Tankai, Shanao faces off with Benkei and breaks the sacred sword due to Benkei's reluctance to fight. However, Ajari appears to scare Shanao away and reveal that Acalanatha's signal was actually a delusion. After the faceoff, Shanao abandons his allegiance for the Genji and announces he will fight only for himself. He visits Ajari, revealing him that the Buddhist deities have abandoned the world and boasting only he has the power to do so now, and cuts down the old master. Shanao then initiates an iconoclast rampage, killing monks and desecrating statues, which spreads insanity around the lands of Gojoe, and challenges Benkei him to a duel in the bridge. Finding Tetsukichi alive among the corpses of Ashagiri and Tankai's warriors, Benkei asks him to reforge the sacred sword. Tetsukichi feels hopeless, but after watching Benkei mystically revive Ashagiri's baby as his last deed as a monk, he does so. Shanao comes to the bridge after having assumed the name of Yoshitsune, while Benkei confronts him while wearing armor and carrying multiple weapons, embracing his warrior ethos. The two fight, only for the sacred sword to break again. However, Benkei now utilizes the rest of his weapons, which get similarly destroyed, and while unarmed he uses jujutsu. Although Yoshitsune seems near the victory, Benkei announces he will finally show him his demon blood and fights him wielding a piece of sword. Yoshitsune stabs Benkei through the torso, but Benkei raises the piece to the stormy sky, attracting a bolt of lightning that kills them both and destroys the bridge. After the duel, Shashinbo meets a group of emmisaries of the Genji, whom he makes believe that Keshimaru and Gojin are respectively Yoshitsune and a now allied Benkei. At the bridge, a Tetsukichi rendered blind by the lightning searches desperately for Benkei among the rubble, but he only finds the baby, still miraculously alive. ==Cast== * Daisuke Ryu as Musashibo Benkei * Tadanobu Asano as Shanao/Yoshitsune * Masatoshi Nagase as Tetsukichi * Saburo Teshigawara as Ajari * Masakatsu Funaki as Tankai * Ittoku Kishibe as Taira no Tadanori * Jun Kunimura as Suzaku-hougan * Wui-Sin Chong (credited as Yoshinobu Tei) as Sashinbo * Takahito Hosoyamada as Keshimaru * Atsushi Narita as Gojin * Taketoshi Naito as the old man in the bridge * Urara Awata as Ashagiri * Nobuhiro Suwa as Taira no Kiyomori (flashback) * Toshihiro Isomi as Minamoto no Yoshitomo (flashback) * Ikui Ishii as Tokiwa Gozen (flashback) ==Production== Film producer Takenori Sento, who helped produce the Ring Trilogy, wanted to create a box office hit by making an action film in the jidaigeki genre. ==Release== The film was first shown in North America as part of the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was also shown at the 2001 Sitges Film Festival. The film was set for an October 7, 2001 theatrical release in Japan. ==Awards== Actor Tadanobu Asano won the award for Best Supporting Actor at the Hochi Film Awards in 2000 for his role in this film and in Taboo. ==Reception== Variety gave the film a mixed review, stating that \\"Despite an impressive opening and suitably titanic finale, yarn about various warriors battling one another during the \\"Dark Ages\\" is way overlong at almost 2½ hours and soon palls with its endless succession of sylvan swordplay.\\" The Japan Times compared the final action scene to the \\"excessive episodes of the Dragonball Z\\" and that the film may \\"bring in the same kids who made the Ring films an event – but it's not going to make anyone forget Shichinin no Samurai. Kurosawa's masterpiece delivers the essence of battle with gut-wrenching authority. Film4 gave the film a positive review, stating that \\"What it lacks in humour (and there is absolutely none to be found in it), Gojoe more than makes up for in its sheer, unrelenting intensity, something which few other directors would be able to sustain over so long a duration.\\" ==Notes * Category:2000 films Category:Toho films Category:2000s action films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese action films Category:Fantasy adventure films Category:Japanese martial arts films Category:Samurai films Category:2001 martial arts films ","title":"Gojoe"},{"id":"35211206","text":"Thitarodes eberti is a species of moth of the family Hepialidae.

On 17 February 2013, then Premier Campbell Newman appointed Walker as the new Minister for Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts after the resignation of Ros Bates. Following the LNP's defeat at the 2015 Queensland election, Walker was succeeded as Minister by Leeanne Enoch (Science and Innovation) and Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk (Arts). Despite the statewide defeat of the LNP, Walker narrowly retained Mansfield, a noted bellwether seat, becoming its second opposition member. The first, fellow Liberal Frank Carroll, served in opposition for a few months in 1995 and 1996 before a by-election elevated the Coalition to minority government. The Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg appointed Walker to the Shadow Cabinet, giving him the roles of Shadow Attorney-General and Shadow Minister for Justice, Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations and Shadow Minister for the Arts. Walker's seat of Mansfield was altered by an electoral redistribution for the 2017 election, becoming a notionally Labor seat with a 0.8% Labor margin, as opposed to Walker's 0.5% margin from the 2015 election. He recontested his seat on the new boundaries, but was defeated by Labor candidate Corrine McMillan.

After initial training it was placed under the operational control of RAF Coastal Command, flying its first mission, a daylight bombing raid against a road junction at Nieuwpoort, Belgium on 31 May 1940. The squadron continued to fly a mixture of convoy escort missions, daylight attacks against German land and sea targets and nighttime patrols against German E-boats until the Albacore was grounded on 3 July 1940 owing to the unreliability of the aircraft's Bristol Taurus engines. This resulted in the Squadron being temporarily re-equipped with the older Fairey Swordfish until the Albacore was returned to use in August. From August to October 1940, the Squadron carried out more convoy escort patrols and raids against barges being massed by the Germans in the Channel ports in preparation for Operation Sealion. On 7 October the squadron left Coastal Command control to undertake more training in preparation for carrier-based operations.Brown 1972, pp. 49–50. From May to October, the Squadron dropped 55.5 tons of bombs and seven tons of mines, escorted over 100 convoys. It claimed two Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters shot down for the loss of five Albacores.Brown 1972, pp. 48–50. In November 1940, the squadron embarked on the newly commissioned aircraft carrier , which sailed for the Mediterranean via South Africa and the Red Sea, the squadron flying attacks against Massawa in Italian-ruled Eritrea on the way.Brown 1972, p. 50. The squadron's strength was supplemented by two Swordfishes in March 1941 to replace losses. 826 Squadron took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 28 March 1941, damaging the .\\"Fleet Air Arm 826 squadron profile\\" .

On 26 May 1941, following an attack on an airfield on Karpathos, Formidable was badly damaged by German bombers, and was withdrawn from operations for repair, with 826 Squadron being detached for land-based operations. The Squadron was then deployed on night bombing raids over the Western Desert in support of the Eighth Army, before being transferred (along with 815 Squadron) to Nicosia, Cyprus for operations against Vichy French naval forces during the Syria–Lebanon Campaign on 28 June 1941. The squadron returned to North Africa on 15 July, and continued to carry night bombing attacks until early 1942, when it returned to the torpedo bomber role, operating from Berka in Libya to attack Italian convoys.Brown 1972, pp. 50–51. The Squadron continued to carry out both anti-shipping and bombing missions in support of the army for much of the rest of 1942, adding the role of dropping flares to illuminate targets for Vickers Wellington bombers, participating in both the first and second Battles of El Alamein. Following the British victory at El Alamein, the squadron continued to fly anti-shipping and convoy escort missions until disbanded on 25 August 1943.Brown 1972, pp. 51–53. 826 Naval Air Squadron reformed on 1 December 1943 at RNAS Lee-on- Solent equipped with the Fairey Barracuda torpedo bomber as part of No 9 Torpedo-Bomber-Reconnaissance (TBR) Wing.Brown 1972, pp. 53–54.

The Squadron was again disbanded on 13 October 1944.Brown 1972, pp. 53–58. Post War Canada The squadron reformed on 15 August 1945, again equipped with Barracudas, with the intention of forming part of the air wing of , a carrier building for the Royal Canadian Navy. It re-equipped with Fairey Firefly fighter bombers in January 1946, but was disbanded on 26 February 1946, as delays to the completion of Magnificent meant that the squadron was not yet needed.Brown 1972, p. 58. The squadron reformed on 1 June 1947 as part of the Royal Canadian Navy, equipped with Fairey Fireflys, operating both from Magnificent and HMCS Warrior. It re-equipped with Grumman TBM Avenger anti- submarine aircraft in June 1950. On 1 May 1951, the squadron was renamed 881 Squadron (RCN), later VS 881. Reformation 826 Squadron reformed as part of the Fleet Air Arm in May 1951, equipped with Firefly Mk 5 (soon replaced by Firefly AS. Mk.6) in the anti-submarine role. The Squadron flew its Fireflys off the carriers , Theseus and Glory, before re-equipping with the new Fairey Gannet anti-submarine aircraft in January 1955, becoming the first squadron to operate the Gannet. It embarked aboard HMS Eagle but disbanded in November 1955. Helicopters The 826 designation was then reactivated in 1966 at RNAS Culdrose, where the squadron was equipped with 8 Westland Wessex HAS.1 helicopters, and was attached to on a tour of the Mediterranean and Far East in 1966–1967. It then deployed detachments aboard the Replenishment oilers and before deploying aboard in 1969. The squadron disbanded at RNAS Culdrose on 25 March 1970.Brown 1972, pp. 58, 61. It was reformed a sixth time on 2 June 1970 with Westland Sea Kings,Brown 1972, p. 61. serving on HMS Eagle until the carrier decommissioned in January 1972. The squadron then operated from the helicopter training ship and from December 1972, from the cruiser . It continued to operate its Sea Kings from Tiger until 1978, when it transferred to the carrier , receiving Sea King HAS.5s in March 1981, and embarking on Hermes in September that year.Sturtivant and Ballance 1994, pp. 222–224. (Bulwark having been paid off in March 1981.Chesneau 1998, p. 146.) Following the Argentinian invasion of the Falkland Islands in April 1982, the squadron, equipped with nine Sea King HAS.5s, deployed aboard Hermes as part of the Operation Corporate Task Force sent to retake the Islands. The squadron carried anti-submarine and surface search patrols around the task force, unsuccessfully attacking a suspected Argentine submarine on the night of 1/2 May, and also rescued survivors from , and . Four Sea Kings were transferred to the stores ship to free up space aboard Hermes on 17 May. The Squadron lost two helicopters during the Falklands War, but on both occasions the crews escaped unharmed.Burden et al 1986, pp. 247–250. After the end of the war, the Squadron was split into a number of independent flights operating from Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships, and deployed in turn to the South Atlantic, these operations continuing until 1986. After that period, the Squadron was split into 4 flights of two Sea Kings each, operating from Type 22 frigates, RFAs and aircraft carriers as required.Sturtivant and Ballance 1994, pp. 223, 225–227. In December 1990, just prior to the start of the First Gulf War, 826 C Flight, commanded by Lt Cdr Kevin Williamson RN, deployed to the Middle East to take over the two D Flight Sea King helicopters already on station in the region - they were the only helicopters and crews deployed into the Gulf from RNAS Culdrose. The ASW equipment (SONAR and LAPADS equipment) normally fitted had been removed and prototype equipment designed to detect shallow moored mines was fitted instead. This equipment, called 'Demon Camera', was largely ineffective in the waters of the Gulf and the crews reverted to spotting moored and floating mines visually from heights of around 500 feet. The mines were then destroyed by RN EOD divers deployed directly from the helicopters in a low hover and recovered by winch. During their time deployed in the Gulf C Flight operated from and RFAs , and . The C Flight crews returned to RNAS Culdrose in April 1991, after handing their Sea Kings back to 826 D flight personnel who then subsequently took part in flood relief operations off Bangladesh. During this period Sea King XZ577 (side number '138') was lost in a collision with ; the crew and passengers survived. ==Aircraft operated== Fairey Albacore, circa 1940.
