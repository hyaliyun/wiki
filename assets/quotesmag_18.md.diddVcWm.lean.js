The team also signed free agents Armen Gilliam and Andrew Lang, while acquiring Elliot Perry from the Phoenix Suns. Under new head coach Chris Ford, the Bucks appeared to be on their way breaking out of the gate with a 15–11 start.

Following the season, Baker was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics in an offseason three-team trade, Johnny Newman was dealt to the Denver Nuggets, and Sherman Douglas, who was involved in a trade with Cleveland signed as a free agent with the New Jersey Nets. ==Draft picks== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 255325; color:#609\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 255325; color:#609\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 255325; color:#609\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 255325; color:#609\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 255325; color:#609\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 255325; color:#609\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  4  Stephon Marbury  PG   Georgia Tech - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  33  Moochie Norris  PG   West Florida - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  53  Jeff Nordgaard  SF   Wisconsin-Green Bay } ==RosterRegular season== Season standings :z - clinched division title :y - clinched division title :x - clinched playoff spot Record vs. opponents {  style=\\"font- size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=301996-97 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !008080;color:#800080;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000000;color:#5787DC;width=35\\"CLE !00008B;color:#008000;width=35\\"DAL !141A44;color:#BC2224;width=35\\"DEN !0C7674;color:#BB222C;width=35\\"DET !0000FF;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"GSW !002366;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !00471B;color:#5C378A;width=35\\"MIL !044D80;color:#000000;width=35\\"MIN !DC143C;color:#0000CD;width=35\\"NJN !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !FF0000;color:#0000FF;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !6846A8;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#992634;width=35\\"SEA !7436BF;color:#BE0F34;width=35\\"TOR !644A9C;color:#149BC7;width=35\\"UTA !0CB2AC;color:#000000;width=35\\"VAN !DC143C;color:#0000CD;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  3–1  1–3  1–3  3–1  2–0  1–1  1–3  2–0  1–1  3–1  2–0  1–1  1–2  4–0  2–0  3–1  1–3  3–1  4–0  1–1  2–0  2–0  2–0  1–1  4–0  1–1  2–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  1–3  —  0–4  0–4  1–2  1–1  1–1  0–4  1–1  0–2  1–2  0–2  1–1  0–4  1–3  0–2  0–4  0–4  0–4  1–3  1–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  3–1  0–2  0–2  0–4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Charlotte  3–1  4–0  —  0–4  3–1  1–1  2–0  2–2  2–0  2–0  2–2  1–1  1–1  1–2  2–2  2–0  4–0  3–1  1–2  4–0  1–1  0–2  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–2  0–2  2–0  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Chicago  3–1  4–0  4–0  —  3–1  2–0  2–0  3–1  2–0  1–1  4–0  2–0  1–1  2–2  4–0  2–0  3–1  2–2  3–0  4–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  3–1  1–1  2–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cleveland  1–3  2–1  1–3  1–3  —  2–0  1–1  2–2  1–1  0–2  3–1  2–0  1–1  0–4  2–2  2–0  4–0  1–3  2–2  3–0  1–1  1–1  2–0  0–2  0–2  3–1  1–1  2–0  1–3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Dallas  0–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  —  3–1  0–2  0–4  0–4  1–1  2–2  0–4  0–2  0–2  1–3  1–1  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–3  1–3  2–2  1–3  1–3  0–2  1–3  3–1  0–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Denver  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  1–3  —  0–2  1–3  1–3  0–2  1–3  0–4  0–2  1–1  0–4  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  2–2  0–4  2–2  2–2  0–4  1–1  0–4  3–1  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Detroit  3–1  4–0  2–2  1–3  2–2  2–0  2–0  —  2–0  1–1  3–1  2–0  1–1  0–4  3–1  2–0  4–0  1–2  2–2  2–1  0–2  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  3–1  1–1  2–0  4–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Golden State  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  4–0  3–1  0–2  —  0–4  1–1  1–3  0–4  0–2  1–1  1–3  2–0  0–2  1–1  2–0  0–4  2–2  1–3  4–0  0–4  2–0  0–4  3–1  0–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Houston  1–1  2–0  0–2  1–1  2–0  4–0  3–1  1–1  4–0  —  1–1  3–1  3–1  0–2  1–1  4–0  2–0  1–1  0–2  2–0  2–2  2–2  4–0  3–1  3–1  1–1  2–2  3–1  2–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Indiana  1–3  2–1  2–2  0–4  1–3  1–1  2–0  1–3  1–1  1–1  —  2–0  1–1  1–3  2–2  2–0  2–2  1–3  1–3  3–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  4–0  0–2  2–0  1–3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  L.A.

His compositions are regularly performed and broadcast worldwide, and they appear on a number of CDs. ==Early career and education== He was born in Norwood, South London on 4 August 1947, son of artists Paul Bullard and Jeanne Bullard, and lived as a child in Blackheath, South-East London. He attended St. Olave's Grammar School, where he learnt music with Desmond Swinburn, while studying piano with Geoffrey Flowers and John Allen at the Blackheath Conservatoire of Music. He then studied with Herbert Howells, Ruth Gipps and Antony Hopkins at the Royal College of Music, and took postgraduate study with Arnold Whittall at the University of Nottingham. For the next few years he taught music part-time in several art schools and at the London College of Music (from 1970 to 1975). Apart from a short song written in 1967 when he was a student of Herbert Howells, the earliest work that Alan Bullard now acknowledges is his Three Poems of W B Yeats of 1973. This work, and a cluster of other choral works, (several of which found publishers such as Banks and the RSCM) written at about the same time, are almost the only pieces to survive this period. ==Professional career== The opportunity of a permanent teaching post at what is now Colchester Institute (where Bullard taught from 1975 to 2005) caused a move to the Essex countryside, and later to Colchester. Here encouragement by several colleagues and friends resulted in a growing musical confidence and output: for example Colchester Choral Society (director Ian Ray) commissioned three large-scale works for choir and orchestra. In 1985 Bullard wrote a setting for unaccompanied choir of four sixteenth-century poems entitled Madrigal Book. This work came to the attention of Stephen Wilkinson and was the beginning of a long association with Alan Bullard's choral music, resulting in several broadcasts by the BBC Northern Singers. Meanwhile, his work in the area of choral music for amateurs attracted the interest of Oxford University Press, and there is now in their catalogue a wide variety of Bullard’s anthems and carols for different choral groupings and situations, many of which are performed worldwide. Many of Bullard’s orchestral pieces found first performances in East Anglia, often under the baton of Christopher Phelps. Bullard has also written much chamber music for many instrumental combinations and his music for wind groups, in particular, has found particular favour, as has his music for the recorder, an instrument he enjoys playing as an amateur. Bullard has also written much music for children and adult learners: he is a contributor to many instrumental collections and is the composer of Joining the Dots (ABRSM) an ongoing series to develop musical sight-reading, and the editor and author, with his wife Janet, of the Pianoworks piano tutor series published by Oxford University Press. Bullard claims to find ‘the writing of an interesting Grade One piece as exciting as any other musical challenge’. ==Awards== In 2008 Bullard was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of Essex for his work in composition and education, and in 2010 he received three awards from the Music Industries Association (MIA) for his publications in that year. ==Musical language and reception== Bullard acknowledges the influence of twentieth-century composers such as Benjamin Britten and Herbert Howells on his musical language, as well as that of mediaeval and renaissance music. Writers have described his music as ‘gentle, melodic, and unfailingly well-crafted’, and showing ‘a real sense of pianistic understanding, economical and linear without sounding clichéd’. Another critic has said ‘Bullard’s music shows a genuine love for melodic contours and a delicate shading of a harmonic language that is respectful of tradition without being a slave to it’. Of his Christmas carols, writers have said that ‘Bullard’s direct tuneful language draws its chief source of inspiration from the eloquent simplicity of folk-carols’ and that ‘he shows a sensitivity to the text, and vocal lines that show a natural easy flow’ and found his carol ‘Glory to the Christ-Child’ to be a ‘rigorous and exhilarating setting of mediaeval lyrics’. And educational material such as Pianoworks (with his wife Janet as co-writer) has been welcomed as ‘attractive, unpatronising and adult in manner’. Bullard's is not ivory tower music - what seems to please him most is to write music which performers enjoy playing and audiences enjoy hearing: music which might provide something of a challenge, but which is not out of reach. As one critic put it: ‘He sees his role as quietly getting on with the vocation of writing music that people will want to sing and play on the everyday, as well as the special occasion’. ==Personal life== Alan Bullard is married to Janet Bullard (nee Dakin), a piano teacher and singer.

In a career which lasted from late summer 1987 until September 1988, he ran eight times and won five races. He recorded his most important success when winning the Classic St. Leger Stakes as a three-year-old in 1988, ridden by his breeder, Willie Carson. In the same year in which he also won the Newmarket Stakes, the Predominate Stakes and the Gordon Stakes. He was retired to stud following his St Leger victory. ==Background== Minster Son was a strongly-built chestnut horse with a white blaze bred by the leading jockey Willie Carson who rode him in all of his races. He was sired by the American- bred stallion Niniski, who won the Irish St. Leger and the Prix Royal-Oak in 1979 before going on to sire many good staying horses including Petoski, Hernando (Prix du Jockey Club) and Lomitas (Preis von Europa). His dam, Honey Bridge, was a member of Thoroughbred family 14-a, which also produced notable horses including Tetratema and Polynesian. Before his racing career began, Minster Son entered the ownership of Lady Beaverbrook and was sent into training with Major Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. ==Racing career== 1987: two-year-old season Minster Son made his first appearance in a maiden race at Newbury Racecourse in which he defeated his stable companion Unfuwain and twenty-five others. He was beaten in his two remaining starts in 1987. 1988: three-year-old season Minster Son began his three-year-old season in the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs in April. Carson rode the colt to a one length victory over the favourite Red Glow. Two weeks later, Red Glow won the Dante Stakes at York. Minster Son was sent to Goodwood for the Predominate Stakes on 18 May, a recognised trial race for The Derby. He took the lead in the straight and won by one and a half lengths from Sheriff's Star. At Epsom on 1 June, Minster Son started the 6/1 third favourite for the Derby behind Red Glow and Unfuwain. Carson chose to ride the horse he had bred in preference to the more fancied Unfuwain and the 2000 Guineas runner-up Charmer. Minster Son was never in contention for the lead and finished eighth of the fourteen runners behind Kahyasi. It was to be his only defeat of the season. In July, Minster Son returned to Goodwood for the Gordon Stakes and won by two lengths from Assatis to establish himself as major contender for the St Leger. Shortly after Minster Son's win in the Gordon Stakes, Hern underwent heat surgery, and the colt's training was taken over by his assistant Neil Graham. At Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September, Minster Son started third favourite for the St Leger behind the filly Diminuendo who had won The Oaks, Irish Oaks and Yorkshire Oaks. Sheriff's Star was made second favourite after winning the King Edward VII Stakes and the Great Voltigeur Stakes. Carson kept his horse towards the front of the field before sending him into the lead three furlongs from the finish, and Diminuendo emerged as his only serious challenger. Minster Son \\"stayed on gamely\\" to beat the filly by a length, with Sheriff's Star finishing eight lengths further back in third. Willie Carson became the first man to win a Classic on a horse he had bred himself. After the race, Carson explained that Minster Son's performance as the colt had been affected by a back injury in his previous two starts. He also expressed the hope the colt would be better as a four-year-old. Minster Son remained in training in 1989 but in March Lady Beaverbrook announced that he would be retired to stud without racing again. ==Stud career== Minster Son stood as a stallion at the Acrum Lodge Stud near Bishop Auckland in County Durham from his retirement until his death on 30 August 2006. He had no success as a sire of flat racers, but had more success as a National Hunt stallion. The best of his progeny was probably the steeplechaser Rambling Minster who started second favourite for the 2009 Grand National after winning the Blue Square Gold Cup at Haydock. ==Pedigree References == Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:1985 racehorse births Category:2006 racehorse deaths Category:Thoroughbred family 14-a Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Minster Son"},{"id":"35927534","text":"Brandon Collins (born April 21, 1989) was an American football wide receiver who is currently a free agent. ==College career== Collins played 2 seasons at the University of Texas before transferring to Southeastern Louisiana University.

In this season, Dinamo was affected again by the big number of players who left the team, which became a tradition for the bosses of the club to sell players after winning a title. Thus, Dinamo was again facing another reconstruction. They started the season badly, losing the two games in the UEFA Champions League qualifying phase, and leaving early the European competitions. Cornel Dinu was sacked after this two losses. In Divizia A Dinamo had hard times, changing a lot of managers and losing seven consecutive games. The team finished the season on the sixth position. A momentum of the season came in November, in the Romanian Cup, last 16, where Dinamo met the biggest rival Steaua. Dinamo won 3-0 the game played at the Cotroceni stadium. After Ioan Andone came to the team, Dinamo played a spectacular semifinal with Astra Ploieşti. They lost the first game, 2–1 in Ploieşti in the middle of the crisis, but then the team beat Astra in Bucharest 3-1 after extra time.

He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Bishopp was the son of Sir Thomas Bishopp, 1st Baronet of Parham Park, Sussex, and his second wife Jane Weston, daughter of Sir Richard Weston of Sutton Surrey. George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage, Volume 1 1900 He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 22 October 1619, aged 18 and was a student of the Inner Temple in 1620. 'Alumni Oxonienses, 1500-1714: Bennell-Bloye', Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714 (1891), pp. 106-141. Date accessed: 21 May 2012 He was knighted at Hampton Court on 18 December 1625 and succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1626. In 1626, he was elected Member of Parliament for Steyning. In 1627 he killed Henry Shirley the playwright when the latter called at his house to collect a £40 annual annuity that Bishopp was obliged to pay him under the terms of a bequest. After initially making his escape Bishopp was captured, charged with manslaughter and sentenced to be burnt on the hand. He was however later pardoned on condition that he paid the annuity to the victim's elder brother, which he never did. He was nevertheless pricked Sheriff of Sussex in 1636. In April 1640, Bishopp was elected MP for Bramber in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected in the Long Parliament in November 1640 until his election was declared void in December. He supported the King in the civil war and was governor of Arundel Castle on behalf of the King in 1643 and was taken prisoner at the surrender of the castle in January 1644. His estates were sequestrated and he compounded in October 1644. He was fined £7,500 in October 1645 which was later reduced to £4,790. In about 1626 Bishopp married Mary Tufton, daughter of Nicholas Tufton, 1st Earl of Thanet and Lady Frances Cecil. Lady Frances Cecil was the daughter of Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter and Dorothy Neville. Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter was the son of William Cecil, Lord Burghley. Subsequent Bishopp baronets carried the name Cecil in recognition of this influential ancestor. Bishopp died at the age of about 47 and was succeeded briefly in the baronetcy by his son Thomas, born 3 Dec 1627. In 1651, Thomas, his mother Mary, and sisters Frances, Diana, Christina, and Mary, successfully appealed for the portion of Sir Edward's estate that was intended for the maintenance of his widow and daughters to be released from sequestration. Thomas he died unmarried and without issue in 1652 and was succeeded by his brother Sir Cecil Bishopp, 4th Baronet (c. 1635 – 3 June 1705). ==References== Category:1602 births Category:1649 deaths Category:Cavaliers Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Oxford Category:Members of the Inner Temple Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England Category:English MPs 1626 Category:English MPs 1640 (April) Category:High Sheriffs of Sussex ","title":"Sir Edward Bishopp, 2nd Baronet"},{"id":"35927642","text":"Simak (, also Romanized as Sīmak) is a village in Derakhtengan Rural District, in the Central District of Kerman County, Kerman Province, Iran.

The agency in charge of censorship in the Russian Empire changed over time. In the early eighteenth century, the Russian emperor had direct control, but by the end of the eighteenth century, censorship was delegated to the Synod, the Senate, and the Academy of Sciences. Beginning in the nineteenth century, it fell under the charge of the Ministry of Education and finally the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The history of censorship in the Russia began long before the emergence of the empire. The first book containing an index of prohibited works dates to the year 1073, in Kievan Rus. For several centuries these were mere translations of censorship lists from other languages; the first authentic old Russian censorship index was created only in the fourteenth century. The number of indices (as well as illegal publications) increased steadily until the beginning of the sixteenth century. Censorship first attained a kind of official status in the period of the Tsardom (1547–1721): it was encoded in law in the Stoglav and was directed against heresies, schisms, and other alleged deviations from religious dogmas and sacred texts.Bol'shaia Sovetskaia Entsiklopediia, s.v. \\"Tsenzura\\", retrieved on 25 August 2011. Significant changes in censorship policy occurred over the course of the imperial period. The reforms of Peter I marked the beginning of the separation between ecclesiastical and secular censorship. A greater delineation of the responsibilities of censorship organizations took place in the reign of Empress Elizabeth. The period of Elizabeth's reign is also notable for the appearance of the first private journals, which greatly promoted the development of journalism in the Russian Empire.Zhirkov, \\"XVIII vek: period perekhoda ot dukhovnoi k svetskoi tsenzure\\" (2001) One of the most important events in the history of Russian censorship occurred in the course of Catherine II's reforms: the establishment of a censorship institute and the creation of the position of professional censor. Paul I, Catherine's son, continued the business of his predecessor, by expanding the areas that were subject to state control. Alexander I, however, reversed some of these policies and weakened the censorship. In the second half of the nineteenth century, under Alexander III, freedom of the press was once again significantly restricted. Many classics of Russian literature were affected by censorship, and the censor was regularly represented as a grotesque figure and made the target of satire. Imperial censorship was followed by Soviet censorship, which adopted many of its features and continued until 1990. ==Historical background== Kievan Rus and the Grand Duchy of Moscow Page from the 1073 Izbornik Censorship in Russia dates back to long before the codified legal censorship of the Russian Empire. The first known list of banned books is found in the Izbornik of 1073, when much of what is now European Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus was governed by a polity known as Rus', centered in Kiev. The Izbornik, which also contained a large selection of Byzantine biblical, theological, and homiletic writings, was copied from a Bulgarian original that was probably created on the initiative of the Bulgarian tsar Simeon I. Most historians agree that the Russian version was made by order of Grand Duke Izyaslav Yaroslavich, though it was later reattributed to the prince Svyatoslav Yaroslavich. The list of banned books in the Izbornik did not necessarily indicate that the banned books had previously been available: N. A. Kobyak notes that out of the twenty-three apocryphal writings listed, only nine were available in Old Church Slavonic and Old East Slavic translations or adaptations. The second translated work containing an index of prohibited books was the Taktikon by the monk Nikon Chernogorets. The historian D. Bulanin M. notes that this work was so popular in Rus' that \\"rarely did a book or original medieval composition not contain excerpts from the Pandects or the Taktikon\\". Nikon's articles were at an early date included in Slavic legal codes. They became especially popular in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries: the writers of the time (Joseph Volotsky, Vassian Patrikeyev, Maximus the Greek, Zinovy Otensky, etc.) constantly refer to Nikon and include excerpts from his works. The first native Slavic list of banned books is thought to be the index included in the Pogodinsky Nomokanon, dated to the fourteenth century. This was the first list to include works by a Slavic author, the Bulgarian priest Jeremiah, including his Story about a Red Tree and some other works. The index also prohibited religious texts that were later popular among the so-called Judaizers: Shestokryl, Logic, and Cosmography. Up until the early sixteenth century the number of indices of prohibited books steadily increased, but they were not able to hold back a massive influx of literature from Byzantium and the south Slavic countries. Kobyak argues that the expansion of the lists of books reflected the same sentiments found in the teachings of Joseph Volotsky against \\"unwholesome stories\\" and of Nilus of Sora against \\"ungodly\\" writings. But similarly to these teachings, the lists did not fully achieve their objectives. Tsardom of Russia The title page of the Stoglav According to G. V. Zhirkov, \\"official\\" censorship of book publishers began in the Tsardom of Russia in the mid-sixteenth century, when the Stoglavy Sobor was convened to strengthen the position of the church against heretical movements. The collection of decisions taken by the council, called the Stoglav, consisted mainly of questions posed by the tsar and detailed answers given by the church officials. A section titled \\"On Scribes\\" gave the church authorities the right to confiscate unrectified manuscripts. Thus a system of prior censorship of all publications prior to sale was established. Among other changes, the council proposed a retroactive revision of the books already in circulation. Adopted in 1551, the Stoglav was the first official censorship document in Russia. It was a reaction to the development of literacy and the emergence of an increasing number of literary works, the content of which did not always fit with church and state doctrine. In the period from 1551 to 1560 at least twelve documents and deeds were published establishing new measures and regulations in accordance with the Stoglav. The church in its new censorship capacity focused mainly on the fight against deviations from church doctrines and sacred texts, heresy, and schism. The majority of the \\"apostates\\" fled abroad, particularly to Lithuania. The pioneering printers Ivan Fyodorov and Pyotr Mstislavets also fled to Lithuania, fearing persecution by the Josephite-dominated church leadership. With the invention of the printing press, the priest-scribes who had previously dominated the book industry saw their incomes decline and erupted in protest, and as a result, Fyodorov and Mstislavets were accused of heresy. After a fire in their printing house in 1566, the publishers finally decided to leave Moscow. Fyodorov later commented, \\"Envy and hatred drove us from our country, fatherland, and kin to other lands, hitherto unknown.\\": \\"Зависть и ненависть нас от земли и отечества и от рода нашего изгнали и в иные страны, неведомые доселе.\\" The seventeenth century repeatedly saw bans of books created in the territory of modern Ukraine and Belarus. For example, in 1626, Lavrenty Zizany's Catechism was published in Moscow on the recommendation of the Kiev Metropolitan Job Boretsky. Many Russian clergymen believed that the Catechism contained heretical statements and in February 1627 Zizany publicly debated the matter with the editors in the Moscow Print Yard. Following the discussion, the copies of the Catechism was destroyed. In 1628, the importation of all books from the \\"Lithuanian press\\" was banned, and such books that already existed in Russian churches were withdrawn. Patriarch Nikon, who instituted significant reforms in the Russian church, presided over a massive confiscation of books published under his predecessors, as well as books written by Old Believers, who separated from the main church following his reforms. Censorship also extended to icons: in October 1667 a decree was passed that banned the amateur painting of icons and forbade the buying of such icons in shops and marketplaces. Lubki—popular decorative prints—were also subjected to censorship because of their drawings of religious subjects, which caused outrage among the clergy. Patriarch Joachim strictly forbade their dissemination (after 1674), and confiscated lubki were burned. In 1679 Tsar Feodor III ordered the creation of a palace printing house, which was intended for the publication of the works of Symeon of Polotsk, who had taught the tsar and his brothers. The printing house was allowed to circumvent church censorship in order to support the royal favorite. In 1683, however, Patriarch Joachim managed to close the uncontrolled printing house, and after the fall of the regent Sophia Alekseyevna, the printer Sylvester Medvedev was put to death. Even before the execution, his works were banned by the Council in 1690 in Moscow and burned.Богданов А. П. От летописания к исследованию: русские историки последней четверти XVII века. М.: RISC, 1995. С. 215—301.; Панченко А. М. Сильвестр //Словарь книжников и книжности Древней Руси. СПб. 1998. Вып. 3. Ч. 3. С. 354—359. Another act of censorship punishment occurred in October 1689 in Moscow, when German mystic Quirinus Kuhlmann and his successor Conrad Norderman, who were burnt alive and whose writings were labelled heretical and confiscated.Богданов А. П. Русские патриархи (1589—1700): В 2 т. Т. 1. — М. 1999. С. 225—231. ==Peter I's reforms== Title page of the Ecclesiastical Regulations (Духовный регламент) The history of censorship took a new turn in response to the development of secular publishing. In 1700, Peter I gave his friend, the Amsterdam merchant Jan Tessing, a monopoly over the printing of books for Russia for fifteen years—the books were printed in Amsterdam, then imported and sold in Russia. At the same time the Petrine government set penalties for trafficking in printed materials from other foreign printers and introduced the requirement that the books had to be published \\"for the glory of the great sovereign\\" and were not to include any \\"abasement of our Imperial Majesty [...] and our state\\". The only censor at this time was the Emperor himself, and the whole printing industry was in the hands of the state. As part of Peter's ecclesiastical reforms, he introduced legislative changes that limited the power of the church in the field of book censorship. This included a provision that forbade monks to own personal writing instruments: Peter decreed in 1701 that \\"Monks in cells do not have the right to write any writings; there should be no ink or paper in the cells, but in the refectory there will be a specified place for writing, with the permission of the head of the monastery\\". Within four years, the first civil (as opposed to ecclesiastical) presses were opened St. Petersburg and Moscow. In 1718 the tsar ordered Feofan Prokopovich to develop a plan for the transformation of church administration on the model of the civil colleges. Two years later, the text of the regulations was presented to Peter. The Emperor made some modifications, and, after a discussion, the Senate unanimously adopted it without amendment. In 1721, a special censorship body, controlled by the church, was organized: the Ecclesiastical Collegium, which at the first meeting was renamed the Holy Synod. The Collegium included three bishops and seven members of the laity. The Ecclesiastical Regulations that governed the Collegium described the organization as being \\"under the [control of the] sovereign monarch and established by the monarch\\". In the same year Peter created a new censorship body, the Izugrafskaya Palata, as a countermeasure against those who were trading \\"pages with various images without permission and without supervision\\" on the Bridge of the Savior in Moscow. The printing of engraved lubki and parsuny (portraits) was prohibited \\"under penalty of a strict response and ruthless fines\\". By 1723 this prohibition extended to \\"improper\\" royal portraits. In tandem with this, an attempt was made to conduct a similar mandatory censorship of books, but only to new publications, not canonical church writings. In addition, Peter put an end to the monopoly of the Church in matters of printing. In 1708 he began to take steps to introduce a civil alphabet, for which he prepared the first drafts. He also invited foreign engravers to Russia to ensure the quality of the illustrations in published books. Paper mills and new printing houses were built. During Peter's reign, the first printed newspaper appeared in Russia—Vedomosti (1702–1728)—and with it came the first censorship of periodicals. Peter personally supervised its publication and many issues saw the light only with the approval of the tsar. Despite the fact that censorship acquired a \\"secular\\" character, the church remained the authority that limited the dissemination of \\"objectionable literature\\"; thus, in 1743, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church banned the importation of books printed in Russian, as well as the translation of foreign books. The \\"free presses\\" in Kiev and Chernigov, mostly dealing in theological literature, also fell under the supervision of the church. ==Elizabeth's reforms== The final separation of religious and secular censorship was brought about by the Empress Elizabeth, who ordered that \\"all printed books in Russia pertaining to the Church and the teachings of the Church should be published with the approbation of the Holy Synod, and civil books and other kinds of books not pertaining to the church, with the approbation of the Governing Senate\\". Nevertheless, according to Zhirkov, Elizabeth's censorship was somewhat disordered; A notable aspect of Elizabeth's reign was her attempts to destroy all traces of the previous short reign of her ousted predecessor, Anna Leopoldovna. Thus, with the decree of October 27, 1742, Elizabeth ordered a review of all books published in the period from October 17, 1740, to November 25, 1741. On September 18, 1748, the Synod resolved that \\"wherever printed church books with one of the mentioned titles are found in someone's possession, these should be gathered ... and, taking out of them only the pages in need of correction, to send them to the printer, where they will be printed, as soon as possible, without delay or slowness\\". The state also strengthened its control of the import of literature from abroad; before publications in foreign languages could be sold in the Empire, they had to undergo a review, in case they mentioned undesirable persons. At the same time the church strengthened its control over lubki pictures. The Synod demanded the control of the publication of all prayerbooks and the painting of icons. A decree on May 10, 1744, stated: \\"in the rural peasant huts icons are blackened and filthy; the faces on them are often not visible; this can lead to ridicule among foreign travelers entering the hut\\". New rules required priests to monitor the cleanliness of icons and direct the peasants in this matter. At the same time, however, intellectual activity had increased: more books were printed, new scholars arose, and the University was established as separate from the Academy. Printing was completely concentrated in the hands of the government, but a clear set of censorship laws still did not exist. ==Paul I's reforms== Emperor Paul I continued the work of Catherine, developing and supporting her censorship initiatives; moreover, he greatly expanded the areas that were subject to state control. A Censorship Board was organized, headed by Prince Alexander Kurakin. In the last years of the eighteenth century, 639 books were confiscated in the Russian Empire, most of them—552 volumes—at the Riga customs office. Authors affected included Goethe, Schiller, Kant, Swift, and many more. ==Censorship during the First World War== thumbright\\"Review of correspondence from the theater of war by military censors\\", an illustration from the journal Priroda i liudi, May 28, 1915 In 1913, according to Reifman, 372 fees were imposed on the press, for a total of 140 thousand rubles, 216 issues were confiscated, 63 editors were arrested, and 20 newspapers were closed down. \\"Full\\" censorship was established only in areas of military actions, and \\"partial\\" censorship outside of those areas. The authorities, however, had the prerogative to determine the locations of military areas.Рейфман, П.С. Часть первая. Российская цензура. Глава восьмая. «Но в октябре его немножечко того...». Из истории русской, советской и постсоветской цензуры. reifman.ru. Проверено 25 августа 2011. Архивировано из первоисточника 24 января 2012. Zhirkov, however, calls this time \\"the flowering of Russian journalism\\", characterized by expanding discussions about freedom of speech and growing discontent with the repressive interior ministry MIA among publishers and journalists. On July 20, 1914, the law \\"Provisional regulations on military censorship\\" was published. The chairman of the Council of Ministers Goremykin commented, \\"The military censorship, examining newspaper material being prepared for publication, should evaluate the latter not only from a narrowly military point of view, but also from the point of view of general policy\\". ==Establishment of Soviet censorship== After the fall of the monarchy and the collapse of the empire, the institution of censorship was preserved, though transformed. In the words of Pavel Reifman: \\"Soviet censorship did not come out of nowhere. It was the successor of the pre-revolutionary Russian censorship, the censorship of a centuries-old autocratic Russia\\". On March 9, 1917, the Provisional Government eliminated the main center of tsarist censorship—the Main Committee on Matters of the Press—and introduced the post of Commissar on Matters of the Press. On May 16 the Bulletin of the Provisional Government published the legislative decree stating: \\"The press and the trade of printed works are free. It is not allowed to apply administrative penalties to the press.\\" In reality, such freedom was never fully achieved. Pyotr Wrangel wrote that with the freedom given to left-wing propaganda, right-wing newspapers were closed down and confiscated. Subsequently, in response to the crisis of the July Days, the government gave the minister of war the right to close publications that called for military rebellion and disobedience on the front, which led to the repression of Bolshevik newspapers. ==NotesBibliography== *Blium, Arlen.

It was released on May 22, 2012 Elverum's own label, P.W. Elverum & Sun. The album was written and produced entirely by Elverum, who recorded it, at his studio the Unknown. Which had a lasting influence on the album's creation. Musically, Clear Moon sees Elverum depart from the distortion-heavy sound of his previous studio album, Wind's Poem in favour of a hypnotic, guitar and synthesizer based sound. To promote the album Elverum, released two singles, \\"House Shape,\\" on March 22, 2012 and \\"Lone Bell,\\" on April 24, 2012. Elverum also embarked on North American/European tours. Clear moon received critical acclaim and was commercially successful. It is the first part of an aesthetically and conceptually connected duo of albums released by Mount Eerie in 2012, the other being Ocean Roar. ==Recording and compostion== From left to right: Nadja, Burzum, Wolves in the Throne Room, Gary Synder and Eihei Dōgen each of whom inspired Phil Elverum. Clear Moon is the first of two albums released by Mount Eerie in 2012, the other being Ocean Roar.Pelly, Jenn. Mount Eerie to Release Two New Albums This Year . Pitchfork Media. 22 February 2012. Retrieved 24 May 2012. Both albums are aesthetically and conceptually connected and represent a \\"transition from day-to-day.\\" Elverum chose not the release Clear Moon and Ocean Roar as a double album as he felt that it was too much for listeners to take in and that such a release would be too similar to his previous studio albums. The album initially came from Elverum experimenting with instruments such as a Gong and Organs and use of the space within sound, during winter months. Most of the aforementioned experimentations were discarded, however some were eventually developed and were placed into 2 distinct groups: Clear Moon and Ocean Roar. The songs that were chosen for Clear Moon were based on if they evoked \\"sharp clarity\\". The album was recorded on analogue equipment from to October 3, 2010 and January 7, 2012 in Anacortes, Washington at Elverum's studio the Unknown. Elverum described the recording process as: Said studio was an overarching influence on the development of the album. Elverum cites Burzum, Eihei Dōgen, Gary Snyder, Cold Mountain and zen poetry as an influence on the album.Stosuy, Brandon. Mount Eerie . Pitchfork Media. 17 May 2012. Retrieved 25 May 2012. Other influences include Popol Vuh, Wolves in the Throne Room, Menace Ruine, and Nadja. == Music and Lyrics == Musically, Clear Moon is a departure from Elverum's previous studio album, the distortion-heavy Wind's Poem; replacing the heavy guitars for \\"ominous rumbling and isolated feedback squalls.\\" Described as \\"lush and expansive,\\" the album is predominantly guitar based, featuring downplayed vocals, droning organs, 4/4 drum beats, chimes and \\"overlapping, hypnotic guitar lines.\\" The album takes inspiration from multiple genres such as, psychedelia, folk, chamber, electronic, ambient and metal. Themes of solitude; which Elverum presents through the imagery of the moon, a recurring motif in the album and his work at large, and maturity are present, with the album seeing Elverum exploring new avenues of his established sound and lyrical content. According to Thomas May the songs on Clear Moon are the most melodically dynamic he has created since The Glow Pt. 2. Tonally, the album is clearer and lighter than Ocean Roar, while still retaining Elverum's typical dark style, and has more extensive use of synthesizer and vocals. The range of tempo is diverse throughout the record. Lyrically, the songs makes reference to existentialism, the artificiality of being an artist, Elverum's relation to nature, his life in Anacortes, Washington and \\"the unexpected moments of clarity that briefly flash through.\\" Narratively, it expands on the story first introduced in the final Microphones studio album, Mount Eerie and sees Elverum traverse the ocean and under go a metaphorical rebirth. Elverum described the album as a \\"resonant lone bell symbol, the glint in the water, the sudden breath.\\" and as an \\"abstract non- narrative diary,\\" exploring his mental state. Philosophical in nature, the quite, melodic, drum and acoustic guitar driven, folk jazz, opening track, \\"Through The Trees Pt. 2\\" has Elverum calmly singing about \\"nature, life and death, [and] the inherent pointlessness of existence.\\" As the song goes on more instrumentation such as additional percussion, piano resonant strings, and bells are added. The song also make use of ambient noise, Elverum's \\"trademark\\" humor and stereo panning with the guitars utilising the left and right speakers. \\"the Place Lives\\" explores humanity's relation and ultimate insignificance to the world at large in a lyrical manner akin to japanese poetry. Instruments such as piano and cymbals are present on the song. Reminiscent of the sound of Earth, the third song \\"the Place I Live\\" is a \\"hymn-like ode to Anacortes\\". It begins with a single bass guitar before synthesizer, electric guitar and vocals by Allyson Foster are soon incorporated, concluding in a near grunge manner. It also features feedback, strings, drums, a \\"heart beat pulse,\\" and double tracking on the guitar. Elverum and her sing in a call-and-response manner. Foster is also featured on \\"Through The Trees Pt. 2\\". The fourth and eightieth tracks, both entitled \\"(something)\\", serve as instrumental interludes, dividing the album into three distinct sections. Elverum and Castrée, who is featured on \\"Over Dark Water\\", performing together in 2006. \\"Lone Bell\\" is a jazz-like noise rock song, composed of processed vocals, piano, saxphone accents, snare drum brushes, bass and \\"metal\\" riffs and two repeating, droning, chords. Utilising space and repetition, in a manner similar to that of Neu! \\"House Shape\\" features a pump organ, detuned acoustic guitars, strings, keyboard, drums and elements of shoegaze. According to Elverum \\"Lone Bell\\" and House Shape\\" are fairly indicative of the sound of Clear Moon. \\"Over Dark Water\\" is a gothic, doom metal, \\"anti-hymn to night and nothingness,\\" which features choral singing from Geneviève Castrée. It is composed of drums, synthesized strings, organ, bass guitar and distorted electric guitar and synthesized bass played in unison. The song concludes with a drum heavy black metal climax. Described as the climax of the album, the cacophonous title track features manipulated—vocoder-like—vocals from Elverum alongside additional vocals from Carson Churchill and Paul Benson. It also features \\"hum-like\\" bass, synthesizer, cymbals, keyboards chants and bells. \\"Yawning Sky\\" is an ambient track with lyrical themes of man's frailty and mortality and keyboards and guitar. \\"(synthesizer)\\" is an instrumental new-age song which Elverum described as an \\"extreme exaggeration of what [the] album is.\\" == Release == The first track released from Clear Moon, \\"House Shape\\" was released on March 22, 2012 on SoundCloud.Fitzmaurice, Larry.

On July 31, 2012, Elverum released his first music video through Pitchfork TV for “The Place Lives”. It is composed of footage of Elverum traversing Oregon woods, brewing a pot of tea, and pouring that tea into the dirt. Stereogum choose it as one of the best videos of the week of its release.  Touring  In support of the album, Elverum embarked on a tour of Europe from March 2012 to April 2012. Elverum was accompanied by Earth and Ô PAON. This was succeeded by a North American tour from August 2012 to October 2012. Elverum was accompanied by Loren Mazzacane Connors and Bouquet as well as a live band consisting of a drummer, a bass player, two guitarists, a keyboardist and three singers. With this tour Elverum made a conscience decision for the local openers to be women as he felt show promoters would disproportionately chose male performers. ==Clear Moon / Ocean Roar (Condensed Versions)== On October 17, 2012, Phil released a 7-inch single entitled \\"Clear Moon / Ocean Roar (Condensed Versions)\\". Side A consists of all the songs on Clear Moon played at once ==Reception== Clear Moon received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave Clear Moon' 7.9 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote that \\"Elverum's meditation on the fact that life goes on within you and without you is thoughtful and thorough in a way few other songwriters could manage\\". David Greenwald of The A.V. Club found that album was \\"meaningful without feeling personal.\\" and that it was a \\"thunderous effort\\". Sean Caldwell of No Ripcord wrote that \\"Elverum’s utilization of metallic and avant-garde elements into what might otherwise be considered a folk album demonstrates a songwriter unlimited by genre and also turned on by creative possibility\\". Jayson Greene of Pitchfork wrote that \\"The album's sound, meanwhile has the misty-but-tactile feeling of a sense memory. Every sound echoes from side to side of the mix, and the effect isn't so much \\"panning\\" as it is a shimmering omnipresence\\". \\"kingsoby1\\" of Sputnikmusic \\"The impressive thing about Clear Moon though is how truly organically rooted it is. The recording is still lo-fi, but not such that there is a lapse in quality. Elverum's recording techniques really enhance the compositions\\". Joe Clinkenbread of Spectrum Culture despite liking the album found it hard to judge the album on its own and described some songs such as \\"Lone Bell\\" and both \\"(Something)\\" songs as underwhelming. The album was also commercially successful selling out its first pressing almost immediately.  Accolades  The Tyee called it one of the best albums of the year. == Legacy == Donovan Farley of Willamette Week chose \\"The Place I Live\\" and \\"Through the Trees Pt. 2\\" as two of Elverum's \\"essential\\" songs. Eric Hill of Exclaim! Included the album in a ranking of Elverum's \\"essential\\" albums. A version of \\"Lone Bell\\" was used as the lead single for Elverum's album \\"Pre-Human Ideas\\". ==Track listingReferences * Official website Category:2012 albums Category:Mount Eerie albums Category:P.

The sensor site regulates the integrator gene, responsible for synthesis of activator RNA. The integrator gene cannot synthesize activator RNA unless the sensor site is activated. Activation and deactivation of the sensor site is done by external stimuli, such as hormones. The activator RNA then binds with a nearby receptor site, which stimulates the synthesis of mRNA at the structural gene. This theory would explain how several different integrator's could be synthesized at the same time.In addition, this theory would explain the pattern of repetitive DNA sequences followed by a unique DNA sequence that exists in genes., ==See also== *Transcriptional regulation *Operon ==References== Category:Genetics Category:Biology theories ","title":"Britten–Davidson model"},{"id":"35927871","text":"Stone Lake is a reservoir in Rio Arriba, New Mexico.

All these formations were answerable to the Laotian Ministry of the Interior of the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane. Constabulary The regular Laotian Police branch, this was the uniformed urban constabulary – also designated Civil Police, Civil Police Force (French: Force de Police Civile) or National Police Corps (French: Corps de Police Nationale) – tasked of providing security and maintaining law and order in the main population centers, including the nation's capital city and the provincial capitals. Gendarmerie Successor of the French colonial 'Indigenous Guard', the paramilitary Laotian Gendarmerie was tasked of patrolling the countryside. Directorate of National Coordination/Frontier Police One particular ephemeral 'branch' of the Laotian security forces that is worth mention is the Directorate of National Coordination or DNC (French: Direction de Coordination Nationale – DCN) paramilitary Security Agency. The DNC begun as a airborne- qualified paramilitary élite police field force closely modelled after the Royal Thai Police (RTP) Police Aerial Resupply Unit (PARU) 'Commandos' and similar in function to the Republic of Vietnam National Police Field Force. The unit had its origins in September 1960, when the PRL command entrusted the then Lieutenant colonel Siho Lamphouthacoul the creation of a 'Special Mobile Group' (French: Groupement Mobile Speciale 1 – GMS 1) composed of two paramilitary special battalions (French: Bataillons Speciales – BS), 11th and 33rd BS.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), p. 105. The new unit soon became involved in Laos' domestic politics during the turbulent period of the early 1960s, with its commander Lt. Col. Siho actively conspiring in Major general Phoumi Nosavan's return to power. Between mid-November and late December 1960, GMS 1 paramilitary battalions participated in the retaking of Vientiane from Captain Kong Le's rebel Neutralist airborne units,Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), p. 37. including the successful capture of the Laotian Aviation (French: Aviation Laotiènne) military runway at Wattay Airfield.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), p. 41.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 17. For his actions in support of his patron Major general Phoumi Nosavan's December 1960 countercoup, Lt. Col. Siho was rewarded with a promotion to Brigadier general and given command of a new paramilitary security organization:Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75 (1989), p. 39. in March 1961 the GMS 1 was combined with Laotian National Army or ANL (military intelligence, psychological warfare, and military police units) and PRL (the civil police force and the immigration service) units to form the DNC.Anthony and Sexton, The War in Northern Laos (1993), p. 98, note 54.Conboy and McCouaig, South- East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 17. Answering only to Maj. Gen. Phoumi, Brig. Gen. Siho and its new security agency quickly took over police duties in Vientiane, exercising near absolute authority in the capital city and began screening the civilian population for Pathet Lao elements and stragglers, which often led to abuses.Sananikone, The Royal Lao Army and U.S. Army advice and support (1981), pp. 72-73. Brig. Gen. Siho's actions cost funding from the U.S. for police training; however, his GMS 1 was considered the most effective paramilitary unit in the Royal Lao Armed Forces (French: Forces Armées du Royaume – FAR).Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), pp. 105-106. Although originally intended to be used in intelligence- gathering and Commando operations, the GMS was primarily kept in Vientiane to support Siho's illicit activities.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 18. In reality, the GMS served principally as Siho's personal bodyguard, gaining a reputation among the civilian populace for both corruption in police duties and military ability as para-commandos.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), p. 113, note 1.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75 (1989), p. 39. One source refers to them as \\"gangsters\\" involved in prostitution, gambling, extortion, sabotage, kidnapping, torture, and political repression.Kuzmarov, Modernizing Repression (2012), pp. 130-131. In 1962 a 30-man contingent was sent to Thailand to attend Airborne and Commando courses manned by Royal Thai Police (RTP) instructors from the Police Aerial Resupply Unit (PARU) at their Camp Narusuan training facilities located near Hua Hin in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 17. Upon their return to Laos, they formed the cadre of a new special battalion, 99 BS, which enabled GMS 1 to attain full regimental strength.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), p. 105. A DNC training depot and an airborne course were established at Phone Kheng in Vientiane, where 11, 33, and 99 BS were all given parachute training.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), pp. 17-18. In 1963 Brig. Gen. Siho appointed Lieutenant colonel Thao Ty as his replacement at the head of the GMS 1 para-commando regiment, while retaining the command of the DNC.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75 (1989), p. 46, Plate G1. On 18 April 1964, Brig. Gen. Siho staged a coup d'état, during which his DNC police units seized the capital's public infrastructure and took control of the country.Castle, At War in the Shadow of Vietnam (1993), p. 64. However, the coup was short-lived, as Brig. Gen. Siho received international criticism and was quickly outranked by Major general Kouprasith Abhay, who succeeded in being nominated Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Lao Army (RLA), whilst his ally Major general Ouane Rattikone became the Commander-in-Chief. In response, Siho changed the GMS 1 designation to 'Border Police' or 'Frontier Police' (French: Police de Frontiers), and kept a low profile.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), p. 123.Anthony and Sexton, The War in Northern Laos (1993), p. 119. On 1–3 February 1965, the DNC which had held de facto control over Vientiane during the previous year, was defeated and disbanded by the RLA in the wake of another coup d'état led by Maj. Gen. Kouprasith Abhay held that same month.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 18.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960–75 (1989), p. 39. Brig. Gen. Siho was forced to exile in ThailandConboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), pp. 124–125. and his DNC 'empire' was quickly divided, with its units being disbanded: the military intelligence, psychological warfare, and military police personnel were returned to the RLA structure whilst some of the policemen were kept in service and renamed the National Police Corps, which was assigned to the Ministry of the Interior of the Royal Lao Government.

In 2008, Goldblatt was convicted of perpetrating acts of rape as well as other sex offenses against women in his acting class. == Biography == Hanan Goldblatt was born in 1941 in Tel Aviv. In his youth Goldblatt studied in the youth village HaKfar HaYarok along with Yisrael Poliakov, and together they performed in various skits in the events and parties. Goldblatt did his mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces in the Nahal troupe, the military band of the Nahal Brigade. After Goldblatt finished his military service he founded the band \\"HaTarnegolim\\" (The Roosters) together with several veteran members of Israeli military bands, under the musical guidance of Naomi Polani. In the early 1960s Goldblatt left the band in favor a theater career. In 1962 Goldblatt participated in the play \\"Root of All Evil\\" (שורש כל רע) at the Hamam Club in Jaffa, in which he played alongside Yoram Gaon, Bomba Tzur, Yosef Carmon and Margalit Ankori. In 1966, Goldblatt played in the Israeli musical film \\"The Flying Matchmaker\\" alongside Mike Burstyn, Mordechai Arnon and Oshik Levy. In the late 1960s Goldblatt established the entertainment trio \\"Shlishyat HaTeomim\\" (שלישיית התאומים) together with Mordechai Arnon and Oshik Levy, which performed until 1970. After the entertainment trio was disbanded, Goldblatt traveled to the United States. At the end of the 1970s, he returned to Israel and joined the staff of the children TV series \\"Carousel\\" (קרוסלה), in which he portrayed the balloon seller \\"Hanan Annan\\". Afterwards Goldblatt participated in the Educational TV series \\"Bli Sodot\\" in which he portrayed the detective \\"Gashash Balash\\". Following the series, the participants of the series raised a theatrical show for children. During the 1980s, Goldblatt wrote the children's play \\"An amazing moment in the carousel\\" (רגע מדהים בקרוסלה) in which he also performed alongside Tzipi Moore and the magician Yoreinu (יוריני). During those years Goldblatt produced a solo album which included only songs he wrote by himself. During this period Goldblatt began directing shows for military bands, and appeared in the movies \\"Melech LeYom Ehad\\" (1982), \\"Ko'ach Meshiha\\" (1988), \\"Irit, Irit\\" (1985), and more. During the 1990s Goldblatt participated in children's educational TV show \\"BeSod HaInyanim\\", and directed the summer TV show \\"Dagi Digitaly\\". Through the years Goldblatt dubbed the voices of various characters in Israeli Hebrew-speaking TV shows and films. In addition to his career as a performing actor, through the years Goldblatt also taught theater in a number of acting schools. In 2004 Goldblatt began hosting the program \\"אדם ומלואו\\" at Channel 33 (after the sudden death of former host Uzi Hitman). In addition, Goldblatt played a cameo role in two episodes of the Israeli sitcom \\"HaPijamot\\" as Micah, the uncle of Alona Tal.  Sex crimes conviction  In August 2005, Goldblatt was arrested on suspicion of acts of rape and sodomy at various acting students, among them several minors, who came to his apartment to study acting. His arrest came after three young women complained to police. Six more women came forward and pressed charges soon afterward, although two of these cases could not be prosecuted as the statute of limitations had expired. Some of the complainants had been minors when the offenses were carried out. Police determined there was sufficient evidence for an indictment, and Goldblatt was indicted in the Tel Aviv District Court on August 21, 2005. Goldblatt denied the accusations and pleaded not guilty, claiming he never forced himself on any of the complainants. On July 3, 2008, following a lengthy trial, Goldblatt was convicted of two counts of rape and sodomy, two counts of indecent assault, committing an indecent act, abuse of authority, and aggravated fraud. He was acquitted of two counts of attempted indecent assault, one count of assault, one count of attempted rape, and one count of fraud.Untitled document - Olive Enterprise PublisherActor Hanan Goldblatt faces six new sexual assault complaintsActor Hanan Goldblatt charged with rape and other sexual offenses The court referred to Goldblatt's assertion, noting: The court noted that \\"the events took place over many years, beginning in 1986 and lasted until 2004\\" and various other women were also offended, but due to the statute of limitations Goldblatt would only be tried on his subsequent offenses. During his trial, Goldblatt noted that in some cases he was frivolous, and that some of the complainants' were offended by him in one way or another. Goldblatt was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment, 2 years probation, and was ordered to pay 25,000 NIS in compensation to two of the victims.Untitled document - Olive Enterprise Publisher Goldblatt appealed to the Supreme Court on his conviction and of the punishment imposed on him. In February 2011 the Supreme Court partially accepted Goldblatt's appeal (as it replaced one of the two rape offenses of which he was convicted with fraud under aggravating circumstances), and cut his prison sentence by one year.פסק- דין בתיק ע\\"פ 10733/08 In 2009, the state began seizing Goldblatt's assets after he refused to pay court-ordered compensation to two his victims, and ignored two demands for 50,000 NIS.Government to force actor to compensate rape victims On November 19, 2012, Goldblatt was granted early release by the Board of Pardons for good behavior in prison and participation in rehabilitation programs.

Berry re-uses jeans, jackets, and other denim clothing to create portraits, landscapes and other unique works. In 2013, Berry was named as one of Art Business News's \\"30 under 30\\" influential artists in the world. Berry was born in Huddersfield, Kirklees, England in 1984, and has lived in Landskrona, Sweden and Sydney, Australia. ==Early career== Berry began experimenting with art while at university and then while working at TMW as an art director. In advertising he worked on brands like the RAF, Nissan, Guinness, British Airways and Talisker whiskey After first experimenting with denim at the end of university, he carried on while working as an art director in London, and then left to work in Australia. Berry started to work full-time on his artwork when he moved to Sweden from Australia. As well as London his artwork has been featured in galleries and Art Fairs across Sweden, Portugal (Calheta Madeira), United States (New Orleans, Miami, Fairmount, Asbury Park, Hamptons, Portland, San Francisco, Paducah). == Medium == Berry works with textile, denim, stating in a Selvedge Magazine interview how 'you can't mix denim like you can paint' The idea for his denim artwork came from a simple observation while at his family home in Huddersfield. His mother knew he was never moving home so had cleared and sorted some of his room. There was a pile of denim where he noticed the different shades of indigo. Berry started to think of his relationship with denim and remembered a time when he was 14 and had to wear chords at a family party, and when he got there everyone was wearing jeans and even now, he says it is the only material he feels comfortable wearing and so it became the only medium he felt comfortable using. Detail of cut and layered denim on a Berry artwork His process involves cutting, stitching, and gluing various shades of denim to provide contrast and shadow. Even at touching distance, many viewers don't realise that they are looking at many layers, and shades, of denim jeans. Many people compare it to Photorealism, but just with denim, not paint.'your first impression is that of an indigo coloured oil painting, or a photograph in blue.' In reality, Berry's pieces are very layered and three dimensional, something that gets lost once viewed online or in print. Many people can't believe they are made of denim. Fellow artist Colin Fraser has said that Berry \\"uses denim as a painter uses paint, but with a difference: he makes what I call ‘denImages’. The entire surface of these works is made from denim. The scissors are Ian's paint brush and he handles them with virtuosity.\\" In each work, the artist carefully selects denim samples that he cuts, trims, tears and then glues to create works of depth and space. This depth pushes the boundaries of conventional central perspective by building up layers that reach out from the picture plane and draw us in to look again. The Vice Creators Project wrote he 'develops his work by selecting individual pieces of denim and certifying each is a unique wash. Afterward, all the many denim parts are layered to produce a three-dimensional collage effect. All together, the pieces collate into an established image from afar, bringing together light, color, and many of the elements of classic painting style.' Berry has a studio in Poplar, East London where he has thousands of pairs of jeans organised in a palette from light to dark, he gets many donations from brands, denim mills, as well as looking in charity shops, vintage store yet start with his own jeans, then his friends, then their friends. Now he gets packages from around the world It is often said that denim is the most democratic of fabrics, and he really feel like that he can tap into this, and he can communicate with people as there is something about the denim that draws them in, even if they find the work unusual, it is still something familiar. You don't need to be a connoisseur to enjoy denim, anyone can wear it he says. While it started as a very rural material, 'I feel now it is a very urban one, and the layers of urban life is what interests me and what I portray, so what better material is there to depict our contemporary life, than with the material of our time.' As he portrays the changes in our cities, often depicting places that are closing down or at risk of with using denim he is adding a comment on the fading fabric of the urban environment\\".[37][1] While many reports talk about it being made of only denim, Berry said \\"It is not about it being about denim. It's just my medium. Yes, it helps, but it's not about the material foremost. I see it as very much an urban material now. I love urban society and all the layers and depth within it and for me, what better way to portray contemporary life and issues than with the material of our time.\\" Berry's pieces are so detailed many talk of his work in terms of photorealism. Levis unzipped said 'from a distance, indigo's high contrast and gradient fades create a stunning illusion of depth, light, and ultimately, photorealism.' Berry does base his work of photography, photographs that he took and set up the scene. Berry said “Admittedly at the beginning I often used parts like the pockets and seams to kind of say, 'Hey look, it's denim,' but now I use all those parts in a way to not show it's denim. Sometimes, this has been too successful though. [It's] maybe a compliment when people mistake it for a photo-realistic painting, but often people don't get to the ‘aha!’ factor when the penny drops—it's denim!\\" Fiona McCarthy of the Sunday Times said 'one of a number of artists fusing the slightly loftier world of art with the often (unjustifiably) denigrated world of craft. Like Tracey Emin, Grayson Perry and Chuck Close before him, Berry is pushing the boundaries of Textiles as a medium, producing photorealistic denim collages depicting everyday scenes. == Work == Berry lives in London and portrays the city he is surrounded by depicting the changing urban life He also had done a body of work on USA urban living with the American Jean[67] which was based mainly on New York. Berry had seen that in many cities, the places that were meeting places for the community were changing, closing down for bigger development or left empty. Pubs were closing down, launderettes left empty, diners being replaced. He often depicted the places with scenes of loneliness. Berry's work has also often been talked about in the context of Eco-Art, Upcycling and Recycling Berry is a Contemporary Artist but his work has also been talked about in the context of Arte Povera, Collage, and also with his medium being denim Textile Art, Fiber Art, and while not using quilting techniques many quilters follow Berry and he is often mentioned in that context.  Behind Closed Doors  Berry working on Behind Closed Doors Berry's 2016 London solo show was a success. The gallery had said \\"it's easy to get carried away with the novelty of the medium and forget that, first and foremost, Ian Berry is an artist with something to say. Well, in this two-part show he is speaking loud and clear.\\" Art Critic Tabish Khan wrote it was a top 5 London Exhibition for Fad magazine 'What Berry can do with denim is astonishing. He creates multi-layered paintings, his attention to detail is superb and this exhibition is an impressive feat' The scenes are the ubiquitous life of London residents that form the creative foundation for a series of poignant pieces of art made of azure and bright navy swatches of denim. Framed within the lonely enclaves of home life, the settings of many of the graceful, hyper-detailed portraits are fixated on an isolated interior. Wide, cinematic tableaus of a woman just waking up to bright sunlight is mirrored in two other similarly evocative visuals of a sleeping girl in a rumpled camisole. The collages of day-to-day life filled out in the medium of denim portrayed a perfect life, almost like a page from an interior design magazine however the lonely figure offered a melancholic view that materialistic possession doesn't make a happy life.  My Beautiful Laundrette  By the end of the 1970s, there were around 12,500 Launderettes in the country. That number has now slumped to 3,000, with 450 in London. During one photoshoot, Berry went back to a launderette he had only visited on a recce the week before only to discover it boarded up. Berry portrayed the interior of launderettes in Crisp Street Market, Poplar, Bow, Ladbroke Grove and Holloway Road in London. The body of work was a comment on the declining launderettes and what they meant to the community they served. The title of the show was borrowed from a film based on the screenplay of Hanif Kureishi, and shot in the mid 80s. My Beautiful Laundrette, directed by Stephen Frears, captured a mood London at the time, the cultural tensions and the economic change but central to the film was the laundrette, one scene depicts a crowd of customers gathering outside, impatient to be let in. Laundrettes are now no longer like this. The 'showstopper' was the installation however. Where people could interact and take photos and selfies and sit down and pretend they were waiting for their laundry. Berry made with set builder Luke Aan de Wiel a life-sized denim launderette with washing machines, dryers, tiled floors and walls, posters and instructions all made in denim.  Secret Garden  This interactive installation, titled the Secret Garden, was a piece that the viewer could walk through, on top of a denim path that was filled with various flowers and plants, from roses to cacti, wisteria to chrysanthemum that hung down like a trellis. It was shown at the Children's Museum of the Arts New York in 2017. The installation for the Bridge Project was inspired by thinking of childhood. Immediately Berry thought of playing outside at his Yorkshire hometown. He believed children play less outside and interact and look less at the nature around. Children have new technology with iPads. He had stated that while he was making the Behind Closed Doors piece, he was thinking of a woman with a perfect home but the children had grown up, leaving the nest empty. The home depicted in the picture, there was a garden at the back. It made him think of the garden being full of the laughter of kids playing once upon a time and now the empty nest. As children would come to the garden in denim with their parents he wanted them to look at being in a garden differently and as in New York seek out a Community Garden together. He wanted to draw attention to the community gardens as a meeting place and a location to enjoy being outside. Berry also used some of the last fabric that the USA had produced to make the installation. After 112 years of production, Cone Mills, a historic denim mill in America, announced it would close its White Oak plant in North Carolina. As the last major manufacturer of selvage denim in the United States, its final products served as relics for newer generations to learn about in this exhibition. Berry at Tonello It was also used as an example of sustainability. Berry worked with Tonello, the Italian laundry manufacturer and technology company. He used their laser machines in this work to cut many of the pieces made for the trellis, and used the ozone washing to colour the denim. These are now some of the new tools for the denim industry. In the opening to the garden, Berry shows a cotton plant and explained that this is where the jeans we wear first comes from. The headline was from plants to pants, to plants again.  Record Store  In 2013 Berry turned the gallery into a vintage record store. It was in response to the changing High Street and the loss of a lot of independent Record Stores in the UK, where many in the music community and like minded people would meet. The whole of the gallery window was turned into a vinyl store. It was filled with records, tee shirts, records and framed albums. It wasn't just any albums however, they were all chosen for their connection to the denim story. Rock and Roll music and denim have gone together through time. With Elvis to heavy metal, Bob Dylan, hippies and punk, the pioneers of youth music have worn jeans. Many of the most famous album covers of all time feature this artisan fabric: the Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, and Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA for example. In 1975, the musicians who hung around a New York bar called CBGB started to crop their hair and rip their jeans. The look was spotted by musician and designer Malcolm McLaren, who adapted it into punk back in London with the Sex Pistols. Berry was portraying much of this history. He spoke with Robert Elms about the albums, who he had met most of the people and bands depicted in the albums. Warhol said of the denim: “I wish I could invent something like blue jeans. Something to be remembered for.” Of course, he went on to design the jeans close-up cover for the Stones’ Sticky Fingers album. In 2018, Berry brought the Record Store back together in the US to make a whole high street, including the launderette (changed to Laundromat) and the Secret Garden (changed to a community garden) together with a gallery showing some of Berry's pieces. Newsstand Other well known works include the Newsstand installation and the CCTV Surveillance piece. == Portraits == Berry has made many portraits but has turned down most. He does portraits where the person has to have a connection to denim, and be respected and not just celebrity.  Ayrton Senna  Berry was commissioned to make a portrait of the late Formula One racing driver, Ayrton Senna, in 2015 to commemorate the 20th year of his passing. He immortalized Ayrton in denim, including jeans from the family of Ayrton who look after his legacy with the Instituto Ayrton Senna. The piece was unveiled in São Paulo, Brazil before the Grand Prix to the press and family and was met with positive reviews. The piece subsequently traveled around the world including to Amsterdam, Birmingham, Silverstone, Singapore, Rio, Barcelona Grand Prix, Turin at Adplog, at Williams, Hungary and Monaco Respected Motorsport journalist Maurice Hamilton said 'I'm not in the least surprised that Ayrton's sister, Viviane, found it difficult to contain her emotions when she saw the work for the first time during an official unveiling last year. And the nice thing is that the entire project has been associated with the Ayrton Senna Foundation, for which Viviane and the family continue to do such good work in the name of underprivileged children in Brazil. There's a short but moody video on YouTube showing the unassuming and hugely talented Berry at work.' At one Event in Birmingham there was an emotional showing and presentation of the people by many who knew Ayrton closely like David Coulthard, who replaced Ayrton in the team after he died in 1994, Allan McNish who had been his test driver as well as a former F1 driver and David Brabham who was in the same Imola race when Ayrton died. Paul Weaver at the Guardian called it 'Berry's finest creation' and called the piece 'Stunning'. He also spoke how Berry didn't sign the piece 'as it wasn't about me, its about Ayrton' but Ayrton's mother insisted he signed it. Berry liked the idea that it was the families jeans that made up his image, as they are the ones that are carrying on his legacy with the charity and also licensing and protecting his image. He also spoke how he had worked with denim brands, and was often seen in denim but what he especially loved is that like denim, Ayrton transcended so many people and demographics, but was ultimately a man of the people and denim represented that well.  Debbie Harry  In 2013 Luxxotica launched a new Ray Ban Wayfarer, all made in denim and worked with Berry. At a launch party in New York Blondie performed and as part of the show a portrait of its leading lady, Debbie Harry was unveiled. Berry wanted to do the commission as Debbie Harry was a big part of the CBGB bands down the Bowery in the 70's. It was this group of bands that changed the history of music, but also denim. Debbie harry was also one of the first to be seen to wear double denim The portrait got rave reviews and reactions from the media on the opening night. Berry became friends with Blondie's Guitarist Tommy Kessler and made his jacket that he has worn on stage since 2013 including at glastonbury, UK.  Giorgio Armani  Berry was commissioned to do a portrait of Giorgio Armani for a birthday gift from the Creative Director.  Lapo Elkann  Berry made a portrait of Lapo Elkann that now hangs above his desk. Elkann, is an Italian entrepreneur and grandson of Gianni Agnelli, the former controlling CEO and controlling shareholder of Fiat Automobiles. He is a big denim fan and had made a denim upholstery for a Diesel-edition Fiat 500 as well as a Smeg fridge all in denim. Vanity Fair magazine listed Elkann in its International Best Dressed List in 2008, and added him to its Best Dressed Hall of Fame in 2009. In an article with DuJour in 2013 Elkann said it was one of his 'prized possessions'.  Eunice Olumbide MBE  Berry made a portrait of his friend Eunice Olumbide in the year she got her MBE. Olumbide MBE is a Scottish supermodel, actress and curator. She is one of the first black Scottish models dedicating her life to arts and charity. Berry made the piece for her Switch exhibition. The Exhibition was linked with Fuel Poverty Action a grassroots campaign taking action against mammoth fuel bills and working towards an affordable, sustainable and democratic energy system.  Other  Berry's early works have featured Icons of Denim such as James Dean and Marilyn Monroe, in fact one of the first pieces he did was of Debbie Harry, and he stated it was nice in later years to get the actually commission to do her portrait. Berry also went on to work with The Estate of James Dean and the James Dean Gallery to create a mural for Dean's hometown of Fairmount, Indiana. In the early years Berry did the portraits of the people because of their connection in the denim story. == Education == Berry believes in art and creativity in education and has given a lot of time to schools, colleges and universities. He has given lectures all around the world and as well as the UK has spoke in the USA Sweden Brazil, Holland as well as giving workshops Many schools do projects on Ian Berry and children are inspired to make works in denim like him. Many education magazines have featured Berry's work including Scholastic, arts&activities;, Science & Vie as well as National Geographic in Brazil and BBC Newsround in the UK. Berry was so committed to this cause that he exhibited at the Children's Museum of Art New York where he showed the Secret Garden in 2017. In 2018 he travelled the United States and gave lectures in many schools and when he found that many students were inspired to do his work, but didn't have the correct equipment so Berry arranged for many companies to step in and donate tools like scissors, denim and rotary cutters. Many Children, parents and teachers send him examples of their work inspired from him. Most of Berry's family are or were teachers. == Denimu == Berry dropped the Denimu name he had used at the beginning of his career == References  * Official Website * Denimu on Twitter Category:People from Poplar, London Category:Living people Category:Pseudonymous artists Category:British expatriates in Sweden Category:People from Huddersfield Category:British textile artists Category:Artists from Yorkshire Category:British contemporary artists Category:Collage artists Category:Arte Povera Category:Quilters Category:British installation artists Category:1984 births ","title":"Denimu"},{"id":"35928161","text":"Arthur Thomas (December 10, 1864 - August 8, 1895) was an American baseball catcher and first baseman in the late 19th century, who played for predecessor teams to the Negro leagues.

It tells the story of one place, the Leicestershire village of Kibworth, throughout the whole of English history from the Roman era to modern times.BBC official site The series focuses on tracing history through ordinary people in an ordinary English town, with current residents of Kibworth sharing what they know of their ancestors and participating in tracing their history. A four-part version aired on PBS in the United States in 2012.PBS official site ==Episode one: Romans to Normans== With the help of the local people and using archaeology, landscape, language and DNA, Michael uncovers the lost history of the first thousand years of the village, featuring a Roman villa, Anglo-Saxons and Vikings and graphic evidence of life on the eve of the Norman Conquest. ==Episode two: Domesday to Magna Carta== Wood's unique portrait moves on to 1066 when the Normans build a castle in Kibworth. He reveals how occupation affected the villagers from the gallows to the alehouse, and shows the medieval open fields in action in the only place where they still survive today. With the help of the residents, he charts events in the village leading to the people's involvement in the Civil War of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. Intertwining the local and national narratives, this is a moving and informative picture of one local community through time. ==Episode three: The Great Famine and the Black Death== Wood's fascinating tale reaches the catastrophic 14th century. Kibworth goes through the worst famine in European history, and then, as revealed in the astonishing village archive in Merton College Oxford, two thirds of the people die in the Black Death. Helped by today's villagers – field walking and reading the historical texts – and by the local schoolchildren digging archaeological test pits, Wood follows stories of individual lives through these times, out of which the English idea of community and the English character begin to emerge. ==Episode four: Peasants' Revolt to Tudors== Wood's gripping tale moves on to dramatic battles of conscience in the time of the Hundred Years' War. Amazing finds in the school archive help trace peasant education back to the 14th century, and show how the people themselves set up the first school for their children. Some villagers join in a rebellion against King Henry V, while others rise to become middle-class merchants in the textile town of Coventry. On the horizon is the Protestant Reformation, but the rise of capitalism and individualism sow the seeds of England's future greatness. ==Episode five: Henry VIII to the Industrial Revolution== The tale reaches the dramatic events of Henry VIII's Reformation and the battles of the English Civil War. The programme tracks Kibworth's 17th-century Dissenters, travels on the Grand Union Canal, and looks at Anna Laetitia Barbauld, an 18th-century feminist writer from Kibworth who was a pioneer of children's books. The story of a young highwayman exiled to Australia comes alive as his living descendants come back to the village to uncover their roots. Lastly, the Industrial Revolution comes to the village with framework knitting factories, changing the village and its people forever. ==Episode six: Victoria to the Present Day== In this final episode, helped by today's villagers Michael uncovers the secret history of a Victorian village more colourful than even Dickens could have imagined. Recreating their penny concerts of the 1880s, visiting World War I battlefields with the school and recalling the Home Guard, local land girls and the bombing of the village in 1940, the series finally moves into the brave new world of 'homes fit for heroes' and the villagers come together to leave a reminder of their world for future generations. ==Other media== A book () and DVD (ASIN B00860YHSM) followed the series. ==See also== * The Village (2013 TV series) * Ulverton, a 1992 novel by Adam Thorpe ==ReferencesCategory:2010 British television series debuts Category:2010 British television series endings Category:BBC television documentaries about history ","title":"Michael Wood's Story of England"},{"id":"35928226","text":"Jannatabad (), also Jannatābād, is a village in Shusef Rural District, Shusef District, Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

It was initially released as a free Adobe Flash- based browser game, and later as a Facebook app. This version was developed by Ben Perez, Michael Block, and Ryan Wiemeyer. The game uses the Unity game engine. An expanded version, The Organ Trail: Director's Cut, was released on mobile devices in August 2012. That same month the Director's Cut was also posted on Steam Greenlight; after receiving enough support, it was released on Steam for Windows, Mac, and Linux on March 19, 2013. The expanded version was developed by Michael Block and Ryan Wiemeyer, founders of the company The Men Who Wear Many Hats. Director's Cut has sold 429,192 copies as of August 9, 2013. Most of the copies were sold on Humble Bundle, Steam and iOS. Most profits were made on the Steam and iOS platforms. ==Gameplay== In The Organ Trail, players must cross a post-apocalyptic United States in an car in order to reach a sanctuary free of zombies, called Safe Haven. Players must manage their limited resources, including food, ammunition, medicine, scrap, money, and fuel for their vehicle, in order to complete their journey and keep everyone in their party alive and healthy. At the beginning players can choose from a number of characters to play as, including a cop from Kentucky, a clerk from New Jersey, or a lawyer from Miami. Each character has different bonuses in gameplay. For example, the cop will offer more hours for the player to scavenge for supplies at the beginning of the game but will earn fewer points if the player beats the game, while the lawyer will give the player the least amount of time to scavenge for supplies but will earn the most points. In Complete Edition, the player can unlock different character skins, including Ash from Evil Dead, Ripley from the Alien franchise, George A. Romero and Mad Max. There are more references to other games and films, such as Left 4 Dead, the Resident Evil franchise, E.T, Night Of The Living Dead, Zombieland, Planet Terror, and more. Characters can be named and can contain Easter eggs. For example, naming a character \\"Chuck Norris\\", might trigger random events such as \\"Chuck Norris did a spinning kick in the car and broke his leg\\" and \\"Chuck Norris headbutts a piece of wood for some reason\\". Naming 2 or more characters \\"Chuck Norris\\" might trigger an event when Chuck Norris sees a nuke dropping and drags it in space (however, the character will be gone) Every hour (10-5 seconds in game) a special event might happen, such as getting surrounded by zombies, characters experiencing different events in the car (negative and positive), seeing tombstones in the distance (the player will be given the choice of investigating it or not. Investigating it triggers the event of finding supplies near the grave or a zombie emerging from the grave), negative events to the car (for example, accidentally popping the tire or the muffler breaking) and many more. Certain events can cause death to another character (such as when a bandit grabs a character). The player might be chased by a bike gang (this mostly occurs when leaving a settlement), a bandit gang(random chance of occurrence while on the road) and a fighting a bandit king (this occurs mainly towards the end of the game and to trigger this, a character must be lost. Killing the bandit king will reward the player with a new vehicle). Characters might get sicknesses like cholera, typhoid, measles, and more. Different vehicles exist. The first, a station wagon, is unlocked by default, the second, a SUV which bears strikingly resemblance to Zombieland, is unlocked when getting to Safe Haven,the third, a sedan which bears strikingly resemblance to the green Jaguar in Shaun Of The Dead, is unlocked when completing the game on Suicide difficulty, the fourth, a muscle car, is unlocked when the player unlocks all the skulls in Endless mode and the fifth, a UFO, is unlocked when beating the aliens at Area 51. Each vehicle differs from another in means of reliability, speed, and durability. Eventually, on the road, if the player does not get to a town in time, the car might break down and requires scrap to repair. The player can trade with traders for supplies. The game uses real-life cities as landmarks between Safe Haven and the starting point.Some examples include Indianapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington D.C, Area 51, Dallas and more.Some landmarks are simply marked as \\"Castle\\", \\"Gas Station\\", \\"Farmland\\", \\"Dump Site\\", \\"Satellite Field\\", and more.Player are given the ability to see what car upgrades/skills and light or decent supplies are available at the next landmark, giving the player a choice where to go next. On the map, radiation zones are marked with green.These areas should generally be avoided, exceptions include getting the UFO at Area 51 and more advantages in terms of upgraded, because they will give the player and the group radiation sickness. While reaching a landmark, the player arrives in a town. In the town, the player can buy supplies and, depending on the location, they can either buy car parts, repair and upgrade the car or can get skills.The player can also talk to strangers, giving them tips, sell supplies for money, scavenge supplies, rest and heal themselves and party members. For supplies, the player can take jobs in towns, such as recovering an item from a cemetery and roads, killing bandits and defending the town from a horde. The player is paid with supplies such as tires, mufflers, money, medkits, fuel, and ammo. The zombies get more active at night, therefore increasing danger.There are 4 stages of zombie activity: Low, Medium, High and Deadly. These can influence the number of zombies in scavenging and scenarios. Special zombies exist. There is a shambling, melting zombie which leaves radioactive sludge behind and appear only in radiated zones. A tall zombie which sprints for the player but is stunned when the player looks at him is encountered randomly on scavenging missions. Another special is a fat zombie which takes 2 shots to kill, as opposed to normal zombies taking only one, is commonly encountered. A half-zombie which crawls at high speed is rarer than the fat ones but still pretty common; they're most commonly encountered at tombstones and take only one shot to kill. The normal zombies are most common, walk slowly and take one shot to die. In missions and while scavenging, players are able to select one from three weapons before starting. The first is a single shot rifle with quick reload, the second is a three shot shotgun but has a slower reload and the last is a four-quick-shots pistol with same reload speed as the shotgun. The only scenario where the player is not able to select one of the three is when a zombie crawls out of a tombstone; they will automatically be given the rifle. In Endless mode, players do not have a specific target to reach. Instead they have 2 landmark options from which they are able to select. As usual, the player are able to select their skin, car and name the characters before starting. However, instead of choosing how much hours to spend on scavenging before finishing the tutorial as in the campaign, players can choose \\"sets\\" of supplies, skills, and car upgrades. There are 2 sets of modifiers, one column increasing the player's point, albeit having a negative effect and the other column decreasing the player's points albeit having a positive effect. In both campaign and endless, while scavenging, the player may encounter bosses. The first boss is a bear which doesn't die but bullets temporarily slow him down and can be encountered randomly while scavenging. The second boss are aliens in UFOs and can be encountered in Area 51 while scavenging. Upon beating the bosses, the player will unlock the UFO vehicle. The third boss is a biker gang which will typically occur when the player leaves a settlement. At least 10 bikers will spawn and try to shoot at the car and they can be killed by crashing into them;the car does not take damage. The fourth boss are a horde of zombie deer and will occur randomly while on the road. The player must avoid them to not take damage. The fifth boss are bandits which have a small chance of occurrence and occurs randomly while on the road. The player must survive 30 seconds avoiding obstacles to not be slowed down to be captured by the bandits. The sixth boss are the Bandit Boss, which is very rare to occur. This plays like a normal scavenging mission, but must kill the Bandit Boss and a few of his henchmen. This occurs towards the end of the game but the player must lose a character.When defeating the Bandit Boss, he is revealed to be the lost character and the player is given the choice to shoot him or not. Regardless of the choice, the player will unlock the Interceptor from Mad Max. The endings are different depending on the difficulty. On Easy and Normal, upon reaching Save Haven, they must collect 6 fuel cans to power to generator to open the bridge, therefore granting access to Safe Haven. On Difficult and Suicide, the player must collect the cans, 8 this time, but upon powering the generator, a giant squid-like creature will appear out of Safe Haven. This boss battle has two phases: the first is the player driving while avoiding the squid's tentacles. The second is to shoot the squid while also shooting its tentacles. ==Director's Cut== The Organ Trails popularity led its developers to start a Kickstarter to fund a \\"director's cut\\" of the game based on fan feedback and suggestions. The Director's Cut features a number of changes to the original game, including a customizable protagonist instead of the above preset characters, \\"choose-your-own-adventure\\" style random encounters, boss fights, in-game achievements and online leaderboards. While the original game has been described as a \\"1:1 pure parody\\" of The Oregon Trail, the developers decided The Director's Cut should stand on its own as a title that pushed beyond the source material. In contrast to the original game which is free to play, The Director's Cut is a commercial product. It was released for iOS and Android devices on August 9, 2012. It debuted for Linux, Mac, PC and Android via The Humble Bundle. ==Reception== The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on all platforms except the PC version, which received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. ==References* * * Category:2010 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Browser games Category:Facebook games Category:Flash games Category:Freeware games Category:IOS games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Ouya games Category:Parody video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Survival video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Zombie video games Category:Unity (game engine) games ","title":"Organ Trail"},{"id":"35928256","text":"Garuk or Goruk () may refer to: * Garuk, Hormozgan * Garuk-e Bala, Hormozgan Province * Garuk-e Pain, Hormozgan Province * Garuk, Kahnuj, Kerman Province * Garuk, Narmashir, Kerman Province * Garuk, Ravar, Kerman Province * Garuk, Irandegan, Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province * Garuk, Eskelabad, Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province * Garuk, South Khorasan ","title":"Garuk"},{"id":"35928265","text":"Gaviad (, also Romanized as Gavīād) is a village in Shusef Rural District, Shusef District, Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

From the service provider's perspective the use of the coax portion of the network is transparent to EPON protocol operation in the optical line terminal (OLT) thereby creating a unified scheduling, management, and quality of service (QoS) environment that includes both the optical and coax portions of the network. The IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Working Group initiated a standards process with the creation of an EPoC Study Group in November 2011. EPoC adds to the family of IEEE 802.3 Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) standards. ==Standards== The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.3 standards committee published standards for a symmetric 1Gbit/s EPON network, originally published in September 2004 as IEEE 802.3ah-2004, and a 10Gbit/s EPON network permitting symmetric 10Gbit/s and asymmetric 10Gbit/s downstream 1Gbit/s upstream, originally published in June 2009 as IEEE 802.3av-2009 also known as 10G-EPON. A Call For Interest (CFI) group process was initiated in May 2011 by Broadcom after receiving requests for initiating EPoC standardization in IEEE from Chinese cable operators and then also by North American cable operators. Many companies became involved in the CFI creation and consensus process. According to the CFI materials, representatives from the following companies supported the formation of the study group:\\"EPON PHY for Coax - Call For Interest Presentation Alcatel- Lucent, Aurora Networks, Bright House Networks, Broadcom, Cogeco Cable Inc., CableLabs, Comcast, Cox Networks, Dell, Fiberhome Telecommunication Technologies, Harmonic Inc., Hewlett-Packard, High Speed Design, Huawei, Neophotonics, PMC-Sierra, Qualcomm, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Technical Working Committee of China Radio & TV Association, Time Warner Cable, Wuhan Yangtze Optical Technologies Co. Ltd., and ZTE. In November 2011, the \\"EPON PHY for Coax\\" CFI was presented to the IEEE 802.3 Working Group plenary and the creation of the EPoC Study Group (SG) was approved. In May 2012, the EPoC Study Group completed its draft Project Authorization Request (PAR), its \\"5 Criteria\\" responses, and a set of objectives for further work. These materials require review and approval by the IEEE 802.3 Working Group, the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee (LMSC), and the IEEE New Standards Committee (NesCom). Upon receiving approval, the EPoC Study Group will transition to the EPoC Task Force (TF) and then will begin its work that leads directly to creating the draft standard. On 30 August 2012, the IEEE-SA approved the PAR permitting the IEEE 802.3 Working Group to charter the IEEE P802.3bn Task Force.\\"IEEE P802.3bn EPoC PHY Task Force home page ==Architecture== IEEE 802.3 standards apply to Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer and Physical sublayer specifications, and their respective management, only. For EPON, IEEE 802.3 defined separately a service provider MAC and PHY called an Optical Line Terminal (OLT) and a subscriber MAC and Physical sublayer called an Optical Network Unit (ONU). The medium interconnecting the OLT with the ONU is a fiber optical cable in which two wavelengths are defined for full-duplex operation, one for continuous downstream channel operation (OLT transmitting to one or more ONUs), and another for upstream burst mode channel operation that permits OLT-controlled time-division sharing of the upstream channel amongst all ONUs on the PON. Similarly, the EPoC architecture consists of a service provider Coax Line Terminal (CLT) and a subscriber Coax Network Unit (CNU). The intent is the CLT MAC sublayer is the same as the OLT MAC sublayer and the CNU MAC sublayer is the same as the ONU MAC sublayer. The optical physical sublayer and fiber optical media have been replaced with a coax physical sublayer and a coaxial distribution network (CxDN) media. For the coax media, downstream and upstream communication channels utilize Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum as assigned and made available by a cable operator on the coax network. In the case of a coax network, the Medium Dependent Interface (MDI) is typically the industry standard \\"F\\" connector. IEEE 802.3 standards do not describe implementations or system solutions. The use of OLT, CLT, ONU, and CNU in the standard will apply to their respective MAC and Physical sublayers only. ==System Models== Two system models have been under discussion in the IEEE 802.3 EPoC Study Group.\\"IEEE 802.3 EPoC Study Group home page The first is the direct output of the IEEE 802.3 EPoC standardization effort: i.e., a CLT with one more CNUs interconnected by a coaxial distribution network. The second is enabled by a future EPoC standard, but is outside the scope of the IEEE 802.3 Working Group. That is a traditional EPON deployment consisting of an OLT device and one or more ONU devices attached to the same PON with one or more new devices referred to functionally as an optical to Coax Media Converter (CMC) that attach one side to the PON and the other to a CxDN with their associated CNUs, where the communications over the coax media follows the EPoC standard. The intent of the second model is to permit an OLT to transparently manage the collection of ONU and CNU devices in a similar fashion; e.g. unified EPON management, scheduling, and quality of service. This second model is viewed as extending an Ethernet PON onto coax. Given the likely shorter reach of coax, if CLT's are developed they are likely to be used in FTTB applications with the CLT in the building with EPoC to tenants. A second possibility is an outside plant (e.g. strand mounted or cabinet based) CLT which would be FTTC. ==References== Category:Ethernet Category:Network access Category:Physical layer protocols Category:Local loop ","title":"EPON Protocol over Coax"},{"id":"35928296","text":"Khorram () is a village in Shusef Rural District, Shusef District, Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

The Palacio Bruna is a palace located on the southern edge of the Parque Forestal in Santiago, Chile. The three story building has an Italian Renaissance character. It is entirely surrounded by a frieze decorated with garlands and putti, and was constructed between 1916 and 1921 to serve as the residence for the saltpeter magnate Augusto Bruna. Julio Bertrand, a Chilean architect, was designated as responsible for its design and construction. He died before seeing the palace completed and his friend Pedro Prado took over and completed the building. Industrial-scale production of synthetic sodium nitrate and the resulting collapse of the saltpeter price led to the bankruptcy of Bruna's business. In 1921, as a consequence of this event, the palace had to be offered for sale. It was purchased by the U.S. ambassador to Chile, never having been occupied by Augusto Bruna. It housed the American Embassy until 1962 and then served as the U.S. consulate in Santiago from 1962 to 1994. Since 1995, the building has housed the Chilean National Commerce Chamber. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Santiago ","title":"Palacio Bruna"},{"id":"35928435","text":"The 1976–77 NBA season was Indiana's first season in the NBA and tenth season as a franchise.1976–77 Indiana Pacers ==Offseason== Draft picks { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 2C3294; color:#fcc624\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 2C3294; color:#fcc624\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 2C3294; color:#fcc624\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 2C3294; color:#fcc624\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 2C3294; color:#fcc624\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 2C3294; color:#fcc624\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  8  Wil Jones†  PF   Albany State } †In the 1976 ABA Dispersal Draft, ABA and NBA teams selected players that were on the Kentucky Colonels and the Spirits of St. Louis, the two ABA teams that were not included in the ABA–NBA merger in 1976.

From 2012 until February 2018, the language policy of Ukraine was also based on the law (before 2012, the 1989 law \\"On the languages in the Ukrainian SSR\\" was in force). The Ukrainian language is the State language of Ukraine. According to the article 10 of the Constitution of Ukraine, the State has to ensure the comprehensive development and functioning of the Ukrainian language in all spheres of social life throughout the entire territory of Ukraine. Other languages spoken in Ukraine are guaranteed constitutional protection. Russian is recognized as the language of a national minority. A 2012 law, called the law \\"On the principles of the State language policy\\" gave the status of regional language to Russian and other minority languages. It allowed the use of minority languages in courts, schools and other government institutions in areas of Ukraine where the national minorities exceed 10% of the population. The law was used mostly in Ukraine's southern and eastern regions, where predominant or significant parts of the population speak Russian as their first language. Three minor settlements did the same for Hungarian, Moldovan and Romanian. Ukrainian remained the only official country-wide language. Introduction of the law was supported by the governing Party of regions and opposed by the opposition parties. According to its opponents the law undermined and supplanted the role of the Ukrainian language, and violated Article 10 of the Ukrainian Constitution.Висновок Комітету Верховної Ради України з питань культури і духовності, rada.gov.ua The bill was adopted amid fistfights in the Ukrainian Parliament building on 3 July 2012, and the opposition said that the procedure of adopting the law was not respected. The law came into force on 10 August 2012. Since then various cities and regions of Ukraine declared Russian a regional language in their jurisdictions. Other cities and regions declared their opposition to this law. Immediately after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, on 23 February 2014, the Ukrainian Parliament voted to repeal the law. This decision was vetoed by the acting President Oleksandr Turchynov, who instead ordered drafting of a new law to \\"accommodate the interests of both eastern and western Ukraine and of all ethnic groups and minorities.\\" However, in October 2014 the Constitutional Court of Ukraine started reviewing the constitutionality of the law, and on 28 February 2018 it ruled the law unconstitutional. In April 2019, the Ukrainian parliament voted a new law, . On 16 June 2019, the law entered into force. ==Overview== 2001 census. Russian is a regional language in 13 regions (shaded) with 10% or higher. Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the independence of Ukraine, the Russian language has dwindled, but remains one of the two most used languages for business, legal proceedings, science, artistry, and many other spheres of everyday life. According to the 2001 census, 67.5% of the citizens of Ukraine regarded Ukrainian as their native language, with Russian being considered the native language for another 29.6%. Various other languages constitute the remaining 2.9%. During the Soviet era, both Russian and Ukrainian had official status as State languages of the Ukrainian SSR. Supporters of the bill argued it would make life easier for Russian-speaking Ukrainians. Opponents fear adoption of Russian as a minority language could spread rapidly, challenging Ukrainian and causing splits between eastern and western Ukraine.Language law triggers violence in Ukraine, Financial Times (4 July 2012) In practice Russian is already used widely in official establishments in Ukraine. According to the article #27 (2nd part) it is necessary to translate Ukrainian place names into other languages using only Ukrainian transcription (the transcription of the state language). On 9 February 2013 the authors of the 2012 language law, Serhiy Kivalov and Vadym Kolesnichenko, were awarded the \\"Medal of Pushkin\\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin for \\"great contribution to the preservation and promotion of the Russian language and culture abroad\\". ==Bill \\"On the principles of the State language policy\\"==  Analysis  V. Kolesnichenko, one of the authors of the law, refers to its support from various higher education bodies, scientists and NGOs. Some say that the bill contradicts the Constitution of Ukraine, violates the Budget Code, and aims to annihilate the Ukrainian language. It suffered a criticism in the conclusions of state authorities and their departments: the Main Scientific-Expert Bureau of the Ukrainian Parliament (23 May 2012), the Parliamentary Committee on Culture and Spirituality (September 23, 2011), the Parliamentary Committee on Budget (3 November 2011), Ministry of Finance (9 September 2011), the Ministry of Justice (27 September 2011). The bill also failed to obtain the support of the specialized institutions of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine: the Linguistics Institute, the Institute of the Ukrainian Language, the Institute of political and ethno-national researches, the Shevchenko Institute of Literature, the Institute of State and Law, the Ukrainian linguistic- informational Fund, the Philology Institute of Kyiv University, and the Academy of Sciences of the High School of Ukraine. Opinion adopted by the Venice Commission In December 2011 the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe issued its Opinion on the draft law. According to Ukrayinska Pravda, the Venice Commission did not notice in the draft law of Kolesnichenko any guarantees of the protection of the Ukrainian language and later came to a decision that the bill is another \\"pre-election tool\\" for the Party of Regions. V. Kolesnichenko, one of the authors of the law, claimed the 2011 analysis of the Venice Commission was \\"generally supportive\\". В. Колесниченко «Венецианская комиссия» впервые одобрила проект закона Украины «Об основах государственной языковой политики» (текст выводов) Russian-speaking Ukraine 2011 The opponents noted that the analysis contained strong criticism, specifically about the failure to protect the role of Ukrainian as the State language. In its Opinion, the Venice Commission stated, among other theses: The Opinion also made other observations and proposals of change. It was of the view that \\"further improvements, increased guarantees and more substantial changes to the normative content of the Draft should be introduced...\\" Fight in parliament Prior to 24 May 2012 there were rumors that a revision of the legislation on languages would take place in parliament (the Verkhovna Rada) and that the Secretary of National Security and Defense would attend the session. Some 1,000 protesters gathered just outside the Verkhovna Rada building setting up another tent city. State law enforcement warned the protesters not to establish a tent city. The protesters were yelling in Ukrainian \\"Get busy with work, not a tongue\\" (implying the law draft on languages). Some posters carried the slogan: \\"The problem is in poverty, not in language\\". At the evening session the parliamentary opposition in the Verkhovna Rada (BYuT and Our Ukraine) blocked the main tribune in parliament as some representatives from the Party of Regions surrounded the presidium. The speaker was forced to announce a break in the session. After the break Member of Parliament Vyacheslav Kyrylenko read a statement of the united opposition not to conduct any hearings regarding language issues. After the law draft #10154 \\"On the state language of Ukraine\\" was not adopted onto the daily agenda, Kyrylenko withdrew his draft #9059 \\"Prohibition of narrowing the sphere of use of Ukrainian language\\" from a revision, while Kolesnichenko gave a presentation on his draft #9073. The head of the Committee On Issues of Culture and Spirituality Volodymyr Yavorivsky disclosed the decision of the committee to reject the bill #9073 as it was the decision of the committee's majority. He pointed to the fact that the law draft in fact will introduce a bilingual situation in number of regions. However, after a review the bill was supported by the parliamentary majority which showed its support in adopting two state languages: Ukrainian and Russian. The parliamentary minority and the deputy group \\"Reforms for the Future\\" stayed in opposition to the bill. Parliament speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn was forced to hastily close the session as further discussion descended into another fight leaving some members of parliament injured. The Party of Regions released a statement to the press where it accused the opposition of denying the adaptation of a bill that protects some constitutional rights of millions of citizens of Ukraine. PoR leader in parliament Yefremov promised to revisit the issue once everything is stable. Implementation The bill was to come into force only after it was signed by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the Chairman of Parliament. But the Chairman of Parliament Volodymyr Lytvyn tendered his resignation on 4 July 2012. However, the Verkhovna Rada twice held votes of confidence in the speaker, and did not accept his resignation. On 31 July Lytvyn signed the law. The bill was signed by President Yanukovych on 8 August 2012. The law came into force on 10 August 2012. Since then various Ukrainian cities and regions have declared Russian a regional language in their jurisdictions, these being the municipalities of Odessa, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia, Sevastopol, Dnipropetrovsk, Luhansk and Krasny Luch; and the Oblasts of Odessa, Zaporizhia, Donetsk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk. Hungarian has been made a regional language in the town of Berehove in the Zakarpattia Oblast, Moldovan in the village of Tarasivtsi (Chernivtsi Oblast), and Romanian in the village of Bila Tserkva; also in the Zakarpattia Oblast. These languages will now be used in city/Oblast administrative office work and documents. As of September 2012 there were no plans for such bilingualism in Kyiv. Chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea Volodomyr Konstantinov stated in March 2013 that the August 2012 law had changed nothing in Crimea.  Repeal of the law  On February 23, 2014, the second day after the flight of Viktor Yanukovich, while in a parliamentary session, a deputy from the \\"Batkivshchina\\" party, Vyacheslav Kyrylenko, moved to include in the agenda a bill to repeal the 2012 law \\"On the principles of the state language policy\\". The motion was carried with 86% of the votes in favour—232 deputies in favour vs 37 opposed against the required minimum of 226 of 334 votes. The bill was included in the agenda, immediately put to a vote with no debate and approved with the same 232 voting in favour. The bill would have made Ukrainian the sole state language at all levels. Still, all the minority languages (including Russian) remain explicitly protected under article 10 of the Ukrainian Constitution. The repeal would also bring back into force the previous law on languages, which was in place in Ukraine for 23 years before July 2012 and was regulating the use of the minority languages. According to Uilleam Blacker, the repeal bill contained no specific threat to the Russian language. However the move to repeal the 2012 law \\"On the principles of the state language policy\\" provoked negative reactions in Crimea and in some regions of Southern and Eastern Ukraine. It became one of the topics of the protests against the new government approved by the parliament after the flight of Viktor Yanukovich. Новости NEWSru.com :: На Украине протестуют против начатой новыми властями борьбы с русским языком In this context, the next major development was the Crimean crisis. Passage of the repeal bill was met with regret by the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe. The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities expressed concern over possible further unrest. He also proposed to give advice and facilitate discussions on new legislation, declaring that \\"we must avoid the mistakes made last time [in 2012] when unbalanced legislation was adopted without a proper dialogue in the Verkhovna Rada.\\" The bill was also criticized by the Ambassador for Human Rights of the Russian foreign ministry. Долгов: отмена закона о языке ущемляет права нацменьшинства на Украине RIA Novosti Bulgarian and Romanian foreign ministers evaluated it as a step in the wrong direction, and the Greek foreign minister expressed disappointment. The Hungarian foreign ministry expressed serious concerns, noting that the decision \\"could question the commitment of the new Ukrainian administration towards democracy\\".Repealing the language law could question Ukraine’s democratic commitment 25.02.2014 The Polish foreign minister called it a mistake. After urgently ordering a working group to draft a replacement law on February 27, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov declared on 3 March that he will not be signing the repeal bill until a replacement law is adopted. Турчинов відмовився підписати рішення Ради про скасування закону про мови Кorrespondent.net, 3 березня 2014 Since then the repeal bill is not signed, but not vetoed by the President, its current status is \\"ready for sign\\". On 7 April 2014 former BYuT leader Yulia Tymoshenko stated she supported the 2012 language law. On 3 November 2014, newly elected president Petro Poroshenko declared that the language policy in Ukraine will be amended. On 10 July 2014 57 parliamentary deputies appealed the Constitutional Court of Ukraine to review the 2012 law \\"On the principles of the state language policy\\". On 10 October 2014 the court opened the proceedings on the constitutionality of the law. On 14 December 2016 the Constitutional Court ended the oral proceedings and on 13 January 2017 moved to the closed part of the process. KSU will continue to review \\"the law Kolesnichenko-Kivalov\\" behind closed doors, Ukrayinska Pravda (10 January 2017) CCU will continue to review \\"the law Kolesnichenko-Kivalov\\" January 19, Ukrayinska Pravda (13 January 2017) On 28 February 2018 the Constitutional Court of Ukraine ruled the law unconstitutional. == 2016 law == In 2016, a New rule came into force requiring Ukraine's radio stations to play a quota of Ukrainian-language songs each day. The law also requires TV and radio broadcasters to ensure 60% of programs such as news and analysis are in Ukrainian. == Ukraine's 2017 Education Law == Ukraine's 2017 education law will make Ukrainian the required language of study in state schools from the fifth grade on, although it allows instruction in other languages as a separate subject, to be phased in in 2023. Since 2017, the Hungary–Ukraine relations rapidly deteriorated over the issue of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine. According to the New Europe: == Lviv Oblast == Unian reported that \\"A ban on the use of cultural products, namely movies, books, songs, etc., in the Russian language in the public has been introduced\\" in the Lviv Oblast in September 2018. Critics called the law ill-defined, illegal, and unconstitutional, and a successful January 2019 court challenge by the Chuhuiv Human Rights Group was dismissed on technical grounds in May, and could lead to a complaint before the European Court of Human Rights. == Law \\"On provision of the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the State language\\" ==  First vote  On 4 October 2018, the Ukrainian parliament voted with a majority of 261 MPs in the first reading of a new language law (bill n. 5670-d, \\"On provision of the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the State language\\"). Thereafter, the bill \\"was prepared for second reading for about four months. During this time, the Verkhovna Rada's committee on culture and spirituality worked out over 2,000 amendments to the document that were proposed by people's deputies. In particular, the document proposes creating the national commission on the standards of the state language and introducing the post of commissioner for the protection of the state language. Lawmakers started considering the document at second reading on February 28. The Verkhovna Rada continue[d] to review amendments to the bill during March 12-15 [2019].\\" The Council of Europe asked the Verkhovna Rada to postpone the adoption of the bill until the post-election period.  Second vote and signature  On 25 April 2019, the Ukrainian parliament adopted the law. However, on the same day Pro-Russian members of the Ukrainian Parliament blocked the chairman, Andriy Parubiy, from signing it by introducing two draft resolutions to repeal the law. \\"If parliament d[id] not support these resolutions, [Parliament chairman] Andriy Parubiy ha[d] the right to sign the law and forward it to the President of Ukraine to get his signature on it.\\" In total, four appeals to cancel the law were submitted, and it was planned that the parliament would vote on those on 14 May 2019. Parubiy declared that after the parliament will have rejected those appeals, he will sign the law and that the Ukrainian President will sign it \\"without delay.\\" Patriarch Filaret and former Ukrainian President Yushchenko were present in the parliament during the vote. Poroshenko called the adoption of the law by the Ukrainian parliament \\"a historic decision\\" and said he would sign the law as soon as he receives it from the parliament. Poroshenko also said that the law \\"would not have been approved without Andriy Parubiy\\". Parliament chairman Parubiy signed the law on 14 May 2019, after the four draft bills to cancel the bill n. 5670-d were rejected by the Ukrainian parliament. Parubiy said that the law \\"will be signed by the president of Ukraine in the coming hours or days.\\" On 15 May 2019, President Poroshenko, in his last week in office, signed the law. Poroshenko showing the law signed.  Analysis  The law regulates the Ukrainian language \\"in the media, education, and business. It aims to strengthen the language’s role in a country where much of the public still speaks Russian.\\"  Reactions  Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said the law was \\"unacceptable\\" and part of an \\"anti-Hungarian policy\\". The European Commission intends to study and give its assessment to the law. On 22 May 2019, the Chair of the Monitoring Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe asked the Venice Commission to analyze the law. The court of Kyiv declined the appeal from an NGO to ban Andriy Parubiy from signing the law and to ban the law's publication. Russia asked the President of the UN Security Council to convene a meeting over the adoption by Ukraine's parliament of the law. ==References Further reading == * * ==External links== *Further information and news by Kyiv Post on various actions in Ukraine taken on the regional level in response to the law * The text of the 2012 law * Plenary sessions on May 24, 2012 * Citizen's reviews on legislation * Review of the bill \\"On the principles of the state language policy\\" by another parliamentary * Parliamentary speech of Kolesnichenko on May 24 * * The text of the 2019 law Important documents *Bill \\"On the principles of the state language policy\\" (#9073) (26 August 2011) * Bill \\"On languages in Ukraine\\" (#1015-3) * Bill \\"On prohibition of narrowing the spheres of use of regional languages and languages of national minorities of Ukraine\\" (26 August 2011) *European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages *Constitution of Ukraine Category:2012 in Ukraine Category:Verkhovna Rada Category:Languages of Ukraine Category:Language policy Category:Russian language Category:Political scandals in Ukraine Category:Ukrainian law Category:Ukrainian crisis Category:Linguistic discrimination ","title":"Language policy in Ukraine"},{"id":"35928475","text":"Karel Knesl (8 April 1942 – 3 September 2020) was a Czech football player who competed in the 1964 Summer Olympics.

Early on the company also included songwriter Harry Von Tilzer, who composed what became the company's first hit, \\"A Bird in a Gilded Cage\\". The song, with lyrics by Arthur J. Lamb, sold two million copies of sheet music, which encouraged Von Tilzer to form his own publishing company in 1902. When Maurice Shapiro died in 1911, Bernstein took over the company. The company became a successful publisher of popular music, especially novelty songs. They made a contract with newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst in 1916 to include their songs in Hearst's newspapers, which greatly increased the sales. Among the company's successful publications was Vernon Dalhart's \\"The Prisoner's Song\\", published in 1924. One of the company's major hits was \\"Yes! We Have No Bananas\\" published in 1923. The same year the song was published, they sued lyricist and publicist C.F. Zittel who was making a film using the title \\"Yes, We Want No Bananas\\" which they considered an unauthorized use of the title. Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. did give permission to producer George Lederer to produce a musical using the title, but the project did not come to fruition.”’Bananas’ Film Title Use Unauthorized,” ‘’Variety’’ (August 23, 1923), p. 17. Shapiro and Bernstein, along with Decca Records and Columbia Pictures, formed a company called Mood Music in 1947 to publish songs from film musicals including The Jolson Story. In May 2020, Shapiro Bernstein was acquired by Reservoir Media Management. https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/reservoir-acquires-16000-copyrights-by- bringing-shapiro-bernstein-into-its-portfolio ==Company name== The company started out as Shapiro, Bernstein & Von Tilzer. When Von Tilzer left in 1902, the name was changed to Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. Shapiro joined Jerome H. Remick in 1904 to form Shapiro & Remick, Co., but left the company to Remick in 1905. The following year he re-established his own publishing firm under the name Shapiro Music Publisher.

He stood tall and weighed during his playing career. He was affectionately known as \\"Niño\\" by his teammates and fans due to the youthful exuberance with which he played the game. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Miami Marlins from 2013 until his death in 2016. Fernández was born in Santa Clara, Cuba. He made three unsuccessful attempts at defecting to the United States before he finally succeeded in 2008. He enrolled at Braulio Alonso High School in Tampa, Florida, and was selected by the Marlins in the first round of the 2011 MLB draft. Fernández made his MLB debut with the Marlins on April 7, 2013. He was named to the 2013 National League All-Star Team, and won the National League (NL) Rookie of the Month Award in July and August. After the season, he won the NL Rookie of the Year Award and finished third in Cy Young Award balloting. He underwent Tommy John surgery during the 2014 season and was named to his second All-Star Game in 2016. Fernández was the pilot when he and two other men were killed in a pre-dawn boating crash into a jetty off the coast of Miami Beach, Florida, on September 25, 2016. ==Early life== Fernández grew up in Santa Clara, Cuba, where he lived on the same street as his friend and future Major League Baseball (MLB) shortstop Aledmys Díaz. They played for the same youth baseball team, and Díaz's father and uncle encouraged Fernández's mother to bring him to the ballpark. Fernández commented that he pursued a professional baseball career because Díaz's uncle had been an influence early in his life. Ramón Jiménez, Fernández's stepfather, defected from Cuba in 2005, settling in Tampa, Florida. On three occasions, José unsuccessfully attempted to defect; each failed defection attempt was followed by a prison term. On his fourth attempt in 2007, José successfully defected at age 15 with his mother and sister, but José's mother fell overboard when the boat hit turbulent waters, and he had to dive into the water to save her life. They reached Mexico and then moved to Tampa in 2008. Ramon knew Orlando Chinea, a coach who lived in the Tampa area. Chinea had trained some of Cuba's top pitchers before he defected to Tampa. Ramon had José train with Chinea. He attended Braulio Alonso High School in Tampa, Florida. Playing on the high school baseball team, José was part of the Florida Class 6A state champions in his sophomore and senior seasons. Before his senior year in 2011, the Florida High School Athletic Association ruled that Fernández was ineligible, as he entered the ninth grade while in Cuba in 2006 and had therefore exhausted his eligibility. MLB's Cincinnati Reds were prepared to sign Fernández as an international free agent to a $1.3 million signing bonus. Fernández won an appeal and was declared eligible for his senior year, ending Cincinnati's pursuit. As a senior, Fernández pitched to a 13–1 win–loss record with a 2.35 earned run average (ERA) and 134 strikeouts. He also threw two no-hitters. ==Professional baseball career== Draft and minor leagues The Florida Marlins selected Fernández 14th overall in the first round of the 2011 MLB draft. Fernández signed with the Marlins, receiving a $2 million signing bonus. After he signed with the Marlins, he made one start for the Gulf Coast Marlins of the Rookie- level Gulf Coast League, and one start for the Jamestown Jammers of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League. Fernández in the minor leagues with the Jupiter Hammerheads, 2012 Pitching for the Greensboro Grasshoppers of the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) to start the 2012 season, Fernández threw the first six innings of a combined no-hitter. He was twice named the SAL pitcher of the week. Fernández was named to appear in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game. After pitching to a 7–0 win-loss record and a 1.59 ERA in 14 games for Greensboro, the Marlins promoted Fernández to the Jupiter Hammerheads of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. He finished the 2012 season with a 14–1 win-loss record, a 1.75 ERA, and 158 strikeouts in 134 innings pitched at Greensboro and Jupiter. He was named the Marlins' Minor League Pitcher of the Year. Miami Marlins =2013 season: Rookie of the Year= Prior to the 2013 season, Baseball America ranked Fernández as the Marlins' best prospect and the fifth best prospect in all of baseball. The Marlins invited Fernández to spring training but sent him to minor league camp before the season began. However, they chose to add Fernández to their 25-man Opening Day roster, due in part to injuries to Nathan Eovaldi and Henderson Álvarez. Also, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria hoped that promoting Fernández would buy him goodwill with the fans, following a fire sale the previous offseason. He was planned to be limited to approximately 150 to 170 innings during the 2013 season in order to protect his development. He was the second youngest National League player that season, older only than the Nationals' Bryce Harper. Fernández made his major league debut on April 7 against the New York Mets at Citi Field. He pitched five innings, allowing one run on three hits with eight strikeouts. He became the seventh pitcher since 1916 under the age of 21 who recorded at least eight strikeouts in his MLB debut. Fernández had a rough outing against the Tampa Bay Rays on May 27. Rays' manager Joe Maddon took to Twitter soon after watching Fernández pitch, saying, \\"José Fernández might be the best young pitcher I've ever seen, at that age. I believe he will go far.\\" On July 6, 2013, Fernández was selected to represent the Marlins for the National League All-Star team. He pitched a perfect 6th inning in the 2013 All-Star Game in which he struck out Dustin Pedroia, got Miguel Cabrera to pop out, and struck out Chris Davis. With this performance, Fernández is one of only three pitchers in the history of the All-Star Game who struck out two batters prior to their 21st birthday for their All-Star debut, the other two being Dwight Gooden and Bob Feller. Fernández struck out 13 batters in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 28, earning the 3–2 victory. With Fernández's 14-strikeout performance against the Cleveland Indians on August 3, 2013, he became just the sixth pitcher since 2000 to strike out 13 or more batters in consecutive games. He established the Marlins' rookie record for most strikeouts in one game. For his performance in July 2013, Fernández was named the Rookie of the Month for the National League, leading all qualified rookie pitchers in ERA. He followed up his July by compiling a 1.15 ERA with 49 strikeouts in 39 innings pitched in August, which resulted him in receiving a second consecutive Rookie of the Month Award. Fernández's rookie season has been considered historic as his 4.2 Wins Above Replacement places him in the Top 10 player seasons among those under 21 years old since 1900. Fernández's Adjusted ERA+ of 174 on the season also places him in the Top 10 all-time for pitchers under the age of 21, and he is only the fourth pitcher to record this feat in the past 100 years. His strikeout rate is the highest in his league, pacing the National League at 9.81 strikeouts per nine innings. At the time after his last start of his rookie season, Fernández was in the top 10 of many pitching statistics in the National League, including sixth in strikeouts (187), first in strikeouts per nine innings (9.75) and hits allowed per nine innings (5.759), second in ERA (2.19) and Adjusted ERA+ (176), and third in WAR (6.3). Fernández won the Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award and the National League Rookie of the Year Award. He came in third place in the Cy Young Award voting behind Adam Wainwright and winner Clayton Kershaw. =2014 season= Fernández started his sophomore campaign as the Opening Day starter for the Marlins, making him the youngest Opening Day starting pitcher since Dwight Gooden in 1986. Fernández recorded nine strikeouts while walking none, and he joined Bob Gibson, Steve Carlton, Ferguson Jenkins, Walter Johnson, and Cy Young as the only pitchers to do so on Opening Day. On May 12, Fernández was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a right elbow sprain. An MRI revealed that the elbow had a torn ulnar collateral ligament, which prematurely ended Fernández's 2014 season. He underwent Tommy John surgery on May 16. He made eight starts, going 4–2 with a 2.44 ERA and 70 strikeouts in 2014. =2015 season= Fernández began the 2015 season on the 15-day disabled list but was later moved to the 60-day disabled list to continue recovery from Tommy John surgery. It was announced by the Marlins on June 15 that he would make his season debut on July 2. In his debut, Fernández recorded six strikeouts in six innings. He also hit a home run. Fernández returned to the disabled list in August with a biceps strain in his pitching arm. He returned to the mound in September and set a major league record for consecutive wins at home by a single pitcher with his seventeenth such win on the 25th of that month. =2016 season= Miami Marlins in spring training, 2016 To aid his recovery from Tommy John surgery, Fernández cut back on the use of his fastball during spring training in 2016 and began working on his secondary pitches. Appearing as a pinch hitter in the 12th inning against the Atlanta Braves on July 1, Fernández doubled in two runs to put the Marlins ahead 7–5, which ended up being the final score. He became just the second pitcher in Marlins history to produce a game-winning hit, following Dennis Cook on August 1, 1997. Fernández appeared in the 2016 MLB All-Star Game. Fernández pitched his last game on September 20. He threw eight shutout innings in a 1–0 win against the division-leading Nationals, striking out 12 batters and allowing just three hits with no walks. Afterwards, Marlins infielder Martín Prado recalled that Fernández told a teammate it was \\"the best game he ever pitched\\". He finished 2016 with an MLB-leading 12.49 strikeouts per nine innings and a new Marlins' season record of 253 strikeouts in 182 innings. He won 16 games, the best of his four-year career, while losing eight, with a 2.86 ERA. He had the highest line drive percentage allowed (28.0%) of all major league pitchers.Major League Leaderboards » 2016 » Pitchers » Batted Ball Statistics  FanGraphs Baseball He also had the lowest percentage of balls pulled against him (33.3%) among major league pitchers, and led major league pitchers in lowest contact percentage (67.5%).Major League Leaderboards » 2016 » Pitchers » Plate Discipline Statistics  FanGraphs BaseballMajor League Leaderboards » 2016 » Pitchers » Batted Ball Statistics  FanGraphs Baseball For his career, he had a 38–17 win-loss record for a winning percentage and a 2.58 ERA. ==Pitching style== Fernández had four pitches in his repertoire: a four-seam fastball that averaged and topped ,PitchFx » Overview  FanGraphs Baseball a slurveJose Fernandez Has Two Breaking Balls  FanGraphs Baseball at , a changeup at , and an occasional sinker at . ==Personal life== Fernández considered his grandmother, Olga, the \\"love of his life\\". After six years apart, Olga and José were reunited in Miami after the 2013 baseball season. Fernandez married Alejandra Baleato Marichal, his high school sweetheart, in December 2012 in Tampa, Florida. The couple divorced in 2014. https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/mlb/miami- marlins/article134761844.html On April 24, 2015, he became a citizen of the United States. On September 20, 2016, which was just five days prior to his death, Fernández announced that his girlfriend Maria Arias was pregnant with their child. Fernández's daughter was born in February 2017. He was good friends with teammate Dee Gordon. Gordon paid tribute to him on the day after his death by wearing Fernández's batting helmet and standing in the right-hand batter's box for the first pitch from Mets' starter Bartolo Colón. He then switched sides and hit a lead-off home run, which coincidentally was his only home run of the year. After rounding the bases, Gordon wept as he pointed to the sky as a tribute to his deceased friend. ==Death== On September 25, 2016, Fernández was killed in a pre-dawn boating crash when the boat he was piloting was speeding at 56.48 knots (65 mph) and struck the Government Cut north rock jetty off Miami Beach, Florida.https://www.local10.com/sports/mlb/marlins/jose-fernandezs-family- says-crash-has-left-them-in-financial-ruin The U.S. Coast Guard found the boat, Kaught Looking,The name of the craft is slightly misspelled; the \\"K\\" should be rotated 180° to the right. at about 3:00 a.m., overturned on the jetty near South Pointe Park, and found Fernandez and two other men, Eduardo Rivero and Emilio Jesus Macias, dead at the scene. A Florida Wildlife Commission (FWC) official initially confirmed that Fernández had died from the blunt impact of the crash. The commission received a toxicology report from the medical examiner of Miami-Dade County, but opted not to release the results. On October 28, 2016, ESPN obtained the autopsy and toxicology reports, which determined that Fernández had cocaine in his system and was legally drunk (BWI) at the time of the crash. The Marlins canceled their game against the Atlanta Braves that day. Teams around the major leagues honored Fernández, paying tribute with a league-wide moment of silence and the display of his jersey No. 16. The Miami Dolphins also observed a moment of silence before their Sunday football game against the Cleveland Browns. The next day, all players wore his jersey for the final time for that night's game, a 7–3 win over the New York Mets. The City of Miami and the Marlins held a public memorial and funeral procession for Fernández on September 28. His ashes were scattered at sea on October 2. In a search warrant affidavit, Miami-Dade County authorities stated that a strong odor of alcohol was found on the three men who died in the crash, and evidence indicated that the boat's skipper was speeding and driving with \\"recklessness\\" that was \\"exacerbated by the consumption of alcohol\\". Additionally, the toxicology report determined that cocaine and twice the legal limit of alcohol were in Fernández's system at the time of his death. In February 2017, the families of Eduardo Rivero and Emilio Jesus Macias sued Fernández's estate for $2 million each, claiming negligence and personal injury. The lawsuit was settled on July 31, 2018, for an undisclosed sum. On March 16, 2017, the final investigative report on the incident confirmed that Fernández was piloting the boat at the time of the incident \\"in a reckless manner, at an extremely high rate of speed, in the darkness of night, in an area with known navigational hazards such as rock jetties and channel markers.\\" The report concluded that he was legally drunk, having a blood alcohol content of 0.147, which was nearly double the legal limit of 0.08. Fernández also had cocaine in his system and had committed a number of crimes, including involuntary manslaughter, boating under the influence, vessel homicide, and reckless or careless operation of a vessel. Fernández family attorney Ralph Fernandez (no relation to the deceased) challenged the findings of the final investigative report, saying that Fernández was framed to be piloting the boat and someone spiked his drink with cocaine. Prior to the conclusions of the investigation, there were talks about honoring Fernández with a statue, streets named after him, and plaques throughout the city. Today, a plaque showing his jersey No. 16, years of birth and death, and a black ribbon exists outside of Marlins Park.https://www.local10.com/sports/mlb/marlins/marlins-honor-jose-fernandez- with-plaque-with-no-name ==See also== * List of baseball players who defected from Cuba * List of baseball players who died during their careers * List of Major League Baseball players from Cuba * List of Miami Marlins team records * Miami Marlins award winners and league leaders ==References * Category:1992 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Accidental deaths in Florida Category:All-Star Futures Game players Category:American sportspeople of Cuban descent Category:Baseball players from Florida Category:Boating accident deaths Category:Defecting Cuban baseball players Category:Cuban baseball players Category:Cuban emigrants to the United States Category:Greensboro Grasshoppers players Category:Gulf Coast Marlins players Category:Jamestown Jammers players Category:Jupiter Hammerheads players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from Cuba Category:Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award winners Category:Miami Marlins players Category:National League All-Stars Category:People from Santa Clara, Cuba Category:Sportspeople from Tampa, Florida ","title":"José Fernández (pitcher)"},{"id":"35928582","text":"Nakhjiran (, also Romanized as Nakhjīrān) is a village in Shusef Rural District, Shusef District, Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

It can be used to describe the practice of restaurants re-using cooking oil that has already been fried before. It can also be used to describe the processing of waste oil collected from sources such as restaurant fryers, grease traps, slaughterhouse waste and fatbergs.Alexa Olesen \\"Gutter Oil: China Sounds Alarm Over Filthy Cooking Oil\\" . 20 July 2010 In China, gutter oil has been used to create products like soap, rubber, bio-fuel, plastics, rooftops, and cosmetics. In the city of Shanghai, it was reported that over 2,000 buses ran on biodiesel that was made from gutter oil, and many gas stations in Shanghai also offered gasoline that was in part produced from gutter oil. Due to China's vast industry of factories involved with gutter oil processing in order to produce products like soaps, fuels, plastics, rubbers, etc, there have been abundant rumours in China about unscrupulous sellers selling gutter oil for cooking and frying. However, due to the underground nature of these allegations and rumours, it remains difficult to prove and prosecute such unscrupulous individuals. Gutter oil has also been used outside of China as well. For example in England, fatbergs that were dug out of sewers in cities like London and Liverpool were later reported to be processed in order to produce biofuel. Reprocessing of used cooking oil is often very rudimentary; techniques include filtration, boiling, refining, and the removal of some adulterants.Qian Ye, Xiaofang Pei Methods for differentiating recycled cooking oil needed in China AOCS It is then packaged and resold as a cheaper alternative to normal cooking oil.Fangqi Lu, Xuli Wu AOCS Used kitchen oil can be purchased for between $859 and $937 per ton, while the cleaned and refined product can sell for $1,560 per ton.Li Li In the Tank, Not on the Table The Beijing Review 17 November 2011 Thus there is great economic incentive to produce and sell gutter oil. Another version of gutter oil uses discarded animal parts, animal fat and skins, internal organs, and expired or otherwise low-quality meat, which is then cooked in large vats in order to extract the oil. It was estimated in 2011 that up to one in every ten lower-market restaurant meals consumed in China is prepared with recycled oil. As Feng Ping of the China Meat Research Center has said: \\"The illegal oil shows no difference in appearance and indicators after refining and purification because the law breakers are skillful at coping with the established standards.\\"Andrew Shen \\"China's Ministry of Health Just Inadvertently Green Lighted The Gutter Oil Industry\\" .

In a subsequent investigation, 22 people were arrested for involvement in a recycling oil ring over 10 years based in Taipei. The worst offender was sentenced to 7 years in prison. The first documented case of gutter oil in mainland China was reported in 2000, when a street vendor was found to be selling oil obtained from restaurant garbage disposals.He Jiangyong and Liu Ziqian, \\"Sick Slick\\" , NewsChina Magazine, December 2011. In September 2012, an ongoing investigation into the suspected use of gutter oil as a raw material in the Chinese pharmaceutical industry was revealed. A scandal involving 240 tons of gutter oil in Taiwan affecting hundreds of companies and thousands of eateries, some of which may have been exported overseas, broke in September 2014.\\"Taiwan's Premier Bans Sale 235 Food Companies Products Gutter Oil Scandal\\". South China Morning Post ==Production and distribution== The collected waste oil is sold to local workshops or small factories for cleaning and packaging.

Huffington Post, 20 July 2010 On other occasions the oil goes to industrial cooking oil refineries for further processing before it finally reaches its end purpose. The industrial oil refineries are usually legitimate producers that sell the processed oil for use in the chemical or energy industries. Gutter oil is acceptable as a raw ingredient for producing soap, rubber, bio-fuel, and cosmetics. However, the refiners can also have other intentions as the prices attained by selling it as cooking oil are much higher than if it is sold to the chemical or energy industries. Some lower-market restaurants have long-term purchase agreements with oil recyclers for selling their used oil.David Barboza Recycled Cooking Oil Found to Be Latest Hazard in China The New York Times, 31 March 2010Cao Yin and Luo Wangshu, \\"Rotting meat used to make illegal oil\\", China Daily, 4 April 2012. Low-end restaurants and street vendors are the biggest end users of gutter oil, as they operate with lower profit margins than bigger restaurants. Oil is a large kitchen supply cost for restaurants, so obtaining cheaper oil can allow a marginal restaurant to reduce its overall expenses. Chinese food is generally heavily dependent on oil due to most foods being fried, so cheaper meal prices for many price- sensitive consumers are possible if gutter oil is used instead of virgin oil.Xinhua News Agency, Our kitchens must be freed from gutter oil, 14 September 2011. The situation becomes more serious because it is hard to distinguish reprocessed gutter oil from legitimate oil. Bleach is used to transform gutter oil's dark color into a more natural-looking one, and alkali additives are used to neutralize the abnormal pH caused by high concentrations of animal fats. ==Health effects== Gutter oil is an acceptable raw ingredient for products that are not for human consumption, such as soap, rubber, bio- fuel, and cosmetics. Gutter oil has been shown to be quite toxic, and can cause diarrhea and abdominal pain. There are also reports that long-term consumption of the oil can lead to stomach and liver cancer.Austin Ramzy, China Cracks Down on \\"Gutter Oil,\\" a Substance Even Worse Than its Name, Time, 13 September 2011. Testing of some samples of gutter oil has revealed traces of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), dangerous organic pollutants capable of causing cancer with long-term consumption. There is also potential for gutter oil to contain aflatoxins, highly carcinogenic compounds produced by certain molds. Zeng Jing of the Guangdong Armed Police Hospital said of gutter oil: \\"Animal and vegetable fat in refined waste oil will undergo rancidity, oxidation and decomposition after contamination. It will cause indigestion, insomnia, liver discomfort and other symptoms.\\" Due to rumours and the fear of Chinese customers of restaurants using gutter oil in their cooking, it has been reported that some people in China have resorted to bringing their own cooking oil with them from home in restaurants, and instructing chefs to use their home-brought oil in their kitchen when preparing their food instead of the restaurant's own cooking oil. ==Regulations and law enforcement== Chinese law states that industrial animal fat is not allowed for use in food products because it does not meet basic hygiene standards and contains high levels of potentially toxic contaminants.Ankush Chibber \\"Edible oil or industrial oil in China\\". Food Navigator Asia, 25 May 2012 The national and local governments are researching ways to test and identify gutter oil but there were no nationwide standards in place to help with this process. The government is looking into methods that rely on technical equipment as well as on-site instant tests to screen suspect oil. There are five proposed tests for gutter oil but each has failed to accurately detect it. In August and September 2011, the Beijing city government passed two new sets of regulations. The first was \\"On Accelerating the City's Food Waste and Waste Oil Recycling Program\\". Its goals are to increase daily food waste processing to 2,200 tons by 2012 and to 2,900 tons by 2015. Additionally, the intent of the regulations is to create a system that \\"should be a unified, standardized, and orderly processing of waste oil collection and improvement of the transportation system\\".Tian Peng, Sun Lichao \\"Cooking Oil's Final Destination\\". The Economic Observer 14 November 2011 The second set of regulations by the city of Beijing, called the \\"Beijing Municipal Solid Waste Regulations\\", was passed in September 2011. The regulations specifically target the two sources of gutter oil: food waste and used oil. The central government intends for these two sets of regulations to serve as national examples, yet wants every municipality nationally to find their own solutions to the food waste and gutter oil problem.'Proposals pouring in for testing gutter oil', China Daily, 24 May 2012. A nationwide campaign was set in motion in August 2011 to crack down on the widespread production and selling of gutter oil. The law enforcement campaign uncovered 100 gutter oil manufacturers and arrested more than 800 people allegedly involved in the production and sale of gutter oil. In April 2012 another crackdown occurred with an additional 100 arrests made and 13 illegal workshops closed down across four provinces.Mark Astley Chinese officials arrest more than 100 in rotten meat-based 'gutter oil' crackdown Food Quality News, 5 April 2012 According to a notice released jointly by the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security, the death penalty will now be an option when prosecuting more serious cases of gutter oil manufacturing in the country. More severe punishments will also be given out to government and public officials who fail to properly address matters related to gutter oil. The State Council said inspectors would target edible oil trade fairs and wholesale markets and called for inspections of oil being used at restaurants, school cafeterias, work canteens and kitchens at construction sites. The State Council also stated that businesses that use recycled oil would be forced to close temporarily or lose their business license while peddlers who sell the oil could be criminally prosecuted.Xinhua News Agency Death penalties considered for 'gutter oil' crimes 24 February 2012Laurie Burkitt, Chinese Gutter Oil Attains New Level of Gross, The Wall Street Journal, China Real Time Report, 3 April 2012. In October 2013, a man from eastern China's Jiangsu Province was sentenced to life imprisonment for profiting heavily from making and selling gutter oil. ==Production of biofuel and value addition == Recently researchers are working on identifying different components in Gutter oil using 1H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance), MALDI-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry) and HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography). In addition, sustainable utilization of gutter oil for biofuel production is being explored using different chemical and enzymatic methods. ==See also== * Food safety incidents in China * Food safety incidents in Taiwan ==References== Category:Health in China Category:Food safety scandals Category:Recycling Category:Cooking oils Category:2014 health disasters Category:2014 in China Category:Adulteration Category:Economic history of China Category:Health disasters in China Category:Mass poisoning Category:Scandals in China ","title":"Gutter oil"},{"id":"35928593","text":"Nureshk (, also Romanized as Nūreshḵ; also known as Rūshenḵ) is a village in Shusef Rural District, Shusef District, Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

On 8 June 2012, the club announced that Andriy Tlumak and Taras Petrivskiy will leave FC Karpaty having received free-agent status. On 7 December 2012 Polish defender Jakub Tosik left the club with a scandal, stating that he will never set a foot on Ukrainian land and calling club officials \\"bastards and thieves\\". Tosik appeared in 5 matches before he was suspended from the first team for unknown reasons. On 27 May 2013 at FC Karpaty season review meeting it was decided to transfer list 19 players due to club's unsatisfactory results. Also measures of material influence were imposed on all members of the team. Season Karpaty opened their 20th top-tier national championship season with a 1–1 away draw against Volyn Lutsk in the so-called \\"Wild West Derby\\". This was the first ever draw between the two clubs in 17 official matches. Restructuring On 20 September 2012 Petro Dyminsky, an honorary president of Karpaty Lviv, officially passed management authority over the club to the club's supporters, thus making green'n'whites a first Ukrainian football club to do so. Petro Dyminsky stated that the strategic goal of the reorganization of FC Karpaty is a clear understanding that the club should not depend on private funds of founders, but to eventually obtain independent financial stability instead. ==Competitions== Friendly matches =Pre-season= =Mid-season= =Winter break= Premier League =League table= =Results summary= =Matches= Ukrainian Cup ==Squad information== Squad and statistics =Squad, appearances and goals= - colspan=\\"14\\"Players away from the club on loan: - colspan=\\"14\\"Players featured for Karpaty but left before the end of the season: } =Goalscorers= {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;

The original soundtrack for the film was lost and replaced by another donated by collectionist Leslie Shepard. The sets were designed by Ludwig Kainer. == Plot == Count Greven (Bruno de Carli) returns to his old castle after spending several years touring the world. The servants note how the count has changed: he is now withdrawn and fearful. He orders that the doors to the castle be kept locked and no one admitted. When he is left alone in his room, Greven opens a chest he brought from his travels, inside it there is a strange statue that he adds to his vast collection of rare works of art. Several days pass and a worried servant (Bernhard Goetzke) informs the town's minister (Hermann Picha) about his master's melancholia. The old man visits the castle looking to help. The count confesses the minister how, during his stay in India, he had heard of a statue of Buddha that was so beautiful that it made the sick well and the sad joyous; while visiting the temple, he stole the figure and smuggled it back home. The count tells the minister that the temple's priest swore a terrible revenge upon him for his sacrilege, and he has been living in fear of their secret powers ever since. The minister leaves shocked, believing that Greven has gone mad. The count screams in despair that he no longer wants to live, since the agony of suspense is worse than death. One night, a turbaned figure does appear on Greven's grounds. The count demands that the Indian priest (Conrad Veidt) kills him right then and there to end his suffering, but the man refuses. He warns that - from that very day - the count will only have seven years to live life to its fullest, after which he will die by the hand of the one who loves him most. The count spends those years seeking out every joy life holds. He throws bacchanalias and hosts gambling parties, but soon these pleasures no longer satisfy him. Looking to obtain fame, Greven researches obsessively a means to cure world hunger, but after succeeding, he capriciously destroys it, all for his amusement. Still looking for fulfillment and meaning, he becomes involved with a young woman (Mechthildis Thein) and revels in the experience of love. He and the young woman are wed. Nevertheless, as the fateful day approaches, he becomes paranoid and terrified once again. Desperate, he decides to leave his castle and travel around the world once again, however he can't depart from his wife and cancels his trip. Greven then takes the statue and throws it into a lake, hoping the curse of the priest goes away with it, only to find it back in his home right after. Trusting no one - he even suspects that will be his wife's hand that will slay him - he shoots himself. The statue is retrieved from Greven's castle and carried back to India in the hands of the mysterious priest.Conrad Veidt on Screen: A Comprehensive Illustrated Filmography p.34Beyond Caligari: The Films of Robert Wiene p.40-41 == Cast == * Bruno Decarli as Count Greven * Conrad Veidt as Indian Priest * Bernhard Goetzke as Manservant * Hermann Picha as The Minister * Mechthildis Thein as Greven's Lover == Reception == The film was well received by contemporary critics, who praised Wiene's interpretation of psychology and portrayal of paranoia. == Availability == As with many of Wiene's lesser known works, Fear has not been released in any format for home media, making it an obscure and rare film. Nonetheless, a print of it is located at the Swedish Film Institute. == Interpretation == Considerable ambiguity exists whether the Indian Priest is real or simply a product of the Count's fevered imagination due to his growing madness.

He was born in Port Huron, Michigan, the son of Granville Boynton and Frances Rendt Boynton. Frances Rendt was the daughter of Captain Ludwig Rendt, a Hessian soldier who fought for the British in the War of 1812; his wife was from Spain. Boynton was educated in Waukegan, Illinois and briefly attended medical school in Cincinnati, Ohio where he married Anna Fidelei. Together they had five children. After his service in the Civil War, Boynton returned to Port Huron where he served in many capacities, including postmaster, newspaper publisher and mayor. He held patents related to fire fighting equipment and commemorative badges. He also founded the Order of the Maccabees, a national social fraternity that served as a form of life insurance. His failing health caused him to seek a warmer climate; Boynton visited South Florida in 1895 with Congressman William S. Linton. Boynton purchased land along the beachfront from Linton and built a wooden two-story hotel, The Boynton, later called the Boynton Beach Hotel.. Retrieved May 12, 2015.

(Jay) Famiglietti is the director of the Global Institute for Water Security at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada. Prior to that he was the Senior Water Scientist at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CAhttps://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Famiglietti/ and a professor of Earth System Science at the University of California, Irvine. He is a leading expert in global water issues and in raising awareness about the global water crisis and in particular, about global groundwater depletion. == Education == Famiglietti received his B.S. in Geology from Tufts University in 1982 and his M.S. in Hydrology from the University of Arizona in 1986. He continued his graduate studies at Princeton University, where he earned both his M.A. and Ph.D. in Civil Engineering. Formerly an Assistant and Associate Professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, and the founding Associate Director of the University of Texas at Austin's Environmental Science Institute, Famiglietti was also the founding director of the UC Center for Hydrologic Modeling (UCCHM) at UC Irvine. Famiglietti is known for his research using satellites and developing computer models to track changing freshwater availability around the globe. His work, his commentary and efforts in science communication were featured in the Participant Media water documentary Last Call at the Oasis, in 60 Minutes, on Real Time with Bill Maher. == Research and Projects == Famiglietti's research centers around “the role of hydrology in the coupled Earth system” and evaluating “global change impacts on water availability.” He has long been a proponent of advancing the capabilities of hydrological models in the United States. While chair of the board of the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI), he led the Community Hydrologic Modeling Platform (CHyMP) effort to accelerate the development of hydrological models for use in addressing global issues related to water, food, economic, climate, and global security. He continued those efforts at the UCCHM and at NASA JPL, where he leads the Western States Water Mission. Famiglietti conducts research using NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to monitor how humans and global change are impacting freshwater availability. His team pioneered the use of GRACE for remote sensing of groundwater storage changes. Their work has revealed unsustainable groundwater use and the rapid rates of groundwater depletion in the world's major aquifers. This research is also recognized by NASA as the primary justification for the selection of the GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) as a climate continuation mission. == Awards and honors == Famiglietti is a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and of the Geological Society of America (GSA). In 2012 he was selected as the GSA's Birdsall-Dreiss Distinguished Lecturer. During that year he delivered over 50 lectures in the United States and internationally on the topics of water cycle change and on the need to advance hydrological modelling capabilities. He was also selected as one of two 2014 David Keith Todd Lecturers of the Groundwater Resources Association of California. In 2010, Famiglietti was the recipient of the Shimizu Visiting Professorship at Stanford University in Civil and Environmental Engineering. Other notable honors include being awarded the Outstanding Contributions to Undergraduate Education honor in 2005 by UC Irvine, and the NASA New Investigator Award in 1996. == Publications == Famiglietti has published a number of academic research reports and articles, on topics ranging from soil moisture, to the remote sensing of groundwater availability and the effects of climate change on water balance. Notable publications include Satellite-Based Estimates of Groundwater Depletion in India, Satellites Measure Recent Rates of Groundwater Depletion in California’s Central Valley (2011), The Global Groundwater Crisis (2014)Famiglietti, J. S., \\"The Global Groundwater Crisis\\", Nature Climate Change, 2014., Quantifying Renewable Groundwater Stress with GRACE and Emerging trends in global freshwater availabilityFamiglietti, J. S., \\"Emerging trends in global freshwater availability\\", Nature, 2018. Beyond academia, Famiglietti has published a number of op-eds in major national newspapers including the Los Angeles Times, and the San Francisco Chronicle. Among these, his March 12, 2015 LA Times op-ed went viral and attracted major media and public attention He has also been a regular contributor to the National Geographic Water Currents blog and to Huffington Post. == References External link== *H2O:The Molecule That Made Us PBS.org documentary with Famiglietti Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:University of California, Irvine faculty Category:American hydrologists ","title":"James S.

Known as \\"Jimmy\\", and nicknamed \\"Cowboy,\\" he competed in rodeo bull riding, worked as a stable groom, and then went on to become a successful jockey in Quarter Horse racing before turning to Thoroughbred flat racing.Youngstown Vindicator (Ohio) - July 3, 1984 ==Riding career== In 1947 Jimmy Nichols was the leading apprentice jockey at Hollywood Park Racetrack 2012 Hollywood Park Media Guide and the following year, the leading jockey at Del Mar Racetrack. He went on to ride for major racing stable owners such as Christopher Chenery, George A. Pope Jr., the Phipps family's Wheatley Stable, Fred W. Hooper and John W. Galbreath. During his career, Nichols rode in seven U.S. Triple Crown races, his best finish a third aboard Gentleman James in the 1967 Belmont Stakes.Modesto Bee (California) - June 4, 1967 After thirty-two years, Jimmy Nichols retired from riding in 1979 and went to work as a steward at various racetracks including Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans, Waterford Park near Chester, West Virginia and finally at Trinity Meadows Race Track in Willow Park, Texas. In 1993, Jimmy Nichols was inducted into the Fair Grounds Racing Hall of Fame. He suffered from kidney failure in 1995 and spent his last years working in the jockeys' room at Lone Star Park in Grand Prairie, Texas. James Nichols obituary at Bloodhorse.com February 27, 2003 ==Risen Star== Even after his retirement from riding, Jimmy Nichols was sought out by owners in the horse racing industry for his knowledge of Thoroughbreds. The best known example of this occurred in 1987 with Louie Roussel, an owner/trainer who also owned Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans.Schenectady Gazette - June 11, 1988 Roussel hired Nichols to check out approximately twenty two-year-old Thoroughbreds coming up for auction and to make buying recommendations. The result was Nichols recommending a colt that Roussel and partner Ronnie Lamarque would acquire for $300,000 and name Risen Star. At age three, the son of Secretariat just missed out on winning the 1988 U.S. Triple Crown series when he was a narrowly beaten third in the Kentucky Derby then won the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. Throughout Risen Star's campaign, Jimmy Nichols maintained an important role. He turned down a job offer from Ellis Park Race Course to remain as the exercise rider of Risen Star in exchange for a bonus of one lifetime breeding right to the valuable colt.Newsday, June 7, 1988 article titled BELMONT STAKES - Nichols, the Hidden Star ==References== Category:1928 births Category:2003 deaths Category:American jockeys Category:Sportspeople from Las Cruces, New Mexico ","title":"James D.

It was intended to replace the organic solvents that were the main method of film cleaning before that point.http://www.filmshooting.com/scripts/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t;=13502 Although their effectiveness is not usually considered sufficient for lab operations, where ultrasonic cleaning with a solvent solution remains the standard, the PTR sold widely for use in projection booths and transfer houses. ==Use== At least two PTRs are needed in the film path - one for the base side and one for the emulsion side - though four are frequently used. A set of PTRs is frequently placed in the film paths of projectors, telecine machines, scanners and printers in order to remove dust and contaminants from the surface of the film before projection, transfer or duplication. PTRs are also used in some dedicated film cleaning machines, or mounted between rewind heads and used for manual cleaning. The contaminants are lifted from the film and adhere to the roller as the film passes in contact with it. The rollers themselves are then cleaned, usually in soapy water, and dried before the next use. ==References * Page on PTRs on the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's site.

They played in the Golden Horseshoe Conference of the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League. The team announced it would not participate in the 2018–19 season. However the team returned to the GOJHL for the 2019-20 season with an entirety new group of players. On May 23, 2012, the Brantford Eagles were transplanted to Caledonia, Ontario, and renamed the Caledonia Corvairs, the name of the long running Junior C team in the town. The Eagles had been one of the most dominant teams in Junior B for the previous four seasons but lacked crowd support. ==History== Corvairs goalie during 2015 playoffs. Prior to the Brantford Eagles, a former Junior C team called the Brantford Penguins joined the Southwestern Junior B Hockey League in 1976. After two seasons, the SWJBHL folded and the Penguins jumped to the Golden Horseshoe Junior Hockey League. In 1984, the Brantford Alexander B's were Golden Horseshoe Champions. In 1986, the Alexander B's were infamously suspended from playing in the 1986–87 season in a crackdown against violence by the Ontario Hockey Association. The team was rebranded the Brantford Classics in 1987 and jumped to the Mid-Western Junior Hockey League. The Classics were very competitive until they relocated to Ohsweken, Ontario, and became the Ohsweken Golden Eagles in 1992. The team would not have another winning season until 2005–06 and missed the playoffs six consecutive years in that time. In 1998, the team was renamed the Brant County Golden Eagles and returned to Brantford in 2002 still as the Golden Eagles. The name was shorted in 2008 to just the Eagles and the team performance turned around. In the newly formed Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League's Mid-Western Conference, the Eagles put up 157 victories in 205 games, three conference titles, and the 2009 Sutherland Cup as OHA and GOJHL Champions. On May 23, 2012, the team was relocated and renamed the Caledonia Corvairs. After a first-place finish in the 2012–13 in the Mid-Western Conference, the Corvairs applied to transfer to the Golden Horseshoe Conference to play against teams closer to their area. ==Season-by-season results== {  - !

The senatorial districts (except those in New York City) were made up of entire counties. 128 Assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts to a one-year term, the whole Assembly being renewed annually. The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards, forming a contiguous area, all in the same county. The City and County of New York was divided into four senatorial districts, and 16 Assembly districts. At this time there were two major political parties: the Democratic Party and the Whig Party. The Democratic Party was split into two factions: the Hard-Shells (or Hards) and the Soft-Shells (or Softs). In 1848, the Democratic Party had been split into Barnburners and Hunkers. The Barnburners left the party, and ran as the Free Soil Party, with presidential candidate Martin Van Buren. Afterwards the larger part of the Free Soilers re-joined the Democratic Party. During the following years, the Hunkers split over the question of reconciliation with the Barnburners. The Hards were against it, denying the Barnburners to gain influence in the Party. The Softs favored reconciliation with the intention of maintaining enough strength to win the elections. Both Hards and Softs favored a compromise on the slavery question: to maintain the status quo and to leave the decision to the local population in new Territories or States if they want slavery or not, as expressed in the Kansas- Nebraska Act. The Barnburners were against the permission of slavery in new Territories or States, but were now the minority in the party. The small faction of the Free Soil Party which advocated abolition of slavery, ran their own State ticket as the \\"Free Democratic Party\\". About this time the Temperance movement began to enter politics to advocate legal and/or political measures to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages, and endorsed candidates of the major parties who favored prohibition. ==Elections== The New York state election, 1853 was held on November 8. Due to the Democratic split, of the ten statewide elective offices up for election, eight were carried by the Whigs, and two by the Democrats. The approximate statewide party strength, as shown by the vote for Secretary of State, was: Whig 160,000; Hard 99,000; Soft 96,000; and Free Democrats 14,000. ==Sessions== The Legislature met for the regular session at the Old State Capitol in Albany on January 3, 1854; and adjourned on April 17. Robert H. Pruyn (W) was elected Speaker with 74 votes against 24 for George De Witt Clinton (Hard) and 17 for Jonathan C. Collins (Soft). On January 20, the Legislature passed \\"An Act to perfect an amendment of the Constitution, providing means for the completion of the canals of this State\\". On January 30, Andrew B. Dickinson (W) was elected President pro tempore of the State Senate. On February 15, a special election was held at which the Canal Amendment was ratified by the voters with 185,771 votes For; and 60,526 votes Against the proposed amendment.see Documents of the Senate (77th Session) (1854; No. 65, pg. 41ff) On April 4, the Legislature elected Victor M. Rice (W) as the first State Superintendent of Public Instruction. ==State Senate== Districts * 1st District: Queens, Richmond and Suffolk counties * 2nd District: Kings County * 3rd District: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th wards of New York City * 4th District: 7th, 10th, 13th and 17th wards of New York City * 5th District: 8th, 9th and 14th wards of New York City * 6th District: 11th, 12th, 15th, 16th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st and 22nd wards of New York City * 7th District: Putnam, Rockland and Westchester counties * 8th District: Columbia and Dutchess counties * 9th District: Orange and Sullivan counties * 10th District: Greene and Ulster counties * 11th District: Albany and Schenectady counties * 12th District: Rensselaer County * 13th District: Saratoga and Washington counties * 14th District: Clinton, Essex and Warren counties * 15th District: Franklin and St. Lawrence counties * 16th District: Fulton, Hamilton, Herkimer and Montgomery counties * 17th District: Delaware and Schoharie counties * 18th District: Chenango and Otsego counties * 19th District: Oneida County * 20th District: Madison and Oswego counties * 21st District: Jefferson and Lewis counties * 22nd District: Onondaga County * 23rd District: Broome, Cortland and Tioga counties * 24th District: Cayuga and Wayne counties * 25th District: Seneca, Tompkins and Yates counties * 26th District: Chemung and Steuben counties * 27th District: Monroe County * 28th District: Genesee, Niagara and Orleans counties * 29th District: Livingston and Ontario counties * 30th District: Allegany and Wyoming counties * 31st District: Erie County * 32nd District: Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties Note: There are now 62 counties in the State of New York.

Elections to the Wigan council were held on Thursday, 7 May 1987, with one third of the council up for election. Previous to the election there had been two by-elections held, resulting in a Labour gain of the seat being fought in Swinley from the Conservatives and Labour retaining one of their Hindley Green seats. Participation for this election increased substantially from the previous year's lows. Only one ward went unopposed (Leigh Central) as Labour reliably provided a full-slate of candidates, the Alliance all but Atherton and the Conservatives up from 16 to 18, by way of fielding candidates in the Labour strongholds of Abram and Worsley Mesnes this time around. An Independent Labour candidate also fought and won Hindley, with an Independent victory last seen in 1976, and Independent representation in 1980, when that same victor failed to survive the re-warding. The results seen an end to four years of consecutive increases in Labour's share, peaking with last year's all-time high, as they slipped back into a respectable high-fifties and their loss dispersing to each of the opposition parties. Labour lost four seats in total, with the aforementioned Independent Labour loss in Hindley, an Alliance casualty from last year's elections re-elected in Winstanley, another loss to Alliance in Aspull-Standish and the Conservatives comfortable retaking the seat in Swinley they'd lost in the earlier mentioned by-election. These losses were offset somewhat by a gain from Alliance in Tyldesley East, returning the ward to entire Labour representation. Overall turnout rose to an above-average 37.1%. ==Election result== This result had the following consequences for the total number of seats on the Council after the elections: {  - ! valign=top colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width: 230px\\"Party ! valign=top style=\\"width: 30px\\"Previous council ! valign=top style=\\"width: 30px\\"New council - ! style=\\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\\"   Labour  65  62 - ! style=\\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\\"   SDP-Liberal Alliance  5  6 - ! style=\\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\\"   Conservatives  2  3 - ! style=\\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\\"   Independent Labour  0  1 - ! colspan=2 Total ! style=\\"text-align: center\\" 72 ! colspan=3 72 - ! colspan=2 Working majority ! ! } ==Ward resultsReferences== Category:1987 English local elections 1987 Category:1980s in Greater Manchester ","title":"1987 Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council election"},{"id":"35929110","text":"In audio and recording, what is known colloquially as an anchor point is a center position in a stereo mix reserved for only three or four important tracks.Hodgson, Jay (2010).

In 1921 he returned to the Caribbean with his wife Clara and young family. He briefly worked in Trinidad, then went on to become chief medical supervisor in Dominica. Move to Bermuda In 1924, Gordon went to Bermuda, where he would set up a busy medical practice on Heathcote Hill in Somerset. According to biographer Ira Philip, Gordon \\"was brought to Bermuda by Sandys businessman William Robinson to fill a void caused by the death of black Dr Arnold Packwood. The all white local medical board was embarrassed when Dr Gordon passed what he termed was an impossible examination which he contended was calculated to fail him.\\"Ira Philip, \\"Dr Olivia Tucker — pioneering pharmacist denied the opportunity to work in her homeland\\", The Royal Gazette, 8 March 2013. Gordon began to take up the cause of black nurses and the discrimination they faced in employment in Bermuda, writing a series of letters dating from 1929 to the editor of The Royal Gazette criticising the refusal of the Bermuda Welfare Society to hire Blacks as district nurses. After decades of lobbying, the first black district nurse to be hired was Leonie Harford in 1963. ==Political life== After standing unsuccessfully for Parliament in 1933 and 1943,Eva N. Hodgson, Second Class Citizens; First Class Men, 2nd edition, Bermuda: The Writers Machine, 1988, p. 67. Gordon won a seat in St George's in 1946. Name change On 22 June 1947,Mazumbo: 100 Facts and Quotes by Dr. E. F. Gordon, Writers' Machine, 1994, pp. 14, 33. in protest at the fact that his fellow parliamentarians persistently refused to address him by his correct title, and that a Bermuda newspaper, the Mid-Ocean News, prefixed \\"Mr.\\" to the names of white members of Bermuda's Parliament (second oldest in the world), but called him simply Gordon,Carl Murphy, \\"Beautiful Bermuda  Call Him Mister\\", Richmond Afro American, 6 December 1947. he announced that henceforth he was to be known by the African name of Mazumbo, with no prefix. His notice to this effect in The Royal Gazette read: :\\"I, Edgar Fitzgerald Gordon, Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery of Edinburgh University, President General of the Bermuda Industrial Union, President of the Progressive Bermuda League and Member of Parliament for St. George's, hereby declare that from henceforth I shall be known as Mazumbo.\\" He gave as explanation: \\"The name Gordon, which I inherited, reminds me very painfully that some Scotsman in some other age compelled a grandmother of mine to submit to his desires. In Bermuda I am black and treated as Bermuda treats the black people.Hodgson (1988, pp. 70–71) writes: \\"The daily paper often underscored its contempt for coloured people by refusing to attach a title to them in any reference to them.... [Dr. Gordon's] gesture had the value of drawing the insult to the attention of many Negroes, who, from long familiarity, tended to take so many insults for granted. It was part of Dr. Gordon's overall programme of stimulating awareness on the part of the people who were so hard pressed that they had little time to think about the basis of their problems. He understood, very well, that support was gained for these political battles through starkly presented ideas and the simple statement of the injustices which the people faced in their daily lives.\\" So I want to be called by a name that belongs to my race and requires no prefix.\\" He was further quoted as saying that he had taken his new name from \\"a famous West African chieftain, who had once been received by Queen Victoria\\".\\"BERMUDA: Grandpa Was a Scotsman\\", 21 July 1947; cited in Time, 21 December 2011 (subscription required). This was a reference to a 19th-century Trinidadian lawyer called Emmanuel Lazare, popularly known as Mazumbo (or Mzumbo) Lazare, about whom Maureen Warner-Lewis has written: \\"although born in the Antilles, Lazare appropriated, or condoned the use of, an overtly African designation. The name was a symbol of his identification with black people and the poor. He was a defender of their rights, joined the Pan-African Association founded in 1901 in England by fellow Trinidadian Henry Sylvester Williams, and became a moving spirit behind democratic political reforms at the turn of the twentieth century.\\" This characterisation of Mazumbo Lazare is additional evidence for Gordon's motivation in associating himself with the name.Maureen Warner-Lewis, Central Africa in the Caribbean: Transcending time, Transforming Cultures. Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies Press, 2003; p. 80. Personality in Parliament As a Member of the Colonial Parliament (MCP), Gordon was a fiery and sometimes controversial orator. After the death in July 1948 of the Speaker of the House of Assembly Sir Reginald Conyers (who in his will left money for the Port Royal School in Hamilton, providing it was \\"used for the education of white children\\"), Gordon told a public meeting that he had only attended Conyers' funeral to \\"make sure he was put in the hole\\". According to the historian and activist Eva Hodgson, Gordon's \\"dramatic personality, his drive, and his unabashed theatricals had done what no one else either could do, or chose to do. He had alerted the Negro masses, he had given expression to their unvoiced despair and anger, often his words had given shape and form to emotions which they themselves could hardly define.\\"Hodgson (1988), p. 124. Bermuda Workers' Association (BWA) Championing the rights of black and working-class Bermudians, Gordon was asked to become president of the Bermuda Workers' Association (BWA) in 1944, which fought for trade union rights and was committed to the removal of segregation and the adoption of universal adult suffrage. Membership of the BWA had by then dwindled to 200 but under Gordon's vigorous leadership it increased to 5,000 in 1945.W. S. Zuill, The Story of Bermuda and Her People (1973), Macmillan Caribbean, 2nd revised edition 1983, p. 200. In 1946, he began his campaign to petition for social and constitutional change, and in that year the Legislature passed Bermuda's first Trade Union and Disputes Act, which was designed to curb the fledgling BWA, making it illegal for a union to have a newspaper or operate a business. Gordon took the lead in the subsequent establishment that year of the Bermuda Industrial Union (BIU),Robert J. Alexander with Eldon M. Parker, A History of Organized Labor in the English- Speaking West Indies, Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2004, pp. 101–02.\\"From BWA to BIU\\", BIU History. and the BWA for the time being continued as its political arm. Petition to British Colonial Office During an extended visit to England from December 1946 to March 1947, Gordon presented a petition containing more than 5,000 signaturesGovernment of Bermuda website. to the British Colonial Secretary from the Bermuda Workers' Association outlining various concerns, including the limited franchise, segregation, and restricted occupational opportunities.\\"1946 – Dr. E. F. Gordon delivers Bermuda Workers’ Association Petition to the Colonial Office in Great Britain\\", The Evolution of Bermuda's Franchise, compiled by James E. Smith. Parliamentary Registry.\\"When the times they were a-changin’\\", The Royal Gazette, 9 September 2015. Only seven percent of the population could vote, and (as Meredith Ebbin notes) there were more votes cast than actual voters because a property owner could vote in every parish where he owned land. It was a system that gave \\"the monied classes a distinct and definite control over the election results\\", Gordon said, pointing out that while the UK and its dependencies had undertaken voting reforms, Bermuda had operated under the same system since 1620.Meredith Ebbin, \\"To vote or not to vote: it was not always an option\\", BDA Sun, 14 December 2012. The matter was debated in the British Parliament, which while condemning many of the practices highlighted in the petition refused Dr. Gordon's request for a Royal Commission to investigate social, political and economic conditions on the island. The Colonial Secretary subsequently issued a document (Command Paper 7093), sent to the Governor, Admiral Sir Ralph Leatham, strongly recommending positive and progressive changes to the colony's discriminatory laws.National Hero Profile: Dr. E. F. Gordon, Bernews, 29 April 2011.\\"Significant Events in Bermuda\\", Bermuda Parliament. A Joint Committee of the Bermuda Legislative Council and House of Assembly was formed to study the matter; however, its report in April 1948 recommended against changing the colony's Jim Crow laws, holding that \\"the early adoption of adult franchise would be prejudicial to the best interests of Bermuda\\". (It would not be until 1959 that segregation ended, with the BIU playing a key role in the civil disobedience that brought about the change.)Steven High, Base Colonies in the Western Hemisphere, 1940–1967, Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 133–34. At the 1948 election, Gordon lost his House of Assembly seat – a setback attributable to his preoccupation with a dock workers' dispute that year, which had limited the time he could devote to his Parliamentary duties – but he was re-elected in 1953. Queen's visit to Bermuda In November 1953, when the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II made Bermuda the first (24-hour) stop in her tour of the Commonwealth, Gordon learned that of more than 1,000 guests to be invited to a Government House garden party in her honour only 60 were black, and that not a single black Bermudian had been asked to attend the official state dinner. With the intention of focusing world attention on Bermuda's racially stratified society, Gordon passed this news to the British press and Reuters reported the resultant angry protests from the Daily Mirror and the Daily Herald. In its editorial the Herald stated: \\"Perhaps others may benefit from this instance of gross ill manners. It is time everyone from Governors downwards grasped the facts about this British Commonwealth. Within its frontiers coloured people outnumber whites by more than eight to one. One of the moral pledges by which it is held together is that the colour bar should be utterly destroyed as speedily as possible....\\" As Bernews notes: \\"The Queen set foot in Bermuda the day the story broke. She was photographed that same afternoon meeting a broadly smiling, tail-coated Dr. Gordon in St. George’s.\\" ==Cricket== Keenly interested in cricket, Gordon believed that Bermuda would benefit by closer contact with the islands of the West Indies, which were then gaining ascendancy in Test cricket. He championed the Bermudian cricketer Alma Hunt, who in 1933 went to Trinidad to take part in the trial games from which would be selected the West Indies team for the Test series in England that summer. Although proving himself both on and off the field, Hunt was not eventually given a place.Ira Philip, Freedom Fighters (From Monk To Mazumbo), London: Akira Press, 1987, p. 144. Gordon pointed out that Hunt's status would have been more assured had there been an official body to deal with finance and represent him, and advocated for a Bermuda Cricket Board of Control, which was eventually formed in 1938. Gordon was instrumental in bringing about the first ever West Indian cricket tour to Bermuda in 1939, which was headed by Trinidadian Ben Sealey.Ira Philip, in Freedom Fighters (1987), pp. 152–58, quotes a letter dated 20 October 1953 from Gordon to the Mid-Ocean News, detailing Gordon's role in the sequence of events. ==Family life== Gordon and his Dominica-bornBurgess, Black history month: Saluting our heroes.

The series was created by Iginio Straffi, founder of the Rainbow animation studio. The season focuses on the Winx Club's third and final year at the Alfea College for Fairies, where they strive to earn an enhancement to their powers called Enchantix. The Trix escape from their prison in the Omega Dimension and bring back a new villain named Valtor, who has a special connection with Bloom. In 2011, the American company Viacom became a co-owner of the Rainbow studio, and Viacom's Nickelodeon began producing a Winx Club revival series. Before airing the Nick-produced episodes, Nickelodeon U.S. rebroadcast the third season under the title Winx Club: Enchantix from 14 November to 26 December 2011. ==Overview== The Winx Club begin their third and final year at Alfea. As Winx fairies, the six best friends learn of their full-fledged fairy form, Enchantix, that can only be achieved when a Winx fairy rescues someone from her own home world and shows great courage, bravery, self-sacrifice, and compassion in doing so. The season focuses mainly on Bloom discovering the truth and whereabouts of her birth parents-Oritel and Marion. In the Omega Dimension, the Trix find and release a powerful and vengeful sorcerer named Valtor, who has a tragic connection to Bloom, as he was directly involved in the destruction of Bloom's home world, Domino, seventeen years ago alongside the three Ancient Witches. They choose to forge an alliance and plan to invade several areas in the realm of Magix and seek vengeance on those who imprisoned them by stealing their exceptionally strong, magical and mystical treasures and immeasurable power sources of each realm. With their newly strong Enchantix powers, Flora, Stella, Aisha, Tecna, and Musa are able to use strong, incredible power and can miniaturize themselves at will. Bloom, however, cannot miniaturize herself due to the fact that her Enchantix is not complete. The Winx begin their third and final year at Alfea, learning about their unique Enchantix transformations, acquired by selflessly sacrificing, or risking sacrificing, themselves for someone from their home world (or even everyone from every world, in what ends up being Tecna's case) and showing great bravery and courage in doing so. With no one from her home world to save, Bloom must acquire her Enchantix form and tremendous power on Pyros, the island of dragons. ==EpisodesReferences * Winx Club website Category:Winx Club ","title":"Winx Club (season 3)"},{"id":"35929170","text":"Immanuel Church is a church at Forhåbningsholms Allé 20 in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen, Denmark. It belongs to Københavns Valgmenighed, a Grundtvigian congregation under Church of Denmark. The building was designed by Andreas Clemmesen and completed in 1893. The artists Niels and Joakim Skovgaard and Niels Larsen Stevns, all three members of the congregation, decorated the church building together with a group of other artists, providing a series of glass mosaics above the entrances as well as the church furnishings. The church is built as a typical danish Gesamtkunstwerk in skønvirke style. ==History== The church in 1895 The church was built for the first Grundtvigian congregation in Denmark which had separated from the Vartov congregation. The congregation first assembled at a local folk high school on Cjr. Winters Vej, but soon began construction of the new church which was consecrated on 29 October 1893. The detached clock tower was designed by af R. V. Rue in 1904 and completed in 1905 together with some of the surrounding features. ==Architecture== The semi-circular choir seen from the east The church is built in large red brick of the type in Denmark known as Munkesten in a Romanesque Revival style inspired by Italian churches in Ravenna and Sienna. It is a rectangular building under a barrel vaulted roof with a semi- circular choir to the east. The main entrance in the western gable The round- arched entrance is located in the west gable. It has a tympanum with a glass mosaic. Four additional entrances, two on each side of the building, also have glass mosaics in their tympana. The eastern mosaic on the south side was designed by Niels Skovgaard, while the rest are by Joakim Skovgaard. The north and south sides also have double-height windows.

An independent commission organized by the King of Bahrain concluded in November 2011 that many of the detained health workers had been subject to torture and abuse while in police detention. ==Role of health workers in the Bahrain uprising== Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw sustained pro-democracy protests, centered at Pearl Roundabout in the capital of Manama, as part of the wider Arab Spring. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later referred to by protesters as Bloody Thursday), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured. Health workers played an important role in documenting the injuries, which were at the time downplayed or denied by the government of Bahrain. Rheumatologist Fatima Haji, for example, appeared on Al Jazeera television news in a \\"hysterical\\" state, describing Isa Abdul Hasan, a man in his 60s who died in her hospital of a head wound he had received from police: \\"I just started shouting: 'What the hell did this guy do, he was an old man. What did he do to deserve this?'\\" She later stated that following her arrest, her interrogations were centered on this television appearance. At Salmaniya Medical Complex, doctors joined the protests themselves, speaking to protesters and media from the hospital stairs, after authorities blocked ambulances from bringing injured protesters there for care. The military responded by naming the hospital an opposition stronghold, taking it over on March 16. ==Arrests and charges== In March and April 2011, twenty health workers were arrested on a variety of felony charges for their actions during the protests, while an additional twenty-eight were arrested for misdemeanors. The total number of arrested health workers exceeded seventy. Dr. Ali Al-Ekri was arrested while performing surgery at Salmaniya Medical Complex. Charges against the doctors included \\"occupying a hospital, stockpiling weapons, spreading lies and false news, inciting hatred of Bahrain's rulers and calling for their overthrow, and withholding treatment of Sunnis\\". The government additionally alleged that blood from hospital blood banks had been used to exaggerate wounds, that health workers had transported weapons to the protesters by ambulance, and that AK-47s had been confiscated inside the hospital on a police raid. State media described the defendants as having \\"a terrorist aim\\". According to the prosecutor's case, al-Ekri acted as the group's ringleader, organizing staff at Salmaniya to oppose the Bahraini government. Al-Ekri was well known in Bahrain previous to the uprising for a January 2009 trip to the Gaza Strip to provide aid to Palestinians during the Gaza War. On his return, he received a number of awards, including one from the king. After his arrest, Al-Ekri stated that he was being persecuted for his comments to the media about police violence: \\"They know we witnessed all the crimes of the regime and we stood strong by injured people and we talked to the media ... Anywhere, like in Gaza and in Yemen now, doctors speak about what they see.\\" The defendants denied all charges and maintained that the accusations were politically motivated. In a joint statement, they held that \\"our only crime was that during the unrest earlier this year, we were outspoken witnesses to the bloodshed and the brutal treatment by the security forces.\\" Bahraini MP Jamal Fakhro responded that Bahrain jails only \\"people who prefer to play politics rather than be doctors\\", not \\"doctors who treat people\\". A spokesman for Bahrain's Information Affairs Authority stated that the health workers were fabricating their stories and that they were \\"collaborating with the hard liners\\" in \\"an attempted coup d'etat\\". British journalist Robert Fisk, who had been present at the protests, accused the Bahraini government of dishonesty: \\"Doctors I saw, drenched in their patients' blood, desperately trying to staunch the bullet wounds of pro-democracy demonstrators shot in cold blood by Bahraini soldiers and police, are now on trial ... How could these fine medical men and women have been trying to \\"topple\\" the monarchy? The idea that these 48 defendants are guilty of such a vicious charge is not just preposterous. It is insane, a total perversion – no, the total opposite – of the truth.\\" In response, Bahrain's Information Affairs Authority threatened him with libel action. The BICI supported the government account that medics occupied the first floor of Salmaniya hospital. However, it rejected the claim that medics had supplied protesters with weapons and stated that evidence supporting allegations that medics denied health care to patients was \\"hardly conclusive,\\" as paraphrased by Al Jazeera English.\\"Bahrain court upholds verdict in medics trial\\". Al Jazeera English. 1 October 2012. Retrieved 1 October 2012. ==Trials==  Felony trials  The twenty health workers facing felony charges were found guilty and sentenced on 29 September 2011 by the military National Safety Court of First Instance. According to the International Federation for Human Rights, the trial lasted only a few minutes. Thirteen of the twenty received sentences of fifteen years' imprisonment, while five were sentenced to five years and two were sentenced to ten years. The sentences were a blow to the hopes of human rights groups lobbying on the health workers' behalf, which had predicted authorities would ease their stance after releasing some defendants on bail. The defendants were scheduled to be retried by civilian courts after widespread international criticism. The prosecutor's office stated that the defendants' confessions, which had allegedly been given under torture, would not be used as evidence. On 10 March 2012, Bahrain's Information Affairs Authority announced that the criminal charges against fifteen of the twenty would be dropped, and referred to a review board. Their decision was reversed without explanation the following week. The trials were postponed to 14 June. On 14 June the court acquitted nine medics and downgraded sentences against nine others. Ali Al- Ekri was sentenced to five years imprisonment, another doctor to three years and seven were given from one month to one year. Two other doctors did not appeal their sentences of 15 years' imprisonment, instead fleeing the country. On 1 October, the Court of Cassation, the country's highest court, closed the first case involving twenty medics by upholding jail sentences on the remaining nine. Although the verdict is final, activist Mohamed al-Maskati said that they could still be pardoned by the king.  Misdemeanor trials  Of the 28 health workers charged with misdemeanors, 23 were convicted and five acquitted on 21 November 2012. Those convicted were sentenced to either serve three months in prison or pay 200 dinars (US$530). On 28 March 2013, 21 of the 23 convictions were overturned by an appeals court. The remaining two health workers had chosen not to appeal their sentences. == Torture of health workers == Many of the detained health workers stated that they were ill-treated or tortured while in custody, leading Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International to call for independent investigations. Authorities reportedly forced detainees to stand for long periods, beat them with boards and rubber hoses, and deprived them of sleep in an effort to force confessions. In one case, a prisoner alleged that he had been forced to sign papers while blindfolded. Dr. Fatima Haji alleged that she was blindfolded and beaten in an effort to make her confess to faking the injuries to protesters during her Al Jazeera interview; she later identified her interrogator as a distant relative of the king. Ibrahim al-Demastani, head of the Bahrain Nurse's Society, alleged that he was deliberately kicked and kneed by guards in his back at a spot where he had told them he had a prolapsed disc; he was then denied medical care until he happened to meet a police officer to whom he had once taught first aid. In an investigation by Human Rights Watch, Dr. Rula al- Saffar stated that she had been given electric shocks in the hands and face, and threatened with rape. Al-Ekri described being \\"constantly beaten by cables, hoses, and fists\\", as well as being forced to stand for a full day. Dr. Ghassan Dhaif stated that he remained handcuffed and blindfolded for 21 days, and \\"was beaten every hour\\". Dr. Basim Dhaif alleged that he was beaten in front of his children at his home at the time of his arrest, and eventually signed a false confession while in custody after authorities threatened to harm his family. Dr. Nader Dawani, a pediatrician, stated that he was forced to stand for seven days while being beaten by a female officer, and that other officers had tried to force a bottle into his anus. The BICI verified that \\"many detainees were subjected to torture and other forms of physical and psychological abuse\\". The report stated that medics were among the tortured. == Reactions ==  Domestic  Many Sunnis supporting the government of Bahrain stood against the doctors, accusing them of \\"deliberately worsening patient injuries for cameras\\" as well as \\"causing the deaths of protesters in order to discredit security personnel\\". The BICI report said that some of the Shia health workers refused to treat Sunni patients and instead used their positions to support activists by promoting their causes.  International  The trials drew sustained international attention, with governments, medical professional organizations, and human rights organizations issuing statements on behalf of the health workers. = Governments = The U.S. State Department stated that it was \\"deeply disturbed\\" by the sentences and urged the Bahraini government \\"to abide by its commitment to transparent judicial proceedings, including a fair trial, access to attorneys, and verdicts based on credible evidence\\". Following the conviction of nine medics on the retrials, the department said it was \\"deeply disappointed\\" that not all medics were acquitted\\"Convicted Bahrain Medical Workers Seek International Support\\". Voice of America. 16 June 2012. Retrieved 24 June 2012. and that \\"convictions appear to be based, at least in part, on the defendants' criticisms of government actions and policies\\". United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also expressed concern at the legality of the military trials, calling on the Bahraini government \\"to ensure the application of due process and respect for international human rights norms\\". A spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights noted the office's \\"severe concerns\\" over \\"serious due process irregularities\\" in the trials. = Health worker organizations = In a letter published in The Guardian, the British Medical Association expressed its \\"deep concern\\" over the twenty felony convictions, stating that \\"all the independent evidence points to a politically motivated trial which has demonstrated a disregard for proper judicial process and fundamental principles of medical neutrality.\\" The Australian Medical Association condemned the prosecutions, describing the defendants as \\"simply doing their jobs in places of conflict\\". Doctors Without Borders criticized doctors at Salmaniya Hospital for joining the protests, but described the military response as \\"exponentially more damaging\\" to medical neutrality. In May 2011, the group issued a statement on behalf of the health workers, urging that \\"doctors and nurses must be allowed to provide healthcare in line with medical ethics, without the fear of reprisal.\\" The World Health Organization expressed similar concerns, stating that \\"health-care workers must be able to carry out their duty to treat injured people, regardless of their political affiliation, and even in times of conflict.\\" The International Council of Nurses and World Medical Association issued a joint statement objecting to the closed military trial and stated its belief that \\"Doctors and nurses have an ethical duty to care for patients irrespective of their race, colour, creed and political affiliation. No health professional should be put on trial for looking after injured and dying people.\\" The U.K.-based Royal College of Nursing wrote to the Bahraini government on the health workers' behalf, as well as sending them a direct video message of support in which General Secretary Peter Carter said, \\"All you were doing was your job. You were trying to care for people.\\" = Human rights organizations = International human rights groups said the accusations against doctors were \\"reprisals for treating injured protesters\\". Amnesty International described the charges as \\"ludicrous\\" and a \\"travesty of justice\\". The organization called for a letter- writing campaign on behalf of the convicted health workers, stating its belief \\"that the charges were politically motivated, that the proceedings did not meet international fair trial standards and that [the health workers] may be prisoners of conscience\\". Following the conviction of nine medics in the retrials, Amnesty said it was a \\"dark day for justice\\" and named them prisoners of conscience. Freedom House called the trials part of \\"a pattern of repression that belies any promises of reform and honest political discourse by the government or the ruling family\\". Front Line Defenders also described the arrests as part of a \\"widespread pattern of repression\\". Human Rights Watch protested the alleged torture of the medics, condemned what it called the \\"fundamental unfairness\\" of the trials, and urged the appeals court to overturn the \\"flawed convictions\\". The Gulf Centre for Human Rights called on Bahrain's king to \\"intervene personally and immediately\\" to have the charges against the health workers dropped. The U.S.-based Physicians for Human Rights also called for the health workers' immediate release. == See also == *College of Health Sciences, Bahrain ==References== Category:Bahraini uprising of 2011 Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Bahrain Category:Human rights abuses in Bahrain ","title":"Bahrain health worker trials"},{"id":"35929335","text":"Facade facing Campo Santa Margherita The Scuola Grande dei Carmini is a confraternity building in Venice, Italy. It is located in the sestiere of Dorsoduro, before Campo dei Carmini and Campo Santa Margherita, upon which its facade looks. It stands, separated by an alley, to the northeast of the church of Santa Maria dei Carmini. ==History== It was the former home of the Venetian Scuola of the same name. The Scuola was founded in 1594 under Doge Pasquale Cicogna, and was the last of its kind to be recognized as a Scuola Grande in 1767 by the Council of Ten. Initially it was located in the Convent of the Church of Carmini, whose structure also faces the campo of the same name. The present scuola building was designed by Francesco Caustello and Baldassare Longhena. In 1807, the confraternity was suppressed by Napoleon's anticlerical decrees. The Austrians allowed the Scuola to reopen, and it continues activities today, though mostly cultural activities. == Exterior == The entrance facade and porch are of Baroque style, are facing south and overlook the southwestern tip of Campo Santa Margherita, while the west facade is parallel to the left of the nave of Carmini church. and visible from Campo dei Carmini. The whiteness of the two facades is due to their Istrian stone surface and opposes the black thick wrought iron balustrades that close all the windows of the building. == Interior == The Scuola dei Carmini contains many works of great artistic value, due to their presence in their original location.  The Chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel  Inside the school, on the ground floor, there is a large chapel (Cappella della Madonna del Carmelo) with a single nave, baroque style, the ceiling is apparent woodwork is remarkable. The main altar is dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, protector of the brotherhood, the painting of the altarpiece, an oil on canvas of the Venetian painter Sante Piatti, represents it.

Although the term is sometimes understood to describe marginal, unregulated, and even criminal activity, there is considerable overlap between the informal sector and formal economy, and the informal economy serves an important societal function in contributing to employment and economic growth. The informal economy in China represents a large portion of domestic output, consumption and employment. Employment in the urban sector represents a major part of the Chinese economy: approximately half of urban Chinese workers belong to the informal economy as of 2004.Johannes Jutting and Theodora Xenogiani, \\"Informal Employment and Internal Migration:The Case of China,\\" Organisation de Cooperation et de Developpement Economiques, (Beijing, Nov 2007).—a significant increase since the 1990s. It is described as fast-growing, dynamic, highly competitive, and it contributes substantially to economic growth. However, there are serious concerns about the lack of protections afforded to workers in the informal sector. In addition, China is a major part of the global informal sector, producing unregulated goods for consumption in Africa, Latin America, and elsewhere.National Public Radio, The ‘Informal Economy’ Driving World Business, 26 October 2011. According to Roberta Neuwirth, China’s rise as a global center of manufacturing owes, in part, to its willingness to trade in the informal economy (also known as “system D” trade).Robert Neuwirth, “Stealth of Nations: The Global Rise of the Informal Economy,” (Random House 2011. In some regions in China, local governments have adopted policies designed to encourage the informal economy to alleviate unemployment.Kristina Flodman Becker, The Informal Economy , Sida, March 2004. ==Development and causes== The informal economy in China, as it is currently conceptualized, arose amidst economic reforms that began in the 1970s. Prior to 1978, the centralized economy under Mao Zedong precluded the emergence of a private economy. As the country’s economy was liberalized and reformed under Deng Xiaoping, however, the private economy was permitted to develop, and often emerged in the form of unregulated micro-enterprises, family enterprises, or individual purveyors of goods and services. Some of the causes accounting for the rise of the informal sector of the Chinese economy includes weak legal and social safety nets; international demand for ‘System D’ products; economic shifts such as urbanization and the decline of state-owned enterprises. ==Employment in the informal economy== By some estimates, nearly half of employment in urban China is in the informal economy. Many of these workers—approximately 120 million to 150 million — are migrant workers who are not registered to work in cities, and therefore lack a number of formal protections. ==See also== *Black market *Jangmadang ==References== Category:Economy of China Category:Informal economy in Asia ","title":"Informal economy of China"},{"id":"35929353","text":"Niko Datković is a Croatian football, playing as a centre-back for Cracovia in Poland. ==Club career== Regarded as one of the club's greatest talents, Datković was a regular starter in Rijeka's defence during his first professional year with the club in 2011–12.

However, Duckworth never lived up to expectations as he struggled with weight problems. After a 6–6 start to the season, the Bullets struggles continued losing ten straight games, then suffering a nine-game losing streak in March. Injuries continued to bite the team as key players Rex Chapman, and top draft pick Calbert Cheaney missed significant stretches, and Pervis Ellison missed half of the season again. The Bullets finished last place in the Atlantic Division with a 24–58 record. Second-year forward Don MacLean led them with 18.2 points per game (tied with Chapman), and was named Most Improved Player of The Year. Following the season, Ellison signed as an unrestricted free agent with the Boston Celtics, Michael Adams was traded to the Charlotte Hornets, and head coach Wes Unseld was fired. ==Draft picks== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" !

It was a fine dining restaurant that was awarded one Michelin star in 1988 and retained that rating until 1992. Historical overview Michelin stars 1986 t/m 1990 Last visited 24 July 2011 Historical overview Michelin stars 1991 t/m 1996 Last visited 24 July 2011 In the time of the Michelin stars, head chef was Robert Kranenborg. Hotel Corona is located in three 17th century buildings, within sight of the Dutch parlementary buildings. It reopened after an extensive renovation in January 2012. Restaurant Les Saison closed down in 1992. Partly, because head chef Kranenborg moved on to La Rive in Amsterdam. But also because the owners, Heineken International, sold the hotel to Ad Ph. Siliakus. The new owner, later Chagall Hotels & Restaurants and Hampshire Hospitality & Leisure, wanted a brasserie instead of a fine dining restaurant. ==See also== *List of Michelin starred restaurants in the Netherlands ==References == Category:Restaurants in The Hague Category:Michelin Guide starred restaurants in the Netherlands Category:Defunct restaurants in the Netherlands ","title":"Corona (restaurant)"},{"id":"35929479","text":"The 1994–95 NBA season was the Bullets' 34th season in the National Basketball Association.1994-95 Washington Bullets During the offseason, the Bullets acquired Scott Skiles from the Orlando Magic and hired Jim Lynam as head coach. After drafting Juwan Howard with the fifth pick in the 1994 NBA draft, the Bullets traded Tom Gugliotta to the Golden State Warriors for Howard's former \\"Fab Five\\" teammate at Michigan Chris Webber. However, after a 4–1 start to the season, the Bullets struggled as they lost 25 of their next 28 games. At midseason, things got worse as Kevin Duckworth was suspended indefinitely after 40 games for not staying in physical condition, where he weighed over 310lbs. The Bullets posted a 13-game losing streak near the end of the season, and finished last place in the Atlantic Division with a 21–61 record. Webber averaged 20.1 points, 9.6 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game. Following the season, Rex Chapman was traded to the Miami Heat, Duckworth was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, Skiles signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia 76ers, Don MacLean and Doug Overton were both dealt to the Denver Nuggets, and Larry Stewart left in the 1995 NBA Expansion Draft. ==Draft picks== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\"  - ! style=\\"\\" width:10%;\\"Round ! style=\\"\\" width:10%;\\"Pick ! style=\\"\\" width:20%;\\"Player ! style=\\"\\" width:15%;\\"Position ! style=\\"\\" width:15%;\\"Nationality ! style=\\"\\" width:20%;\\"College / Team -  1  5  Juwan Howard  SF   Michigan -  2  32  Jim McIlvaine  C   Marquette } ==Roster== Roster Notes *Guard Brent Price missed the entire season due to a knee injury. *Center Kevin Duckworth was suspended indefinitely for not maintaining playing shape. *Rookie forward Anthony Tucker was released on April 19. ==Regular season== Season standings :z – clinched division title :y – clinched division title :x – clinched playoff spot Record vs. opponents {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=281994–95 NBA records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !008080;color:#800080;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000000;color:#5787DC;width=35\\"CLE !00008B;color:#008000;width=35\\"DAL !141A44;color:#BC2224;width=35\\"DEN !0000FF;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"DET !0000FF;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"GSW !FF0000;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !00471B;color:#5C378A;width=35\\"MIL !0000FF;color:#228B22;width=35\\"MIN !DC143C;color:#0000CD;width=35\\"NJN !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !FF0000;color:#0000FF;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !6846A8;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#FFC322;width=35\\"SEA !36004A;color:#FFFF00;width=35\\"UTA !DC143C;color:#0000CD;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  3–1  2–2  1–4  1–4  2–0  2–0  3–2  2–0  0–2  1–4  2–0  0–2  2–2  1–3  2–0  4–0  2–2  1–3  3–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  4–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Boston  1–3  —  1–3  0–4  2–2  1–1  1–1  3–1  2–0  1–1  2–2  0–2  1–1  4–1  1–3  2–0  2–3  0–5  2–3  3–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  3–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Charlotte  2–2  3–1  —  2–2  3–2  0–2  1–1  5–0  2–0  0–2  1–4  2–0  0–2  3–1  4–1  1–1  3–1  3–1  1–3  3–1  0–2  2–0  1–1  1–1  2–0  2–0  3–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Chicago  4–1  4–0  2–2  —  2–3  1–1  1–1  5–0  2–0  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  3–1  1–4  2–0  2–2  3–1  1–3  4–0  1–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–2  2–2 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Cleveland  4–1  2–2  2–3  3–2  —  0–2  1–1  2–2  2–0  0–2  2–3  1–1  1–1  1–3  4–0  1–1  4–0  2–2  1–3  3–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  3–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Dallas  0–2  1–1  2–0  1–1  2–0  —  1–4  1–1  3–1  2–3  1–1  3–1  1–3  0–2  1–1  4–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  2–0  0–4  3–1  2–2  2–3  0–4  2–4  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Denver  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  4–1  —  1–1  1–3  1–4  1–1  4–0  2–2  2–0  2–0  6–0  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  1–3  3–1  2–2  1–4  1–3  1–4  2–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Detroit  2–3  1–3  0–5  0–5  2–2  1–1  1–1  —  1–1  0–2  2–2  1–1  0–2  1–3  2–3  1–1  2–2  1–3  1–3  4–0  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–2  3–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Golden State  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  1–3  3–1  1–1  —  0–4  0–2  3–2  3–2  1–1  0–2  1–3  1–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  3–2  1–4  0–5  1–3  1–4  2–2  2–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Houston  2–0  1–1  2–0  1–1  2–0  3–2  4–1  2–0  4–0  —  1–1  3–1  0–4  2–0  1–1  3–2  2–0  0–2  0–2  2–0  3–1  1–3  3–1  1–5  0–4  2–3  2–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Indiana  4–1  2–2  4–1  2–2  3–2  1–1  1–1  2–2  2–0  1–1  —  2–0  1–1  2–2  3–2  2–0  3–1  1–3  2–2  4–0  1–1  1–1  2–0  2–0  1–1  0–2  3–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  L.A.

In his second season, Juwan Howard emerged as a star on the court and in the community, averaging 22.1 points per game while being selected to the 1996 NBA All-Star Game. However, Injuries would be an issue as Chris Webber was limited to 15 games following the lingering effect to his injured shoulder. Meanwhile, Price only appeared in just seven games due to a sore left heel, and Pack who played in 31 games was out with nerve damage in his right leg. After a 7-game winning streak, the Bullets lost their final four games and finished fourth in the Atlantic Division with a 39–43 record, which was an impressive 18-game improvement over their previous season. However, they missed the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season. 7'7\\" center Gheorghe Mureșan was named Most Improved Player of The Year, and top draft pick Rasheed Wallace made the All- Rookie Second Team. Following the season, Wallace was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, Pack was dealt to the New Jersey Nets, Price signed as a free agent with the Golden State Warriors while his brother Brent Price signed with the Houston Rockets, and second-year center Jim McIlvaine signed with the Seattle SuperSonics. ==Offseason== Draft picks { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" !

Lewis co-wrote the song with Mike Elizondo, James Fauntleroy, Justin Timberlake and Robin Tadross. It was produced by The Y's and co-produced by Elizondo. Lewis and Timberlake carried out the vocal production. Having wanted to work with Timberlake for a long time, the collaboration came to be after he had asked Lewis to perform at a charity concert he was holding in Las Vegas in October 2008. It was reported that they were going to cover Dolly Parton's song \\"I Will Always Love You\\" as a duet, however they worked together on new songs for Echo instead, and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" was created. Lewis revealed that her cover of \\"Run\\" inspired Timberlake. Lyrically, the song is about making difficult decisions in life and trying to take control of situations. The song garnered a mixed response from music critics. While Lewis' vocal performance relieved unanimous praise, some felt that the track lacked any soul or emotion. Its production received comparisons to Timberlake's songs \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"What Goes Around... Comes Around\\". Lewis has performed the song at Rock in Rio and it was included on her debut concert tour, The Labyrinth, and later on the accompanying DVD release, The Labyrinth Tour: Live from the O2. ==Background and development== Some of Alexandra Burke's (pictured) unfinished songs were also leaked along with Lewis' \\"Don't Let Me Down\\". Prior to creating \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" for Lewis' second studio album Echo, Justin Timberlake had asked the singer to perform at a charity concert that he was hosting in Las Vegas in October 2008. The singers got to know each other and became friends, resulting in Timberlake asking Lewis to join him in the recording studio to work on some material, which she accepted. In January 2009, it was reported that the pair were planning to cover Dolly Parton's song \\"I Will Always Love You\\" as a duet, and were going to record it sometime within the next couple of months when they both had some spare time in their busy schedules. In June 2009, Lewis confirmed that she was over halfway through the recording process for Echo in an interview with Digital Spy, and that she and Timberlake had collaborated on several tracks together. She said that Timberlake was \\"awesomely talented\\", and that he had contributed vocals on a couple of the songs. In a November 2009 interview, Lewis said that she had always wanted to work with Timberlake. In February 2010, she said that a few weeks after the two of them had met in Las Vegas, they went into a recording studio, where Lewis played him her cover of \\"Run\\". She revealed that Timberlake was \\"really inspired\\" after hearing \\"Run\\", and they created \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" shortly afterward. She characterised her time in the studio with him as \\"amazing\\" and Timberlake as \\"really hardworking and focused\\". Lewis said that her favourite song by him is \\"Cry Me a River\\", which critics later compared to \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" upon the release of Echo. Internet leak In August 2009, computer hackers leaked \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" on the internet. Record label SyCo and music trade body IFPI called in the police to help them find the hackers. Jeremy Banks, head of IFPI's Internet Anti-Piracy Unit, spoke about the situation in an interview for The Sun, saying \\"IFPI is working with SyCo and law enforcement agencies in the US and Europe to trace the individuals who stole the Leona Lewis/Justin Timberlake track\\". He clarified that the investigation was ongoing and stated that such pre-release leaks are damaging for the members who invest budgets in marketing and promotion before release. The Sun reported that SyCo's personal computers were also hacked the previous month and unfinished tracks by singer Alexandra Burke were also leaked. SyCo also expressed their opinion, stating that they believe the song was leaked by hackers and not by someone in the music industry. A representative for the BBC confirmed that the record label's personal computers had been under \\"sustained attack\\" for some time and said \\"We will certainly look to bring charges against those who are responsible.\\" ==Recording and composition== Mike Diver for BBC Music compared \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" to \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"What Goes Around... Comes Around\\" by Timberlake (pictured). \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" was co-written by Lewis with Mike Elizondo, James Fauntleroy, Timberlake and Robin Tadross. Production of the song was done by The Y's, while Elizondo served as the co-producer. Lewis and Timberlake carried out the vocal production. The track was recorded by Paul Folley at Henson Studios and was mixed by Jean-Marie Harvat at East West Studios, both of which are located in Los Angeles, California. Harvat was assisted in the mixing process by Mimi Parker. Larry Gold was enlisted as the string arranger. Timberlake also contributes uncredited background vocals. \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" appears as the eleventh track on the standard edition of Echo, and lasts for a duration of . The song appears as the tenth track on the North American edition of the album and lasts for one second less at . It was composed in the key of E Major using common time at 60 beats per minute. Instrumentation consists of a piano, guitar, strings, and \\"subtle\\" percussion. The style in which \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" was produced received comparisons to song recorded by Timberlake, including \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"What Goes Around... Comes Around\\". According to Michael Cragg of musicOMH, Lewis is singing about \\"making tough decisions and trying to take back control\\". ==Reception and live performances== Lewis performing \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" during The Labyrinth tour in Sheffield. Cragg wrote that \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" and another Echo track \\"I Got You\\" are \\"equally infectious\\"; he also praised Lewis' vocal performance and described it as \\"genuinely stirring\\". Nick Levine for Digital Spy was brief in his description of the song, simply calling it \\"lovely\\". BBC Music's Mike Diver wrote that although the track resembles Timberlake's songs \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"What Goes Around... Comes Around\\", Lewis fails to deliver \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" with \\"any comparable soulfulness.\\" As part of his review of Echo, Matthew Cole for Slant Magazine wrote that too much of the album is dominated by \\"thoughtless\\" ballads like \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\". While he noted that Lewis gives a \\"technically unimpeachable\\" vocal performance, he wrote that it does not compensate for the \\"dull arrangement\\" and lack of emotion in her delivery. Lewis performed \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" at the Rock in Rio festival held in Lisbon on 22 May 2010. The song was included as the second song on the set list of her debut concert tour, called The Labyrinth (2010). It was later included on the DVD release of the tour, The Labyrinth Tour: Live from the O2. Lewis performed the song in the first section of the set list, along with \\"Brave\\" as the opener, \\"Better in Time\\", \\"Whatever It Takes\\" and \\"Take a Bow\\". Jade Wright for the Liverpool Echo wrote that the singer belted out the track. The set was decorated in the style of a castle; acrobats performed as they were hanging from the ceiling on large pieces of fabric while Lewis wore a gold sequined dress and thigh high boots. ==Track listings== ;Echo standard edition ;Echo United States standard version ;The Labyrinth Tour: Live from the O2 ==Credits and personnel== ;Recording *Recorded at Henson Studios, Los Angeles, CA. *Mixed at East West Studios, Los Angeles, CA. ;Personnel *Songwriting – Mike Elizondo, James Fauntleroy, Leona Lewis, Justin Timberlake, Robin Tadross *Production – The Y's, Mike Elizondo (co-producer) *Vocal recording – Paul Folley *Vocal production – Leona Lewis, Justin Timberlake *Mixing – Jean-Marie Harvat *Assistant mixing – Mimi Parker *String arrangements – Larry Gold *Background vocals – Justin Timberlake (not credited in booklet) Credits adapted from the liner notes of Echo. ==References * Category:2000s ballads Category:2009 songs Category:Leona Lewis songs Category:Songs written by Leona Lewis Category:Songs written by Mike Elizondo Category:Songs written by James Fauntleroy Category:Songs written by Justin Timberlake Category:Songs recorded at Henson Recording Studios Category:Songs written by Rob Knox (producer) ","title":"Don't Let Me Down (Leona Lewis song)"},{"id":"35929520","text":"Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah!

It is not used in deaf education, which has been the domain of American Sign Language since about 1974, when a philosophy of Total Communication replaced previous Oralist approaches. A mixture of TTSL and ASL is used in Deaf associations, with TTSL being used more heavily in informal situations. The younger generation does not know the language well, as they only learn ASL in school, but teachers are starting to switch over to TTSL. Many people in Trinidad and Tobago use the name Trinidad and Tobago Sign Language to refer to any variety of signing in the islands, which includes a range of signing varieties from TTSL to ASL and various blended versions in- between.

Despite a stellar season last year, Juwan Howard signed a 7-year $100 million contract with the Miami Heat. However, the deal was voided claiming that Miami exceeded their salary cap. The Bullets quickly re-signed Howard, but would lose their first round draft pick next year. With a record of 22–24 at midseason, the Bullets fired head coach Jim Lynam, then after playing one game under assistant Bob Staak, they hired Bernie Bickerstaff as their new coach. Under Bickerstaff, the Bullets finished the season winning 16 of their final 21 games. On the final day of the regular season, the Bullets defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 85–81 at the Gund Arena to capture the #8 seed in the Eastern Conference. They finished fourth in the Atlantic Division with a 44–38 record, ending an eight-year playoff drought. Chris Webber led the team in scoring, rebounding and block shots. He was also selected for the 1997 NBA All-Star Game. In the first round of the playoffs, the Bullets were swept by the defending champion Chicago Bulls in three straight games. This would be their final playoff appearance until 2005. Game 3 of that series at US Airways Arena was officially their final game as the \\"Bullets\\". Following the season, the team changed its name to the \\"Wizards\\". ==Draft picks== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! C9143A; color:#0344AD\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round !

In 1739, he joined the Order of Saint Benedict, Camaldolese at the monastery of Sant'Apollinare in Classe near Ravenna. He adopted \\"Andrea\\" as his religious name on 29 June 1739. He was then sent to study at Bertinoro and Rome, where he studied philosophy and theology. He was ordained as a priest on 19 December 1744. After further studies in Bertinoro and Rome, Gioannetti returned to Bertinoro as its priest. On 19 December 1748, he returned to the monastery at Classe, becoming lector of philosophy. He later served as the theologian of Ferdinando Romoaldo Guiccioli, Archbishop of Ravenna, from 15 June 1753 until 1763. In 1763, he became procurator and economous of the monastery of Classe, later becoming its abbot in 1770. In 1773, he became abbot of the monastery of San Gregorio Magno al Celio in Rome. In this capacity, he served under Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Braschi, the monastery's commendatory abbot, who became Pope Pius VI in February 1775. On 29 January 1776, he was elected titular bishop of Emeria and became administrator of the Archdiocese of Bologna. He was consecrated as a bishop by Cardinal Giovanni Francesco Albani, Bishop of Ostia, at San Gregorio Magno al Celio on 4 February 1776. He arrived in Bologna on 5 March and began a canonical visitation. As head of the Papal Legation, he was also the secular administrator of Bologna. In the consistory of 23 June 1777, Pope Pius VI made Gioannetti a cardinal in pectore. This was published in the consistory of 15 December 1777, and Gioannetti received the red hat on 18 December 1777. He was awarded the pallium and the titular church of Santa Pudenziana on 30 March 1778. In 1792, the Archdiocese of Bologna was overrun with Catholic priests fleeing the French Revolution. Cardinal Gioannetti subsequently wrote denouncing the revolutionaries. In June 1796, the French troops of Napoleon entered the Archdiocese of Bologna. Over the next several years, Gioannetti worked to secure the position of Catholicism as the state religion, a position recognized in the March 1797 constitution of the Cispadane Republic, but Catholicism's favored position was reversed when the Cispadane Republic was merged with the Cisalpine Republic in July 1797. In March 1799, Austrian and Russian troops occupied Bologna, enabling Gioannetti to reestablish his authority. He participated in the papal conclave of 1799–1800 that elected Pope Pius VII. Shortly after returning to Bologna, he died on 8 April 1800. He is buried in Bologna Cathedral. ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:1722 births Category:1800 deaths Category:Italian cardinals Category:Cardinals created by Pope Pius VI ","title":"Andrea Gioannetti"},{"id":"35929590","text":"The 1997–98 NBA season was the Wizards' 37th season in the National Basketball Association.1997-98 Washington Wizards There was a new beginning for basketball in Washington, D.C. as the team changed its name to the \\"Wizards\\", fearing \\"Bullets\\" endorsed gun violence. The team also got a new logo, and new uniforms with blue, black and brown colors. The Wizards got off to a slow 5–11 start to the season, losing their first five home games at US Airways Arena before moving out of the longtime home that had been home to them since they moved to Washington. In December, they moved into their new arena, the MCI Center, posting a 24–12 home record for the remainder of the season. The Wizards won their final four games of the season to finish fourth in the Atlantic Division with a 42–40 record, falling just one game short of making the playoffs. Rod Strickland led the league with 10.5 assists per game and made the All-NBA Second Team. Following the season, Chris Webber was traded to the Sacramento Kings, and Gheorghe Mureșan, who missed the entire season with a foot injury was released. ==Offseason== Draft picks { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  2  45  God Shammgod  PG   Providence College - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  48  Predrag Drobnjak  C   } The Wizards forfeited their 1997 first round pick in connection with the signing of Juwan Howard in 1996.

Richmond had a solid season leading the team in scoring averaging 19.7 points per game. Meanwhile, Rod Strickland finished second in the league with 9.9 assists per game. However, the Wizards continued to under achieve as head coach Bernie Bickerstaff was fired after a 13–19 start, and was replaced with Jim Brovelli midway through the season. The team lost seven of their final nine games finishing sixth in the Atlantic Division with a disappointing 18–32 record. Following the season, Thorpe signed as a free agent with the Miami Heat, Calbert Cheaney signed with the Boston Celtics, Ben Wallace was traded to the Orlando Magic, and Brovelli was fired as coach. ==Draft picks== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  2  43  Jahidi White  PF/C   Georgetown } ==Roster== Roster Notes *Center Lorenzo Williams missed the entire season due to a foot fractures injury. ==Regular season== Season standings :z - clinched division title :y - clinched division title :x - clinched playoff spot Record vs. opponents {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=301998-99 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !008080;color:#800080;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000000;color:#5787DC;width=35\\"CLE !00008B;color:#008000;width=35\\"DAL !141A44;color:#BC2224;width=35\\"DEN !0C7674;color:#BB222C;width=35\\"DET !072E63;color:#DC5A34;width=35\\"GSW !002366;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !00471B;color:#5C378A;width=35\\"MIL !044D80;color:#000000;width=35\\"MIN !12305B;color:#C4CED4;width=35\\"NJN !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !000000;color:#BB9754;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !6846A8;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#992634;width=35\\"SEA !7436BF;color:#BE0F34;width=35\\"TOR !644A9C;color:#149BC7;width=35\\"UTA !0CB2AC;color:#000000;width=35\\"VAN !044D7D;color:#BC7A44;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  3–0  3–0  3–1  2–1  0–1  0–0  1–2  0–0  1–0  3–1  1–0  0–0  0–3  1–2  0–0  1–2  2–1  2–2  2–1  1–0  0–0  0–0  0–0  0–0  2–1  0–0  1–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  0–3  —  1–2  2–1  2–2  0–0  1–0  0–3  0–0  0–0  0–3  1–0  0–0  3–0  0–3  0–1  1–2  1–2  1–2  1–2  0–0  0–1  0–1  0–0  0–0  1–2  0–0  1–0  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Charlotte  0–3  2–1  —  2–1  2–1  0–0  0–0  3–0  0–1  0–0  1–2  0–0  0–1  1–2  2–2  0–0  3–0  1–3  1–2  1–2  1–0  1–0  0–0  0–0  0–0  2–1  1–0  0–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Chicago  1–3  1–2  1–2  —  0–3  0–1  0–0  0–3  0–0  0–0  0–3  1–0  0–0  1–2  1–3  0–0  2–1  1–2  0–3  1–2  0–0  0–0  0–0  0–1  0–1  1–2  0–1  1–0  1–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cleveland  1–2  2–2  1–2  3–0  —  0–0  0–0  1–2  1–0  0–1  0–3  0–0  1–0  0–3  1–2  0–0  3–0  1–2  1–2  1–2  1–0  0–0  0–0  1–0  0–0  2–2  0–1  0–0  1–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Dallas  1–0  0–0  0–0  1–0  0–0  —  2–1  0–1  2–2  2–2  0–0  3–0  0–3  0–1  0–0  1–2  0–1  0–0  1–0  0–0  1–3  0–3  2–2  1–3  0–3  0–0  0–3  2–1  0–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Denver  0–0  0–1  0–0  0–0  0–0  1–2  —  0–0  1–3  0–4  0–1  3–0  1–2  0–1  1–0  0–3  1–0  0–0  0–0  0–0  0–3  0–3  0–3  0–4  2–2  0–0  1–2  3–1  0–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Detroit  2–1  3–0  0–3  3–0  2–1  1–0  0–0  —  0–0  0–0  2–1  0–0  0–0  2–1  2–1  0–1  2–1  2–1  0–4  1–3  1–0  0–0  0–0  0–1  1–0  2–1  1–0  0–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Golden State  0–0  0–0  1–0  0–0  0–1  2–2  3–1  0–0  —  0–3  1–0  2–1  1–2  0–0  0–1  2–2  0–0  0–0  0–1  0–0  1–2  2–2  1–2  0–3  1–2  0–0  0–4  4–0  0–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Houston  0–1  0–0  0–0  0–0  1–0  2–2  4–0  0–0  3–0  —  0–0  3–1  1–2  0–1  0–0  2–1  1–0  0–0  0–1  0–0  2–2  2–1  3–0  0–3  2–1  1–0  0–3  4–0  0–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Indiana  1–2  3–0  2–1  3–0  3–0  0–0  1–0  1–2  0–1  0–0  —  0–0  1–0  2–2  3–0  0–0  3–1  2–1  1–2  1–2  0–0  0–1  0–0  0–0  0–0  2–1  0–0  1–0  3–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  L.A.

Following the season, Austin was traded to the Vancouver Grizzlies, Tracy Murray signed as a free agent with the Denver Nuggets, Williams signed with the New Jersey Nets, and Walker was fired as coach. ==Offseason== Draft picks { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" - ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 004874; color:#BA8545\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  7  Richard Hamilton  SG   Connecticut - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  35  Calvin Booth  C   Penn State } ==RosterRegular season== Season standings :z - clinched division title :y - clinched division title :x - clinched playoff spot Record vs. opponents {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=301999-2000 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !008080;color:#800080;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000000;color:#5787DC;width=35\\"CLE !00008B;color:#008000;width=35\\"DAL !141A44;color:#BC2224;width=35\\"DEN !0C7674;color:#BB222C;width=35\\"DET !072E63;color:#DC5A34;width=35\\"GSW !002366;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !00471B;color:#5C378A;width=35\\"MIL !044D80;color:#000000;width=35\\"MIN !12305B;color:#C4CED4;width=35\\"NJN !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !000000;color:#BB9754;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !6846A8;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#992634;width=35\\"SEA !7436BF;color:#BE0F34;width=35\\"TOR !644A9C;color:#149BC7;width=35\\"UTA !0CB2AC;color:#000000;width=35\\"VAN !044D7D;color:#BC7A44;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  1–3  1–3  3–1  3–1  0–2  1–1  1–3  0–2  1–1  1–3  1–1  0–2  2–2  0–4  1–1  3–1  2–1  0–3  0–4  0–2  0–2  2–0  0–2  1–1  2–2  0–2  1–1  1–3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  3–1  —  1–3  2–2  2–2  1–1  2–0  0–3  1–1  1–1  1–3  1–1  0–2  1–3  1–2  0–2  3–1  2–2  2–2  1–3  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Charlotte  3–1  3–1  —  4–0  3–1  1–1  1–1  2–2  2–0  1–1  2–2  2–0  0–2  2–2  3–1  2–0  2–1  1–3  2–2  3–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–2  1–1  3–1  0–2  2–0  3–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Chicago  1–3  2–2  0–4  —  1–3  0–2  1–1  1–3  0–2  0–2  1–3  2–0  0–2  2–2  1–3  0–2  2–1  0–3  0–4  0–4  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  1–1  0–4  0–2  0–2  2–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cleveland  1–3  2–2  1–3  3–1  —  2–0  2–0  2–2  1–1  1–1  0–4  2–0  0–2  0–3  1–3  0–2  2–2  3–1  2–1  0–4  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–4  0–2  2–0  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Dallas  2–0  1–1  1–1  2–0  0–2  —  3–1  2–0  4–0  1–3  1–1  4–0  1–3  0–2  0–2  2–2  0–2  0–2  1–1  0–2  3–1  2–2  1–3  2–2  1–3  1–1  1–3  3–1  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Denver  1–1  0–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  1–3  —  1–1  2–2  2–2  0–2  3–1  1–3  0–2  2–0  2–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  2–0  1–3  2–2  2–2  1–3  1–3  2–0  2–2  2–2  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Detroit  3–1  3–0  2–2  3–1  2–2  0–2  1–1  —  2–0  1–1  1–3  2–0  0–2  2–2  3–1  0–2  2–1  1–3  2–2  2–2  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  2–0  2–2  0–2  2–0  2–2 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Golden State  2–0  1–1  0–2  2–0  1–1  0–4  2–2  0–2  —  1–3  0–2  1–3  0–4  1–1  1–1  1–3  0–2  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–4  0–4  1–3  0–4  0–4  0–2  0–4  3–1  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Houston  1–1  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  3–1  2–2  1–1  3–1  —  0–2  4–0  2–2  1–1  0–2  0–4  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  2–2  2–2  1–3  0–4  1–3  0–2  1–3  2–2  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Indiana  3–1  3–1  2–2  3–1  4–0  1–1  2–0  3–1  2–0  2–0  —  1–1  1–1  2–2  2–2  1–1  3–1  2–2  2–1  2–2  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  3–1  2–0  2–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  L.A.

Under new head coach Leonard Hamilton, and later on acquiring Tyrone Nesby from the Los Angeles Clippers, the Wizards continued to struggle with a 7–34 start to the season, as people scoffed that their best player Michael Jordan was sitting up in the owner's box. Juwan Howard, who grew disgruntled with all the team failures was traded at midseason to the Dallas Mavericks for Christian Laettner, Hubert Davis, and rookies Courtney Alexander and Etan Thomas, who was out for the entire season with a toe injury. In early March, Rod Strickland was released and later on re-signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. Alexander averaged 17.0 points per game in 27 games with the Wizards, and made the All-Rookie Second Team. However, the Wizards finished in last place in the Atlantic Division with a dreadful 19–63 record, their worst to that point over a full 82-game season although subsequently equalled by the 2008–09 Wizards. Second-year star Richard Hamilton led them in scoring with 18.1 points per game.

He is chiefly known as a political advisor to French President Emmanuel Macron and the first secretary of his political movement, En Marche!. He currently serves as a security advisor to the Chief of the Military Staff of the President of the Republic. == Biography ==  Early life and education  Chaker grew up in Saint-Jean-du-Bruel, a village in Aveyron located between the Causses and the Cévennes. In 2002, he graduated from the Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales in Mandarin Chinese and International Relations. He contributed to books focused on modern China, such as Shanghai - Histoire, promenades, anthologie et dictionnaire, directed by Nicolas Idier, in which he writes a chapter on martial arts. He was admitted to the CELSA where he attended the intercultural management program, while studying political science at the Paris Nanterre University (2003-2004) and human resources and public affairs at Sciences Po.  Professional and political career  Hired by the French consulate in Shanghai, he was in charge of developing cooperation between French and Chinese universities. Upon returning to France, he became chief of staff to the mayor of Joué-lès-Tours, a city in which he was also elected. He was then recruited by Richard Descoings as head of external relations for Asia, the Pacific region, Africa and the Middle-East of Sciences Po. In 2012, he ran as an independent left-wing candidate for the MP seat of the Eleventh constituency for French residents overseas, that includes 49 countries in Asia and Oceania. Running as a \\"2.0 candidate\\" using couchsurfing as a campaigning technique, he obtained 1.99% of the votes.. He then founded a consulting company, Ooda, named after the four phases (observe–orient–decide–act) of the military OODA loop. In 2015 he joined Emmanuel Macron's team and became the first general secretary of his party, En Marche ! and its first official employee. He was then appointed as deputy general secretary and coordinator of Macron's campaign operations for the 2017 French presidential election. He was often described as a senior staffer in the candidate's team and one of its closest advisors, earning the nickname of \\"ninja of logistics\\". After the election of Macron to the presidency, Chaker was appointed to the Military Staff of the President. Several media outlets identified him as close to Alexandre Benalla and compared him to the character of intelligence officer Malotru in the TV series The Bureau \\\\- a comparison reinforced by the fact that Chaker speaks Arabic fluently after living in Cairo. After a reorganization of the presidential staff, he became the advisor to the Chief of the Military Staff of the President of the Republic, tasked with coordinating with the different services of the presidency and delivering notes and strategic analyses.  Martial arts and yoga  Ludovic Chaker was taught kung-fu by master Liang Chaoqun, a proponent of the Zi Ran Men or \\"natural style\\". He then joined the leadership of the French Wan Laisheng association and authored several publications devoted to the history of martial arts.. He also taught yoga. == References == Category:China–France relations Category:1979 births Category:21st-century French politicians Category:La République En Marche! politicians Category:Sciences Po alumni Category:Living people ","title":"Ludovic Chaker"},{"id":"35929753","text":"Trichadenotecnum sexpunctatum is a species of Psocoptera from Psocidae family that can be found in Great Britain and Ireland.

Her husband, Josiah Potts, was executed simultaneously, having been convicted of the murder and partial dismemberment of Miles Faucett. ==Biography== Elizabeth Atherton and Josiah Potts (1842–1890) were both born in Manchester, England. They married in 1863 and immigrated to the United States two years later, settling in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They became parents to at least five and as many as seven children (sources differ on the number), including a son named Charley (b. ca. 1873), a daughter (b. ca. 1877), and a daughter named Edith (b. 1883). The family moved west after Josiah, a machinist, got a job with the Central Pacific Railroad, at first in Terrace, Utah, and in 1886, in Carlin, Nevada. While living in Carlin, Elizabeth temporarily separated from Josiah, possibly due to financial hardships. While separated from her husband, Elizabeth traveled to Fresno, California, where she entered into a bigamous marriage with Miles Faucett, a carpenter who was also a native of England. The marriage was not revealed publicly until it was uncovered by a San Francisco journalist some time after the Pottses had been executed for Faucett's murder. By 1887, Elizabeth had returned to her home in Carlin as had Faucett who became a boarder in the Potts household. Soon after, he bought a nearby ranch and moved there, but visited the Potts home regularly because Elizabeth provided him with bread and washed his laundry. ==Disappearance and death of Miles Faucett== On January 1, 1888, Faucett told a friend, J.P. Linebarger, that he intended to visit the Pottses to collect some money they owed him, and that he had knowledge about Elizabeth's past that he could use to convince her to pay the debt. Faucett and Linebarger arrived together at the Potts' home, and Elizabeth invited Faucett to spend the night. Faucett accepted, Linebarger left, and Faucett was not seen alive again. In the days that followed, when questioned about Faucett's disappearance, Josiah said that Faucett had been called away on business in another state. In the summer of 1888, the Pottses moved to Rock Springs, Wyoming, and their house in Carlin was rented to a family named Brewer. In January 1889, George Brewer discovered mutilated human remains in the home's cellar. The remains were identified as those of Miles Faucett, and Elizabeth and Josiah Potts were arrested for the murder. ==Death and legacy== The Pottses were indicted for murder in the first degree and tried. They were both convicted of murder and sentenced to the death penalty. A double gallows, manufactured in Placerville, California, was obtained for the hanging and invitations were issued to attend the June 20, 1890 event. With 52 men in attendance, Elizabeth and Josiah were hanged simultaneously. The initial internment was at the Elko Cemetery but they were re-interred in a common grave when the cemetery was relocated. Elizabeth is the only woman ever to be legally executed in the history of Nevada. The Pottses hanging was the last legal execution in Elko County; a state law passed in 1901 ended the practice of conducting executions in Nevada's county seats. ==References== Atribution * Bibliography * * * ==Further reading== * Category:1846 births Category:1890 deaths Category:People from Manchester Category:People from Elko County, Nevada Category:19th-century executions of American people Category:People executed for murder Category:English emigrants to the United States Category:People executed by Nevada by hanging Category:Executed American women Category:Executed people from Greater Manchester Category:British people executed abroad Category:Executed people from Nevada Category:19th-century American criminals Category:American murderers Category:Criminals from Nevada ","title":"Elizabeth Potts"},{"id":"35929993","text":"Santa Rosa de Lima was an early 18th-century Spanish settlement in the Rio Chama valley, near the present-day town of Abiquiu in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. By the 1730s Spanish settlers were moving into the Chama River valley, and by 1744 at least 20 families were living in the present-day Abiquiú area, where they founded the Plaza de Santa Rosa de Lima.History of Abiquiu -- timeline with cites The church, on the plaza, was built around 1744, and was in use until the 1930s. Repeated raids by Utes and Comanches caused the settlement to be abandoned in 1747. In 1750, the Spanish founded a new settlement at the present site of Abiquiú, about a mile from Santa Rosa de Lima. Today the site of Santa Rosa de Lima is a ghost town, with substantial adobe ruins of the church, and mounds where the settlers' adobe houses stood. The site is private property, belonging to the Archdiocese of Santa Fe.

This event would mark the only instance that a NASCAR Cup Series season would end at Rockingham Speedway. Having a 43-car racing grid was a very infrequent case during this era of NASCAR racing. Today, it forms the mandated standards that NASCAR developed over the years. This is also the earliest in the year a Cup season has finished since the inaugural season in 1949, and the last time there have been no races in November. 1973 would become the \\"year of the smaller engine\\" while declining sponsorship interests for the drivers resulted in NASCAR keeping the bigger gas-guzzling engines from being abolished from the sport. Following this race, NASCAR started to tighten up on their pre-race inspections as a precautionary measure to ensure that only legal racing components are being used. ==Background== North Carolina Motor Speedway is a closed racetrack located near Rockingham, North Carolina. It is affectionately known as \\"The Rock\\". ==Race report== David Pearson would defeat Buddy Baker by at least one lap after nearly four hours and fifteen minutes of racing. While the green flag was waved at noon, the checkered flag wasn't officially waved until 4:15 PM.1973 American 500 racing information at Racing Reference An incredible number of people would show up for the race; exactly 48,000 people would see 20 different lead changes and five caution flags for a staggering distance of 36 laps. While the average speed of the race was , Richard Petty would clinch the pole position in qualifying for his amazing run that reached . Pearson ended the 1973 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season with 18 starts and 11 wins. Every time Pearson was running at the end of a race he finished either 1st, 2nd, or 3rd while leading led 2,658 of 5,338 laps in the process.David Pearson 1973 NASCAR Career information at Racing Reference The complete racing grid was 43 American-born drivers; including the last-place finisher Frank Warren who crashed on lap 13 out of the 492 laps that made up the advertised distance. Benny Parsons would return to the track after being a part of that lap 13 crash which destroyed the whole right side of his car. Travis Carter, his crew and volunteers, including Ralph Moody and his staff of 20 people managed to complete repairs to Parsons's car in an hour and eight minutes. They had to replace a rear axle, rear suspension, sidebars, braking system, and roll bar cage, cannibalizing parts from a car that did not qualify for the race. He was able to return to the race 136 laps down, to cheers. Parsons would encounter some vibration issues on lap 308 that would knock him out of the race. Even with the DNF, he would slide into a comfortable 28th-place finish. Only manual transmission vehicles were allowed to participate in this race; a policy that NASCAR has retained to the present day. Other notable drivers in this race included Darrell Waltrip, Elmo Langley, and Richard Childress (now the owner of Richard Childress Racing). Eddie Bond, John Sears, and Paul Tyler would retire from NASCAR after this racing event.1973 American 500 racing information at Race-Database Souvenir racing programs were sold at the event for the then-inexpensive cost of $2 USD per copy ($ when adjusted for inflation). Benny Parsons would eventually win the Winston Cup Championship after this race by a mere 67 points over runner-up Cale Yarborough.1973 Winston Cup Recap at How Stuff Works Even though Parsons would finish in 28th during the race in his Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna machine, Yarborough's third- place finish would not earn him enough points to overtake the championship lead. Individual race winnings for this event varied in grandeur from the winner's share of $16,795 ($ when adjusted for inflation) to the last-place finisher's share of $485 ($ when adjusted for inflation).

From 1910 to 1921 she was a member of the General Presidency of the Relief Society. The second wife of Joseph F. Smith and the mother of Joseph Fielding Smith, she is the only woman in the history of the LDS Church to have been the wife of a President of the Church and the mother of another church president. She worked as a midwife in the Mormon community and delivered over 1,000 babies. ==Biography== Julina Lambson was born to Alfred Boaz Lambson and Melissa Jane Bigler in Salt Lake City. Her parents were Mormon pioneers who arrived in Utah in 1847. Her family's home was the first house in Salt Lake City to be plastered. As a young girl Julina would often stay with her aunt Bathsheba W. Smith and it was in her home that Julina was first introduced to the idea of plural marriage. Ten years after arriving in Salt Lake Julina's family was forced to Nephi, Utah because of the Utah War. Her family and many other saints passed through great trials after being displaced from their homes. Marriage and family In 1866, Julina married Joseph F. Smith in the Endowment House. It was Joseph F. Smith's second marriage; Julina was his first plural wife. His first wife Levira, was unable to have children and was often ill, so Julina would do all of the household chores and other tasks. Joseph and Levira were divorced in 1867. On August 14 of that same year Julina had her first child, Mercy Josephine. In the next fifteen years Joseph married four more women. Julina was close friends with the two of her sister wives closer to her in age, Sarah Ellen and Julina's sister Edna. Joseph F. Smith would go on to be an apostle in the LDS Church and was the church's president from 1901 until his death in 1918. Joseph F. Smith and Julina Smith had 11 children, one of which was Joseph Fielding Smith, longtime historian and apostle of the church and president from 1970 to 1972. Another son was David Smith, who became a member of the church's Presiding Bishopric. Her son E. Wesley Smith, who was born in Hawaii, twice served as mission president in Hawaii.Deseret News article announcing E. Wesley Smith's second assignment to Hawaii The couple also adopted two children. Because of their polygamist lifestyle, their household was in constant need of a midwife. To find a solution, Julina went and got professional training in nursing and obstetrics. After being trained as a midwife Julina shared this new ability with many of the expecting sisters in her community and would sacrifice many long nights doing such service. She was one of the first trained midwives in Utah. When the U.S. Congress passed the Edmunds Anti-Polygamy Act of 1882 Julina and her husband went to Laie, Hawaii to go into hiding after President Taylor suggested doing so. Many other LDS church leaders also went into hiding during this time. Julina and Joseph stayed in Hawaii from January 1885 until the middle of 1887, while all of their children (except the youngest) stayed in Utah with her sister wives. During her time in Hawaii she gave birth to two children and continued using her midwifery skills to help deliver children on the island. She also ran the missionary kitchen near their home. After returning home from Hawaii, Smith had three more children and continued her service in the church and as a midwife. During her lifetime she delivered 1,025 babies and never lost a mother during delivery. In 1901 Joseph F. Smith was called to be the next President of the LDS church and held that position until his death in 1918. Many years later, after suffering a bad fall, Julina died on January 10, 1936, aged 86. Church callings In 1870, when the first Young Women's Retrenchment Society was first organized in Salt Lake City on a ward level, Smith was selected as one of its first ward presidents. At that time she also worked at the Endowment House and in 1892, she became a member of the general board of the Relief Society. When Emmeline B. Wells became the president of the Relief Society in 1910, she selected Smith as her second counselor. Along with first counselor Clarissa S. Williams, the presidency served until Wells died in 1921. ==Publications== * * * ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Andrew Jenson.

Members of the tribe prefer the name Malaa. == Language == Malaa people use a distinct form of dialect un-intelligible to most of the other subgroups of Adi. There has been several theories regarding its unique dialect, however most of the Malaa people maintains that they adopted this dialect from a certain group of people called Soi-sotem who inhabited their lands long before Malaa people came and settled there and the latter migrated to other places. Still today the Malaa mention and remember those archaic Soi- sotem people in their ballads as: : Soi belu kettunge, Sotem belu kettunge. Soi sotem were believed to come from Kalang Ade(dite), the highest peak in the land of the Milang beyond which is the land of Idu Mishmi tribe. ==Religion== The Malaa are adherents of indigenous Donyi-Poloism, the practice of praying to the almighty Sun goddess and The Moon God. The priests, called Madar in Malaa, are popularly believed to be the intermediaries between the natural human world and Spiritual and supernatural world. Male priests are connected with act of divination while the female priests are related with healing of sickness. The priesthood is hereditary practice as it passed from generation to generation in a family. The ritual of sacrificing an animal as suggested by priest to cure a disease is called Lulu. Whenever an epidemic or disease breaks down in a village, the villagers construct a gate at the entrance of the village and a dog is sacrificed with intestines sagging out and hanged.This ritual is called Lukan. Ayid Madar Bemmanu, a ritualistic dance is performed throughout the night in which priest bargains to appease the spirits to release the soul of diseased person and in exchange for gifts. The priest examines the chicken liver and reads omen and suggest the nature of disease and corresponding sacrifice to be made to heal the disease. Name of festival Dates Aran 7 March Solung Etor 15 May Solung(Lune) 1 September ==Geography== Geographically the Malaa land lies approximately between 94-95 degree N latitude and 28-29 degree E longitude in Upper Siang district. The land of the Milangs extends to the Chage and Felo hills in the north which is land of the Idu tribe of Dibang valley. To south and the east they are bounded by the land of the Padams. Their land is a rich source of the Aconitum plant (variously known as monk's hood or wolf's bane), the source of the powerful poison aconitine, which the Milang historically used on their spears and arrows during battle.The Anglo-Abor wars between 1835 and 1912 saw massive use of 'EMO'(called AMU in Millang) being supplied from Peki Modi village against the invading British forces. The principal rivers are Sidip, Yamne, Yammeng, Satamak and Chapel besides many rivulets flowing through their land. Millang, Dalbing and Peki Modi are the important ancestral villages of the Malaa. However, as of today they are found residing in the hills and the valleys of East Siang, Upper Siang and Lower Dibang Valley Districts of Arunachal Pradesh. ==Surnames== Surnames used by Malaa are based on family lineage.

The battle was part of the long Reconquista of Spain, and resulted in a victory for the forces of the Kingdom of Aragon and the Kingdom of Valencia. == Context == Rodrigo Díaz had conquered the Taifa of Valencia on June 17, 1094.Alberto Montaner Frutos, «The exact date of the surrender of Valencia», in Montaner Frutos, Alberto y Alfonso BOIX JOVANÍ, Guerra en Šarq Alʼandalus: Las batallas cidianas de Morella (1084) y Cuarte (1094), Zaragoza, Instituto de Estudios Islámicos y del Oriente Próximo, 2005, pgs. 285-287. Gea de Albarracín, Cronología de Aragón y otros relacionados El Cid had joined forces with Peter I of Aragon later that year in Burriana to cement an alliance with the end goal of doing battle with the Almoravids. Under this agreement, El Cid departed in December 1096 with the aid of Aragonese troops to bring weapons, ammunition, and general supplies to the castle of Sierra de Benicadell. The castle itself had been retaken by \\"El Cid\\" in October 1091 to control access to Valencia from the south via the interior route. That action had taken place in the course of the operations for the \\"reconquista\\" of Levante that the Cid had undertaken before the arrival of the North African Almoravids. ==The battle== Muhammad ibn Tasufin, commander of the Islamic forces, marched to intercept the combined Christian forces at Xàtiva. Throughout January 1097, from that position, he threatened and pestered the forces of El Cid and Peter I of Aragon who, nevertheless, managed to reach the castle at Sierra de Benicadell and resupply it. Whilst \\"El Cid\\" and the king were marching north, they camped at Bairén, a place situated a few kilometers north of Gandía. The Almoravids managed to take the nearby high ground at Mondúver (at 841 meters above sea level), from where they were able to harass the Christian camp. In addition, General Muhammad had managed to bring a fleet of ships, both Almoravid and Andalusian, onto the nearby seashore from which archers and crossbowmen were able to catch the Christian forces in a crossfire. The situation appeared desperate, but \\"El Cid\\" harangued his troops one morning, ordering them to conduct a frontal charge and assault on the Almoravid forces, breaking their center. By mid-day, the attack was in full swing. The Almoravids, taken aback by the courage and desperate nature of the attack, broke and fled the field in disarray. The chaotic nature of the Muslim retreat led many Almoravid soldiers to drown in the river which crossed their path of retreat or in the sea as they tried to reach the safety of the Almoravid armada. == Aftermath == The Christian army was able to come away from the battle with a great deal of victory spoils after looting the Almoravid camp. After the battle, they were able to continue, in safety, to the city of Valencia. == References  Bibliography == * Fletcher, Richard, El Cid, San Sebastián, Nerea, 2001. . 4ª ed. 2007. .

This antigen represents critical biological functions for the parasite including immune evasion and adherence to microvascular endothelial cells. During this time Howard served on the World Health Organization's Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases and the USAID program for research and vaccine development in malaria. While Howard was President and Scientific Director at Affymax Research Institute, Willem 'Pim' StemmerWillem P.C. Stemmer conceived and developed DNA shuffling Technology. This revolutionary technology for improving the expressed phenotype of genes, pathways, plasmids, viruses and genomes gave birth to the creation and spinout of Maxygen Inc.Zaffaroni Announces New Start-Up Company – Maxygen, Inc. where Howard was CEO for 12 years. He took the company publicMaxygen, Inc. Raises $110 Million In Initial Public Offering of Its Common Stock and led its growth with 10s of corporate partnerships, technology application programs that led ultimately to the development and commercialisation worldwide of 10s of Life Science products in diverse fields. Maxygen exploited DNA Shuffling technology across the entire Life Sciences spectrum, creating new companies dedicated to Agricultural Products (VerdiaDuPont To Acquire Maxygen Subsidiary Verdia) and Industrial Chemical opportunities (CodexisMaxygen Announces Launch of Wholly Owned Chemicals Subsidiary, Codexis, Inc.) as well as a Protein Pharmaceuticals Business (PerseidMaxygen and Astellas Announce Global Agreement to Develop New Therapies for Autoimmune Diseases and Transplantation.). In 2008, Howard left Maxygen to found Oakbio Inc. He is currently a founder and the CEO of Oakbio Inc. in Sunnyvale, California, USA, a company designing microbes for production of cost-competitive chemicals using industrial CO2 emissions as carbon source . Additionally, he is currently Commercial Strategy Advisor at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research's Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics. Howard has published over 145 scientific publications in refereed journals and is an inventor on nine issued patents. == Education == Howard graduated from Box Hill High School in Melbourne, Australia and later studied Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Melbourne, culminating in a PhD in 1975 where he studied the carbohydrate and central metabolism of Caulerpa simpliciuscula, a marine green alga. == Employment == He spent his first postdoctoral studies from 1976–1979 at the Immunoparasitology Laboratory at the Walter & Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne, with frequent visits and collaborative work on sialic acids at the Biochemisches Institut at Christian Albrechts Universitat in Kiel, Germany. He started working as a Research Associate in the Malaria Section of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland before earning his tenure in the same institution in 1987. From 1988 to 1992, he worked at the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases of the DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology in Palo Alto, California, USA, with dual roles, studying cytokine genes for Schering Plough, the parent organisation of DNAX Research Institute, and leading his Infectious Diseases laboratory there on malaria work funded by DNAX and USAID. In 1994, he was named President and Scientific Director of Affymax, Inc. where he managed teams working on small molecule drug lead discovery using combinatorial chemistry and high throughput target screening. His independent malaria work continued at Affymax with support from USAID and Affymax, leading to cloning of the PfEMP1 gene while at Affymax. After Affymax was purchased by GlaxoWellcome, Howard led technology transfer and interchange in combinatorial chemistry, drug discovery and optimisation between Affymax and GlaxoWellcome worldwide. During this time, Molecular breeding or DNA shuffling Technology was conceived and the nascent company Maxygen Inc. incubated for later spun out from Affymax-GlaxoWellcome. From 1997 to 2009, Howard worked as Maxygen's CEO, focusing on human, including, protein pharmaceutical drugs and vaccine discovery, as core business. Non-core businesses were successively incubated, nurtured and spun-out (Codexis) or sold (Verdia). In 2008, he left Maxygen with $200MM in cash, no debt, on-going clinical stage drug development programs and multiple partnerships and licenses with other parties. Following his departure, Howard started Oakbio, Inc., a seed-stage, privately held Clean Technology company in Sunnyvale, California, USA[www.oakbio.com]. Oakbio captures CO2 from industrial waste gas streams and uses microbial chemosynthetic systems to capture and convert this carbon resource to valuable chemicals, sequestering a Green House Gas from accumulation in the atmosphere. In 2012 Howard moved residency from Silicon Valley, California, where he had worked for 25 years, to Sydney, Australia. In 2013 he joined the Garvan Institute of Medical Research's Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics as Commercial Strategy Advisor. He is now the Head of Commercial Strategy, The Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics. In addition, currently Howard is Executive Chairman at NeuClone Pty. Ltd, Sydney, developing biosimilar monoclonal antibody products and a Non Executive Director at Immutep (a biotechnology company working in the field of cancer immunotherapy). == Financing leadership == With Howard as CEO, Maxygen, Inc. completed its initial public offering of $110MM in 1999, just two years after its spinout from Affymax-GlaxoWellcome. In March 2000, Maxygen raised another $150MM in a Secondary Public Offering. More recently, Howard and colleagues at NeuClone, Pty. Ltd. raised >$10 MM (AUS) from private investors in Sydney to support development of a portfolio of 10 biosimilar monoclonal antibodies. == Recognition & research == Howard has been awarded three Doctor of Science (honoris causa) degrees, one from the University of Technology, Sydney, Australia in 2004, one from the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia in 2008 and the third from the University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia in 2014. Howard's >145 publications tackle topics ranging from the metabolism of the algae Caulerpa simpliciuscula, to the molecular pathogenesis of human cerebral malaria and the role of parasite antigenic variation and infected cell adherence in disease virulence. His papers reflect successful use of the tools of biochemistry, protein chemistry and structure-function, molecular biology, cell biology, large animal studies, and field studies with humans. == Patents == Howard is an inventor on nine patents. At the NIH he patented discovery, characterisation and cloning of a novel gene encoding a soluble malarial antigen, called PfHRP2 that the most lethal human malaria releases into the blood. This discovery led to a rapid, sensitive, inexpensive and reliable diagnostic test for malaria infection that the NIH licensed commercially. This test has been used worldwide for over 15 years.Rapid Diagnostic Test Information: Malaria Diagnostic Overview. In 1990 and 1995, he and his colleagues at Affymax applied for the patents of antigenic determinants obtained using a pathogenic agent or a derivative that presents a restricted set of antigens, and recombinant DNA clone from Plasmodium falciparum. While working at Maxygen Inc., he and his colleagues developed three patents for the following technologies: antigen library immunisation using polynucleotides encoding flavivirus and alphavirus; multivalent antigenic polypeptides; and optimisation of immunomodulatory properties of genetic vaccines == Selected references and publications  External links == * Affymax Research Institute * Maxygen, Inc. * Oakbio, Inc. * NeuClone Pty.

He graduated from the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute in 1957 and enrolled in Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography, from which he was expelled during the campaign against Boris Pasternak's novel Dr. Zhivago. Pasternak was persecuted by the Soviet government until his death and was forced to decline the Nobel Prize. Nikolay Rasheyev, like many of his contemporaries, was expelled from the university after being accused of being \\"a spiritual brother of Pasternak\\". He finished his studies at Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography by correspondence. In 1966 he completed advanced coursework in screenwriting and directing. After being expelled from the Gerasimov Institute, he made use of his earlier engineering education, working in various jobs in northern and eastern Russia, in Tuva, Sakhalin and Chukotka. In 1964, he graduated from Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography (scriptwriting faculty) and in 1966, the Higher Courses of Scriptwriters and directors. He worked as an assistant director for TV stations in Chişinău and Kiev and as a director for Perm television and the Moldova-Film studios. He became a director in Dovzhenko Film Studios in 1971.

He became famous for the United States Supreme Court case of Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823) and for his massive real estate holdings on the Wabash River. For a time he was a close friend of William Henry Harrison, but their relationship eventually soured and Harrison sued him for slander. When Harrison won the lawsuit, M'Intosh was forced to pay him a large sum of money. ==Early years== William M'Intosh was born in Aberdeen, Scotland around 1760. In Scotland he served as a lieutenant in the Northern Fencibles from 1778 to 1781 and then emigrated to Canada. In 1785 he moved to Vincennes, Indiana and operated as a fur trader in the Illinois country along the Wabash River. About 1815-20 he moved to a tract of land he owned on the Illinois side of the Wabash River, near the present site of Mount Carmel, Illinois.Watson, Blake A., Buying America from the Indians: Johnson v. McIntosh and the History of Native Land Rights, University of Oklahoma Press, 2012, p. 202. It is thought that he resided near where the Grand Rapids Dam was built in the 1890s. Thomas S. Hinde, one of the founders of Mount Carmel, later purchased this property.Robertson, Lindsay Gordon, Conquest by Law: How the Discovery of America Dispossessed Indigenous Peoples of Their Lands, Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 51-55. ==Fur trader and agent== M'Intosh operated in the Illinois country of the Northwest Territory in association with the fur trading company of John Askin in Detroit. His primary residence was located in Vincennes, Indiana. Certain sources claim that his methods were deceptive and he was able to acquire vast land holdings by profiting unfairly from other people. He claimed to own 11,560 acres around the Wabash River.Robertson (2005), Conquest by Law, pp. 51-55. ==Marriage and family== M'Intosh lived with Lydia, a former slave. At one time, they had to fight off litigation regarding her status from individuals in Knox County, Indiana trying to claim her as property. M'Intosh had two daughters and one son by Lydia.Watson (2012),Buying America from the Indians, p. 300. ==Johnson v. M'Intosh== Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823) is a notable Supreme Court case that held that private citizens could not purchase lands from Native Americans; it affirmed the relationship between the tribes and the United States government. The decision was written by Chief Justice John Marshall, who was a close friend of Thomas S. Hinde. The latter later purchased a substantial portion of the property that was in question in the litigation. M'Intosh had obtained a land patent from the United States government, while Johnson's descendants had inherited the land from a purchase he had made directly from the Piankeshaw Indians. The court ruling rendered the Johnson purchase invalid, as he had no authority to buy land from the Piankeshaw after the United States had formed as a nation. In short, M'Intosh won based on Marshall's creation of the discovery doctrine.Johnson v. Mc'Intosh, 21 U.S. 543 (1823) ==Death and additional information== On July 14, 1832 the Vincennes Gazette reported: \\"Died--at the Grand Rapids of the Wabash, William McIntosh Esq. for a long time resident of Vincennes. He was a native of Scotland, from which country he emigrated at an early age.\\" According to one report, Lydia and her children inherited none of M'Intosh's land holdings and were left destitute.Watson (2012),Buying America from the Indians, p. 300. ==References * City of Mount Carmel Website Category:Miami tribe Category:People of pre-statehood Indiana Category:People of pre-statehood Illinois Category:William Henry Harrison Category:Indiana Territory Category:People from Mount Carmel, Illinois Category:1832 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"William M'Intosh (fur trader)"},{"id":"35930679","text":"The video game developer and publisher, Nintendo, has engaged in a variety of marketing campaigns, ranging from early efforts to appeal to teenagers with \\"Play It Loud!\\" to the more open-ended \\"Who Are You?\\" campaign. Nintendo also sometimes markets its various consoles and games with lavish promotions. ==Facilities== Originally, all marketing operations for Nintendo of America were based out of the company's Redmond, Washington headquarters. It opted not to expand that headquarters, although it owned 550,000 square feet of property for potential expansion.http://www.joystiq.com/2007/05/09/nintendo-of-america- hq-stays-in-redmond-sales-ad-and-marketin/ In May 2007, the company announced plans to move its sales, marketing, and advertising divisions to either San Francisco or New York City. The company established its new office in Redwood City, California. ==Personnel== left Reginald \\"Reggie\\" Fils-Aimé joined Nintendo in December 2003 as the Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing. He was responsible for all sales and marketing activities for Nintendo in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. Fils-Aimé shot to fame in May 2004 with the opening line of Nintendo's E3 press conference: \\"My name is Reggie. I'm about kickin' ass, I'm about takin' names, and we're about makin' games.\\" His theatrical antics, flying in the face of Nintendo's long- standing \\"kiddie\\" image, gained a cult following soon after, with many gamers calling him the \\"Regginator\\". Following the conference, many images of him spread across the Web. Fils-Aimé is considered to be responsible for revamping Nintendo's public relations in North America, leading many fans and members of the press to dub his arrival the \\"Reggielution\\" (after \\"Revolution\\", the code name for the Wii). He speaks highly of the \\"blue oceans\\" strategy, which attempts to bring in people who are not traditionally gamers. His expertise is with youth marketing, although he made an effort to reach out to the elderly using games like Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day! and Nintendogs. In October 2007, Fils-Aimé was promoted to president and chief operating officer of NoA.http://www.joystiq.com/2007/10/25/nintendo-hires-two-new- executive-vps/ On February 21, 2019, Fils-Aimé publicly announced that he is now retiring and handing over his presidency of Nintendo of America to Doug Bowser.

She joined KidZania as the global chief marketing officer. Dunaway was succeeded by Scott Moffitt in May 2011. Moffitt previously worked at Henkel and PepsiCo, and was tasked with providing new life to the Nintendo 3DS and Wii. In August 2015, Scott Moffitt was succeeded by Doug Bowser as the Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Bowser had previously been the VP of Sales, coming to Nintendo in 2014 from Electronic Arts. Nintendo engages non-employees (known as Brand Ambassadors) to do marketing too, an example being The Nintendo Power Couple (channel name). In late May 2020, Nintendo dropped several Brand Ambassadors, including Wood Hawker, without giving specific reason. ==Brand campaigns== The Best Play Here \\"The Best Play Here\\" campaign was aimed at children and adults.Elliott, Stuart. \\"THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Nintendo Turns Up the Volume in a Provocative Appeal to its Core Market: Teen-Age Males.\\" New York Times: D.15. New York Times. Jul 01 1994. Web. 25 May 2012. It was relatively mild and not as emphatic as the \\"Play It Loud!\\" campaign that would follow. Leo Burnett U.S.A. produced the campaign. Play It Loud! left Facing intense competition from Sega, Nintendo decided to alter the trajectory of its marketing and pitch a new image to the public. The Play It Loud! campaign marked a departure from traditional marketing practice by Nintendo. Instead of focusing on one particular console or game, it promoted a particular corporate image.Lefton, Terry. \\"Sneak Peek: Nintendo Rocks Out Hardcore Image Push.\\" Brandweek 35.25 (1994): 1-. ABI/INFORM Global; ProQuest Research Library. Web. 25 May 2012. The campaign was aimed at Nintendo's core market: teenage boys. Dan Coyner, marketing manager at Nintendo of America, noted that previous campaigns felt \\"like an adult talking to a child,\\" while Play It Loud! appealed more directly to a younger audience. John Montgomery of Burnett said the ads were intended \\"to capture what kids are in their music, their clothes, their attitudes.\\" The advertisements extensively used youth slang of the day, advising viewers to \\"hock a loogie at life\\" and \\"give the world a wedgie.\\" They also utilized \\"provocative imagery,\\" such as a tattoo reading Play It Loud! Advertisements used music extensively, marrying hard rock music with video games. One early advertisement featured the Butthole Surfers, an alternative rock band. Many were concerned that the campaign would seem too fake, as if adults were trying to pander to children and pretend to be \\"hip.\\" The campaign ran from July 1994 to September 1996. It had a $10 million budget and was produced by Burnett. Nintendo Power released the Play It Loud Original Soundtrack: Volume 1 on April 1, 1996 as a gift to subscribers. It contained 41 tracks of different music from past Nintendo games.http://www.game-ost.com/albums/622/nintendo_power_- _play_it_loud__original_soundtrack_volume_1/ Who Are You? \\"Who Are You?\\" was a campaign back in 2003 intended on promoting Nintendo's console and handheld systems, the Game Boy Advance and the GameCube. The campaign was developed in conjunction with the Chicago advertising company, Leo Burnett. The promotion would take the form of advertisements in places such as cinemas, print, billboards in major cities, transit, mall banners, and in-store merchandising. There was also an official website containing interactive advertisements of the campaign that has since been taken down. Too Much Fun Nintendo of Canada adopted an ironic approach to marketing itself in 2004. The \\"Too Much Fun\\" campaign jokingly presented \\"N\\" (short for Nintendo) as an illicit drug.http://www.toomuchfun.ca/media/wallpaper3_800.jpghttp://www.toomuchfun.ca/professional_help.html The campaign stated that \\"Four out of five doctors agree that using 'N' leads directly to Too Much Fun.\\" Its Ministry of Fun Suppression was said to offer possible remedies.http://www.toomuchfun.ca/media/wallpaper4_800.jpg As a remedy, the company suggested self-help groups including Nintendo and other fan sites. ==Product campaigns== Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo promoted its Nintendo Entertainment System using the slogan, \\"Now you're playing with power!\\" It would go on to modify and adapt the slogan for other consoles. It is also important to remark that this slogan was used for several campaigns. When promoting the miniature, classic NES (titled the Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition in the US, Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System in Europe and Australia), the original NES slogan was brought back in its YouTube trailer. Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo promoted its Super Nintendo Entertainment System using a modification of the slogan for the console's predecessor, \\"Now you're playing with power; SUPER POWER!\\" or \\"Now you're playing with power. Super power.\\" For the promotion of the SNES Classic Edition, Nintendo used the slogan \\"Now you're playing with super power\\" Game Boy The company promoted its Game Boy line using a modification of the slogan used for the Nintendo Entertainment System, \\"Now you're playing with power; PORTABLE POWER!\\" Virtual Boy Nintendo extensively advertised the Virtual Boy, and claimed to have spent US$25 million on early promotional activities.Boyer, Steven. \\"A Virtual Failure: Evaluating the Success of Nintendos Virtual Boy.\\" Velvet Light Trap.64 (2009): 23-33. ProQuest Research Library. Web. 24 May 2012. Advertising promoted the system as a paradigm shift from past consoles; some pieces used cavemen to indicate a historical evolution, while others utilized psychedelic imagery. Nintendo portrayed the system as a type of virtual reality, as its name indicates; it was to be more than just another gaming console. Confronted with the challenge of showing 3-dimensional gameplay on 2-dimensional advertisements, the company partnered with Blockbuster and NBC in a coordinated effort. American viewers were encouraged via television advertisements on NBC to rent the console for US$10 at a local Blockbuster. This made it affordable for a large number of gamers to try the system, and produced 750,000 rentals.\\"Nintendo/Nickelodeon/Blockbuster.\\" Mediaweek 6.30 (1996): 36-. ABI/INFORM Global; ProQuest Research Library. Web. 24 May 2012. Despite its popularity, the rental system proved harmful to the Virtual Boy's long-term success, allowing gamers to see just how un-immersive the console was. Nintendo promoted the console using the slogan \\"3-D game for a 3-D World.\\"Nintendo. \\"(1995) Nintendo Virtual Boy Commercial 2.\\" YouTube, 1995, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzSwrHldg0k Taken as a whole, the marketing campaign was commonly thought of as a failure. Nintendo 64 Nintendo promoted its first 3-dimensional console, the Nintendo 64, using several slogans. One was \\"Change the System\\" while the other was \\"Get N or Get Out\\".  Game Boy Color  Nintendo promoted the Game Boy Color using the slogan \\"Escape to a World of Color\\" and \\"Get into It!\\" with Flying CGI Lips.  Game Boy Advance  The Game Boy Advance was marketed using the slogan \\"Life Advanced\\" GameCube Nintendo used several advertising strategies and techniques for the GameCube. Around the time of release, the GameCube was advertised with the slogan \\"Born to Play.\\" The earliest commercials displayed a rotating cube animation, which would morph into the GameCube logo as a coca- cola whispers, \\"GameCube\\". This was usually displayed at the end of GameCube game commercials. It was also used in the opening of a Gamecube demo disc. Nintendo DS In 2005, Nintendo adopted a somewhat controversial tagline to promote its Nintendo DS handheld console. The slogan, \\"Touching is Good,\\" promoted the unusual touch-based features of the console. A web site created for the promotion awarded prizes to fans.http://www.touchingisgood.com/ = Nintendo DS Lite = With the launch of the Nintendo DS Lite, Nintendo used the slogan \\"The world you wish for\\" = Nintendo DSi = For the Nintendo DSi, the slogan \\"What will you and I do?\\" was used to emphasize the built in camera. = Nintendo DSi XL = The Nintendo DSi XL was marketed using the slogan \\"a LARGER experience\\". This slogan placed emphasis on the larger build of the DSi XL compared to the original DSi. Wii To promote the launch of its unconventional Wii console, Nintendo chose a unique approach to advertising. Rather than appeal to teenage males, Nintendo's traditional audience, the \\"Wii Would Like to Play\\" campaign showed people of all ages and backgrounds playing the console. The advertisements made particular note of the Wii's motion control system. The advertising campaign was produced by Leo Burnett, the firm responsible for many past Nintendo campaigns. The campaign won the Grand Effie Award in 2008 for the Most Effective Marketing Effort.  Nintendo 3DS  Multiple slogans were used to promote the newest model of the DS family, the Nintendo 3DS. The first slogan was \\"Take a Look Inside\\" which highlighted the system's 3D gameplay. In May 2016, after Nintendo reduced the price of the Nintendo 2DS, a new slogan, \\"There's No Play Like It,\\" and accompanying logo was featured. Wii U The Wii U's advertisements involved the \\"How U will play next\\" (\\"How will U play next?\\" in PAL regions) campaign to show the various play styles of the console.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dbGJieRaH0 Nintendo Switch The Nintendo Switch's advertising campaign involved the slogan \\"Switch and Play\\" to show the versatility of playing the console anywhere.http://www.nintendo.com/switch Alternatively, the slogan \\"Play anywhere, anytime, with anyone\\" has been used in various European trailers featuring the console.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1r369yv2Uk Due to the lower sales of the Wii U, Nintendo made the decision to focus their advertisements towards an older audience. This decision paid off well. As of September 2019, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 41 million units, far eclipsing the Wii U's lifetime sales of 13.56 million units. On November 11th, 2019 Nintendo published the \\"Our Favorite Ways to Play-2019\\" advert , which showcased a young boy with Down syndrome, Aaron Waddingham from Vancouver, Canada, in a commercial for the first time in Nintendo's history. Nintendo Power Nintendo promoted its magazine, Nintendo Power, using the slogan \\"Get the power! NINTENDO POWER!\\" == Social Media == Much like other companies in the field, Nintendo uses social media to market their products. They use social media to market their upcoming games and products to a large audience. They also use the platforms to develop and maintain relationships with their customer base on the internet.  Twitter  Nintendo began using Twitter on April 20th, 2007, long before any other social media. Their Twitter account is used to market their upcoming products and games releasing, along with marketing their already released games. Given the more interactive nature of Twitter, fans are able to react and respond to tweets easily, and allows Nintendo to see the feedback and interact with the feedback easier. As of December 2019, the Twitter page has over 18,000 tweets and 10.3 Million followers. This follower total far eclipses their follower count on any other social media.  Facebook  Nintendo began using Facebook on January 1st, 2011. They use their Facebook account to create awareness for their upcoming games and products. They also use their Facebook page to interact with fans and potential customers to answer any questions they may have. As of December 2019, the Facebook page has 5.2 million followers  YouTube  Nintendo uploaded their first video to YouTube on January 25th, 2011. This first video depicted first reactions and thoughts of the Nintendo 3DS, which was set to debut later in 2011. Nintendo uses their YouTube channel to upload trailers and commercials for their upcoming products and games. They also use YouTube for uploading Nintendo Directs in which they announce and discuss upcoming games and products in more detail. They usually host four or five Directs a year. As of December 2019, Nintendo has uploaded over 3,900 videos to their channel, and have over 6.2 million subscribers  Instagram  Nintendo's first Instagram post came on June 3rd, 2012. Their first photo depicts Shigeru Miyamoto, Satoro Iwata, and Reggie Fils-Aimé together. Given the nature of Instagram being a photo sharing platform, Nintendo uses the platform to share photos and videos of their products, both upcoming and current. Given the younger demographics of their fan base, more of their fans appear on Instagram as opposed to the older oriented Facebook. As of December 2019, the Instagram page has 5.9 million followers and over 1,400 posts  Miiverse  Miiverse was Nintendo's own social media created for the Wii U and 3DS. It launched on November 18th, 2012 alongside the Wii U. The service allowed players to share moments from games, their thoughts on different sections, and allowed interaction between fans of games. The service was integrated with every Wii U game, and eventually every 3DS game once the service came to the platform. Given the younger demographic of Nintendo's fan base, Miiverse also had a younger demographic, and thus was very child-friendly. Nintendo used the platform to market their own upcoming games, and used word-of-mouth marketing with games that were already released via the communities posts on the game. Nintendo shut down Miiverse on November 7th, 2017, as the service was not integrated on the Nintendo Switch, their new console. ==Demographic shifts== Due to negative perceptions of the business viability of video games following the video game crash of 1983, Nintendo decided to position the NES more as a toy than a computing device. This corresponded with targeted marketing towards the demographic of young boys, a choice which set the tone for marketing across the industry for more than a decade. At the release of the Nintendo DS in 2005, Nintendo attempted to expand the audience toward older males with the sexually suggestive \\"Touching is Good\\" advertising campaign. Advertising for the DS later pivoted towards adult women, emphasizing health and productivity while avoiding referring to products as games. Nintendo continued this emphasis on older and female audiences with the Wii console. The Wii's motion controls and casual software helped Nintendo expand its audience, even as many in Nintendo's traditional market regarded the system dismissively. Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw identified The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask as exemplifying the type of complicated game beloved by core gamers that would not be replicated by newer titles emphasizing accessibility. Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto commented in 2014 that due to the pervasiveness of mobile phone games, Nintendo no longer needed to work at convincing all audiences that games are for them. He further expressed a desire to develop for more engaged audiences who want to challenge themselves. The release of the New Nintendo 3DS, with more complicated controls and launch titles, was seen as a pivot back towards a hardcore gaming audience. This repositioning was a retreat from competition in mobile gaming from smartphones, while Nintendo prepares new health-oriented game devices to once again tap the non- traditional gaming market. After the disappointing sales of the Wii U, partly due to poor marketing and the rise of mobile phone gaming, Nintendo pushed its latest console, the Nintendo Switch, with strong advertising and promotion. The portable home console aims to appeal to both casual and core gamers, focusing on portability and multiple modes of playing. Nintendo showcased its first-ever Super Bowl ad during Super Bowl LI, with a 30-second advertisement for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the Nintendo Switch. ==References== Marketing Category:Promotion and marketing communications ","title":"Nintendo marketing"},{"id":"35930698","text":"The Shafat Glacier/Parkachik Glacier is a long glacier in the north eastern Himalayan Range situated south from Kargil and east from Srinagar on the right side of Kargil Zanskar Road near the border of the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh in India.

The majority of television infrastructure in the country was concentrated in the Bogotá area. The original owners were the singer Isadora, the businessman and producer Fernando Parra Duque and Clara María Ochoa. The Isadora era, 1981-91 Proyectamos at the start picked up two hours of weekly programs and used them to broadcast El Show de Isadora, hosted by the singer and aired on Fridays, as well as two foreign telenovelas and an educational program, Vamos al Zoológico Ecológico Lógico, all broadcast on Cadena 2. In the 1983 bidding cycle it ramped up production to 3.5 hours a week. El Show de Isadora moved to Tuesdays. Many of its other programs were imports. Several changes occurred to their program slate during this time, and in 1985, another success for Proyectamos, the Thursday night program Enfoques, made its debut. The 1987 bidding cycle marked another increase in output for Proyectamos, as it was awarded 4.5 hours a week. Now it began to produce its own dramas and comedies. El Diario de Amar, Papi es un Disastre and others now came on the air on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. Enfoques fell victim in the ratings to its new Sunday night competition, the powerful Premier Caracol movie. Along with Producciones JES and Cenpro Televisión Proyectamos created a rival, La Película del Domingo (The Sunday Movie). Enfoques would migrate to Wednesdays. The R.T.I. era, 1992-2003 Businessman Tulio Ángel Arbeláez bought Proyectamos Televisión in 1992, at the start of a new bidding cycle that gave it eight hours a week on Cadena Uno. On Friday, February 14, 1992, Proyectamos changed its corporate image. The majority of Proyectamos Televisión's programs came from R.T.I. Colombia. Among the new slots assigned to Proyectamos was a block of telenovelas presented jointly with R.T.I. and Producciones Cinevisión, airing Alcanzar una Estrella 2, Valeria y Maximiliano and others. There were other spaces, including Debates Caracol (a joint production with Caracol Televisión) on Thursdays; Sailor Moon soon appeared on Friday afternoons. In the mid-90s, its schedule changed somewhat; Quiere Cacao, an R.T.I. production, was now jointly presented by Proyectamos. With DFL Televisión it jointly presented Todo por la Plata, which DFL would later air itself on Canal A. In the 1997 bidding cycle, Proyectamos crossed over to Canal A (along with R.T.I., Datos y Mensajes and Nuevos Días/En Vivo). It once more increased its output to 10.5 hours. Many of its assigned spaces in the 1998-2003 period were shared. One of the major productions of Proyectamos in this last bidding cycle was, along with Coestrellas and CPS, was Sábados Felices, inherited from Caracol which didn't receive any slots on Saturday (this went on for seven months in 1998). After the departure of RCN to its own channel, Proyectamos and the other programadoras on Canal A received more timeslots, but they were later required to be returned. Closure The owner of Proyectamos Televisión, Arbeláez, presented to the Comisión Nacional de Televisión (CNTV) his own salvation plan for the public channels as the programadoras crisis begun in 1998 took full flight. The last straw for Proyectamos was the banning of infomercials, or televentas, which had been allowed since 1995. In March 2003, both Proyectamos and Andes Televisión returned their spaces to the CNTV and were liquidated. ==References== Category:Television production companies of Colombia ","title":"Proyectamos Televisión"},{"id":"35930720","text":"Stairway to Hell is an EP by the American alternative rock band Ugly Kid Joe.

The Liberty Bell Pavilion (demolished) was a building within Independence National Historical Park (INHP) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that housed the Liberty Bell from January 1, 1976 to October 9, 2003. Designed by the architectural firm of Mitchell/Giurgola Associates to be the Bell's permanent home, it stood for only 30 years. The Bell is currently housed in a much larger building, the Liberty Bell Center, completed in 2003. The Pavilion was demolished in 2006. ==Moving the Bell== Liberty Bell in 1951, on display in Independence Hall. The Liberty Bell, cast in 1752 and bearing the words \\"Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof\\", was commissioned by the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly to be the bell for the Pennsylvania Statehouse, now called Independence Hall. Later, this was the building in which the Declaration of Independence (1776) and United States Constitution (1787) were debated and signed. The Bell originally hung in the lowest chamber of the building's wooden spire, but it was lowered into the brick tower when the rotting spire was deemed unsafe and removed. In 1852, the cracked Bell was taken down and exhibited on the Hall's ground floor.Greiff, pp. 35–36. In 1969, Independence National Historical Park expressed concern that crowds of visitors to the upcoming 1976 United States Bicentennial could overwhelm (and possibly cause structural damage to) Independence Hall. INHP's proposed solution was to separate the Bell from the Hall, creating two visitor attractions. INHP's plan, announced in 1972, involved moving the Bell to a visitor center to be built at 3rd & Chestnut Streets (2-1/2 blocks east of Independence Hall). The Bell was to be installed on the visitor center's second story – separated, literally and visually, from the building for which it had been created and in which it had been housed for 220 years. Following severe criticism from the public and members of Congress, this plan was abandoned.Greiff, pp. 208–14. INHP's next plan was to build a Bell pavilion at the north end of Independence Mall, on the block bounded by Race, Arch, 5th and 6th Streets (now the site of the National Constitution Center). This would have placed the Bell about a quarter-mile from Independence Hall. INHP's second plan was also soundly rejected. Philadelphia's mayor, Frank Rizzo, pressed for the pavilion to be built on the block directly north of Independence Hall, bounded by Market, Chestnut, 5th and 6th Streets. The designer chosen was Romaldo Giurgola, a Philadelphia architect known for his Modernist buildings. Giurgola began design work in early 1974; ground was broken in early-1975 and construction was completed by the end of the year. The move of the Bell some 600 feet north to its new home became part of Philadelphia's 1975 New Year's Eve celebration. The Pavilion opened to visitors at 12:01 am on January 1, 1976.Greiff, p. 231. ==Building== The steel-and-glass, hourglass-shaped building gathered visitors in a vestibule, and funnelled them down a hallway to the Bell Chamber. There, visitors encountered the Bell before a wall of glass, with Independence Hall as its backdrop. An INHP ranger or guide made a 5- to 10-minute presentation about its history.Stephan Salisbury, \\"Moving History,\\" Philadelphia Inquirer, October 5, 2003. A longitudinal line of skylights illuminated the interior, relieving the visual weight of the ceiling and reinforcing the central axis of Independence Mall. Glass walls on the north and south facades and canted ones on the sides made the Bell visible from multiple angles, especially at night when it was lit by spotlights. Even when the Pavilion was closed, the Bell was visually accessible to everyone.Roeder, p. 39. The building drew near- unanimous praise from architects, but some members of the public found the architecture cold and insufficiently-dignified, complaining that it looked like \\"a drive-in bank or subway station.\\"Roeder, pp. 45–46. The modest-sized Pavilion, with a capacity of about 100 people, also did not function well with large crowds. Even with the ranger presentations eliminated, lines of visitors were long on peak-visitation days and the wait could be hours.Edwin Gutman, \\"Enshrine the Liberty Bell in a new and better home,\\" Philadelphia Inquirer, March 17, 1985. When INHP began a redesign of Independence Mall in the 1990s, a much bigger Liberty Bell building was part of the plan.Roeder, pp. 50–60. The Liberty Bell Center, built to the west of the Pavilion, opened on October 9, 2003. Initially, the vacant Pavilion was repurposed as a security building in which visitors headed to Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell Center were screened.Sarah M. Granlund, \\"Independence Mall brings home the Bacon,\\" Phillyist, November 28, 2005.

It premiered on May 23, 2012 in Canada on Global, and on May 24, 2012 in the United States on NBC. \\"Turtles All the Way Down\\" was scheduled to air on May 17, 2012, as part two of a two- hour finale. NBC had changed the order, and moved it to the following week. The teleplay of the episode was written by series creator Kyle Killen, from a story by Killen, and staff writers Leonard Chang and Noelle Valdivia. It was directed by Miguel Sapochnik. \\"Turtles All the Way Down\\" was well received by television critics, who praised its storylines. Commentators noted that the script was well written. Upon airing, \\"Turtles All the Way Down\\" obtained 2.87 million viewers in the United States and 0.9 million in the 18–49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. The show centers on Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs) a police detective living in two separate realities after a car accident. In the episode, Michael Britten finds out the truth about the car accident that caused his split realities, and seeks out those responsible for it. He finds out that Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) caused the accident, alongside Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman) and Captain Carl Kessel (Mark Harelik). ==Plot== In his \\"green reality\\" (where his son is alive and his wife is dead), Detective Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs) sits in a prison cell temporary for killing Detective Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman), who caused Michael's car accident. Meanwhile, his partner in the \\"green reality\\", Detective Isaiah \\"Bird\\" Freeman (Steve Harris) finds heroin that Hawkins, under orders from Captain Kessel (Mark Harelik), had placed in a self storage unit. Meanwhile, Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) shoots Carl Kessel in a hotel room, making it look like a suicide to cover up her involvement in Michael's accident. Michael is freed from the cell and Kessel's body is found. Michael regains consciousness (after having passed out from a gunshot wound when Ed Hawkins was chasing after him) near a dumpster in the \\"red reality\\" (where his wife is alive and son is dead). The still-alive Detective Hawkins takes Michael to his car, but Michael flees after attacking Hawkins and causes a car accident. Michael finds his therapist in the \\"red reality\\", Dr. John Lee (BD Wong), forces him to sew up the bullet wound, and takes him to the self-storage unit to show him the heroin stash. Seeing no heroin, Michael then locks Lee in the containment center and contacts his partner in the \\"red reality\\", detective Efrem Vega (Wilmer Valderrama). Vega secretly takes Britten to his house but, upon returning to the police station, is convinced that Michael is unstable and allows Michael to be captured. Michael is first taken to the hospital to receive medical treatment and then goes to jail. Harper visits Michael in jail. When Michael notices the caller ID of an incoming call matching Kessel's hotel room pseudonym, he realizes Harper is part of the conspiracy and attempts to strangle her. Later, Michael is visited by himself from the \\"green reality\\" who leads him to the jail door. Past the door, Michael first witnesses Kessel's murder and Detective Vega, in a penguin suit, shows Harper's heel breaking in the process hinting that this can be used as hard evidence to place Harper at Kessel's murder. Next Michael briefly meets his wife, Hannah (Laura Allen) in a restaurant before he finds his \\"green reality\\" self sleeping in his bedroom. He – his \\"red reality\\" self – lays down in bed as well and merges with his \\"green reality\\" self before waking up in said \\"green reality\\". In Harper's office, Michael confronts her about her involvement in his accident, pulling out his gun to shoot her. However, he instead lets Bird and another detective arrest her. Later, Dr. Evans applauds Michael's apparent rejection of the \\"red reality\\" and, when Michael suggests his fantastic experiences may have simply been a dream of the \\"red reality,\\" Dr. Evans warns him not to create a third reality. She suddenly goes still. Michael, confused, goes through her office door and finds himself in his bedroom. He goes downstairs and finds both his son, Rex (Dylan Minnette), and wife alive. Concerned about Michael's odd behavior, Hannah asks if he is okay. He replies, \\"I'm perfect,\\" and closes his eyes. ==Production== Series creator and executive producer Kyle Killen (pictured) wrote the story and teleplay of the episode, alongside staff writers Leonard Chang and Noelle Valdivia. The episode's teleplay was written by series creator and executive producer Kyle Killen, from a story by Killen, and staff writers Leonard Chang and Noelle Valdivia; it was Killen's seventh writing credit, and Chang and Valdivia's third writing credit each. It was directed by Miguel Sapochnik, his first directing credit for the series. In January 2012, it was announced that Kevin Weisman would appear in multiple episodes of Awake. The actor was later cast as Ed Hawkins, a cop who took over Michael's spot at the police department after his crash. This is his third appearance on the series, with the first being \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\", the eleven episode. Other guest stars included Laura Innes as Tricia Harper and Mark Harelik as Carl Kessel. The episode featured the song \\"Montana\\" by Youth Lagoon during the final scene. Many viewers wondered if the series creator had changed the ending for the last episode, due to the cancellation of the series. This caused series creator and executive producer Killen to assure viewers that the episode would have been \\"exactly the same\\" if it had been renewed for a second season. In a pre-broadcast interview by Entertainment Weekly with Killen and actor Jason Isaacs, Isaacs claimed that he found it \\"strangely ironic and amusing\\" to be promoting the series finale of the Awake series. Killen claimed that \\"When we wrote the episode, we didn't know it would be the end of the series\\". He stated that it had a \\"satisfying conclusion\\", \\"and I think it will be a satisfying way to leave the show\\". \\"Turtles All the Way Down\\" was scheduled to air as part two of the scheduled two-hour finale. NBC had changed the order, and aired it the following week. ==Reception== Ratings \\"Turtles All the Way Down\\" first premiered a day early in Canada on May 23, 2012 on Global between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., due to the season premiere of the Canadian series Rookie Blue, which aired in Awake regular time slot on Thursdays at 10:00 p.m. The episode premiered on May 24, 2012 in the United States on NBC between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. Upon airing, \\"Turtles All the Way Down\\" obtained 2.87 million viewers in the United States despite airing simultaneously with a rerun of The Mentalist on CBS and Rookie Blue on ABC. It acquired a 0.9 rating in the 18–49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings, meaning that it was seen by 0.9% of all 18- to 49-year-olds. The episode marked the series' highest ratings since the fifth episode \\"Oregon\\" which aired on March 29, 2012. Critical response \\"Turtles All the Way Down\\" was well received by television commentators. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review. He also noted that parts of the episode were \\"surprising\\", and that \\"the show embraced some final insanity before the end, it’s more the illusion of depth than actual depth\\". Handlen wrote that \\"it’s hard to ask for more from an hour of television\\", despite noting that he was \\"glad the series got cancelled\\". Handlen noted that he would \\"look forward to their next projects\\". Handlen concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of \\"B\\". Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a positive review and claimed that there were some \\"gut-wrenching\\" scenes in the episode. Fowler also opined that the episode was \\"thrilling\\", \\"frustrating\\", \\"fascinating\\", and \\"terrible\\" to see Hannah \\"crying over an arrested Britten\\". Fowler wrote that he \\"love[d] the open ending\\". Noting that Awake was \\"one of the good ones\\", Fowler concluded his review by giving the episode a \\"9.5 out of 10\\" classifying it as \\"amazing\\". Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic gave the episode a positive review. He opined that Michael \\"has a unique ability to dream in a way that feels real, why not recreate what was once lost\\". McHatton found it \\"fitting that the show ended with Michael closing his eyes. Despite the fact that he did not know what the phrase \\"turtles all the way down\\" meant, he concluded his review by giving the episode a score \\"5.0 out of 5.0\\". Ross Bonaime of Paste magazine gave the episode a complimentary review. He started by claiming that Awake was \\"the best drama to come out the 2011–12 season on television, and one of the finest NBC dramas in years\\". He also wondered \\"what Awake would be like in a Michael Britten-like alternate reality where the show lasted five seasons, or 10, or even just one more year\\", Could Awake maintain this story for long and still be compelling?\\" Bonaime wrote that it was \\"better to have one great season and be remembered fondly\\". Bonaime claimed that the \\"ending is quite smart, given that it never truly clarifies if Michael was dreaming the whole time, or if Dr. Lee was right and that he was on the verge of completely snapping, which makes much more sense\\". He was also grateful that \\"Awake decided to just go completely nuts with the last half of this episode\\". He claimed that the episode and series was \\"different, a rare move, especially on network television\\". He claimed that \\"Once Awake arrives on Netflix and DVD, people will rush through in a matter of days and will say they enjoyed their experience with this short yet sweet treasure\\". He claimed that works with Awake should be \\"rewarded\\" and \\"praised\\". Bonaime concluded his review by giving the episode a \\"9.0 out of 10\\". Screen Rant's Kevin Yeoman, gave much praise in the episode. Like Paste magazine and other critics reviews, Yeoman claimed that \\"there was certainly disappointment in finding out that Awake wouldn't see a second season, and would instead be looked at as a 13-episode miniseries\\". He claimed that the episode has the puzzling and high points that are similar to \\"That's Not My Penguin\\" and \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\". Again, Screen Crush's Kevin Fitzpatrick was also disappointed that there would not be a second season. Verne Gay of Newsday gave the episode a complimenting review. He called it \\"promising\\". He noted that he could see \\"why Awake was canceled\\". He blessed \\"the show for at least trying\\". He called it \\"challenging\\" and \\"original\\". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode \\"fascinating\\", \\"puzzling\\" and \\"moving\\". Carl Cortez of Assignment X, again, enjoyed the episode. In his \\"B+\\" grade review, he noted that \\"you can view it as another missed opportunity\\". He claimed that parts of the episode were \\"confusing\\". He stated that he would \\"prefer to have more questions than answers\\". He argued that the episode felt more like a \\"Series Finale, than Season Finale\\", which he called \\"a good thing\\", \\"Too many good shows go off into the sunset without a single resolution and this one at least strives for something more\\". He also argued that NBC should have \\"put a little more promotional push\\". He called it \\"challenging\\" and \\"interesting\\". ==See also== *Keynesian beauty contest ==References * \\"Turtles All the Way Down\\" at NBC.com * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Awake (TV series) episodes Category:American television series finales Category:Television episodes directed by Miguel Sapochnik ","title":"Turtles All the Way Down (Awake)"},{"id":"35930794","text":"Naked Truth is an American, Atlanta, Georgia-based quartet, originating in the local hardcore scene in 1988, although the individual band members were born in from various locations: vocalist Doug Watts came from Detroit, bassist Jeff from Harlem, New York, and drummer Bernard Dawson from Los Angeles, with Jimmie Westley as the only Georgia native, from Savannah. The dreadlocked group's singer came to the notice of Bernie Rhodes, and the band signed a recording contract with Sony. They relocated to London, saw their bassist depart due to homesickness and recruited the London-born Kwame Boaten. Green With Rage (1991) was a mini-album which introduced Naked Truth's raw, aggressive sound. They followed that release with another EP, Read Between the Lines. The band supported Little Angels on tour, and they built a cult following enhanced by gigs in London. The album, Fight, was released by Sony in 1993, mixing genres such as jazz and death metal. A proposed name change to Watts coincided with Sony's decision to drop the outfit from its roster. ==ReferencesOther sources== * * * Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Musical groups from Atlanta ","title":"Naked Truth (band)"},{"id":"35930812","text":"Jack Scott (May 12, 1910 - December 30, 2000) was an Irish born union activist and member of the Communist Party of Canada.

She was also one of the first two single female missionaries of the LDS Church.Diane L. Mangum, \\"The First Sister Missionaries\\", Ensign, July 1980. ==Biography== Jennie Brimhall was born in Spanish Fork, Utah Territory, to George H. Brimhall and Alsina Elizabeth Wilkins. Jennie was educated as a teacher at Brigham Young University (BYU) and taught school in San Juan County, Utah. On April 1, 1898, Jennie was set apart as one of the first two single women in the LDS Church to be formally selected as full-time church missionaries. The other was her childhood friend Inez Knight. Jennie Brimhall and Inez Knight were missionary companions in England in 1898; Jennie returned to Utah in November 1898 due to poor health. After she returned from her mission, Jennie Brimhall married J. William Knight in January 1899. (William Knight was the brother of Inez Knight, her friend and missionary companion.) Shortly thereafter, she accompanied her husband to Canada, where his father Jesse Knight had established the Mormon settlement of Raymond in present-day Alberta. While living in Raymond, Jennie Knight was the president of the Taylor Stake's Young Ladies Mutual Improvement Association from 1903 to 1906.Melvin S. Tagg, A History of the Mormon Church in Canada (Lethbridge, Alberta: Lethbridge Herald, 1968) p. 103. William Knight and Jennie Knight later returned to live in Utah. In 1921, Jennie Knight was selected as the first counselor to Clarissa S. Williams in the General Presidency of the Relief Society. Along with Louise Y. Robison, Knight was a counselor to Williams until 1928, when the presidency was released from their duties. Knight was the mother of two sons. The Knight Mangum Building on the BYU campus in Provo, Utah, is named after Knight and her sister-in-law Jennie Knight Mangum. Jennie died on March 31, 1957 of heart disease.

Its first employee was John Smithman, a former RCAF pilot from Montreal, who had been flying as a captain with Royalair Ltd. a short- service airline based at the Montreal's Dorval airport. Royalair had been providing passenger services for Pembroke until it went bankrupt in 1969. John was a captain with Royalair and when he heard that Del O'Brien, a Pembroke Lawyer and 9 other investors wanted to build an airline to replace Royalair's services, he drove to Pembroke to meet with Del O'Brien. He offered to help Del and his partners obtain the appropriate licenses from Canada's Ministry of Transportation. Within a few months, the licenses were issued and the airline began flying daily flights to and from Toronto. They purchased one Beech 18 aircraft and leased another as backup from St. Catherines' Meisner brothers. John hired and trained 3 pilots to provide the four pilot crew needed to fly two flights a day to Toronto. Three events were significant for promoting the new airline. 1\\\\. Stubby Ross, owner of TimeAir Ltd., an Albertan Class II airline based in Lethbridge Alberta called John one day and offered to help in any way that he could. Stubby offered a Beech 18 aircraft at an affordable price. John, along with Pembroke Airport Manager Dick Wigston, flew to Lethbridge to pick up the aircraft and fly it back to Pembroke for painting with the white and blue colours of Pem-Air. 2\\\\. After receiving a call from John Smithman, Air Canada agreed to include Pem-Air in their media event promoting their new 747 aircraft in 1970 at the Toronto Pearson Airport. \\"We took our new stewardess Carol Suter in her attractive light blue uniform with us to Toronto and parked our beautiful small aircraft under the right wing of the 747 for press photos. The photos showed up in newspapers across Canada as an example of Canada's biggest and smallest airlines,\\" commented John. \\"Air Canada rewarded our crew by taking us up for a spin over Toronto in their brand new 747 that day.\\" 3\\\\. After hiring pilots Bud Mason, George Staples and Myron Sikora, John conducted type training by taking them up to fly formation over Pembroke to promote the arrival of Pem-Air to Pembroke. Within 3 years, passenger loads had climbed to 2000 a month; and the airline was established. Our biggest clients were Petawawa Army Base, Chalk River Atomic Energy, and Eddy Match Company. After 31 years, in 2001, the company ended its route between Pembroke, Ontario and Toronto Pearson International Airport, after failing to reach an agreement with Atomic Energy of Canada (that was responsible for two-thirds of its business) the commercial airline service was discontinued to refocus on its flight school an aviation service operated jointly in partnership with Algonquin College. Over its 31-year history the airline operated several other routes for shorter periods of time including flights from Ottawa to Kitchener; Ottawa to Hamilton Certain routes out of Ottawa operated under the Trillium Air brand. == See also == * List of defunct airlines of Canada == References == Category:Defunct airlines of Canada Category:Airlines established in 1970 Category:Airlines disestablished in 2002 ","title":"Pem-Air"},{"id":"35930888","text":"The 2000 West Virginia Mountaineers football team represented West Virginia University in the 2000 NCAA Division I-A football season.

As missionaries, Knight and Brimhall were frequently asked to speak at public meetings and distribute missionary tracts on the street. Because Knight and Brimhall were the first, and for a time only, lady missionaries serving Europe, they were often asked to travel throughout England to speak. In a letter to the Deseret Evening News, missionary Joseph S. Broadbent wrote that \\"Sisters Jennie Brimhall and Inez Knight, both of Provo, Utah, each spoke at some length on Utah and her people and bore strong testimonies on the restoration of the Gospel and the divine mission of Joseph Smith. There were about 800 people present and a pin could be heard drop.\\" Knight and Brimhall not only traveled extensively in England, but throughout other parts of Europe as well. Knight reported having spent \\"a month visiting the principal cities of France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, and Holland. Knight believed that one of her main purposes as a missionary was to dispel the belief, common throughout Europe, that Mormon women \\"were downtrodden slaves\\". Knight and the other missionaries were not always welcome, however. In February 1899, Knight was in attendance at a church meeting in Bristol when all of the windows were broken by anti-Mormon rioters. Knight, her companion, and the other missionaries had to seek protection from the local police. Although Jennie Brimhall returned to Utah in November 1898 due to poor health, Knight continued her mission until 1900 with several other companions, including Liza Chipman and J. Clara Holbrook, both from Utah. Due to the scarcity of lady missionaries, however, at times Knight served alone. She recorded in her journal one meeting in which \\"I was the only girl. I felt more conspicuous by the elders beginning their remarks; my brethren and sister.\\" Areas in which Knight served included Cheltenham, London, Kent, and Bristol. Knight returned home from Britain in June 1900, after over two years service throughout Britain, Scotland, and Wales. ==Personal life and community work== In June 1902, Knight married Robert Eugene Allen, a prominent local banker and community developer, in the Salt Lake City temple. Robert Allen was born on December 21, 1877, in Coalville, Utah, to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas L. Allen. Mr. Allen served an LDS mission in Liverpool, England, in 1905, and attended the Brigham Young Academy where he met Knight. They had five sons, including Robert K. Allen, Joseph Knight Allen, and Mark E. Allen. After her marriage, Inez Allen was active in various areas within the church and the community. From 1927 until her death (10 years) she was a member of the Relief Society's general board. Allen was also extensively involved with Brigham Young Academy for several years following her mission to Great Britain. In 1900, just a few months after returning home, Allen was named matron for \\"Missionary Theology for Girls\\" of the Academy. Allen was the matron of the school for two years despite personal setbacks, which included falling ill with smallpox in October 1900. Allen helped initiate the community welfare department in Provo and was active in the Red Cross organization of Utah County. Allen was frequently honored for her role as one of the first two single female missionaries for the LDS church. In 1934 she and Jennie Brimhall Knight were honored by Church President Heber J. Grant at a meeting of the Yesharah Society. In addition to her leadership in the Relief Society and membership in the Yesharah Society, Allen participated in various other activities and clubs, including the Nelke Reading Club. ==Political work== Allen was also active in the Democratic Party in Utah, serving on various committees and in different offices as early as 1895 at the age of 19 years old. She was named a member of the executive committee of Governor George Dern's advisory council for unemployment relief in 1931. She served four years as a Democratic national committeewoman, during which time she attended two national conventions, one in New York in 1924 and the other in Houston, Texas in 1928. She once ran as a Democratic candidate for State Senate, and was endorsed by William Jennings Bryan and Heber J. Grant for the position. At times, Allen's political beliefs and religious views clashed. As a national committeewoman for the Democratic party, Inez Allen was a supporter of 1932 Democratic candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, Allen opposed the repeal of the 18th Amendment, one of Roosevelt's platform planks. In 1924, Allen was a Utah delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Because her husband was a Republican, Allen's political experiences were sometimes unique. For example, in 1924, Allen attended both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, the first she attended as a Democratic national committeewoman, the second she attended with her husband, who was acting as a delegate from Utah. Additionally, Allen was elected to the National Women's Democratic Committee in 1928. Allen was frequently recognized and honored for her political efforts, and was named Utah's \\"Goddess of Liberty\\" at the 1898 or 1900 Provo Fourth of July Celebration. In 1937, Allen died unexpectedly in her home in Provo, Utah, of gastritis. Her funeral was held June 9, 1937, and speakers included Dr. Franklin S. Harris, then President of BYU, and Stephen L. Richards of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church). The funeral was large, with members of the Yesharah Society, Relief Society General Board, and faculty of BYU in attendance. She is buried at the Provo City Cemetery. ==Legacy== Inez Allen and her husband passed on a legacy of participation in local, state, and national politics to their children. Robert K. Allen served nationally as a U.S. Treasury agent from 1934 to 1945, working both in the United States and at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. He served locally as well, running for Provo City Council in 1961 and for mayor of Provo in 1965. Both Mrs. and Mr. Allen donated generous amounts of money to Brigham Young Academy. Inez Allen began donating as early as 1897. A year before her mission, she donated $10,000 to the institution, the only woman among the ten significant donors that year. As a donor, Allen was asked to give a speech at the 1897 ground-breaking ceremony of the new college building, again being the only woman invited to do so. A men's dormitory hall was named in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Knight in 1937. ==Publications== * * * ==Notes *Inez Knight Allen diary (finding aid), Brigham Young University, Harold B. Lee Library, L.

Joshi became the general secretary of BJP in Gujarat. It seems Modi feels that Sanjay Joshi was instrumental in his expulsion from Gujarat.

In his tussle with Modi, Joshi apparently enjoys the support of several RSS groups, and also former BJP chief Rajnath Singh, and others. Currently Joshi has no assignment with BJP; He stays in Central Delhi. His place of residence is full of political activity with senior BJP leaders and party workers wants to meet him.

According to Romanian media, he is also an Internet media activist, known as 'one of those who made 700 thousand Spaniards take the streets' in 2011. == Whistleblowing and investigative journalism == In December 2010, under the handle of 'FuturePress', Noel and Carrion started to write to the news portal WLCentral.org where they exposed in different languages and using different approaches for more than one year analysis on whistleblowing material, articles and reports on human-rights violations, civic-movements and net- neutrality. In the late 2011, Pedro Noel along with other journalists started the Associated Whistleblowing Press, a media agency focused on the defense of human rights by promoting transparency, freedom of information and speech, whistleblowing and investigative journalism, conceived as a global network made up of cooperative local platforms and actors. As the editor of AWP, Pedro Noel took part in more than 50 revelations of wrongdoing, corruption and abuse in Spain, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru and Iceland, since 2011. == Denouncing freedom of expression violations in Ecuador and Latin America == In a controversial session at 32nd Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg in 2015, Noel held a talk with Canadian journalist Bethany Horne denouncing violations of free speech standards by the Ecuadorian government. During the talk, Pedro Noel released documents providing evidence that press and media coverage of critical issues were considered by Ecuadorian government as risk factors for democratic stability through the local platform Ecuador Transparente, operated by Associated Whistleblowing Press. The publication followed previous denounces, also performed by Ecuador Transparente, of physical and on-line surveillance and spying against activists, journalists and politicians in Ecuador, performed by the local government. In April 2016, Noel also took part in the publication of alleged proofs of illegal Internet censorship performed by Ecuadorian government.

It has been in continual use since its dedication in 1905. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 for its state-level significance in the themes of architecture and art. It was nominated for the neoclassicism expressed throughout the building, from the exterior architecture to the interior design and artwork. With ==Origin== On July 29, 1870, the Minnesota Legislature legally organized Cottonwood County. Its county commission first gathered to do their administrative work at a house in Big Bend, a small community northwest of the future site of Windom. Since the commissioners lacked a permanent building where they could meet and store their paperwork, meeting in private homes was common. As the county's population grew and demands on the judicial and governmental systems increased, local officials recognized the need to consolidate both people and paperwork, and residents began to call for a permanent home. Big Bend, however, didn’t meet the county's needs because it was six miles away from any hotels and businesses. The commissioners decided to name Windom, which had been platted on June 20, 1871, as the county seat—in part because it had been chosen as a stop on the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad. Cottonwood County commissioners first met in Windom in January 1872. Talk of building a courthouse continued for a decade without action because the county needed to reserve its funds for countering the devastation caused by Rocky Mountain locusts between 1873 and 1877. In the meantime, Cottonwood County rented various structures in Windom to house the first government offices. By 1883, a wooden structure that met the county's needs was built. A decade later, however, it was too small, and local citizens talked about building a centrally located courthouse that would serve a population of 30,000. ==Construction== The Cottonwood County commissioners toured four states to select an architect for the new courthouse. By November 1903, they chose the firm of Omeyer & Thori of Saint Paul. By March 1904, they awarded the construction contract to J. B. Nelson and Company, contractors in Mankato, for the sum of $59,994 (). Work began in April 1904 and the cornerstone was laid in July 1904. In October 1904, Odin J. Oyen of La Crosse, Wisconsin, who specialized in ecclesiastical decoration, received a contract to supervise the building's interior decoration. As construction progressed, costs soared past the original estimate to $100,000 (), including interiors, when the county took advantage of a new state program that granted loans for the construction of courthouses. By August 1905 the building was complete. A dedication ceremony was held on November 3, 1905, with Governor John Johnson delivering the primary speech. This event brought crowds to Windom to admire the new building, which consisted of two stories of red sandstone and brick set upon a rusticated basement. It combined elements of the Neoclassical and Renaissance Revival styles and included a central domed atrium which rose through the two upper stories and provided access to offices and chambers. In the second floor courtroom, Oyen executed the gold-leaf-embellished mural of \\"Justice\\" which was patterned after the painting of the same name in the Palais de Justice, Paris. Between 1905 and 1909 work continued on the courthouse's grounds and interior. Sidewalks, gutters, and curbs were eventually completed. In 1927 professional landscapers planted 597 shrubs and trees. ==Later use== Cottonwood County commissioners approved the first courthouse remodeling project in 1930, in part because of the need to accommodate new female voters, jurors, and staff inside the building. The jury room was remodeled and additional restroom space for women was added. The next major remodeling project occurred during the Great Depression. A number of new governmental agencies were created which required space. During World War II, additional agencies were created to deal with new crises. The basement was remodeled to give agents more room. In 1977, the Cottonwood County Courthouse was placed in the National Register of Historical Places. This pattern of modernization and reparation has continued until the present day. Elevators to aid the disabled and a musical dome that chimes every day are two of the more notable modern improvements. Through all the changes, the Cottonwood County Courthouse has remained a historical gem and a source of pride for the people of the county. ==See also== *List of county courthouses in Minnesota *National Register of Historic Places listings in Cottonwood County, Minnesota ==References * Cottonwood County District Court Category:1905 establishments in Minnesota Category:Buildings and structures in Cottonwood County, Minnesota Category:County courthouses in Minnesota Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Government buildings completed in 1905 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cottonwood County, Minnesota Category:Neoclassical architecture in Minnesota Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in Minnesota Category:Omeyer & Thori buildings ","title":"Cottonwood County Courthouse"},{"id":"35931512","text":"The University of Missouri School of Accountancy is one of 19 schools and colleges at the University of Missouri.

Shivnarine Chanderpaul is an international cricketer who has played for the West Indies since 1994, and captained the team for a short time. He has scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on 30 occasions in Test cricket and 11 times in One Day International (ODI) matches. He is West Indies' second-most prolific batsman in international cricket, after Brian Lara, having accumulated almost 20,000 runs. He bats with an unorthodox technique, which is often described as \\"crab-like\\", and is highly regarded for his \\"patience and obstinacy at the crease.\\" In his list of the 100 greatest Test players, Shane Warne described Chanderpaul as \\"a bloke you needed to crowbar away from the crease.\\" In 2008 he was named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and as the Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council. Chanderpaul made his Test debut in March 1994, selected as an all-rounder who could bowl leg breaks, against England. He reached his first century three years later, scoring an unbeaten 137 against India at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown. During the initial phase of his career, Chanderpaul was criticised for his inability to convert half-centuries into centuries, but he proved his critics wrong during the 2001–02 series against India when he scored three centuries in five matches, thus earning the man of the series accolade. During that tournament, he batted for 1,513 minutes between dismissals, a record in Test cricket. Despite being well known for his patient batting, Chanderpaul scored a 69-ball century against Australia in 2003, which at the time was the third fastest century in terms of balls faced. His highest score in Test cricket is 203 not out, a total he achieved twice, first against South Africa in 2005, and then against Bangladesh in 2012. He has scored centuries against every Test playing nation with the exception of Sri Lanka, and has scored seven centuries against India, more than any other team. In ODI cricket, Chanderpaul's debut came seven months after his first Test appearance, but he was not required to bat as the West Indies reached the target to beat India. He scored his maiden ODI century shortly after his first Test century, in May 1997 against India, scoring 109 runs. He reached his highest ODI score in 1999, making 150 runs during a West Indian record partnership of 226 with Carl Hooper, against South Africa. That innings, along with his score of 149 not out against India in 2007 are the only times he has finished a century innings with a strike rate of quicker than a-run-a-ball in ODI cricket. In both Test and ODI cricket, Chanderpaul has remained not out more often than being dismissed once he has scored a century: in Tests, he has been not out in 18 of 30 innings, while out of eleven ODI centuries, he was unbeaten eight times. Chanderpaul has not been selected to play Twenty20 International cricket since 2010, and in his 22 appearances prior to that, his highest score was 41 runs. As of February 2015, he is tenth among all-time century makers in international cricket. ==Key== { * * Remained not out - * M Man of the match - * He was the Captain of the West Indies team in that match. } ==Tests== {class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" + Centuries in Test cricket - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:60px\\"  Score ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:125px\\"  Against ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:40px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:275px\\"  Venue ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:50px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:75px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:50px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  -  1 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   3  1  3/5  Kensington Oval, Bridgetown  Home   Won  -  2 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   4  1  4/6  Bourda, Georgetown  Home   Won  -  3 ! scope=\\"row\\"    6  1  1/5  Bourda, Georgetown  Home   Drawn  -  4 ! scope=\\"row\\"    6  2  3/5  Kensington Oval, Bridgetown  Home   Won  -  5 ! scope=\\"row\\"    6  2  4/5  Antigua Recreation Ground, St. John's  Home   Drawn -  6 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  2  3/3  Eden Gardens, Kolkata  Away   Drawn  -  7 ! scope=\\"row\\"    6  1  1/4  Bourda, Georgetown  Home   Lost  -  8 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   6  4  4/4  Antigua Recreation Ground, St. John's  Home   Won  -  9 ! scope=\\"row\\"    7  3  2/4  Kingsmead, Durban  Away   Lost  -  10 ! scope=\\"row\\"    6  2  2/2  Sabina Park, Kingston  Home   Won  -  11 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  2  1/4  Lord's, London  Away   Lost  -  12 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   5  1  1/4  Bourda, Georgetown  Home   Drawn  -  13 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  2  4/4  Antigua Recreation Ground, St. John's  Home   Drawn  -  14 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   5  3  1/2  Kensington Oval, Bridgetown  Home   Won  -  15 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  4  3/4  Old Trafford, Manchester  Away   Lost  -  16 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   5  1  4/4  Riverside Ground, Chester-le- Street  Away   Lost  -  17 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  1  1/3  St George's Park, Port Elizabeth  Away   Won  -  18 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  2  1/3  Sabina Park, Kingston  Home   Lost  -  19 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   5  2  2/3  Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound  Home   Drawn  -  20 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  1  2/2  McLean Park, Napier  Away   Drawn  -  21 ! scope=\\"row\\"    6  2  5/5  Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain  Home   Drawn  -  22 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   4  2  2/3  Warner Park, Basseterre  Home   Drawn  -  23 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   5  3  3/3  Windsor Park, Roseau  Home   Drawn  -  24 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  1  1/3  Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi  Away   Lost  -  25 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  1  1/3  Kensington Oval, Bridgetown  Home   Lost  -  26 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  1  1/2  Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium, Mirpur  Away   Won  -  27 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  2  2/2  Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium, Khulna  Away   Won  -  28 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  2  2/2  Windsor Park, Roseau  Home   Won  -  29 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  1  3/3  Seddon Park, Hamilton  Away   Lost  -  30 ! scope=\\"row\\"    5  3  2/2  Beausejour Stadium, Gros Islet  Home   Won  } ==One Day Internationals== {class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" + Centuries in One Day Internationals ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  No. ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:60px\\"  Score ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:125px\\"  Against ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:60px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:275px\\"  Venue ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:50px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:75px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:50px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  -  1 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   2  2   Kensington Oval, Bridgetown  Home   Won  -  2 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   2  1   Buffalo Park, East London  Away   Won  -  3 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   2  2   Beausejour Stadium, Gros Islet  Home   Won  -  4 ! scope=\\"row\\"    2  1   National Stadium, Karachi  Away   Won  -  5 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   2  2   Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur  Away   Lost  -  6 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   2  2   Sabina Park, Kingston  Home   Won  -  7 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   3  1   Edgbaston, Birmingham  Away   Won  -  8 ! scope=\\"row\\"    3  2   Harare Sports Club  Away   Lost  -  9 ! scope=\\"row\\"    4  2   Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi  Neutral   Lost  -  10 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   4  1   Providence Stadium  Home  Won  -  11 ! scope=\\"row\\"  M   2  1   Sabina Park, Kingston  Home   Won  } ==Notes and references== ;Notes ;References Category:West Indian cricket lists Chanderpaul, Shivnarine ","title":"List of international cricket centuries by Shivnarine Chanderpaul"},{"id":"35931605","text":"McArtor is a surname.

The East Bay station is served by the Berryessa/North San José–Daly City line and Berryessa/North San José–Richmond line. It was the southern terminus of both lines from its opening on March 25, 2017, until June 13, 2020, when BART opened the first phase of the Silicon Valley BART extension. The station has an island platform between the surface-level BART tracks, with a fare mezzanine above the platform. A footbridge connects the mezzanine to a rotunda which serves as the station entrance. ==History== Planning The station under construction in January 2014 Planning for the Warm Springs extension around 1994; by 1998, BART estimated it would cost $550 million, with 7,800 daily riders by 2010. A 1994 study by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission forecast 3,200 daily riders in 2010. BART held a ceremonial groundbreaking for the Warm Springs Extension in September 2009, with completion then expected in 2014. Construction of the station began in 2011. The BART Board of Directors officially named the station Warm Springs/South Fremont on May 24, 2012. The name combined the historic neighborhood name of Warm Springs (the station name during planning) with the modern South Fremont designator. Opening A train at the station in October 2017 The Warm Springs Extension suffered a series of delays from the original 2014 planned opening. BART power cables unexpectedly needed replacement, and the new train control system on the extension proved difficult to integrate with the original train control system on the rest of BART. By September 2016, BART planned to open the station the next month, which newspapers labeled an \\"October surprise\\" - a news event for the November 8 vote on a BART bond measure - but this did not occur. The yet-to-open station was fully staffed beginning in September 2016 because BART union positions are only reassigned twice per year. The station ultimately opened on March 25, 2017. The conceptual design of the station was by local architect Robin Chiang, with final design by HNTB. San Francisco Chronicle architecture critic John King praised the entrance rotunda with Catherine Widgery’s “Sky Cycles” artwork, but criticized the rotunda being scaled down from Chiang's design, as well as the lack of seating on the platform. Seven bus bays south of the rotunda are used by AC Transit buses as well as private shuttles. Because of delays with new BART railcars entering service, the station was initially served only by one line at a time (the Warm Springs/South Fremont–Daly City line on weekdays before 6 pm, and the Richmond-Warm Springs/South Fremont line at other times), with the other line running only to Fremont. On September 10, 2018, both lines began running to Warm Springs/South Fremont for their full operating hours. Some VTA bus service switched from Fremont to Warm Springs/South Fremont on October 8, 2018 as a result of the increased service. Three of the four VTA routes serving Warm Springs were discontinued on December 28, 2019, during a reorganization of the VTA network. The remaining route was discontinued upon the June 13, 2020 opening of the first phase of the Silicon Valley BART extension (after which Warm Springs/South Fremont station was no longer the southern terminal of East Bay BART service) leaving only AC Transit buses serving the station. Adjacent development The footbridge and adjacent development under construction in January 2020 Warm Springs/South Fremont station is the centerpiece of the Warm Springs Community Plan area, which the city of Fremont designated for federally-assisted transit oriented development projects with higher density than the rest of Warm Springs. The Union Pacific Railroad (UP) Warm Springs Subdivision runs just west of the Warm Springs Extension tracks. In 2011, UP purchased of land adjacent to the former NUMMI plant across the parallel tracks from the under-construction station, intending to build a rail yard. The city, which had included that land in its development plans, hired a lobbyist in an attempt to accelerate the development and prevent the construction of the rail yard. In May 2015, housing developer Lennar Corporation bought the northern of the land from UP. In February 2016, the city approved plans for a cable-stayed pedestrian and bicycle bridge connecting the station mezzanine to a new plaza on the west side of the tracks, to which pedestrian access has been otherwise deemed difficult. The bridge, then planned for completion in 2018, would provide access from the new developments and the adjacent Tesla Factory, which had no convenient pedestrian route to the station because of the rail lines. During the bidding process, the cost of the bridge was increased from $25 million to $35 million, and completion delayed to 2020. Construction began in early 2019, with completion expected in 2020. The main span was put in place in September 2019. ==References *BART - Warm Springs/South Fremont *BART - Warm Springs Extension Project Category:Bay Area Rapid Transit stations in Alameda County, California Category:Buildings and structures in Fremont, California Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2017 Category:2017 establishments in California ","title":"Warm Springs/South Fremont station"},{"id":"35931615","text":"McAslan is a surname.

It is a deeply stratified village site spanning the precontact era from the late Archaic to an Oneota occupation, with a particular concentration of Woodland period ceramics. The site is atop a hill that was formerly an island in a lake. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 for its state significance in the theme of archaeology. In the late 1970s the site was developed into Mountain County Park, a public park operated by Cottonwood County. ==Indigenous occupation== Cottonwood County's now-dry Mountain Lake was the site of Native American villages and encampments over the course of 3,000 years. The area has provided clues—some of the oldest evidence of human habitation in present-day Minnesota—about the lives of a group of people who remained relatively isolated from Upper Mississippi River trade networks. Named by William Mason for the raised island in its center, Mountain Lake shows a near-continuous record of human activity stretching back 3,000 years. In 1976, an archeological team led by Joseph Hudak carrying out a dig there found traces of an ancient village. Carbon dating determined the remains of a round dwelling on the site to be roughly 2,100 years old, making it the oldest dwelling yet found in Minnesota. The amount of material uncovered on the dwelling site indicated that it had been used for only one winter season, making it a remarkably intact snapshot of life in the Middle Woodland period. Because shards of decorated pottery from the village site are similar to those found on nearby islands, archaeologists have identified the Mountain Lake village as part of the Fox Lake focus, named for a nearby village site on Fox Lake. The Fox Lake people lived on islands in present-day Southwestern Minnesota from approximately 100 BCE to 850 CE, hunted bison, and had a unique style of pottery featuring wide mouths and impressions made with cord-wrapped paddles. The Fox Lake people seem to have used items like certain types of hide scrapers and crushed-shell pottery later than groups to the east, indicating that they remained isolated from the river trade routes used by the Oneota culture. Anthropologist Karl Schlesier has found evidence that the Fox Lake group—possible ancestors of Crow and Hidatsa people—later migrated northwest into present-day central North Dakota. Artifacts like crushed shell pottery and certain types of hide scrapers indicate that the Mountain Lake area was eventually inhabited by Oneota groups, whose descendants include the Ho-Chunk, Otoe, Iowa, and Missouria. ==Post-colonial history== In the 1870s and 1880s, Mountain Island was a source of wood fuel for the settler-colonists who moved to Cottonwood County. In the early 1890s, it seemed an ideal place for a summer resort. However, the lowland area surrounding the lake was swampy, and the island was difficult to reach. Mountain Lake was drained between 1905 and 1906 for additional farmland, and farmers raised produce on the fertile lakebed for the next several decades. A road was built to provide access to the former island. Interest in the hill grew in the 1950s when flint arrowheads were found by Sam Franz, whose father owned the farmland surrounding the old island. Excavations at the site led by Lloyd Wilford in 1956 uncovered a \\"deeply stratified village site\\" and indicators that it had been occupied from the Late Archaic through the Middle Woodland periods. Further excavations by Wilford seven years later identified similarities in the form of arrowheads and pottery with nearby sites. As a result of these surveys, Mountain Park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 4, 1973. To prevent damage to the culturally significant site, construction of campground facilities was kept to the side of the island, which had previously been submerged. Some of the dig's findings were displayed at the Science Museum of Minnesota in Saint Paul; a replica of the round dwelling and some of the artifacts found at the site were also displayed at Heritage House in Mountain Lake. Cottonwood County bought Mountain Park from the Franz family in November 1976, and major development proceeded in 1979 with the assistance of the Law and Conservation Fund (LAWCON). Roads, toilets, trails, a picnic shelter, entry signage, and a well were built at a cost of $31,000 (). The undeveloped rise of the former island at Mountain Park is a superior site for observing wildlife and birds of many species.

It was the principal ceremonial center of the Prather Complex, the northeasternmost regional variant of the Mississippian cultures. It also bordered on several Upper Mississippian cultures, including the Fort Ancient peoples of Southern Indiana, Southern Ohio and Northeastern Kentucky. ==Site description== The Prather Site is located west of the Ohio River and east of Silver Creek on a loess-capped upland ridge. It is unusual for a Mississippian mound center to be located in the upland area rather than the alluvial valley closer to the river, but the site is watered by permanent natural springs and shallow streams. Other sites in the complex to the northeast of the site are also situated primarily in the uplands, while those to the south and southwest are located in the alluvial valley. This implies the inhabitants of the area may have settle farther back from the river in an attempt to avoid contact with people traveling on the river, trading the richer soils and marine resources for this added safety. The site itself consists of a residential village area surrounding four platform mounds arranged in a roughly rectangular pattern around a central plaza area. Dating done from samples obtained from the largest mound indicate it was used from approximately 1000 to 1180 CE. It is possible this area was surrounded by a palisade, although currently one has not been located. The site is located next to Indiana State Road 62, immediately west of the former Indiana Army Ammunition Plant. Until relatively recently the area was rural but residential and industrial encroachment is rapidly changing the area. Multiple modern development are planned for the area, including a new bridge over the Ohio River and new housing developments, that could have significant impact on the site and currently threaten its preservation as a viable archaeological site. ==Excavations== The site has undergone several site surveys and some excavations during its modern history. Eli Lilly and the Indiana Historical Society employed E.Y. Guernsey to carry out surveys and excavations at Clark County sites in the early 1930s. He noted three of the mounds at the site, the smallest of which he partially excavated and the largest he examined. Guernsey noted several different types of mortuary practices at the sites, including stone box graves and several flexed and extended burials beneath a fired clay floor. He also discovered typical Mississippian culture pottery, known for its use of crushed marine shells as a tempering agent, a stone discoidal associated with the game of chunkey, a shell gorget and a copper-covered, carved wooden raptorial bird covered in beaten copper. The present whereabouts of all of the artifacts he collected are not currently known, but some are curated at the Glenn Black Laboratory of Archaeology at Indiana University-Bloomington, and at the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology. Several amateur archaeologists occasionally dug at the site over the years after Guernsey, but the next major professional archaeological work at the site was a field school held by Donald Janzen in 1971. He reported one large single mound at the site. He also found sections of a wall trench structure dating ton approximately 1045 CE, and examples Mississippian pottery. Among ceramics found were Mississippian plain pottery, some rare decorated examples with incised lines and red filming, and a fragment of a black-on-buff negative painted bottle. The next major excavations at the site were undertaken in 2003 by Cheryl Munson and Robert McCullough, with funding provided by the National Park Service and administered by the Indiana Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology. ==Prather Complex== The Prather Complex (or \\"Falls Mississippian\\" ) is the northeasternmost variant of the Middle Mississippian culture. It is a group of sites located in the Falls of the Ohio region of central Kentucky and southern Indiana. It is separated from the next closest Mississippian variant, the Angel Phase centered on the Angel Mounds site near Evansville, Indiana, down the Ohio River approximately to the southwest. The section of the river between the two was an empty buffer zone. Another empty buffer zone stretched up the Ohio River to the northeast, separating the peoples of the Prather complex from Fort Ancient culture populations. Although it is possible these empty zones were for social or political reasons, it may also be because the narrowing of the alluvial valley upstream and downstream of the Falls region made it less suitable for the intensive maize agriculture practiced by the societies. The Falls region is the only wide expanse of bottom land flood terrace in between the Little Miami River at Cincinnati, Ohio (occupied by Fort Ancient peoples) and the Anderson River near Evansville, Indiana (occupied by the Angel Phase). This expanse of flood plain is similar to areas occupied by classic Mississippian sites in the Midwest and Southeast. The Prather, Willey, Spangler-Koons, and Newcomb/Elrod/Hale are the largest sites of the complex. Other smaller sites include the Ellingsworth, Smith, Clark's Point, Devil's Backbone, Eva Bandman, and Shippingport sites. Although the Prather site may have been the center of ceremony and politics for the complex, the presence of stone box graves at several of the sites in the complex such as Willey and Spangler-Koons suggest that mortuary rituals may not have been centralized at the site. ==See also== * List of Mississippian sites ==References * Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 13, Part 1 * Producing Multiscalar Data on Falls Mississippian Settlement Practices with Informatics and Outreach * Archaeology of the Lower Ohio River Valley * INDIANA ARCHAEOLOGY Volume 6 Number 1 2011 Category:Middle Mississippian culture Category:Archaeological sites in Indiana Category:Geography of Clark County, Indiana ","title":"Prather Site"},{"id":"35931963","text":"One Sonic Society is a contemporary worship music collective from around the globe. That collective is composed of songwriter Jason Ingram on vocals, guitar and piano, Delirious? lead guitarist Stuart Garrard on guitar and vocals, Hillsong UNITED drummer Paul Mabury on drums and programming, Jonathan Thatcher bass guitarist from Delirious? on bass and synths. The Christian music collective released their debut studio album under the Essential Records label on 28 February 2012 called Forever Reign. Their single \\"Forever Reign\\" was put in rotation during 2011 by many US radio stations. On 7 January 2012, the song was No. 7 on K-LOVE top songs chart and was at the same number on 14 January. ==Background== Jason Ingram, Stuart Garrard, Paul Mabury and Jonathan Thatcher formed the Christian Music collective in 2009. The band was formed in 2009 at the end of Delirious?, which Stu G sought out Christian artist to work with in Nashville at the time that is when he met up with Ingram. After they saw how the group would work together they added in Mabury, an Ingram connection, and Thatcher a Stu G add from his former band Delirious?. The One aspect of their name came from \\"just the vision of the four of us being together in unity\\", which the \\"Sonic being sound and wanting to keep creating and pushing forward with that\\", and Society is \\"that it's not just us but a community.\\" ==Music== Releases The band made three EPs in 2010 and 2011 with the titles of One, Sonic, Society, which was the precursor to their full length effort Forever Reign, and all of the four were released on the Essential Records label. The song that Stu G cited as favourite track is \\"Now and Forever\\", which is because he loved \\"the theme of grace and that God loves us as we are and that 'my sin has gone like it has not been'. That came from reading Meister Eckhart a German vicar from the 12th century.\\" The song Ingram would want to be remembered by is \\"Burn\\", which was a song written by Paul Mabury, and that is because \\"It goes 'Lord write me into Your great story, Lord write me into Your great song, take all I have its for Your glory, one day all else will be gone.\\" However, Both of them cite \\"Forever Reign\\" and \\"Greatness of Our God\\" as songs that they love. Following the release of Forever Reign, they produced Live at the Tracking Room, on 13 July 2012. Radio Their charted single \\"Forever Reign\\" has been put in rotation over the last year by many radio stations. On 7 January 2012, the song was No. 7 on K-LOVE top songs chart and was at the same number on 14 January. It was at No. 10 from 21 January through 18 February. It was not out of the Top 10 until the week of 25 February, when it fell to No. 13. Even by 18 March, the song was still at No. 14 on their chart, and by 1 April 2012 the song was back to No. 8 on the chart. On 29 April, the song fell again to No. 15 on their list, which even on 20 May the song was at that number. ==Discography== Album {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Album ! colspan=\\"3\\" Peak chart positions - style=\\"font- size:smaller;\\" ! width=\\"40\\" Top Christian ! width=\\"40\\" Top Heatseekers -  2012  align=\\"left\\" Forever Reign * Released: 17 January 2012 * Label: Essential * Format: CD, Digital download  —  — }  Live albums  {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Album ! colspan=\\"3\\" Peak chart positions - style=\\"font- size:smaller;\\" ! width=\\"40\\" Top Christian ! width=\\"40\\" Top Heatseekers -  2012  align=\\"left\\" Live at the Tracking Room * Released: 17 July 2012 * Label: Essential Worship Records * Format: CD, Digital download  —  — } EPs *One (2010) *Sonic (2010) *Society (2011) *Make a Way (2015) Singles {  - !rowspan=\\"2\\" Year !rowspan=\\"2\\" Title !colspan=\\"3\\" Chart peaks !rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - style=\\"font- size:smaller;\\" ! width=\\"45\\" US Christ ! width=\\"45\\" Christ Airplay ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US Christ AC -  2011  \\"Forever Reign\\"  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 17  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 25  Forever Reign -  2013  \\"Never Once\\"  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 28  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" —  non-album single -  2016  \\"Great Are You Lord\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 9  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 4  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 4  Great Are You Lord (EP) -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2018  \\"A Billion Stars\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" —  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 46  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" —  rowspan=\\"4\\" -  \\"Great Is Thy Faithfulness (Beginning to End)\\" (featuring Mike Weaver)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" —  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 40  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" — -  \\"Love Song\\" (featuring Elle Limebear)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" —  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 31  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" — -  2019  \\"Goodness of God\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" —  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" —  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" — } Compilation appearances * WOW Worship: Purple, 2010: \\"Forever Reign\\" (album version) * WOW Hits 2018, 2017: \\"Great Are You Lord\\" ==ReferencesLouder Than The Music Profile * allmusic Album Information Category:American Christian musical groups Category:Essential Records (Christian) artists Category:Musical groups established in 2009 ","title":"One Sonic Society"},{"id":"35931975","text":"Licht is a cycle of seven operas composed by Karlheinz Stockhausen between 1977 and 2003.

In addition to minor violations, the statute has been invoked to cover a number of serious criminal offenses defined by state law such as burglary and embezzlement. However, the Assimilative Crimes Act cannot be used to override other Federal policies as expressed by acts of Congress or by valid administrative orders. The prospective incorporation of state law was upheld in United States v. Sharpnack, 355 U.S. 286 (1957). State law is assimilated only when no \\"enactment of Congress\\" covers the conduct. The application of this rule is not always easy. In Williams v. United States, 327 U.S. 711, 717 (1946), prosecution of a sex offense under a state statute with a higher age of consent was held impermissible, but a conviction for a shooting with intent to kill as defined by state law was upheld, despite the similarity of provisions of .Fields v. United States, 438 F.2d 205 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 907 (1971); but see Hockenberry v. United States, 422 F.2d 171 (9th Cir. 1970). See also United States v. Bowers, 660 F.2d 527 (5th Cir. 1981) (child abuse); United States v. Smith, 574 F.2d 988 (9th Cir. 1978)(sodomy). There seems to be a definite trend to construe 18 U.S.C. § 13 liberally to provide complete coverage of criminal conduct within a federal enclave, even where the offense is generally covered by Federal law.See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 967 F.2d 1431 (10th Cir. 1992)(aggravated assault); United States v. Griffith, 864 F.2d 421 (6th Cir. 1988)(reckless assault); United States v. Kaufman, 862 F.2d 236 (9th Cir. 1988)(assault); Fesler v. United States, 781 F.2d 384 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1118 (1986)(child abuse). ==Relation to military law== The Uniform Code of Military Justice (U.C.M.J.), 10 U.S.C. § 801 et seq., because of its unlimited applicability, is not considered an \\"enactment of Congress\\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 13.See United States v. Walker, 552 F.2d 566 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 848 (1977) (drunk driving). See also Franklin v. United States, 216 U.S. 559 (1910). Military personnel committing acts on an enclave subject to Federal jurisdiction which are not made an offense by Federal statutes other than the U.C.M.J. may therefore be prosecuted in district court for violations of state law assimilated by 18 U.S.C. § 13, even though they are also subject to court martial. Dual prosecution is constitutionally precluded by the Double Jeopardy Clause.See Grafton v. United States, 206 U.S. 333 (1907). ==Relation to administrative law== 18 U.S.C. § 13 does not assimilate penal provisions of state regulatory schemes.See United States v. Marcyes, 557 F.2d 1361 (9th Cir. 1977). Nor does it incorporate state administrative penalties, such as suspension of driver's licenses.See United States v. Rowe, 599 F.2d 1319 (4th Cir. 1979); United States v. Best, 573 F.2d 1095 (9th Cir. 1978). Section 13(b) allows suspension of licenses within the enclave. Federal agency regulations, violations of which are made criminal by statute, have been held to preclude assimilation of state law.See United States v. Adams, 502 F. Supp. 21 (S.D.Fla. 1980)(carrying concealed weapon in federal courthouse); United States v. Woods, 450 F. Supp. 1335 (D.Md. 1978)(drunken driving on parkway). In United States v. Adams, 502 F. Supp. 21, the defendant was charged with carrying a concealed weapon in a United States Courthouse in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 13 and the pertinent Florida felony firearms statute. In dismissing the indictment, the Adams court concluded that a General Services Administration (GSA) petty offense weapons regulation, which had explicitly provided for by statute, amounted to an enactment of Congress within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 13 and, therefore, the defendant could not be prosecuted by the assimilation of state law which prohibited the same precise act. It is important to note, however, that a critical provision of the GSA regulations apparently was not considered in Adams. The regulation at the time of the case provides in part: \\"Nothing in these rules and regulations shall be construed to abrogate any other Federal laws or regulations or any State and local laws and regulations applicable to any area in which the property is situated.\\" This non-abrogation provision arguably would permit the assimilation of appropriate state firearms laws or other state statutes notwithstanding the existence of the GSA regulations. It appears that this language has never been considered in any reported case. Moreover, no discussion of the meaning of this language appears in the pertinent parts of the Federal Register.43 Fed.Reg. 29001, July 5, 1978; 41 Fed.Reg. 13378, March 30, 1976. The United States Department of Justice believe it would be reasonable to interpret this non-abrogation provision as permitting the government, in its discretion, to proceed under 18 U.S.C. § 13 and appropriate state firearms laws, rather than under the GSA weapons regulation. ==References * Assimilative Crimes Act from the Criminal Resource Manual of the United States Attorneys' Office Category:United States federal criminal legislation Category:United States federal public land legislation ","title":"Assimilative Crimes Act"},{"id":"35932073","text":"Bruno Bianchi (born 8 February 1939) is an Italian former sprinter, mainly specialized in 400 metres, who won two medals with the national relay team at the International athletics competitions. ==Biography== Bruno Bianchi participated at one edition of the Summer Olympics (1964), he has 26 caps in national team from 1961 to 1971. ==Achievements== {  width=60% style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - !Year !!Competition !!Venue !!Position !!Event !!Performance !!Notes - 1964 align=leftOlympic Games align=left Tokyo 7th 4 × 400 m relay 3:04.6  } ==National titles== Bruno Bianchi has won 3 times the individual national championship. *1 win in 400 metres (1964) *2 wins in 400 metres indoor (1970, 1971) ==See also== *Italy national relay team ==ReferencesCategory:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Genoa Category:Italian male sprinters Category:Olympic athletes of Italy Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Universiade gold medalists for Italy Category:Athletics competitors of Fiamme Oro Category:Italian Athletics Championships winners Category:Medalists at the 1965 Summer Universiade ","title":"Bruno Bianchi (athlete)"},{"id":"35932074","text":"Katharina of Hanau (26 March 1525 - 20 August 1581) was the eldest daughter of Philipp II, Count of Hanau-Münzenberg and Countess Juliana of Stolberg. == Marriage and issue == Katharina married in 1543 to Count Johann IV of Wied- Runkel and Isenburg (d. 15 June 1581).Dispensation was granted on 14 September 1543: Hesse State Archive at Marburg, file I.O.a.

It is one of only seven remaining round churches in Denmark and the only one of its kind on the island of Zealand. ==History== The present church was built in circa 1170 by Sune Ebbesen, from the influential Hvide clan who belonged to the circle around King Valdemar II. His father, Ebbe Skjalmsen, the uncle of Bishop Absalon, had previously built a wooden church at the site. The tower of Sune Ebbesen's round church contains a room which the Hvide family used as an assemblage hall. ==Architecture== The lower part of the church stands in granite while the upper part is made of brick, a relatively new material at the time which had only been used in Denmark since the 1140s. The inspiration for the design most likely came from the former St. George's Church (Sct. Georgs kirke) of Schlamersdorf in Wagria which Sune Ebbesen had visited several times as a military commander. Bjernede Church, Horne Church on Funen and Thorsager Church in Jutland are all built to the same floor plan as that of the Schlamersdorf Church. Four interior granite columns support the roof structure. The porch was built in about 1500 and the tower had previously been altered but was, between 1890 and 1892, changed by architect Hermann Baagøe Storck (1839–1922) to what he believed was its original design. ==Influence== Storck was later heavily criticized for his restoration work. Architects Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint and Ivar Bentsen later made church projects which resembled Bjernede prior to Storck's intervention, when it had a Bishop's Hat-like roof. Storck's restoration came to mark a turning point in Danish restoration architecture which from then on applied a more sensitive approach to the restoration of historical buildings. ==See also== *Nordic round churches ==ReferencesOther Sources== * K.

It was first described by the Czech mineralogist, metallurgist, and malacologist Ignaz von Born in 1778. == Description == The appearance and form of the hooded oyster is very variable. The shape is sometimes nearly circular or it may be oblong or roughly oval, often with an irregular outline. In the Mediterranean, it grows to , but achieves double that size in the Pacific Ocean. The valves are thick and solid. The lower valve is convex and has no sculpturing near the umbo, which is fixed to the substrate. The upper valve is flat and smaller than the lower valve. It may have wide, sometimes spiny, ribs but is sometimes quite smooth. The margins of the valves are pleated and fit together neatly. The ligament is internal and no teeth occur on the hinge joint. The right valve has some small denticles on its margin which fit into grooves in the left valve margin. A single large adductor muscle holds the valves together, which leaves a large, kidney-shaped scar on the inside of each valve. The colour is purplish-brown on the outside of the valves. The inside is white rimmed with black. This oyster could be confused with the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), but is distinguished by having a crenulated margin. == Distribution and habitat == The hooded oyster is found in the Indian Ocean and tropical west Pacific Ocean. In East Africa, its range includes Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, and the Seychelles. In India, it is one of a number of commercially exploited oyster species. It is also found in Australia, New Zealand, and the Red Sea. It was first seen in Turkey in 1999 and seems to have become established in the eastern end of the Mediterranean. It favours rocky habitats in the intertidal zone, and is found at depths down to about , often growing among seaweed. It is part of the fouling community and is found on harbour walls, pilings, and other underwater structures. == Biology == The hooded oyster is a filter feeder, pumping water through its gills and removing the phytoplankton. In polluted waters, it accumulates heavy metals in its tissues. For this reason it can be used as a bioindicator for monitoring pollution. Because it selectively removes these metals and is such an efficient biofilter, it has been used in the Persian Gulf to control pollution. The hooded oyster is tolerant of a wide range of temperatures and salinities. Breeding takes place between June and October in the Northern Hemisphere. The larvae are planktonic and preferentially settle out of the water column in locations already occupied by adult oysters. == Ecology == The hooded oyster is common on the east coast of Africa, where it cements itself to rocks or to the branches and roots of mangroves. It sometimes even grows on the shell of a large gastropod mollusc, the mangrove whelk (Terebralia palustris), which grazes beneath the mangrove canopy. In Australia, another gastropod, the black oyster borer or mulberry whelk (Tenguella marginalba, previously Morula marginalba) feeds on the oyster by drilling a hole through its shell. It then inserts its radula and chews up the body before sucking out the pieces. == References  External Links == * Plate LI shows fossil specimens of S. saccellus (later synonymized with S. cuccullata) compared to a shell of Ostrea edulis.

It is located in the Haute-Saône département. Since 2012, the climb to the summit has been used several times during the Tour de France cycle race. ==Etymology and legend== Statue commemorating legend The name Belles Filles literally means \\"Beautiful Girls\\", but is actually derived from the local plant life. The mountain is attested from the 16th century as lieu peuplé de belles fahys, a \\"place inhabited with nice beech trees\\" in the local dialect. Belles fahys later became corrupted into Belles Filles, though there remains a nearby village of Belfahy. Meanwhile, Planche, \\"board\\", is derived from the nearby small town of Plancher-les-Mines. A folk etymology, in contrast, holds that the mountain took its name from the time of the Thirty Years' War. According to legend, young women from Plancher-les-Mines fled into the mountains to escape Swedish mercenaries as they feared being raped and massacred. Rather than surrender, they decided to commit suicide and jumped into a lake far below. One of the soldiers then took a board on which, with his dagger, he engraved an epitaph for the \\"beautiful girls\\". A wooden statue, created by a local artist, is a reminder of the legend. ==Cycle racing== From Plancher-les-Mines the climb to the finish at is long, gaining and averages 8.5% with a maximum of 14%, but with a short stretch from 22% to 28% near the finish. Tour de France La Planche des Belles Filles was first used as a finish in Stage 7 in the 2012 Tour de France, from Tomblaine on 7 July. The stage was won by Chris Froome with his team-mate Bradley Wiggins taking the race lead. The steep finish proved popular, and it quickly became a popular climb among cycling fans. The climb has since been used frequently; in 2014 it was the finish of Stage 10 and won by then race leader Vincenzo Nibali; in 2017 it was the finish of Stage 5 of the Tour, with Fabio Aru winning by 16 seconds from Dan Martin, and Chris Froome taking the yellow jersey. It featured again in 2019, won by Dylan Teuns. It became the stage finish in a mountain time-trial in stage 20 of the 2020 Tour de France, which was won by Tadej Pogačar, who also took the yellow jersey and the polka-dot jersey. {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !Year !Stage !Start of stage !Distance (km) !Category !Stage winner !Yellow jersey -  2020  20 Lure 36.2 (ITT) 1 align=left align=left -  2019  6  Mulhouse  160.5 1 align=left align=left -  2017  5  Vittel  160.5 1 align=left align=left -  2014  10  Mulhouse  161.5 1 align=left align=left -  2012  7  Tomblaine  199  1 align=left align=left - } == References  *Official website * Cycling profile, map, photos of climb * Profile of climb Category:Ski stations in France Category:Skiing in the Vosges Category:Tourist attractions in Haute-Saône Category:Tourist attractions in the Territoire de Belfort Category:Sports venues in Haute-Saône Category:Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region articles needing translation from French Wikipedia ","title":"La Planche des Belles Filles"},{"id":"35932325","text":"Associação Cultural e Recreativa Alvorense 1º Dezembro (abbreviated as ACR Alvorense 1 Dezembro or ACRA 1 Dezembro) is a Portuguese football club based in Alvor, Portimão in the Algarve. ==Background== ACR Alvorense 1 Dezembro currently plays in the AF Algarve – 1ª Divisão which is the fifth tier of Portuguese football.

It was designed and built in France in the 1970s; only one was made. ==Design and development== André Starck had built the Starck AS-20, a biplane with heavy stagger and small gap, in 1942, guided by the pre-World War II studies of Miroslav Nenadovitch. Conventional biplanes have interplane gaps significantly greater than their wing chord to minimise the usually deleterious inter-wing interactions; Nenadovitch sought to take advantage of the interaction to produce a wing pair that acted rather like a single, monoplane wing with slotted flaps. The AS-27 followed the same plan but introduced wing tip end-plates or \\"curtains\\" bearing the ailerons, used again in the later AS-37. The AS-27 was an all-wood aircraft with Finnish ply covering. The upper wings were attached to the fuselage at shoulder wing position and the lower ones to the lower fuselage, leaving a gap of about 400 mm (16 in). The stagger placed the trailing edge of the upper wing above the lower wing's leading edge. The upper plane had a longer span and wider chord than the lower one. There were no traditional interplane struts; instead, the wing tips were joined by \\"curtains\\", approximately parallelogram-shaped airfoil structures the width of the lower wing. Because of the span difference, these leaned outwards at 45°, allowing them to carry ailerons on their trailing edges. In addition, it was claimed, these provided the lateral stability more usually secured with dihedral as well as producing additional lift. The fuselage and empennage of the AS-27 were conventional, with its cockpit over the lower wing. Its fixed conventional undercarriage had arched leaf spring cantilever main legs with cable bracing, together with a steerable tailwheel. It had a 78 kW (105 hp) Potez 4E flat four engine in its long nose, closely cowled with prominent bulges enclosing the cylinder heads. There were two fuel tanks, one ahead and one aft of the cockpit. The AS-27 was built by Claude Chevassut and his son. It made its first flight in the summer of 1975, piloted by Robert Buisson at Chavenay. ==SpecificationsReferences== Category:1970s French sport aircraft Category:Biplanes Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1975 ","title":"Starck AS-27 Starcky"},{"id":"35932354","text":"Esco di rado e parlo ancora meno () is the 40th studio album by famous Italian singer and actor Adriano Celentano, issued November 10, 2000 by label MSI Music Distribution. == Track listing  Charts == {  - !

He appeared in nearly 100 films between 1915 and 1949. == Life and career == After his graduation from Realschule Rameau got an actor. His first role was Marcellus in Julius Caesar in Bydgoszcz. In 1906 he went to the Schiller Theater in Berlin, where Rameau worked with Leopold Jessner. From 1923 until 1931 he was the vicarious intendant at the Schiller theater.http://www.munzinger.de/search/portrait/Emil+Rameau/0/4321.html He directed some plays at the Volksbühne. Emil Rameau worked also with Max Reinhardt at the Deutsches Theater. Rameau made his film debut in 1915 and appeared regularly in German silent films, mostly in character roles. After the Nazis seized power in 1933, Rameau escaped through Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, and Great Britain to the United States. During the Second World War, he had small appearances in over 20 Hollywood movies. In the 1944 mystery-thriller Gaslight, Rameau played Maestro Guardi, Ingrid Bergman's Italian singing teacher, which was perhaps his most recognizable role in Hollywood. He made his last film appearance in Hollywood in 1949 and returned to Germany, where he worked as a stage actor. In 1951, he was named the deputy artistic director of the Schiller theatre.Kay Weniger: 'Es wird im Leben dir mehr genommen als gegeben …'.

Westman was educated at Herlufsholm School and first trained as a silversmith at A. Dragsted, a goldsmiths concern, before studying sculpture at the Danish Academy (1938–42) under Einar Utzon-Frank. He was however deeply influenced by his early travels to Sweden where he worked as a silversmith. In particular, he was struck by the wooden figures of Axel Petersson Döderhultarn and later by the work of Bror Hjorth. ==Career== Westman's early work from the end of the 1930s was strongly influenced by the folkloric Swedish style as can be seen in Fløjlespilleren (1937) and Sygebesøget (1939). Over the years, his Naturalistic approach evolved into a simpler, more stylised form, often in polychromatic ceramics. His simplified crafting can be seen in works representing children such as Børn ved vinduet (Children at the Window, 1947), and Gøgeungen and Børnehaven (1948).\\"Gunnar Westman\\", Dansk Biografisk Leksikon.

During World War II he held administrative posts at the Nazi concentration camps of Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora and was convicted of war crimes by the United States in 1947. ==Biography== Wilhelm Simon was born in the city of Wuppertal in the Ruhr district of Germany on April 23, 1900. Between 1919 and 1935 he was employed primarily as a clerk in the textile industry. Simon became a member of both the Nazi Party and the SS in August, 1932 and served as head of the accounting department for the Medical Association of the Rhineland from 1935 to 1939. Following the outbreak of World War II he was assigned to the district branch of the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture in Wuppertal.Ernst Klee: The Encyclopedia of persons to the Third Reich Who was that before and after 1945, Frankfurt am Main 2007, pp. 584th In January, 1941 Simon was placed on active duty by the SS. He was assigned to the SS-Totenkopfverbände and was posted to the Buchenwald concentration camp as a member of its SS guard battalion. Simon rose in the camp administration and was promoted to the position of Assistant Labor Allocation Manager for Buchenwald in the summer of 1942. In this capacity, Simon both organized and directly supervised the provision of camp inmates as slave-laborers for various industries vital to the German war economy.Sellier, Andre. A History of the Dora Camp. Chicago: Ivan R. Dee.2003 ==Mittelbau- Dora== In December, 1943 Simon was appointed Arbeitsdienstführer (Labor Service Leader) for the newly established Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. As camp Labor Leader he managed the large-scale assignment of the camp’s prisoners to various forced labor details in the vast and subterranean Mittelwerk armaments facility, where they performed much of the dangerous construction and assembly work required to produce Germany’s V-2 ballistic missiles. Among other things, Simon was responsible for the introduction of a bonus system used to reward productive prisoner laborers with special privileges and also accompanied the eminent German rocket-scientist Wernher von Braun on a trip to Buchenwald to select prisoners there for work at Dora.Der Mond über Peenemünde – Wernher von Braun und der Geist der Barbarei During his service as Labor Leader at Mittelbau-Dora Simon developed a reputation for extreme brutality among the inmates of the camp, who gave him the nickname \\"Simon Legree\\" after the character of the cruel slave-master in the book \\"Uncle Tom’s Cabin\\".Hunt, Linda. Secret Agenda. St. Martin's Press. New York. 1991. pg. 72 In one particular incident during the summer of 1944 Simon was reported to have assigned a group of severely malnourished Hungarian Jews, who had recently arrived on a transport from Auschwitz, the grueling task of building their own barracks. The order would result in numerous deaths from exhaustion among the already badly-ailing Jews. Afterward, Simon ordered the SS to bludgeon to death several children from the same transport before dispatching the survivors into the tunnels at Mittelwerk.Hunt, Linda. Secret Agenda. St. Martin's Press. New York. 1991. pg. 72 Mittelbau-Dora was evacuated shortly before the arrival of American troops in April, 1945. During the evacuation, Simon led a transport of 350 prisoners to the Ebensee concentration camp in Austria. Immediately following his arrival at Ebensee, Simon was drafted into a local Wehrmacht unit. He surrendered to American forces on May 8, 1945 but managed to escape from captivity the following day. Simon was later identified as an alleged war criminal and was arrested a second time by US occupation authorities. He stood trial as a defendant in the Dachau-Dora war crimes trial, staged by the Office of the US Military Government (OMGUS) in 1947.(pdf-datei)# The accused at the Dachau Trial Simon pleaded not guilty to all charges. He was, however, convicted of war crimes on December 30, 1947 and sentenced to life imprisonment and interned in Landsberg prison. Simon’s sentence was eventually commuted to time served by US High Commissioner for Germany John J. McCloy and he was released from US custody in 1954. Simon returned to his native Ruhr district where he worked as a salesman and died in obscurity in Bochum, West Germany on September 27, 1971.Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich: Wer war was vor und nach 1945., Frankfurt am Main 2007, S. 584 ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1971 deaths Category:SS non-commissioned officers Category:Nazis convicted of war crimes Category:Buchenwald concentration camp personnel Category:Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp personnel Category:People from Wuppertal Category:People from the Rhine Province Category:V-weapons people ","title":"Wilhelm Simon"},{"id":"35932542","text":"Muria may refer to: *Muria people of India **Muria language **Maria language (India) *Muria, Bihar, a village in India *Mount Muria, a dormant volcano in Indonesia ==See also== * Murias (disambiguation) Category:Language and nationality disambiguation pages ","title":"Muria"},{"id":"35932543","text":"Charaxes nichetes, the Manx charaxes or water charaxes, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

Messter quickly established itself as dominant force in German production, particularly during the boom years of the First World War when foreign films faced many restrictions in Germany. Messter played a prominent role in the development of the German feature film, moving away from the shorter running times which had been standard in the early years of cinema. Messter also produced its own newsreels. In 1909 Messter Film took part in the Paris Film Congress, a failed attempt by Europe's leading producers to create a film cartel similar to that formed by the MPPC in the United States. In 1917 the company became part of the large conglomerate Universum Film AG (UFA) which brought together many of the leading German companies in a single, powerful organisation. For several years after this Messter continued to produce films as an individual unit of the UFA umbrella. UFA took over Messter's associated distribution partner Hansa Film. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Bergfelder, Tim & Bock, Hans- Michael. The Concise Cinegraph: Encyclopedia of German.

It is found in Australia, Borneo, and New Zealand where the translucent white fungi grows from the ground to a height of 80 mm and a width of 50 mm. ==Taxonomy== It was initially described as Hygrophorus mavis by New Zealand mycologist Greta Stevenson in 1962 and later as Hygrocybe mavis by Egon Horak in 1971, before being placed in the genus Humidicutis by Australian Tony Young in 1997. The generic name derives from the Latin humidus \\"moist\\" and cutis \\"skin\\", referring to its moist cap. The original holotype specimen was collected on 18 June 1949 in New Zealand by T. Levin. It has been compared with collections made by E. J. H. Corner of a Mycena rimosacuta variety alba in Borneo and found to be the same species. It is closely related to Humidicutis lewelliniae and may merely be a white-coloured form of this species.Young, p. 47. ==Description== Humidicutis mavis is a small mushroom with an umbonate cap in diameter, initially conical and later flattening to almost flat. It is smooth and ivory- to pure white in colour with an ivory umbo. The cap is textured with radial fibres, along which it may split, with the gills dividing between the split. The hollow white stipe is high and 0.3–0.6 cm thick and may be swollen at the base. The white gills are adnexed or free, and thick or distant with even margins. The spore print is white and the hyaline spores are more or less oval, measuring around 6–9 x 4.5–6 μm. ==Distribution and habitat== Fruit bodies appear singly or in groups over autumn and winter (April to July) in moss or among leaf litter in wet sclerophyll forest or rainforest in temperate, subtropical or tropical climates. It has been uncommonly recorded from Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, but is common in Tasmania, and is also found in Borneo and New Zealand, where it has been recorded from Gisborne, Wellington, Nelson and Westland provinces. ==References== Cited text * Category:Hygrophoraceae Category:Fungi described in 1963 Category:Fungi of Asia Category:Fungi of Australia Category:Fungi of New Zealand ","title":"Humidicutis mavis"},{"id":"35932753","text":"McBrine is a surname.

He enlisted as a gunner with the fluyt Eensgezindheid of the Dutch East India Company and made a three-year voyage from Amsterdam to Batavia between 1784 and 1787. Back in Norway he settled in Kristiansand, probably in 1805, marrying Helene Hansdatter Netland in 1807 and fathering three daughters. ==War== Following the Battle of Copenhagen (1807) and the surrender of the Danish/Norwegian fleet to the British, only one operational ship of the line was left uncaptured, the HDMS Prinds Christian Frederik, in Kristiansand. When news of the battle reached Kristiansand, along with accounts of British ships raiding up the coast, there was great fear in the town and a defence commission was hastily assembled. Evert Andersen joined the reserves in Kristiansand as a non-commissioned officer on September 2, 1807 with the rank of lieutenant, on the defensive batteries. On 18 September HMS Spencer appeared with two other British ships to try and seize the Prinds Christian Frederik.Hauschild Fredriksen, Karl: Hærens Artilleri i Kristiansandsområdet 1556-1995, 2007 The Spencer mounted attacks for several weeks but was eventually driven off by the coastal batteries. Enlisted from month to month, he was discharged on December 4, but re-appointed March 7, 1808, as commander of a cannon dinghy. He took part in the Battle of Furuholm and was transferred to Arendal, before being given command of the schooner Activ. At the beginning of August, 1808, he was also given command of the cutter Tiap. In action off Skagen on August 8, Activ and Tiap attacked a Swedish cutter which was supported by the British frigate Daphne. The Actif had twelve gunports but only had eight long 3-pounders mounted. Chased by the Daphne for six hours, she threw two of her guns overboard before she striking her colours. After surrendering Evert Andersen was imprisoned for a month in Gothenburg before returning to Frederikshavn. He was immediately given command of the cutter Lykkelig. ==Death== In 1809, Evert Andersen commanded the patrol boat Gripen, the cannon dinghy Thygeson No. 3, and the sloops Lister and Lyngdahl in Kristiansand's coastal defense squadron. With the two sloops he attacked a British schooner on July 28, 1809. Andersen was manning the cannon himself when it exploded and tore his left leg off. He was taken to Mandal but died the following day. He was buried with military honors in Kristiansand on August 7, 1809. ==References== Category:1772 births Category:1809 deaths Category:People from Farsund Category:Royal Dano- Norwegian Navy personnel Category:Napoleonic Wars prisoners of war held by the United Kingdom Category:Norwegian prisoners of war in the Napoleonic Wars Category:Norwegian military personnel killed in the Napoleonic Wars ","title":"Evert Andersen"},{"id":"35932823","text":"McBurney may refer to: *McBurney (surname) *McBurney's point, medical sign *McBurney School, defunct high school in New York City ","title":"McBurney"},{"id":"35932825","text":"William Crichton or Creighton (c. 1535–1617) was a Scottish Jesuit, who became head of the Scots seminary in Flanders. ==Early life and background== He was the son of Patrick Crighton of Camnay, Perthshire; Robert Crichton, 8th Lord Crichton of Sanquhar was a relation. He matriculated in 1552 at the University of St Andrews, and in 1561 at the University of Leuven. ==The Goudanus mission== Crichton entered the Society of Jesus in 1561, at the same time as Edmund Hay, a cousin. He returned to Scotland to put his affairs in order. Nicholas de Gouda, the pope's legate, was engaged in a secret embassy to Scotland in 1561–62. Crichton and Hay conducted him around Scotland, and attended the interview he had with Robert Crichton, the bishop of Dunkeld. All the ports were watched and guarded. Crichton worked with John Hay, brother of Edmund, to see to his successful escape. Crichton accompanied him to Antwerp. Crichton spent much of the following two decades in Aquitaine, Lyon and Avignon. ==Second mission to Scotland (1582)== Crichton returned to Scotland at the beginning of February 1582, having stopped in Normandy in January for a briefing from Robert Persons. He was accompanied by Ralph Emerson. Crichton was received into the house of George Seton, 7th Lord Seton, the only Catholic member of the royal council. He also corresponded with Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, cousin and guardian of James VI of Scotland, who was still a minor. To obtain an interview with Lennox, he had to be introduced into the king's palace at night, and to hide for three days in a secret chamber. The Duke promised that he would have the young king instructed in the Catholic religion, or else moved abroad. Crichton made some concessions on his side, drew up articles of agreement, and the Duke signed them. In spring 1582 Crichton joined forces with William Holt, sent by Persons to England, and with this document travelled to Paris. In March he handed it over to Juan Bautista de Tassis, for Philip II of Spain. There Henry I, Duke of Guise, James Beaton, James Tyrie and others considered the Catholic cause as won. Crichton was sent to Rome and Persons to Spain, seeking a military guard for James VI and Lennox, and a Catholic bride for the king. The plan was well financed but slow moving, and became known. William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie and others acted to kidnap the young king in what became known as the Raid of Ruthven. ==Third mission (failed to land, 1584)== Crichton was sent to Scotland again in 1584, and with him James Gordon; but they were betrayed. Their vessel was seized at sea by the ships of William van Bloys, Admiral of Zeeland, operating for the Dutch rebels out of Vlissingen. Gordon was set at liberty, while Crichton and Patrick Addy, a secular priest, were detained. On Crichton's account, he was nearly condemned to die for the assassination (July 1584) of William the Silent. The independent Netherlands and England were moving towards an alliance, which became formal after the Treaty of Nonsuch of 1585. Queen Elizabeth, on learning that Crichton was a prisoner at Ostend, made a requested to the Dutch diplomats working towards the treaty to have him given up to her, and sent a ship to convey him to England. Crichton was committed to the Tower of London on 16 September 1584, and remained there till May 1587, undertaking not to return to Scotland. His eventual release came after a confession made by William Parry, who was executed for treason in 1584, and who said that when he consulted Crichton as to whether it was lawful to kill the Queen he received an answer in the negative. After an examination on the subject Crichton wrote a letter to Francis Walsingham, which was published by the Queen's order. The consultation with Parry on tyrannicide had taken place in Lyon, around 1583. Crichton later clarified the point: while the Pope could sanction tyrannicide, he had told Parry that killing the Queen in the hope of retrospective permission was not allowed. ==Fourth mission (1587–1589)== On being released Crichton arrived in Rome in July 1587. He was ordered to return to Scotland with William Chisholm; the letter from Claudio Acquaviva sending him made it clear his \\"holy obedience\\" was required, getting round the promise he had made in England. Crichton was therefore in Scotland at the time of the Spanish Armada. Spanish soldiers and sailors were driven ashore, and Crichton had visitors at his house in Canongate; and had to evade government searches. He remained in Scotland until late in 1589, leaving with Edmund Hay. ==Madrid mission (1590–1592)== Crichton was in Madrid, negotiating with the Spanish court, from November 1590 to February 1592. Philip II wished to take up the offer of Scottish Catholic noblemen to seize power, and send a representative. Acquaviva decided that Crichton should on no account go, and thought in terms of Robert Bruce, who had recently been chased out, and was now in Flanders. Then Philip, who had been briefed by Crichton, decided David Graham, Laird of Fintry should be invited to come to Spain, and form the link with the Catholic earls. The timing, however, was very bad, and the Spanish king was preoccupied with France; the negotiations were put on hold. Crichton finally left Madrid for Rome about August 1592. ==After the \\"Spanish blanks\\"== The Spanish blanks plot was discovered late in 1592. Crichton was implicated by George Kerr, the intercepted courier, under torture. He was alleged to be the designated leader of a Spanish invasion of Scotland. Crichton had considered the situation promising: writing to Thomas Owens in 1605, he said that James had offered liberty of conscience to Catholics, and the appointment of a Scottish cardinal, in correspondence Crichton had shared with Persons.James Frederick Skinner Gordon, Catholic Church in Scotland (1869), p. 538. David Graham, Laird of Fintry was executed on 15 February 1593. James Gordon carried on the Jesuit intrigue, with a mission from James VI to Rome, and returned to Scotland with the pope's legate, George Sampiretti. James later decided that the laws against Catholics should be enforced. ==Scottish College== Withdrawing from diplomacy, Crichton concentrated on the Scottish seminary in Flanders. Set up in 1581 at Douai, the Scots College was the leading Scottish Catholic educational establishment in the period to 1648. Crichton was its head from 1593, and moved it to Leuven in 1595. Crichton still entertained hopes of converting James VI. He therefore advocated a waiting policy, and supported James's claim to be the legitimate heir to the English throne. This policy was opposed within the Jesuit ranks by William Holt, and by Robert Persons who supported the claim of Isabella Clara Eugenia, the Infanta of Spain. Crichton became involved in negotiations with John Cecil, who claimed to be working as an agent for James. In fact Cecil then represented Catholic aristocratic opposition to James in Scotland. Crichton and Cecil fell out, and Cecil raised Spanish suspicions of Crichton, who was imprisoned for a time. ==Death== Crichton was living in Paris in 1615, and died in 1617. ==Works== Crichton wrote: * A letter to Sir Francis Walsingham concerning Parry's application to him, with this case of conscience, Whether it were lawful to kill the queen, dated 20 February 1584–5.

The painting received little critical comment at the time, but was rediscovered as part of the political controversy surrounding fellow South African Brett Murray's painting (The Spear) in May 2012. Mabulu criticised Zuma and the African National Congress for their response to Murray's satirical painting – and that of the Nazareth Baptist (Shembe) Church, who called for Murray to be \\"stoned to death\\". He questioned their motives in attacking it, having ignored Mabulu's own work – which depicts Zuma alongside Desmond Tutu, Robert Mugabe, Barack Obama and Nelson Mandela in similar fashion. The debate provoked a response from the Worldart Gallery, where Mabulu's other paintings have been exhibited. Ngcono_ihlwempu_kunesibhanxo_sesityebi_(painting).jpgNgcono ihlwempu kunesibhanxo sesityebi, 2010 ==Further controversies== Zuma-Gupta In 2016, Ayanda released a new painting of President Zuma performing a sexual act on Atul Gupta, the wealthy Indian-South African business man who has been accused of influence over the president. The painting was accused of being extreme and condemned by many. South African newspapers and media reported widely on it and there was mixed reactions from across the country. Zuma- Mandela In April 2017, Ayanda once again released yet another artwork, this time depicting President Zuma engaged in sex with Nelson Mandela. In the image which almost went viral, the respected Mandela is sitting on Zuma with being 'fucked' while caressing his nipples with a smile on Zuma's face. Ayanda described the image as portraying what Zuma has done to Mandela's legacy. This divided opinions but more so because many South Africans who took offense were mainly angered at the debasing of the personality of the widely beloved Mandela. This time it was not only condemnation that came but also death threats which Mr Mabulu shrugged off. Both the African National Congress (the party of the President and of Mandela) and The Nelson Mandela Foundation reacted to the painting by releasing statements. However, in a remarkable approach, both's statement combined their condemnation with upholding the need for freedom of expression. The Nelson Mandela Foundation said: ″The Foundation would like to express that it respects Mr Mabulu’s right to freedom of expression. We however find this painting distasteful.″'' The African National Congress used a stronger language depicting the image as ″crossing the bounds of rationality to degradation, exploiting the craft of creative art for nefarious ends.\\" Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma In October 2017 the African National Congress Women's League described Mabulu as \\"mentally colonised artist\\" for a painting depicting then presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in a sexual position while Zuma looks.

The week-long festivities are marked by carnivals, street performances, sporting competitions, cycling races, musical concerts, parades, tent parties, much flag-waving and many displays of patriotism. During this special week, Eri- TV's schedule is sprinkled with documentaries from the armed struggle for independence to remind the population of the heavy sacrifice paid to liberate the country and defend it. Eritrea's Independence Day is also celebrated by the diaspora communities who live outside the country. The diaspora communities tend to celebrate it on weekends to attract a larger crowd. There are many concerts, picnics, barbecues, and outdoor festivities at various parks across the globe stretching from Australia to California and all around the world. Concerts, carnivals and street performances are always the big draw during Independence Week. Last year for Eritrea's landmark Silver Jubilee Anniversary bands and orchestras from such diverse nations as Germany, Turkey, Uganda, South Africa, Bolivia, China, Japan, Chile, Sudan, United States and Australia performed in Asmara.

This was triggered by the resignation of Liberal MP Sir Paul Hasluck to become Governor-General. It was the first federal by- election to be held in Western Australia since the 1945 Fremantle by-election, and only the seventh since Federation. The by-election was won by Liberal candidate Victor Garland. ==Key dates== {  - ! Date !

The preselection, which took place on 20 March and was ratified on 24 March by the party's State Council, had approximately 15 contestants, among whom Garland and party president (later Senator) Peter Durack were regarded as the main contenders. Others included lawyer John Huelin, a Methodist minister, a naval commodore and the Moore divisional president. The Labor Party's candidate was Hayden Jones, a 29-year-old schoolteacher at Swanbourne Senior High School. Captain Robert Scoggins (37) ran as an independent, backed by the Association for the Abolition of the Means Test, who had campaigned on social welfare issues. The Democratic Labor Party (DLP) decided not to run in Curtin. The DLP's secretary, John Martyr, asked its supporters in the final week to vote for Scoggins. ==Campaign== As a safe Liberal seat, Labor did not expect to win, but Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam predicted a large swing against the government. In a campaign stop on 1 April, Whitlam said Labor would campaign on the cost of land in Perth and the relatively minor level of interest by Australian companies in mineral resources as opposed to overseas interests. On 17 April, Jones accused Garland of illegal campaigning and spending more than the $500 legal limit on expenses. He also expressed annoyance at Scoggins for what he described as milking protest votes that would otherwise have gone to Labor. Scoggins countered that he hoped to attract votes from both parties as neither of them were dealing adequately with social justice issues. ==Results== Garland won the election with a majority of primary votes, but with a significantly reduced majority. Scoggins attained almost double the DLP vote from 1966. Opposition leader Gough Whitlam commented: \\"Curtin has been among the half dozen most undeviatingly conservative electorates in Australia. Reports from scrutineers indicate that at least half, and in some subdivisions well over half, of Mr Scoggins's preferences would come to Labor. This confirms the extent and reality of the swing\\". Prime Minister John Gorton said: \\"In this particular poll, neither ourselves nor the Labor Party can draw much comfort from the figures.\\" He noted the tradition of by-elections going against the government, the large number of people (19.2% compared to 5.4% at the 1966 election) who failed to vote at all, and the loss of Sir Paul Hasluck's personal vote. Of Scoggins, Gorton said: \\"An interesting aspect was the relatively large vote polled by Mr Scoggins, who had campaigned on a non-party basis with social service questions as his exclusive issue.\\" In declaring victory, Garland said he believed the result was satisfactory and that the anti-government swing had been anticipated, expecting that the vote would return at the general election. Jones said the swing foreshadowed a Labor victory at the 1969 election, and that his scrutineers reported two-thirds of Scoggins' preferences in the Leederville subdivision were going to Labor, while in the Dalkeith subdivision they were splitting 50-50. (There is no way to verify this claim, as under the Electoral Act at the time, preferences were not formally reported if the leading candidate won over 50% of the primary vote—the below calculation by Adam Carr and Malcolm MacKerras assumes a 50-50 split electorate-wide.)In 1983, what is now Section 277 was added to the Act, allowing for scrutiny of ballots for information purposes after a candidate had been declared elected. Refer section 107, A spokesman for the Association for the Abolition of the Means Test was pleased with the result, predicting the election result would be reflected in the 1969 budget, and the association intended to enter three candidates to oppose Liberal MPs (Freeth, Chaney and Cleaver) at the 1969 election if the fight was still necessary. ==References== Category:1969 elections in Australia Category:Western Australian federal by- elections Category:1960s in Western Australia Category:April 1969 events in Oceania ","title":"1969 Curtin by-election"},{"id":"35932976","text":"McCagg is a surname.

It was heard in the Constitutional Court, by Chaskalson P, Langa DP, Goldstone J, Madala J, Mokgoro J, Ngcobo J, O'Regan J, Sachs J, Yacoob J and Cameron AJ, on 4 May 2000, with judgment handed down on 18 August. FG Richings SC (with him AM Achtzehn) appeared for the appellant, and MNS Sithole SC (with him BJ Pienaar) for the respondent. == Facts == The central question to be answered in the present appeal, from a decision in a Local Division, was whether, when Parliament enacted the South African Schools ActAct 84 of 1996. (wherein it prohibited corporal punishment in schools), it had violated the rights of parents of children at independent schools who, in line with their religious convictions, had consented to its use. The appellant averred that corporal correction was an integral part of the active Christian ethos which it sought to provide its learners and that the blanket prohibition of its use in its schools invaded individual and parental and community rights to practise religion freely. Having been unsuccessful in the court a quo, the appellant was granted leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court on the grounds that the blanket prohibition contained in section 10 of the Act infringed the provisions in the Constitution relating to * privacy;s 14. * freedom of religion, belief and opinion;15. * education;s 29. * language and culture;s 30. and * cultural, religious and linguistic communities.s 31. The respondent contended that it was the infliction of corporal punishment, not its prohibition, which infringed constitutional rights. He argued that the appellant's claim to be entitled to special exemption was inconsistent with the constitutional provisions relating to * equality;s 9. * human dignity;s 10. * freedom and security of the person;s 12. and * children.s 28. The respondent contended further that section 31(1) rights could not, in terms of the provisions of section 31(2), be exercised in a manner inconsistent with any provision of the Bill of Rights, and that the trend in democratic countries was to ban corporal punishment in schools, and finally that South Africa's obligations as signatory to various conventions required the abolition of corporal punishment in schools, since it involved subjecting children to violence and degrading punishment. Inasmuch as the outlawing of corporal punishment limited other rights, such limitation was reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom. While the sincerity of the beliefs of the parents could not be doubted, nor their right to practise their religion in association with each other be disputed, and while the right of parents to administer corporal punishment at home was not challenged, such conduct was not appropriate in schools, nor in the education system. In its argument that its rights of religious freedom, guaranteed by sections 15 and 31 of Constitution, had been infringed, the appellant argued that the rights in question should be viewed cumulatively. It argued further that the corporal correction applied in its schools with the authorisation of the parent was not inconsistent with any provision of the Bill of Rights. Accordingly, the qualification contained in section 31(2) did not apply. The appellant argued further that, once it succeeded in establishing that the Act substantially impacted upon its sincerely held religious beliefs, the failure of the Act to provide an appropriate exemption could only pass constitutional muster if it were justified by a compelling state interest. In response to this argument, the respondent contended that the governing provision was section 31, not section 15. The corporal punishment was delivered in the context of the community activity in a school; accordingly, it could only attract constitutional protection if, in terms of section 31(2), it was not inconsistent with any other provision of the Bill of Rights. Since corporal punishment violated the right to equality and the right to dignity, it forfeited any claim to constitutional regard. It was argued in the alternative that, if corporal punishment at the appellant's schools did not violate the Bill of Rights, its prohibition by the Act was reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society. == Judgment == The court noted that the matter concerned a multiplicity of intersecting constitutional values and interests, some overlapping and some competing. The overlap and tension between the different clusters of rights reflected themselves in contradictory assessments of how the central constitutional value of dignity was implicated.Para 15. The interest protected by section 31 was not, the court found, a statistical one, dependent on a counterbalancing of numbers, but rather a qualitative one, based on respect for diversity. Section 31(2) ensured that the concept of rights of members of communities that associated on the basis of language, culture and religion could not be used to shield practices which offended the Bill of Rights.Paras 25, 26. For the purposes of making a determination in the matter, the court found it necessary to adopt the approach most favourable to the appellant and assume, without deciding, that the appellant's religious rights under sections 15 and 31(1) were both in issue. It was also necessary to assume, again without deciding, that corporal punishment as practised by the appellant's members was not inconsistent with any provision of the Bill of Rights as contemplated by section 31(2). In the light of these assumptions, section 10 of the Act limited the parents' religious rights both under section 31 and under section 15.Para 27. The court held further that, in relation to the question of whether the limitation on the rights of the appellants could be justified in terms of section 36 of the Constitution, the relevant test was that limitations on constitutional rights could only pass constitutional muster if it was concluded that, considering the nature and importance of the right and the extent to which it was limited, such limitation was justified in relation to the purpose, importance and effect of the provision which resulted in the limitation, taking into account the availability of less restrictive means to achieve the relevant purpose. Although there may be special problems attendant on undertaking the limitations analysis in respect of religious practices, the standard to be applied was the nuanced and contextual one required by section 36, not the rigid one of strict scrutiny.Para 31. What was in issue was not so much whether a general prohibition on corporal punishment in schools could be justified, but whether the impact of such a prohibition on the religious beliefs and practices of the members of the appellant could be justified under the limitations test of section 36. The proportionality exercise had to relate to whether the failure to accommodate the appellant's religious belief and practice by means of the exemption prayed for could be accepted as reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, freedom and equality.Para 32. While the relevant parents could no longer authorise teachers to apply corporal punishment in their name pursuant to their beliefs, they were not being deprived by the Act of their general right and capacity to bring up their children according to their Christian beliefs. The effect of the Act was limited merely to preventing them from empowering the schools to administer corporal punishment.Para 38. The respondent had established that the prohibition of corporal punishment was part and parcel of a national program to transform the education system and bring it into line with the letter and spirit of the Constitution. The creation of uniform norms and standards for all schools was crucial for educational development, as was a coherent and principled system of discipline. The state was also under a constitutional duty to take steps to help diminish the amount of public and private violence in society generally, and to protect all people, especially children, from maltreatment, abuse or degradation. Furthermore, in every matter concerning a child, the child's best interests were of paramount importance. This principle was not excluded in cases where the religious rights of the parent were involved.Paras 39-41. It was true that to single out a member of a religious community for disadvantageous treatment would, on the face of it, constitute unfair discrimination against that community. The contrary, however, did not hold. To grant respect to sincerely held religious views of a community, and make an exception from the general law to accommodate them, would not be unfair to anyone else who did not hold those views. The essence of equality lay not in treating everyone in the same way, but in treating everyone with equal concern and respect. Permission to allow the practice to continue would, in the circumstances, not be inconsistent with the equality provisions of the Bill of Rights.Para 42. The court held that the outlawing of physical punishment in the school represented more than a pragmatic attempt to deal with disciplinary problems in a new way. It had a principled and symbolic function manifestly intended to promote respect for the dignity and physical and emotional integrity of all children. The schools in question of necessity functioned in the public domain so as to prepare their learners for life in the broader society. It was not unreasonable to expect those schools to make suitable adaptations in respect of non-discriminatory laws affecting their codes of discipline.Paras 50, 51. The parents, furthermore, were not being obliged to make an absolute and strenuous choice between obeying a law of the land or following their conscience. They could do both simultaneously. What they were prevented from doing was authorising teachers, acting in their name and on school premises, to fulfil what they regarded as their conscientious and biblically-ordained responsibilities for the guidance of their children. Save for this one aspect, the appellant's schools were not prevented from maintaining their specific Christian ethos.Para 51. The court decided, accordingly, that, when all the factors were weighed together, the scales came down firmly in favour of upholding the generality of the law in the face of the appellant's claim for a constitutionally compelled exemption. The appeal was dismissedPara 52. and the decision in the South Eastern Cape Local Division, in Christian Education South Africa v Minister of Education1999 (4) SA 1092. confirmed. == Semble == There was no curator ad litem representing the interests of the children, as it had been accepted in the court a quo that it was unnecessary to appoint one and that the state would represent the interests of the child. However, the children concerned were from a highly conscientised community and many would have been in their late teens and capable of articulate expression. Although both the state and the parents were in a position to speak on their behalf, neither was able to speak in their name. A curator could have made sensitive enquiries so as to enable their voice or voices to be heard. This, the court suggested, would have enriched the dialogue and the factual and experiential foundations for the balancing exercise undertaken in the instant matter would have been more secure.Para 53. == See also == * Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa * Constitution of South Africa * Corporal punishment * Education in South Africa * Equality * Human rights * Freedom of religion * Law of South Africa == References ==  Case law  * * Christian Education South Africa v Minister of Education 1999 (4) SA 1092 (SE), South Eastern Cape Local Division  Legislation  * South African Schools Act 84 of 1996. == Notes == Category:Constitutional Court of South Africa cases Category:2000 in South African law Category:2000 in case law ","title":"Christian Education South Africa v Minister of Education"},{"id":"35933058","text":"Charaxes zelica, the zelica untailed charaxes, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

She was the sister of Silvana Armenulić and Dina Bajraktarević. Mirjana and Silvana died in a car crash. Her career reached its peak in 1974 with the songs \\"Doletjeće bijeli golub\\" and \\"Ne zovi me, ja ti neću doći\\". The year after her death, she had a posthumous hit single when \\"Rukama sam mahala za tobom\\" was released. ==Early life and family== Mirsada Bajraktarević was born in the Bosnian city of Doboj, the seventh of thirteen children, to a Muslim Bosniak family. Her father was Mehmed Bajraktarević (1909–1966), a local cake shop operator, and her mother was Hajrija (1916–2008). The family surname has its origins in the Ottoman Empire; bajrak is the Turkish word for flag. Mirsada's sister Zilha began singing at an early age, but their father, Mehmed, a local cake shop operator, was not supportive of her singing career. Mirsada had a brother named Hajrudin who died about two weeks after being mauled by a dog in the 1940s. After her brother's death, her father found solace in alcohol and solitude, neglecting the family and his business. After her father's cake shop closed, the family suffered greatly. The family of thirteen children included sisters Mirsada, Hajrudina (Dina), Zilha (Silvana), Abida, and Ševka, and brothers Hajrudin, Muhamed, Izudin, Abudin, and Ismet. Her nephew Sabahudin Bilalović became a professional basketball player who died at age 43 of a heart attack on the beach while swimming with his son. Ten years later, Ševka and her husband Lutvo both died of natural causes in September 2013, just days apart. ==Career== In 1955, Silvana moved to Sarajevo at the age of sixteen where she lived with their aunt and sang in local kafanas for money. She eventually landed a professional singing career which led way to Mirsada getting a record deal and recording her first album at the age of eighteen in 1969 and releasing it on 18 February 1970. In 1975, after five years of releasing extended plays and singles, Bajraktarević released her first full- length studio album, Imala sam drugaricu (I Had a Friend). The album contained a dozen songs, two of which were written by Bajraktarević herself. Four of the songs were written by Radoslav Graić, including the title song which became a hit. She also covered four Bosnian folk songs; \\"Kraj potoka bistre vode\\" (By a Stream of Crystal Clear Water), \\"Ah, moj Aljo, crne oči\\" (Oh, My Aljo, with Your Black Eyes), \\"Moj zumbule\\" (My Hyacinth), \\"Mujo kuje konja\\" (Mujo Shoes the Horse.) ==Personal life== According to an interview with one of Mirsada's friends, she was married for about a year to Yugoslav singer Zoran Milivojević (died 13 March 2011). ==Death and aftermath== On 10 October 1976, at around 9:15 pm CEST, Mirsada died in a car crash near the Serbian village of Kolari in Smederevo along with her sister Silvana Armenulić and violinist/Radio Belgrade folk orchestra conductor Miodrag \\"Rade\\" Jašarević. They were driving in a Ford Granada car from Aleksandrovac to Belgrade after a concert. Originally, Silvana was to drive with Mirsada sitting in the passenger's seat; then Montenegrin singer Ljubomir Đurović asked if he could drive to Belgrade with them. As he was putting his bags into the car, Rade Jašarević asked the sisters if he could drive with them to Belgrade because all the other singers who had performed in the concert that day were watching a soccer game of Spain versus Yugoslavia. Đurović had forgotten about the game; he asked the sisters if they wanted to stay to watch the game, then all drive back to Belgrade when the game ended. The sisters refused as they were both tired and Silvana had a severe headache after hitting her head in the restaurant the day before. Đurović decided to stay and drive back to Belgrade in Boki Milošević's Volvo after the game. Silvana was behind the wheel when they left, but sometime between their departure and the crash, 60-year-old Jašarević had taken the wheel. The car was reportedly travelling , when it collided with a FAP truck driven by 52-year-old Rastko Grujić. Bajraktarević had fallen asleep in the back seat and older sister was asleep in the passengers' side seat. The singer Lepa Lukić was asked to perform at the concert that day but overslept for the first time in her career and did not make it to the concert; she later stated that she believes, had she gone with them, she would have lost her life in the crash with the sisters. In 2013, Lepa revealed in an interview that she hasn't driven a car since the sisters' deaths, out of fear that she would share their fate. Between 30,000 and 50,000 people attended their funeral, including singers Lepa Lukić and Hašim Kučuk Hoki (who himself died in a near-identical car crash on 26 November 2002.) She and her sister were buried side by side in the cemetery Novo groblje. Initially, only the death of Jašarević was reported, as television shows refused to mention Silvana because of a 1972 incident during a live broadcast on New Year's Eve show, which got her banned from all television. The exact cause of the accident is unknown, but it is believed that the crash is directly related to a brake problem. The Ford Granada they were driving was recalled for \\"dangerous structural defects observed in the control mechanism\\". A notification was sent to all customers that the models manufactured between September 1975 and June 1976 were faulty. Owners were advised to return the cars. It is not known if Silvana and Mirsada were aware of the recall, and just opted to not return the car, or if she was completely unaware. At the time of her death, Mirsada was sharing an apartment with her sister Dina and was in the second trimester of her pregnancy. She was also engaged to be married to a boxer named Dragomir Vujković from Zenica. She met him in 1975 and they planned to marry at the end of November 1976 after she returned from a tour with her sister in Australia. Mirsada's mother Hajrija died in 2008, shortly before her 92nd birthday. Five years after their mothers' death, Mirsada's oldest sister Ševka died on 30 September 2013 in Trebinje at the age of 79, leaving Dina the last living of the female Bajraktarević children. ==Discography== The following are studio albums, singles and EPs released by Mirsada between 1970 and 1976, with two posthumous EPs released in 1977: {  - !

At 16, he moved to the United States, working at a hotel in Cerulean, Kentucky, but in 1896 he returned to Italy for the military service in Alessandria, becoming a member of a military band directed by Giovanni Moranzoni. Subsequently, he began his own career and toured in Italy, Germany, England and South Africa. He joined an orchestra in Cape Town at 25. In 1907, he returned to Naples to complete the studies, then he went to America again, becoming first flautist of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, directed by Gustav Mahler, and played with the New York Symphony Orchestra, in substitution of Georges Barrère. He was also flautist of the orchestras of Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Rochester. In 1914, during his collaboration with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, he met Maude Peterson, a pianist who frequently accompanied him and became his wife. In 1917, the Los Angeles Flute Club played a musical in his honor and De Lorenzo was appointed the first Honorary Member of the association. From 1923 to 1935 he was professor for flute at the Eastman School of Music, where one of his students was Julius Baker, considered one of the greatest American flutist of his generation. After his retirement, De Lorenzo focused on composition and writing of theoretical publications. Works such as Saltarello and Pizzica-pizzica are a homage to the characteristic sounds of the traditional music of his native town. In 1951 he released the book My complete story of the flute, a result of intensive research by De Lorenzo which made him one of the most eminent flute pedagogues of the 20th century. All of his research material was donated to the University of Southern California, on October 25, 1953. In the same year, he received an honorary doctorate of the Washington International Academy of Rome and was godfather for the newly formed flute club in Milan. On August 29, 1955 the Los Angeles Flute Club organized a concert playing his compositions for his 80th birthday. De Lorenzo died in his home in Santa Barbara, California.

Its title was a reference to late film actress Madhubala, who is considered to be one of the most iconic actresses, but was not based on her life. ==Plot== Madhubala \\"Madhu\\" Choudhary was born on a film set and destined to become a heroine but works in a parlour whereas her family works as junior artists in the Mumbai film industry. One fateful encounter brings her standing against Bollywood superstar Rishabh Kundra alias RK. She fights a case of hit and run on behalf of her friend Mukund against RK and sends him to jail. Mukund proposes Madhu and they get engaged. RK insinuates that Madhu is his girlfriend and humiliates her mother Padmini and guardian Shamsher Malik's relationship. He says they are having a secret affair for the last 20 years. Mukund breaks off his engagement thinking Madhu has an affair with RK. Madhu visits RK's set and slaps him who puts forward an offer of forty lakh rupees for her father Malik's treatment as he was badly beaten up on RK's set after he had shown up to kill RK after a public stunt. RK asks Madhu to marry him which she accepts. Rude and egotistical, RK becomes hell-bent on ruining Madhubala's life and tries to insult her in any way he can but is possessive of her. Eventually, things turn normal and Madhu falls in love with RK. RK's half-brother Sikandar Bhatia's wife Deepali, who is in fact RK's ex-girlfriend had married Sikandar as he was being launched in a big-budgeted film and RK was a struggling actor at that time. She wants Madhu to leave RK but in vain. Shamsher is determined to kill RK who had forcefully kept Madhu captive at his home. Unaware of the changed scenario, he shoots RK who is saved by Madhu as she donates blood to him. She witnesses a big change in her feelings for RK who too develops a soft corner for Madhu and is no longer rude to her. She brings a lot of changes in RK's life like she restores his faith in God and his relationship with his mother. Madhu teaches RK many other lessons of life and everyone is thankful to her for this. They confess their love. RK helps Padmini and Shamsher in getting married and even when Balraj abducts all but is shot to death by Padmini. RK asks Madhu to leave her family and come away with him to lead a peaceful life because he needs a break and wants to spend his time with her. Madhu blindly agrees and RK says he wants to marry her properly before leaving so that they can take their relationship forward. During the marriage, RK suddenly stops and tells he had never loved her; it was his plan to entangle her in his love and then destroy her life when he leaves her. Devastated, Madhu decides to part her ways. Everyone is furious at RK for deserting Madhu and tries to convince him to bring her back as he is nothing without her but he doesn't budge on his decision. Madhu gets a job as a hairstylist at RK's film set. He is once again rude to her and adamant to make her leave, trying to play hard but she has answers. RK regrets his decision to leave Madhu when he suspects her getting ahead with a mysterious man. He cannot stand the thought of Madhu with someone else and realizes his mistake; he decides to win her back and abducts her to forcefully make her live with him at his home. Earlier, Madhu not relents. Later, Madhu decides to play along and this time she would leave RK with help from Sultan, the mystery man who RK assumes to be Madhu's lover. She wants to teach RK a lesson and make him realize the pain of a broken heart. He is unable to accept his feelings for Madhu. Wanting her plan to succeed, Madhu leaves saying she won't come back unless he confesses his love. As per Madhu's expectations, RK confesses his love and proposes her in front of all. Madhu agrees and the preparation for the grand wedding begins. Just a few days before the wedding, Madhu realizes she cannot execute her plan because she loves RK and cannot leave him. Sultan wants Madhu to back off because he thinks that RK will kill Madhu when he learns her evil plan. Madhu changes her mind and breaks Sultan's heart as he loves her too. Although heartbroken after learning Madhu's plan, RK decides to leave all the bad memories behind, forgive Madhubala and then officially marry her. Sultan, who hates RK for taking away Madhu, seeks revenge. He discovers being RK's half-brother and uses this as a device to humiliate him in public. Sultan refers to RK as a bastard whose father Mohan had first married Meera who gave birth to Sultan. RK realizes Sultan is doing all this to win Madhu and accidentally kills him. He is sent to jail. Madhu finds out Sultan is alive and it was a plan to send RK to jail and take her away. Sultan realizes RK wouldn't so easily let Madhu go and now so on tortures her to get a divorce from RK and come to him in order to save him. Helpless, Madhu agrees. Enraged, RK refuses but later connects all dots and learns that it is Sultan who is behind all this drama and forcing Madhu to divorce him. RK eventually kills Sultan with the police's help and saves Madhu. Due to his inability to shoot for movies owing to personal problems and slapping producer Amar Bahl, RK is banned from Bollywood and decides to produce his own film. Veteran director Mehul Chopra agrees to help him and chooses Madhu as the heroine but RK refuses and is actually fascinated by the idea of her being his heroine. RK finds a heroine but is dissatisfied and vows not to pressurize Madhu to sign the film. On inauguration day, the heroine is rendered unable to attend the inaugural conference by Amar Bahl and RK's stepfather Kulbhushan Bhatia who hates him. Thinking that his career is over, RK is about to commit suicide when his assistant Bittu Sharma calls and informs him Madhu has stepped in as the heroine. Super excited, RK appears as the leading actor of his film in front of media with Madhu who marks her entry into Bollywood. He confesses in front of all that he loves Madhu and thanks to her for becoming his heroine. RK's aunt Paabo is told by a saint that Madhu is not right for him. Madhu is brainwashed by Paabo and made to perform some perilous religious tasks but later finds out it was all Paabo and Deepali's plot to oust her from RK's life. Madhu refuses to leave RK. During shooting, RK gets injured and suffers paralysis. Madhu decides to take over and complete the movie. RK develops insecurity towards her due to her rising fame and being ignored by everyone because he is handicapped. Madhu becomes pregnant but RK doesn't want a baby when he is going through a lot of trouble. This breaks Madhu's heart and she is unhappy with his wishes. The movie \\"Ishq Ek Junoon\\" becomes a superhit, bringing RK out of his financial and career problems. Due to stress, Madhu suffers a miscarriage and blames RK.

Later, everything gets all right and Madhu becomes a heroine like she was destined to be. Enters RK's doppelganger Keval Ram Kushwaha alias KRK, who is hired by Kulbhushan to avenge all the insults RK had thrown at him. Kulbhushan wants KRK to steal away all RK's money and render him bankrupt. KRK agrees to take RK's place in need of money. He is a nobleman and decides to leave RK's life when he realizes of separating him from Madhu. KRK returns back to his hometown with prize money from RK for speaking up the truth and showing decency. Kulbhushan is arrested and sent to jail. Madhu is revealed to be pregnant once again and gives birth to a girl whom RK also names Madhubala. He prophesies that she will become a superstar like her parents. 20 years later RK and Madhu are dead in the bomb blast. RK' mother escapes with RK and Madhu's infant 'Madhubala' and raises her without the shadow of cinema industry as it would become a threat for Junior Madhubala. Radha gets unwell and, Their grown-up daughter Madhubala looks like just Madhu and works for Abhay Kapoor who makes her fall in love with him. They announce their marriage, but Abhay gets Madhubala married to Raja, a mentally challenged and second look-alike of RK. Abhay reveals he wanted to avenge the death of his father Harshvardhan who committed suicide after being incriminated for killing RK and Madhu. Raja turns out to be KRK's son and finally becomes a normal person. Due to his lifestyle of a gangster, Madhubala hates, insults and accuses him by crossing her all limits. She raises the question on his manhood. Angry, dejected and drunk, Raja gets doped and instigated by his brother-in-law who tells him to punish Madhubala for unnecessarily raising questions. This leads to the raging Raja raping Madhubala who files a case against him and gets him jailed but withdraws it after some time. Raja's aunt Baiji dies. Being in jail and unable to donate blood to save her life, he thinks Madhubala is responsible for it and begins hating and torturing her. It is revealed Raja's brother-in-law plotted this to take over the family property. Madhubala gets pregnant with Raja's child and later requests him to forgive her which Raja does; they remarry and begin living separately from his family. Raja opens a garage to start earning a living. One night, a producer assumes him as RK and proposes to do a film with him that the producer had wanted to do with RK and Madhu. Madhubala reads Madhu's diary, learning that Madhu's last wish was to make a film on her and RK's life. Madhubala convinces Raja to sign the film; they start their career and appear as Madhu and RK, giving the first shot of their film. Raja states it is not the end but the beginning of a new life as they were always destined to live and be superstars together. ==Cast== Main * Drashti Dhami as ** Madhubala Rishabh Kundra aka Madhu / Biwi (née Malik/Chaudhary) – Padmini and Balraj's daughter, Shamsher Malik's adoptive daughter, Trishna's Yonger sister, RK's wife,Junior Madhubala's mother (2012–2014) ** Junior Madhubala Raja Kushwaha (née Kundra)– Madhubala and RK's daughter, Raja's wife (2014) *** Spandan Chaturvedi as Young Madhubala Kundra (2014) * Vivian Dsena as ** Rishabh Kundra aka RK – Radha and Mohan's son, Sultan and Sikandar's half- brother, Madhu's husband, Junior Madhubala's father (2012–2014) ** Keval Ram Kushwaha aka KRK – Jugnu's brother, Kulbhushan's accomplice, Raja's father (2013–2014) ** Raja Kushwaha /Raj Kumar aka Raju – KRK's son, Junior Madhubala's husband (2014) Recurring * Pallavi Purohit as Padmini Malik/Chaudhary– Balraj's ex-wife, Madhu and Trishna's mother, Shamsher's wife, Junior Madhubala's maternal grandmother * Aarti Puri as Trishna Malik/Chaudhary– Padmini and Balraj's daughter, Shamsher Malik's adoptive daughter, Madhu's elder sister, Junior Madhubala's sororal aunt * Rakhi Vijan as Roma Malik– Shamsher's sister, Madhu and Trishna's adoptive aunt * Bhupinder Singh as Shamsher Malik– Roma's brother, Padmini's second husband, Madhu and Trishna's adoptive father * Shama Deshpande as Radha Upadhyay– Mohan's widowed/second wife, Kulbhushan's wife, RK and Sikandar's mother, Junior Madhubala's paternal grandmother * Indresh Malik as Bittu Sharma– RK's personal secretary, Leela's husband, Junior Madhubala's uncle * Raza Murad as Kulbhushan Bhatia/ Kukku– Radha's second husband, Sikandar's father * Sikandar Kharbanda as Sikandar Bhatia– Radha and Kulbhushan's son, RK's half-brother, Deepali's husband * Seema Mishra as Deepali Singh– RK's ex-girlfriend, Sikandar's wife * Navneet Nishan/Seema Kapoor as Pabbo– RK's paternal aunt * Avinesh Rekhi as Sultan Kundra– Meera and Mohan's son, RK's half- brother,Aryan's father Madhu's obsessive lover * Siddharth Vasudev as Bhujang Shastri * Zarina Wahab as Meera Malik– Mohan's ex-wife, Sultan's mother * Kannan Arunachalam as Rashid Baig– Mohan's ex-driver * Raj Zutshi as Balraj Choudhary– Padmini's ex-husband, Madhu and Trishna's father, Junior Madhubala's maternal grandfather * Shagufta Ali as Badi Chaudhrain * Lalit Parimoo as Guruji * Sushmita Mukherjee as Dai Maa * Prashant Chawla as Sunny Sharma * Swati Anand as Leelavati Agashey/ Leela– Bittu's wife * Shweta Vyal/Tanvi Thakkar as Sweety Sharma * Vaishnavi Dhanraj as Riya * Manini Mishra as Ila Ramani – Journalist * Usha Nadkarni as Sonali Devi– Mukund and Swati's mother * Manish Naggdev as Mukund Dixit– Sonali's son; Swati's brother; Madhu's ex-fiancé * Ahsaas Channa as Swati Dixit– Sonali's daughter; Mukund's sister * Anita Hassanandani as Sanya * Vinay Apte as Shivdutt Marathe * Neelu Kohli as Harjeet Kapoor– Harshvardhan and Umesh's mother; Abhay and Ananya's grandmother * Arbaaz Ali Khan as Director Harshvardhan Kapoor– Harjeet's son; Umesh's brother; \\" Pam \\"'s husband; Abhay and Ananya's father * Deepshikha Nagpal as \\" Pam \\"– Harshvardhan's wife; Abhay's stepmother and Ananya's mother * Puneet Sachdev as Nikhil Lamba– Ananya's husband * Kishwer Merchant as Ananya Kapoor– Pam and Harshvardhan's daughter; Abhay's half- sister; Nikhil's wife * Gunjan Utreja as Abhay Kapoor– Harshvardhan's son; Pam's stepson ; Ananya's half-brother; Madhubala's ex-fiancé; Aisha's husband * Rajesh Balwani as Umesh Kapoor– Harjeet's son; Harshvardhan's brother; Dolly's husband; Abhay and Ananya's paternal uncle * Utkarsha Naik as Dolly Kaur Singh– Umesh's wife; Abhay and Ananya's paternal aunt * Fenil Umrigar as Aisha Kapoor– Abhay's cousin * Ravi Khanvilkar as Jugnesh Ram Kushwaha/ Jugnu– KRK's brother; Raja's paternal uncle; Baiji's husband; Agni's father * Shraddha Jaiswal as Agni Kushwaha– Baiji and Jugnu's daughter; Raja's paternal cousin * Shalini Arora/Jaya Bhattacharya as Baiji Devi– Jugnu's wife; Raja's paternal aunt; Agni's mother * Shital Thakkar as Tara * Jaswant Menaria as Bhanu Pratap Singh * Pooja Sahu as Faguni Kushwaha * Neha Pendse as Ria * Rajshri Rani as Deepika * Sara Khan * Toral Rasputra as Anandi * Sanaya Irani as Parvati * Dipika Kakar as Simar * Radhika Madan as Ishani (to promote Meri Aashiqui Tum Se Hi ==Broadcast== The show, even before it was aired, was surrounded by a controversy because of the title Madhubala claiming that the show is based on the life of Indian film actress Madhubala.

Expanse of wings, male, 2 in. 11 lin. ; female, 3 in. 6 lin. Accra (Carter). Type, B. M. Hewitson's colouring of the outer border of the secondaries above does not perfectly agree with that of our specimen, being represented as salmon-tinted, whereas ours is greenish-grey, but curiously enough this very discrepancy in coloration occurs in two males of C. Etheocles in the Museum collection. The female C. Carteri is, unfortunately, slightly damaged, but this is explained by Mr. Carter ; he says :—\\" I fear none of them are very perfect ; I am obliged to get natives to make captures for me, and my last employee complained that the 'spank of the wings was too brisk,' whatever that might mean, on my complaining that he hardly ever sent me a perfect specimen.\\" British Museum : September, 1881. see also as female forma of Charaxes etheocles in Rothschild, W.

The 38 kilometre section south of Emmelshausen has been dismantled and has been since replaced by the Schinderhannes-Radweg cycle path. In Simmern it connected with the now partially closed Hunsrückquerbahn (Trans-Hunsrück Railway) between Langenlonsheim and Hermeskeil. On the 15 kilometre-long Boppard–Emmelshausen section there are regular local services operated by Rhenus Veniro as route RB 37. Many school students from Emmelshausen and Boppard-Buchholz rely on the trains and their travel was facilitated by the extension of the line from Boppard Central Station to Boppard Süd station. ==Name of the line == The name Hunsrückbahn was given to this line only after the closure of passenger services on another line that was originally called the Hunsrückbahn, which runs between Langenlonsheim and Hermeskeil. These original Hunsrückbahn is now called the Hunsrückquerbahn (literally meaning the “Trans-Hunsrück Railway”) to distinguish them (especially since the development of Hahn Airport). ==History == The railway was opened in August 1908. Three years were spent building the last section between Boppard and Kastellaun. Not only the steep route between Boppard and Buchholz, but also the line through the front ridge of the Hunsrück required a high standard of technology and a substantial workforce. There were some deaths in the construction of the Hunsrück Railway. The most serious accident occurred on 4 January 1907 in the drilling of the tunnel between Leiningen and Lamscheid when a worker was crushed by a landslide. While colleagues and volunteers searched for him, more earth slipped, killing another twelve. There is a memorial at the disaster site to the 13 dead. On the steep route between Boppard and Boppard-Buchholz, including two viaducts and five tunnels, which was opened in 1907, the line was operated until 1931 as a rack railway with Abt rack. Prussian locomotives of class T 26 were used. This was followed by adhesive operations with class 94.5 steam locomotives, which lasted until May 1956. From May 1956 until the closure of the Emmelshausen–Simmern section, the whole line was operated by class VT 98 Uerdingen railbuses (from 1968: class 798) with special equipment for the steep haul operations. Partial closure Uerdingen railbus in front of the old Boppard station in the 1970s Passenger services between Simmern and Pfalzfeld were abandoned on 29 May 1983. There was a brief renaissance of passenger operations on the Simmern–Kastellaun section on 11 October 1986, when there was big demonstration against the planned stationing of cruise missiles near Kastellaun and a series of special trains operated on that section. Freight operations were closed between Emmelshausen and Pfalzfeld on 27 May 1983. Freight operated between Kastellaun and Pfalzfeld until 31 December 1994 and between Simmern and Kastellaun until 1 June 1995. On 1 March 1996, the Simmern–Pfalzfeld section was closed. In the years since 1998, the section has been gradually dismantled and the Schinderhannes cycle path was built on the Emmelshausen–Simmern route, which is very popular with cyclists, skaters and walkers. With the restriction on operations to the Boppard–Emmelshausen section in 1983, services were operated for the first time with class 213 diesel locomotives hauling two Silberling carriages, one of which was equipped with a control compartment. The use of the class 213 locomotives lasted until 1995, when all ten locomotives were drawn and transferred for use on the Plaue–Themar railway in Thuringia. It was initially replaced by class 215 locomotives and later by the class 218 diesels. In addition to the class 218 diesel locomotives, a modernised Silberling intermediate carriage began operations on 15 April 2011 and a driving trailer of class Bybdzf (also known as a Wittenberg control car) is used. The operation with heavy diesels was not without problems. At the end of 2005, operations had to be suspended for a few weeks because of damage to the tracks and to the wheel sets. This is possibly the result of using 80-ton and 2060 kW locomotives on the tight curves of this steep section. By increasing the wheel flange lubrication and after the installation of rail wheel flange lubrication systems services were restarted. In 2008, the line was completely renovated. The DB Netz AG invested €9.3 million on the line to completely replace the old tracks and sleepers. After the renovation in August 2008, wear reoccurred on the wheel sets, causing the discontinuation of traffic in order to research the cause for several months until 16 February 2009. Change of operator Workshop of Rhenus Veniro in Boppard, one of the three Regio-Shuttle sets to the left Rhenus Veniro was contracted to take over passenger operations on the Hunsrück railway at the timetable change in December 2009. The Public Transport Association of Rhineland-Palatinate North (Zweckverband SchienenPersonenNahVerkehr Rheinland-Pfalz Nord) in Koblenz had awarded the company the contract for its operation in February 2008. The contract is for a period of 20 years. Rhenus Veniro was contracted to operate three Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1 diesel multiple units that were modified for the steep grades of this route. As the operation of these new vehicles had still not been approved by the Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) in December 2009, the line continued to be operated by DB Regio Southwest with locomotive-hauled push-pull trains. In the autumn of 2010 Emmelshausen station was rebuilt. Two new switches were installed and a new platform was built on track 1 to enable trains to stop there again. The signal box at the entrance to the station became redundant during the conversion work. On the last day before the Easter school holidays on the 15 April 2011, Zweckverband SPNV-Nord terminated the operations of DB Regio on the line. During the holidays, the platforms at Boppard-Fleckertshöhe and Ehr stations were renewed. On 29 April 2011, the Federal Railway Authority issued a limited operating license to Rhenus Veniro for the three RS1 DMUs (650350–650352), valid to 31 December 2011, allowing them to be used. Further modifications to the brake system were necessary to obtain a full permit. Until these were carried out the DMUs could not be operated at full occupancy. After a few, minor repairs by the manufacturer, Stadler Rail, Rhenus Veniro commenced operations on 4 May 2011 at 05:23, three days after the announced date for scheduled operations. However, not all three trains were used as the repairs were not complete. Therefore, the route was initially operated with one train, with additional buses used for school transport. From 8 August 2011, the first day of school after the summer holidays, Rhenus Veniro operated two coupled DMUs for the student traffic, which allowed a reduction in the operation of school buses. One of the three DMUs received unrestricted approval from the Federal Railway Authority in December 2011. The other two vehicles received full approval at the beginning of January 2012. Since then, the three-carriage DMUs have been able to run, so no additional school buses are now required. ==Grades== The section of the Hunsrück Railway from Boppard to Emmelshausen is the steepest adhesion railway in western Germany. On the six-kilometre section from Boppard to Boppard-Buchholz it climbs 336 metres. The grade is 6.09% or 1 in 16.4. The section of the Hunsrück Railway between Boppard and Emmelshausen is protected as a monument as a result. ==See also== *Hunsrückquerbahn *Boppard Central Station ==Notes External links == * * * Category:Railway lines in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Hunsrück Category:Railway lines opened in 1908 Category:1908 establishments in Germany ","title":"Hunsrück Railway"},{"id":"35933252","text":"Kevin Chree (born 11 August 1974) is a South African former field hockey player who competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:South African male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of South Africa Category:Field hockey players at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 1998 Commonwealth Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2002 Commonwealth Games Category:2002 Men's Hockey World Cup players Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for South Africa ","title":"Kevin Chree"},{"id":"35933263","text":"Charles Teversham (born 1 May 1968) is a South African former field hockey player who competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:South African male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of South Africa Category:Field hockey players at the 1996 Summer Olympics ","title":"Charles Teversham"},{"id":"35933266","text":"Big () is a 2012 South Korean television series starring Gong Yoo and Lee Min- jung.

It is located on Cape Arkona on the peninsula of Wittow on the northern tip of the island of Rügen. All three towers were renovated in the early 1990s and are open to visitors. In the old lighthouse is a museum with an exhibition on lighthouses and maritime rescue as well as an outstation of the local registry office. Here marriages may be commemorated on a small plaque in front of the tower. The radio navigation tower (German: Peilturm) is used as an art museum and studio. On each tower is an observation platform, from where there are unimpeded views over the island of Rügen, especially the Wittow Peninsula. In fine weather, the Danish island of Møn may be made out. == Schinkel Tower == The smaller of the two lighthouses was built of brick in 1826/27, to plans by the Prussian Main Construction Agency (Oberbaudeputation). The design is usually attributed to Karl Friedrich Schinkel, based mainly on a catalogue of drawings produced in 1863 by Schinkel's son-in-law, Alfred von Wolzogen. Schinkel was not mentioned, however, in a document published in 1828 on the \\"Construction Designs of the Prussian State\\", in which town planner, August Adolph Günther, cites the lighthouse as a \\"design by the Royal Main Construction Agency.\\" Signatures on two drawings of the lighthouse were, on the one hand, interpreted as evidence of Schinkel's authorship and, on the other, as no more than a simple administrative internal check note. No statements are known by Schinkel himself, who first viewed the tower in 1835, of his own participation in the construction of the tower. On the other hand, a contemporary, the Berliner engraver Johann Friedrich Rosmäsler, in his 1834 book, Preußen in landschaftlichen Darstellungen (\\"Prussia in Pictures\\") calls Schinkel the originator of the design. Rosmäsler produced a steel engraving of the lighthouse (1835).Helmut Hannes: Der Swinemünder Leuchtturm – ein Schinkel- Bau? In: Pommern. Zeitschrift für Kultur und Geschichte. Vol. 2/2011, , pp. 2–7. (which also has a picture of the steel engraving) The foundation stone was laid on 5 May 1826 and the light was lit on 10 December 1827. The tower is high and has a focal height of . Its light was visible out to . The lighting apparatus was made by master goldsmith Hossauaer from Berlin. It consisted of 17 silver-plated, copper, parabolic mirrors, at the focal points of which were burners, each with its own oil tank of rapeseed oil. The associated mirrors were placed in metal rings in two staggered rows. In 1872, six additional lamps were installed, which ran on paraffin. A year later, the burners were completely converted to run on paraffin. The rooms of the three-storey tower were used as working rooms and stores. It was also called the Schinkel Tower (Schinkelturm). On 1 April 1905, it was taken out of service. It is the second-oldest lighthouse on the Baltic Sea coast after the Travemünde Lighthouse. The larger tower was built in 1901/02 immediately next to the old one and taken into service on 1 April 1905. It is high and has a focal height of . It is made of brick and stands on an octagonal granite base. == New tower == On 27 June 1894, plans emerged for an electrically powered beacon by the firm Helios to replace the old tower. In 1902 this firm built and mounted the lighting apparatus. This consisted of two carbon arc lamps mounted on a rotating table. Each was surrounded on three sides by Fresnel lenses; on the fourth side a screen blocked the light. This light system existed until 1921 when two bulbs were installed as light sources. In 1995 the system was swapped for a metal-halide lamp with an intensity of 2,325 million candelas. Its electric flashing light sends three flashes every 17.1 seconds and is visible at up to . At the same time, one of the two triple-lens sets was removed and displayed to the public. == Navigation tower == Navigation tower The former marine navigation tower (German: Peilturm) was built in 1927 of brick and acted as a maritime navigation beacon. From 1911 to 1925, attempts were made – which were ground-breaking for that time – to improve navigation for the Sassnitz-Trelleborg railway ferry, established in 1909, using the emission of radio waves.

He is most famous for founding the Hotel del Coronado. ==Biography== Born to businessman Elisha Spurr Babcock, Sr. (born 1815 at Utica, NY, settled in Evansville in 1838), and Agnes Southerland Davidson, a Scotland native. They had eight children; Oliver, Louisa, Elisha Spurr, Jr., William D., Edgar, Frank, Amelia and John. Elisha Spurr Babcock, Sr. shut his business in Evansville and went to San Diego in 1887.A History of Evansville and Vanderburgh County, Indiana, Joseph Peter Elliott, 1897 E. S. Babcock Jr. was born on May 1, 1848 in Evansville, Indiana where he was raised, he graduated from Evansville High School. From the outset of his career he was active in business and started many business ventures. Babcock's first job was with the Evansville and Terre Haute Railroad, commencing as a freight clerk at the Evansville depot, and working himself up to the position of general freight agent of the road. Eventually Babcock left the railroad service to engage in developing the Bell Telephone Company, which controlled a large territory extending from Evansville to New Orleans; at the same time he held sole ownership of the Eugene Ice Company, with some five large houses and a number of agencies, and was a partner in the firm of E. S. Babcock & Son. It is generally thought that Babcock became acquainted with Charles T. Hinde in Evansville during the 1870s. He died on September 1, 1922. He was married to Isabella Graham Babcock (died 1932).Cemeteries of San Diego, By Seth Mallios, David M. Caterino, Arcadia Publishing, 2007, p. 73 ==Hotel del Coronado== Originally Babcock came to southern California to regain his health, but when he sensed opportunity he established the Coronado Beach Company and began planning massive real estate investments. Using his training as a civil engineer he planned the construction of dams for water, and the Hotel del Coronado. Babcock and partners bought the land for $110,000 in 1885.The Los Angeles Times, 29 Sep 1985 However, the economy began to struggle and Babcock summoned his good friend Charles T. Hinde to come and help him save his investments. Through some luck John D. Spreckels decided to invest in the Santa Fe wharf in San Diego, the Hotel del Coronado, and purchase the dams. Later, Babcock, Hinde, and Spreckels, founded the Spreckels Brothers Commercial Company. Babcock gave the William E. Ritter's \\"Marine Biological Association of San Diego\\", which later became the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the use of Hotel Del's boathouse as a summer laboratory from 1903 to 1903. ==References * E.

In 1595, after Count Edzard II had increased the tax burden several times and passed new laws, disregarding their effect on the citizens of Emden, the citizens revolted. They removed the city council, which Edzard II had appointed from office and occupied the count's castle. Edzard II was forced to move his residence to Aurich. Under the terms of the Treaty of Delfzijl of 15 July 1595, Edzard had to renounce most of his rights in Emden. == Background == In the late 16th century, Emden took in many Calvinist refugees from the Spanish Netherlands and developed into a major port city of European importance, mainly because the warring Dutch and Spanish forces blocked each other's ports. Emden developed into a major transshipment point for grain imports to Westphalia. At the same time, the integration of the Calvinist refugees marked East Frisian society economically and religiously. After the 1609 truce between Spain and the rebellious Netherlands, the port blockades were lifted and many refugees returned home. This led to an economic depression in Emden. At the same time, tensions arose between the East Frisian town of Emden and Count Edzard II. The real reason was the arbitrary taxation by the count. As so often in history, the tensions exploded in a veritable religious conflict. Edzard's mother Anna had abolished the primogeniture in 1558, and decreed that the government of the county should be run jointly by her three sons, Edzard, Christopher and John. The goal of this decree was probably to dam the influence of the House of Vasa on the county. This influence was founded on the marriage between her eldest son Edzard and Catherine Vasa, the eldest daughter of King Gustav I of Sweden. This led to a religious division in the county, as John, like his mother and the majority of the citizens of Emden, was a Calvinist whereas Edzard was Lutheran. Count John was very popular in the city, because he was a prominent advocate of the Reformed Church in the Countly family. Things changed after John died in 1591. Menso Alting, the reformed vicar in the Great Church in Emden, became a leading opponent of the power ambitions of count Edzard II. Menso Alting had a major influence on the enforcement of Calvinism in Emden. He tried to create a Protestant Union in the spirit of militant Calvinism as a defense against the Counter-Revolution. This got him involved in the conflict between the Netherlands and Spain, as well as the conflict between the East-Frisian Estates and the Lutheran Counts Edzard II and Enno III. Menso Alting cleverly used a tax increase by Edzard II to stir the population of Emden into action against Edzard II. Edzard II then asked the Emperor for assistance. On 21 January 1594, the Emperor issued a decree against the East Frisian Estates and against some citizens of Emden, in which they were asked: * to recognize the Count as their ruler * to pacify the city * to hand over city hall to the Count * to stop meeting * to dissolve the college of forty This appeal by the emperor encouraged the citizens of Emden to reject the authority of the Count. He had obviously lost his authority, and this triggered the revolution. == Revolution== The former \\"Great Church\\" in Emden, now the Johannes a Lasco Library On 18 March 1595, many people gathered in the Great Church in Emden. Menso Alting warmed them up with a sermon. Then Gerhard Bolardus, a member of the college of forty, held an impassioned speech, in which he called for the overthrow of the Count. Weapons were handed out, and the crowd moved to the town hall. They occupied the city walls and various strategic locations in the city. Following the example of other cities, 21 civil companies (later 23) were set up. Each company was led by a captain, a lieutenant and an ensign. These 21 captains and the four quartermasters of the Emden district formed the \\"Civil War Chamber\\". This was the birth of the Emden militia. Alarmed by the news from Emden, Edzard II sent his secretary into the city to test the waters. Encouraged by Edzard's apparent lack of power, the citizens removed the count's mayor from power on 24 March 1595. The college of forty elected by the citizens grabbed power and appointed four new mayors and eight councillors. Edzard then sent his Chancellor to The Hague to ask the Dutch authorities where they stood in the conflict. On 2 April 1595, the Dutch offered to mediate. In the meantime, the conflict escalated on the East Frisian peninsula. On 2 April the citizens stormed the castle in Emden and demolished part of the castle on the city side. This forced Edzard to move his residence to Aurich. Ships from Emden were given orders to look out from troop movements in the area and raid Edzard's ships if necessary. Edzard's reaction showed his lack of power. He offered the States-General to join the Netherlands as its eighth province in return for military support. He stationed troops at the Knock peninsula, west of Emden, and ordered them to shoot at passing ships. The citizens of Emden turned to the States-General for help. The States-General sent a reinforcement of 1000 men to the city. The Count saw no other option than to start negotiating with the city. On 7 November 1595, a peace treaty was signed in Delfzijl by the city, the count and the Estates. This peace did not hold for very long. Tensions rose again and in 1600 civil war broke out between the city of Emden and the States-General on one side, and count Enno III and the rural parts of the county on the other side. On 4 October 1602, a battle began near the sconce at Logum, which Enno had built. The battle continued until 14 October and was won by the city. As the battle had clearly demonstrated the power relations in East Frisia, Enno III went into hiding until February 1603. While he was in hiding, the city held sovereignty over East Frisia, and collected taxes. In February 1603, Enno III appeared in The Hague. The city of Emden then sent representatives to the States-General to conduct negotiations, which led to the Agreement of the Hague of 8 April 1603. The agreement confirmed the annexation by Emden of its suburbs. The city received tax sovereignty with the city limits, and the city magistrate became sovereign in military affairs. This meant that the city de facto became a free imperial city. The city would have a permanent garrison of 600 to 700 men, funded by the East Frisian estates. The commander of this garrison would be a Dutchman, who had not previously served either the Count or the city of Emden. These were unequal negotiations. Enno III only participated because the States- General threatened war if he didn't. After hesitating for a while, he signed the agreement on 8 April 1603. == Aftermath == The revolution freed Emden from the reign of the Cirksena family. Emden became a \\"satellite\\" of the Netherlands and de facto a free imperial city. The city was proud of this status, and henceforth signed all its official publications with S.P.Q.E. (\\"Senate and People of Emden\\"), after the Roman model. The city and the Reformed southwestern part of East Frisia built close ties with the Calvinist church in the Netherlands. During the 17th century, Dutch was the language of choice of the leading citizens of Emden. However, the decline of the city had begun. Tolerance in matters of faith had disappeared and the Treaty of Greetsiel stipulated that only the Reformed religion could be taught in Emden. Activities in the harbour had declined, and only in 1800 would they again reach levels comparable to those of the 1670s. == References == * Hajo van Lengen (ed.): Die „Emder Revolution“ von 1595, in: Kolloquium der Ostfriesland-Stiftung am 17.

Hendrix is best known for the book Getting the Love You Want, which has sold more than 4 million copies and gained in popularity during Hendrix's 17 appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show.“IDEAS & TRENDS; What Publishers Will Do for a Place on the Right List”, Roger Cohen, The New York Times, August 12, 1990. He is a diplomat in the American Association of Pastoral Counselors as well as a clinical member of the American Group Psychotherapy Association and the International Transactional Analysis Association, and has produced 10 written works in partnership with his wife and American activist, Helen LaKelly Hunt. In addition to their development of Imago Relationship Therapy, Harville and Helen also serve as Chancellors and Distinguished Professors of Daybreak University. == Early life and education == Hendrix was born in 1935 in Statesboro, Georgia. At the age of 17 he became an ordained Baptist minister, after which he continued on to receive his B.A. at Mercer University in Georgia, in 1957, and his B.D. from Union Theological Seminary in 1961. Following this, Hendrix then went on to receive both an M.A. and Ph.D. in psychology and religion from the Divinity School at the University of Chicago.\\"Harville Hendrix: Relationships, the Brain, and Zero Negativity\\", Insights at the Edge podcast, June 28, 2011. == Career and global mission == Hendrix, along with his wife Helen LaKelly Hunt, developed Imago Relationship Therapy, a form of relationship and couples therapy that focuses on relational counseling to transform any conflict between couples into opportunities for healing and growth. The Latin word “imago”—meaning “image”—refers to the “unconscious image of familiar love.” What has been found is frequent connection between frustrations in adult relationships and early childhood experiences. As an example, individuals frequently criticized as a child will likely be highly sensitive to their partner’s criticism. Childhood feelings of abandonment, suppression or neglect will often arise in a marriage or committed relationship. When such “core issues” repeatedly come up with a partner, they can overshadow all that is good in a relationship and leave one to wonder whether he or she has chosen the right mate. Through Imago Relationship Therapy, couples can learn to understand each other’s feelings and “childhood wounds” more empathically, allowing them to heal themselves and their relationships so they can move toward a more “Conscious Relationship. Imago Relationships Worldwide , Hendrix and Hunt's nonprofit organization, has trained over 2,500 therapists and educators in over 50 countries in Imago Therapy.“Seven Questions for Harville Hendrix”, Ryan Howes, Psychology Today, February 12, 2009. Harville and Helen co-created Imago Relationship Therapy and Safe Conversations to promote the transformation of couples and families by a creating relational culture that support universal equality. Most personal suffering, such as divorce, domestic violence, anxiety, depression, addictions and mental illness, are disorders of unhealthy relationships. Therefore, happiness, success, emotional well-being, and joy are functions of healthy relationships. Harville and Helen envision a world in which the primary value is relationship and universal equality is a reality. Their belief is that all persons are created in relationship, become who they are in relationship, and are wounded by and healed in relationship. == Awards and honors == Hendrix holds a Ph.D. in Psychology and Theology from the University of Chicago, In addition to that, he has received an honorary doctorate and two distinguished service awards. He has appeared on many national television shows including sixteen guest appearances on the Oprah Winfrey show. One of his appearances won her an Emmy award for the \\"most socially redemptive\\" daytime talk shows and was included by Ms. Winfrey in her top twenty shows. ==Bibliography== * Hendrix, Harville; LaKelly Hunt, Helen (1988).

The team formed in 2012, mainly with Israeli Football League players and coaching staff. == First game == The first international American football game played by Israel was played on 17 May 2012 in Baptist village near Petah Tikva, when the Israeli national team met Maranatha Baptist Bible College.

HH may present as either congenital or acquired, but the majority of cases are of the former nature. ==Symptoms and signs== Examples of symptoms of hypogonadism include delayed, reduced, or absent puberty, low libido, and infertility. ==Causes== There are a multitude of different etiologies of HH. Congenital causes include the following: * Chromosomal abnormalities (resulting in gonadal dysgenesis) - Turner's syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome, Swyer's syndrome, XX gonadal dysgenesis, and mosaicism. * Gonadotropin resistance (e.g., due to inactivating mutations in the gonadotropin receptors) - Leydig cell hypoplasia (or insensitivity to LH) in males, FSH insensitivity in females, and LH and FSH resistance due to mutations in the GNAS gene (termed pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A). Acquired causes (due to damage to or dysfunction of the gonads) include ovarian torsion, vanishing/anorchia, orchitis, premature ovarian failure, ovarian resistance syndrome, trauma, surgery, autoimmunity, chemotherapy, radiation, infections (e.g., sexually-transmitted diseases), toxins (e.g., endocrine disruptors), and drugs (e.g., antiandrogens, opioids, alcohol). ==Diagnosis== Diagnosis is typically made by measuring both gonadal and gonadotropin levels using a blood sample. ==Treatment== Treatment of HH is usually with hormone replacement therapy, consisting of androgen and estrogen administration in males and females, respectively. ==See also== * Hypogonadism * Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism * Hypergonadotropic hypergonadism * Delayed puberty and infertility * Hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and HPG axis * Gonads (testicles and ovaries) * GnRH and gonadotropins (FSH and LH) * Sex hormones (androgens and estrogens) ==References== Category:Endocrine gonad disorders Category:Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropins ","title":"Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism"},{"id":"35933853","text":"Rønning Treski Logo Rønning Treski is the only remaining producer of wood skis in Norway.

These ingredients are put together to form a material that is denser, stronger, and heavier than wood alone, a wood-plastic composite. ==History== Until the 1990s, wood was the material of choice for deck construction. However, new products, composites, began to emerge at this time. These new products offered the look and workability of wood, but they were more water resistant and required less maintenance. Over time, these lower maintenance decking options increased in popularity. Although the majority of decks are still built of pressure treated pine, redwood, cedar or mahogany, use of composite woods has increased as outdoor decks and living areas have become popular as home features. ==Features== Working with composite lumber is similar to working with wood. However, composite lumber has the added benefit of being less likely to split or delaminate. Some composite lumber is also engineered to be lighter weight for easier handling. Composite lumber is also more stain, scratch, and mold resistant, and is therefore supposed to have a longer life than wood lumber. ==Advantages== Composite lumber comes from the manufacturer as a finished product. There is no need to stain, sand, or paint the material. Composite materials usually cost more than lumber, but their long life and low-maintenance requirements could make them more economical in the long run. Many composites are often made partially out of recycled plastics and waste wood, which makes them an environmentally friendly, efficient use of resources. ==Disadvantages== Composite lumber is usually more costly than normal or treated lumber, but prices have come down over the years.http://www.compositedeckdirect.com Composites may last longer, but the initial investment is likely to be higher. Many composites are formulated to be fade, scratch, and stain resistant, but no lumber is immune to the elements. Although composite lumber may resist these marring effects better than other materials, it will still show signs of wear over time. Composite lumber often has a plastic-like or synthetic appearance. Although manufacturers do mold the product with a wood grain or brush stroke pattern, some consumers simply do not like the artificial sheen. Environmental impact The growth of wood-alternative products continues to fuel a debate about their environmental value when compared to wood, treated wood, metal and other alternatives. Many suggest that wood decking is made from a more sustainable ingredient and that it carries a smaller manufacturing carbon footprint. Others have claimed that the sawing of wood- alternative products during construction creates dust that will not biodegrade and that the wood-alternative deck boards, when they have outlived their useful lives, will not biodegrade in landfills. ==Capped composite decking== Capped composite decking is composite decking, with a thin, approximately , PVC-like veneer, or cap. This cap provides protection for the composite underneath. The cap is also formulated differently, in order to provide increased fade, stain, and scratch resistance.Product Monitor: Decked Out Capped composite decking is more expensive than both normal composite decking and wood decking because of the more involved manufacturing process in adding the second, co-extruded layer to the board. Capped composites also lack the feel of real wood. Although manufacturers form the product with a realistic wood grain or brush stroke, some contractors and deck owners will not accept the artificial sheen. Capped composites, although formulated to resist fading, stains, and scratches, will show some wear over time, even if it is less than a normal composite or real wood product.Which Composite decking is the best?  Deck Masters, llc Composite deck boards are sold in either grooved or solid sided versions. The grooved composite board is fastened with hidden deck fasteners or clips, while the solid board is typically face-screwed. Most composite deck board manufacturers produce lengths of , . Manufacturers of capped composite boards will often leave one side uncapped to prevent the material from expanding and mushrooming out of the corners of the boards. This is usually the bottom side and allows the material within to expand and contract naturally during varying weather conditions, without causing lasting damage. A minority of manufacturers use four-sided capping processes providing a reversible decking board, completely sealed for protection against the elements. Emulated wood grain patterns differ on either side to provide more versatile design options. ==See also== * Composite construction * Glued laminated timber * Plastic composite (disambiguation) ==ReferencesAdditional sources== * * https://web.archive.org/web/20120624055442/http://beautiful-backyard- blog.com/category/composite-materials/timbertech/-discusses composite decking * Ultra decking supports environmentally friendly materials that help keep us safe!

Graeme Potter, director of Queensland Museum South Bank, called her \\"Australia's original bikini designer\\". ==Life== Stafford was born in Melbourne in 1920. After school she studied dress design at Emily McPherson School of Domestic Economy, a part of Melbourne Technical College. She now lives in Gold Coast. In 2010, her autobiography Bikini: the Paula Stafford story was published, co-written with Ali McGovern. Paula Stafford dining out with her husband Beverley, 1949. State Library of Queensland Negative number: 151516 ==Fashion== The bikini is generally credited to Louis Reard in 1946, but two-piece swimming costumes had existed before then. Stafford had been making them for herself since the 1930s, but only gradually turned this into a business. In the 1940s, wartime shortages led to a desire to save fabric, which led to costumes becoming more skimpy. When somebody saw her self-made costume on the beach in Gold Coast and asked to buy one, she began selling them. Her styles became popular in Gold Coast and in Melbourne. She began manufacturing operations with a machinist working in her attic, but later built a factory, and opened a shop, called the Tog Shop, and also sold mail-order. The firm also expanded into leisurewear for men and women. She sold her clothes to stores including British retailers Selfridges and Liberty of London, and in Australia Myers, Georges, Buckleys and David Jones. She also founded a modelling agency and a hotel. In a famous incident in 1952, model Ann Ferguson was asked to leave a beach in Surfers Paradise because her outfit was too revealing; she was wearing a Paula Stafford bikini. In 1993, Paula Stafford was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia in the General Division for service to the fashion industry. Her work is on display at the Gold Coast Historical Society museum in Bundall, Queensland. It was also displayed in an exhibition of swimwear at the Queensland Museum South Bank in 2010. She was awarded Gold Coast City Council's \\"Legend Award\\" in 2012. In 2013 Paula Stafford was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame. ==References== Sara Hicks, \\"The mother of all cheeky bikinis \\", ABC Gold Coast, 23 May 2008 Greg Stolz, \\"Bikini queen Paula Stafford turns 90 \\", Courier-Mail, 10 June 2010 Janet Campbell, \\"Paula Stafford (b 1920) \\", Brisbane Modern magazine, Issue 3 Katherine Feeney, \\"Nothing teeny or weeny about this bikini... exhibition \\", Brisbane Times, 28 May 2010 \\"'Legend' honour for Aussie bikini pioneer \\", ABC News (Australia), 20 January 2012 \\"Bikini Cops \\" (Transcript), ABC (Australia), 6 September 2004 Category:Businesspeople from Melbourne Category:Australian fashion designers Category:1920 births Category:Living people Category:Australian centenarians Category:Women centenarians ","title":"Paula Stafford"},{"id":"35934047","text":"Hope is the second EP of a trilogy released by American rock band Hawthorne Heights through the band's own record label, Cardboard Empire.

PVC decking is a more expensive option in the decking industry, but it provides significant fade and stain resistance and lower maintenance requirements compared to other products. ==History== PVC decking was introduced to the market around 2005 and continues to be a contender as a top deck building material. Its uniquely all-plastic makeup makes it distinctly different from wood decking or other composite decking options. PVC decking has changed in appearance since its introduction and is now available in different colors. ==Production== Unlike some other wood-alternative decking materials, PVC decking is not made with any wood. It is made completely from plastic instead of from a combination of materials. Producing PVC decking is a relatively difficult process called co-extrusion. The deck board core is coated and bound with an outer plastic shell, but the materials can be temperamental and hard to work with. Commercial production is challenging, not only for this reason, but also because about one eighth of the deck boards produced are considered unsellable and therefore scrapped. The fragile nature of this production process requires careful ingredient mixing and precise execution. ==Advantages== PVC decking offers the most significant fade, stain, and mold resistance among decking products. The products are marketed as low- maintenance and are typically easy to clean and maintain. PVC decking typically doesn't require staining, sanding, or painting. It is sometimes partially composed of recycled plastic material, making it an environmentally friendly, efficient use of resources. The product is significantly lighter compared to wood composite products and can be bent and shaped to create custom configurations. ==Disadvantages== Compared to other synthetic decking products, PVC is the most expensive. The 100% PVC makeup of the board makes it costlier than the wood powder/plastic mix used in composite decking. This cost means that PVC will be a more expensive investment up front, although manufacturers claim that the long life and low maintenance requirements of the deck make it an economical decision in the long run. PVC lacks the realistic feel of wood. Although manufacturers form the product with a realistic wood grain or brushstroke, some contractors and homeowners simply do not like the artificial sheen of the product. PVC is also formulated to resist scratches, stains, and mold, but some wear will still show over the life of the product. ==See also== * Composite lumber * Wood-plastic composite ==References== Category:Building materials ","title":"PVC decking"},{"id":"35934060","text":"The Vampire (, Oupyr) is a gothic novella by Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy, first published in Saint Petersburg in 1841 under the pseudonym of Krasnorogsky. ==Background== The inspiration for the story was Tolstoy's reminiscences of his stay in Como, Italy, in 1838. He wrote of this to his wife in April 1872, mentioning the villa Remondi, a girl named Pepina and other details. On April 9, 1841, Tolstoy read The Vampire at Vladimir Sollogub's; the reading was mentioned by Pyotr Pletnyov in a letter to Yakov Grot.The Yakov Grot and Pyotr Pletnyov Correspondence. Vol.I, Saint Petersburg. 1896, р.313 In early May 1841 Tolstoy sent the manuscript to censor Aleksandr Nikitenko to be reviewed. On May 15 he was granted permission to publish it. The novella was poorly received by critics, discouraging Tolstoy from publishing three other vampire-themed works that he had written at the time. One of these, a story titled \\"Amena\\", was published in 1846, while the other two were only published posthumously. Tolstoy's writing on the subject of vampires was at least partly influenced by The Vampyre by John William Polidori, which had been published in Russian translation in Moscow in 1828. ==Critical reception== Vissarion Belinsky liked the novella, recognizing in it \\"all the signs of a gift, still very young, but quite remarkable.\\" Youthfulness, as he saw it, manifested itself in \\"too ardent and intense an imagination which is yet to be tempered by life experience and be balanced by the other qualities of the soul.\\" Unlike the works of E. T. A. Hoffmann whom he admired, Belinsky regarded Tolstoy's creation as lacking intellectual depth. \\"Despite the superficial nature of this invention, the multifacetedness and intricacy of it belie great strength of imagination in the author, while his masterful rendition and the ability to draw characters out of mere faces and catch the spirit of the place and time... along with his beautiful, often poetic language, bear the mark of a strong literary hand,\\" Belinsky wrote. ==English translation== *Vampires: Stories of the Supernatural, (includes The Vampire and three other related tales by Tolstoy), Hawthorn Books, 1973. ==References External links == * Упырь.

Werker and starring Fred MacMurray, Dorothy Malone and Walter Brennan. ==Plot== Plainview is a peaceful town, all the better for bad men Alvin Dennis, his brother Bob, and their gang, to rob the bank there. They figure small-town sheriff Pete MacKay will not pose much of a problem. MacKay is having his usual chess game with Doc Lacy at the general store Jack Wright runs with wife Martha and brother-in-law Wally. A gunshot from the bank startles all. Bob has shot a teller, then guns down the old marshal when he arrives. Jack is just a meek storekeeper, but he manages to grab a gun and wing the fleeing Alvin Dennis, who is then killed by another townsman, George Henderson. And the bank's loot is saved. Everybody, particularly banker Livingston, appreciates the bravery of the town heroes. But when the Amarillo newspaper publishes their photographs, Bob Dennis decides to return to Plainview to avenge his brother's death. The grateful town throws a celebration for both Henderson and Jack. As a tipsy Henderson, who has been appointed the new sheriff, is riding back to his ranch after the party, he is ambushed and killed. Jack could be next. A marshal comes to town to keep an eye on things, but can't stay forever and leaves after two uneventful weeks. Jack, his wife and son Billy, begin to notice that their neighbors are shunning them, no longer shopping at the store or even allowing their kids to come near them. A $2,500 reward for Alvin Dennis's capture is a pleasant surprise for Jack, but when Wally is mistaken for him and murdered in cold blood by Bob Dennis, no one is willing to help. In fact, he is offered more money by Livingston and other frightened citizens if he will sell them the store and leave town. Doc and the Wrights are ashamed of everyone's lack of support in Jack's hour of need. Jack arms himself to face Bob Dennis and his gang. He is outmatched, but suddenly the men in town, brandishing firearms, appear in windows and on the street, demanding the gang drop their guns and surrender. All but Bob give up and, as the outlaw approaches Jack, Doc manages to shoot him. The townspeople offer apologies to the Wrights, who are immediately willing to forgive and forget. Doc storms off, apparently not so willing. ==Cast== * Fred MacMurray as Jack Wright * Dorothy Malone as Martha * Walter Brennan as Doc * Skip Homeier as Bob Dennis * Tommy Rettig as Billy * John Qualen as Livingstone * Whit Bissell as Clem Clark * Jack Lambert as Kirk ==See also== *List of American films of 1955 ==References* * Category:1955 films Category:1955 Western (genre) films Category:Allied Artists films Category:American films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Alfred L.

The hip hop-inspired song was written by American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey, Roy Kerr and Anu Pillai, with production helmed by Kid Gloves. Music critics were divided in their response to \\"Ghetto Baby\\", stating that the track is a highlight on the album, despite Cole sounding too much like Del Rey. An accompanying music video was directed by Rankin, and features Cole and her then boyfriend and back-up dancer Tre Holloway indulging in a public display of affection while performing the track. \\"Ghetto Baby\\" was performed on Cole's debut headlining solo concert tour, named A Million Lights Tour, in October 2012. ==Background and composition== Lana Del Rey wrote the song \\"Ghetto Baby\\" for the album. Cole began working on her third studio album in July 2011 at the Sunset Marquis Hotel in Los Angeles, California. In May 2012, the singer confirmed that American recording artist Lana Del Rey had collaborated on a track for A Million Lights. In an interview with Capital FM, Cole stated that she had noticed Del Rey \\"about a year ago. I was hearing these songs that were really fresh to my ear and amazing and I asked the guy who she was and he said, 'Watch out for her, it's a girl called Lana Del Rey'.\\" The singer explained that she was played another one of Del Rey's tracks and loved it so much, that it eventually led to a collaboration. \\"It all happened really organically just like that. And then 'Video Games' came out and I fell in love with her as an artist as well, so yeah, she's super talented.\\" Del Rey had penned the song, which was cut from her second studio album, Born to Die. On 28 May 2012, Cole tweeted a few lyrics of the song: \\"I'm not a trick boy I'm a trick for you, you give me butterflies heart skipping 1, 2, I know your sick boy I wanna get the flu (sic)... I'm running temperatures thinking of your love boo..\\", adding the hashtag \\"#ghettobaby.\\" \\"Ghetto Baby\\", produced by Kid Gloves, is a hip hop track. Written by Elizabeth Grant, Roy Kerr and Anu Pillai, the song's lyrics were considered by Laurence Green of musicOMH \\"classic Lana Del Rey\\"; a beat- heavy number \\"woven from kisses, stilettos and sultry speak-singing,\\" with lines such as \\"When he's bad he's bad / But when he's good no one's better / Cos we're a match made in heaven / And this kind of love's forever.\\" A MTV news writer said that the track is \\"riddled with elements of the New York singer, with Cheryl even displaying Lana-esque vocals.\\" \\"Ghetto Baby\\" was released on 15 June 2012, while Del Rey's demo leaked online on 9 August 2012. ==Critical reception== Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic deemed it as one of the album's highlights, but stated that, on many tracks from A Million Lights such as \\"Ghetto Baby\\" and \\"Under the Sun\\", \\"Cheryl doesn't stamp these sounds with her own personality; she merely tries the personas on for size, not so much to see if they fit, but rather to see which ones will allow her entry into the charts.\\" A Virgin Media reviewer said that, on the song, Cole \\"sounds exactly what she is – a plucky disco diva,\\" while an Idolator contributor stated that the track was not right for the singer, because it \\"sounds so much like a Lana Del Rey cut that we just can't help but feel that Lana herself should be singing it. ... Cheryl's voice isn't 'ghetto' (or babyish) enough to pull off these lyrics — and love her or hate her, Lana's voice is distinctive enough to at least make you take notice. Not to mention the most ghetto thing about this song is the dated 'Drop It Like It's Hot' reference.\\" Elena Gorgan of Softpedia considered \\"Ghetto Baby\\" a solid song, despite being \\"less dance- inspired\\" than the other tracks on the album, \\"which could mean it never sees the light of day as a single.\\" When reviewing A Million Lights, Alexis Petridis said the song \\"is actually the handiwork of Lana Del Rey, who, in a volte-face designed to confound critics who've noted that all her songs are about exactly the same thing – doomed love for a beautiful bad boy on the run – has alighted on the radical new topic of her doomed love for a beautiful bad boy on the run.\\" ==Music video== An accompanying music video was uploaded to Cole's VEVO on 25 December 2012 and was directed by Rankin, who thanked Cole for \\"such an ace collaboration. It's always fun.\\" Prior to the release on Christmas, the singer tweeted all day on 24 December 2012 the hashtag \\"#CCandRankinMidnight.\\" On 25 December 2012, at midnight GMT, she revealed the music video for \\"Ghetto Baby\\", adding that she loved working with the director so much \\"that I did this exclusively for him.\\" ==Live performances== \\"Ghetto Baby\\" was performed on Cole's debut headlining solo concert tour, named A Million Lights Tour, in October 2012.{[cn}} ==Personnel== * Cheryl – lead vocals, background vocals * Lana Del Rey – songwriter * Roy Kerr – songwriter * Anu Pillai – songwriter * Kid Gloves – producer, vocal producer * Mike Marsh – mastering * Naweed – mastering Credits adapted from the album's liner notes.A Million Lights liner notes.

The condition manifests itself as pseudohermaphroditism (partially or fully underdeveloped genitalia) in males, in whom it is considered to be a form of intersex, and, in both sexes, as a reduced or absent puberty/lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics, resulting in a somewhat childlike appearance in adulthood (if left untreated). Unlike the case of combined 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency does not affect glucocorticoid production (or mineralocorticoid levels), and for that reason, does not result in adrenal hyperplasia or hypertension. ==Symptoms and signs== The symptoms of isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency, in males, include pseudohermaphroditism (i.e., feminized, ambiguous, or mildly underdeveloped (e.g., micropenis, perineal hypospadias, and/or cryptorchidism (undescended testes)) external genitalia), female gender identity, and, in non-complete cases of deficiency where partial virilization occurs, gynecomastia up to Tanner stage V (due to low androgen levels, which results in a lack of suppression of estrogen); in females, amenorrhoea or, in cases of only partial deficiency, merely irregular menses, and enlarged cystic ovaries (due to excessive stimulation by high levels of gonadotropins); and in both sexes, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (hypogonadism despite high levels of gonadotropins), delayed, impaired, or fully absent adrenarche and puberty with an associated reduction in or complete lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics (sexual infantilism), impaired fertility or complete sterility, tall stature (due to delayed epiphyseal closure), eunuchoid skeletal proportions, delayed or absent bone maturation, and osteoporosis. ==Cause== Isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency is a rare disorder caused by genetic mutations in the gene CYP17A1, while not affecting 17α-hydroxylase. Isolated 17,20 lyase deficiency is a rare disease with only a small number of confirmed reports due to mutations in the CYP17A1 gene. Observed physiological abnormalities of the condition include markedly elevated serum levels of progestogens such as progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (due to upregulation of precursor availability for androgen and estrogen synthesis), very low or fully absent peripheral concentrations of androgens such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, and testosterone and estrogens such as estradiol (due to the lack of 17,20-lyase activity, which is essential for their production), and high serum concentrations of the gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (due to a lack of negative feedback on account of the lack of sex hormones). ==DiagnosisTreatment== Males and females may be treated with hormone replacement therapy (i.e., with androgens and estrogens, respectively), which will result in normal sexual development and resolve most symptoms. In the case of 46,XY (genetically male) individuals who are phenotypically female and/or identify as the female gender, they should be treated with estrogens instead. Removal of the undescended testes should be performed in 46,XY females to prevent their malignant degeneration, whereas in 46,XY males surgical correction of the genitals is generally required, and, if necessary, an orchidopexy (relocation of the undescended testes to the scrotum) may be performed as well. Namely in genetic females presenting with ovarian cysts, GnRH analogues may be used to control high FSH and LH levels if they are unresponsive to estrogens. ==See also== * Cytochrome b5 deficiency * Inborn errors of steroid metabolism * Disorders of sexual development * Intersexuality, pseudohermaphroditism, and ambiguous genitalia * Combined 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency * GnRH, FSH, and LH insensitivities * CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) * Sex hormone (androgen and estrogen) ==References External links == Category:Autosomal recessive disorders Category:Endocrine gonad disorders Category:Rare diseases Category:Intersex variations ","title":"Isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency"},{"id":"35934241","text":"Cinerama Holiday is a 1955 film shot in Cinerama.

The Soul of Insurrection in the North. The \\"Magiting\\" of Katipunan). He was regarded as the \\"Hero of Salitran\\". ==Early life== When he was five years old, he began to study at the Escuela Normal. He finished with the qualification maestro de ascenso. Then, he obtained his Bachelor of Arts at Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He later took law at the University of Santo Tomas, and worked for some time as a clerk in the Court of First Instance at Binondo, but then he decided to quit the course when the Philippine Revolution broke out in August 1896. He left home to join the Revolution, leaving a note for his mother that he was going to \\"fight for the Fatherland\\". ==Love story and the Revolution== Historical marker installed by the National Historical Commission in Imus, Cavite, which is where Yengko's remains were interred. Yengko originally did not want to fight in the Revolution, as he was then finishing his law course, but one primary factor that pushed him to do so had to do with his love story. He had a rival for a young woman of Cavite who had distinguished himself in more than one battle during the Revolution. Though the woman favored Yengko, her father, perhaps a patriot, was inclined toward Yengko's young rival. To make his daughter make up her mind, he used to tell her, \\"What can you expect from a dude like him (Yengko) who does not know anything but to dress himself like a woman and is incapable of picking up a gun and fighting like a man for our cause?\\" The words of the father eventually reached the ears of Yengko, and as he was a man of deep honor, he decided to show that the father had a misconception of him. From then on, there took place a real contest between the two rivals to perform the most courageous acts in the Revolution. On November 8, 1896, Yengko reached Imus, where he presented himself to General Emilio Aguinaldo. The first assignment given to him was the transport of gunpowder from Manila to Cavite. He then fought at the Battle of Binakayan, which took place from November 9 to 11, 1896. It was considered the first major victory of Filipino revolutionaries during Philippine Revolution. Yengko's bravery and valor during the battle caught the attention of General Aguinaldo, who promoted him to the rank of captain after the battle. By December 1896, he had the rank of a colonel. Still, he was dressed in a neat and elegant woolen suit. On February 13, 1897, Governor General Camilo de Polavieja opened his first phase to regain territory lost to the revolutionaries, the Cavite campaign. General José de Lachambre, Polavieja's deputy, advanced against the revolutionaries with 16,000 men armed with Spanish M93s (also known as Mausers), and one field battery. Many of the soldiers he led were from Pampanga, which were fired during Ramon Blanco's administration. Yengko, along with other revolutionaries led by Aguinaldo and General Edilberto Evangelista, fought the Spanish at the Battle of Zapote Bridge. The battle was a Filipino victory, but the counterattack made on February 22 caused only a Filipino retreat. Despite that, Aguinaldo promoted Yengko to brigadier general for his performance in the encounter. After the fall of Perez Dasmarinas to enemy control, Yengko, along with General Crispulo Aguinaldo and Colonel Juan Cailles, defended Salitran in hopes to stop the Spanish advance to Imus, the capital of the Cavite revolutionaries. During the battle that ensued on March 1, he was fatally wounded in the abdomen and was carried by his men to a military hospital in Imus. At the hospital, his love comforted him. With the satisfaction of a reciprocated love and the glory of having fought for his country, he died on March 3, 1897 due to urinal complication. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1897 deaths Category:Filipino generals Category:People of the Philippine Revolution Category:University of Santo Tomas alumni Category:Colegio de San Juan de Letran alumni Category:People from Tondo, Manila Category:Independence activists ","title":"Flaviano Yengko"},{"id":"35934251","text":"Eastwood Addition is an unincorporated community in Wood County, West Virginia. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia Category:Unincorporated communities in Wood County, West Virginia ","title":"Eastwood Addition, West Virginia"},{"id":"35934261","text":"Evandale Terrace is an unincorporated community in Wood County, West Virginia. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia Category:Unincorporated communities in Wood County, West Virginia ","title":"Evandale Terrace, West Virginia"},{"id":"35934262","text":"Shinobu Asagoe and Katarina Srebotnik were the defending champions.

They are suddenly awakened by the shouts of the savages, who surround them on all sides. The expected reinforcements alas arrived too late. The Major calls upon his men to show the enemy how a handful of British soldiers can play a losing game as well as a winning one. He bids them to stand shoulder to shoulder, and fight and die for their Queen. The horses are seen to fall, and from the rampart of dead horses, the heroic band fight to the last round of revolver ammunition. The Major, who is the last to fall, crawls to the top of the head of dead men, savages and horses, and makes every one of the few remaining cartridges find its mark until his life is cut short by the thrust of an assegai in the hands of a savage, who attacks him from behind. Before he falls however, he fires his last bullet into the fleeing carcass of the savage, who drops dead. The Major also expires, and death like silence prevails.

The pictures required a great deal of research – for instance, a view of Norwich in the time of Richard I was the result of much consultation with archaeologists about the (now often vanished) churches, the layout of the streets and so on. This picture now hangs in Norwich City Hall. A view of the channel tunnel workings at Shakespeare Cliff near Dover was actually commissioned by the V&A; Museum during the time of the construction of the Tunnel and is now in the V&A; collection. Since the 1990s he has concentrated on \\"invented figurative pictures\\". In subjective painting, one approaches from quite a different point of view. This is painting about things rather than light, about situations. It is a building towards a scene rather than the depiction of it. There is no clear connection between the two kinds of painting. For example, it is not really possible to take a drawing from life and work it up into an invented composition – or rather it is possible, but the resulting painting would be likely to be dull – less successful than if it had been painted directly from life and less inventive than if it had been evolved from paint marks. Is this the subjective view of the artist?

Such interests include commodity futures, swaps, options and/or leverage transactions. A commodity pool may refer to funds that trade in commodities and can include hedge funds. A CPO may make trading decisions for a fund or the fund can be managed by one or more independent commodity trading advisors. The definition of CPO may apply to investment advisors for hedge funds and private funds including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in certain cases. CPOs are generally regulated by the United States federal government through the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and National Futures Association. ==History== In the United States, trading of futures contracts for agricultural commodities dates back to at least the 1850s. In the 1920s, the federal government proposed the first regulation aimed at futures trading and, in 1922, the Grain Futures Act was passed. Following amendments in 1936, this law was replaced by the Commodity Exchange Act. However, it was not until 1974, when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was established under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act, that the \\"commodity pool operator\\" was recognized in legislation. At that time the majority of trading was in futures contracts for agricultural commodities, but, as noted by the CFTC, in later years \\"the futures industry has become increasingly varied and complex\\". In July 2010, the definition of commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act was expanded by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to include \\"persons operating collective investment vehicles that trade swaps\\". Prior to this, swaps were not included in the CPO definition. ==Regulation== Historical regulation Prior to 1974, commodity pool operators were unregulated except for limited requirements to maintain records. In 1979, the CFTC adopted the first comprehensive regulation for commodity pool operators, which was later strengthened by additional rules in 1982 and 1983, increasing the CFTC's oversight of such entities. Also in 1983, the CFTC authorized the National Futures Association (NFA) to carry out processing of registration for entities including CPOs. Current regulation and exemptions Under the Commodity Exchange Act, CPOs must register with and conform to the regulations of the CFTC, unless they meet the Commission's criteria for exemption. Additionally, registered CPOs are required to become members of the NFA, which regulates organizations or individuals who conduct futures trading business with public customers. All registered CPOs must follow the CFTC's disclosure requirements and provide the commission with records and reports. Under the CFTC's Rule 4.7, a CPO may be exempt from certain disclosure and reporting requirements if investment in the fund it operates is only open to \\"qualified eligible persons\\", including registered commodities and securities professionals and accredited investors. If not all of a CPO's investors are \\"qualified eligible persons\\", it may still be exempt from the full disclosure requirements of the CFTC if it engages primarily in securities transactions. Further exemptions from registration include those under CFTC Regulation 4.13, which states that operators of smaller commodity pools and pools trading at a de minimis level of commodity interests may be exempted, and CFTC Regulation 4.5, under which certain operators can claim an exclusion from the definition \\"commodity pool operator\\". If a CPO is exempt from registration, they may still have to follow certain limited requirements for disclosure and reporting, including providing investors with a fund's offering memorandum, quarterly account statements, and an abbreviated form of its annual report. In addition, the CPO is required to submit a self-executing notice and electronic reports with the NFA. All CPOs are subject to the CFTC's antifraud authority and general market oversight. Changes following Dodd-Frank On January 26, 2011, following the 2010 enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the CFTC made additions and amendments to the regulation of CPOs. These include two new forms of data collection. The CFTC also introduced requirements for greater reporting of data and amended the requirements for who should register with the CFTC. In particular, funds that use swaps or other commodity interests may be defined as commodity pools and their operators may be subject to registration with the CFTC, where previously they would not have been. The United States Chamber of Commerce and the Investment Company Institute filed a lawsuit against the CFTC, aiming to overturn this change to rules that would require the operators of mutual funds investing in commodities to be registered, but the lawsuit was unsuccessful and the rule change was upheld.Investment Company Institute v. CFTC, 891 F. Supp. 2d 162 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2012), aff'd, No. 12-5413 (June 25, 2013). ==See also== *Commodity trading advisor *Managed futures account ==References *National Futures Association *U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Category:Commodity markets ","title":"Commodity pool operator"},{"id":"35934412","text":"Magdalena Sibylle of Holstein-Gottorp (also spelled Magdalena Sibylla; 1631 at Gottorp Castle - 1719 in Güstrow) was a Duchess of Hostein-Gottorp by birth and by marriage Duchess of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.

They are responsible for the trading within managed futures accounts. The definition of CTA may also apply to investment advisors for hedge funds and private funds including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in certain cases. CTAs are generally regulated by the United States federal government through registration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and membership of the National Futures Association (NFA). ==Characteristics== Trading activities A CTA generally acts as an asset manager, following a set of investment strategies utilizing futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a wide variety of physical goods such as agricultural products, forest products, metals, and energy, plus derivative contracts on financial instruments such as indices, bonds, and currencies. The trading programs employed by CTAs can be characterized by their market strategy, whether trend following or market neutral, and the market segment, such as financial, agricultural or currency. There are three major styles of investment employed by CTAs: technical, fundamental, and quantitative. Technical traders invest after analysing chart patterns. They often employ partially automated systems, such as computer software programs, to follow price trends, perform technical analysis, and execute trades. Successful trend following, or using technical analysis techniques to capture swings in markets may drive a CTA's performance and activity to a large degree. In 2010, Dr. Galen Burghardt, adjunct professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, found a correlation of 0.97 between a subset of trend following CTAs and a broader CTA index from the period 2000-2009, indicating that speculative technical trend following had been dominant within the CTA community. Fundamental traders attempt to forecast prices by analyzing supply and demand factors, amongst other market information, in their attempt to realize profits. Other non-trend following CTAs include short-term traders, spread trading and individual market specialists. Fundamental CTA's typically invest based on analysis of the core markets they are trading, by analysing weather patterns, farm yields, understanding oil drilling volumes etc. Quantitative CTA's do statistical or quantitative analysis on market price patterns and try to make predictions based on such research. Many Quantitative CTA's have backgrounds in science, mathematics, statistics and engineering. Compensation A CTA is often compensated through management fees calculated as an annual percentage of equity in the fund and incentive fees calculated as a percentage of new trading profits. Usually no incentive fees are charged if the CTA does not generate a profit exceeding a hurdle rate or high-water mark. For investors it is noteworthy to consider the impact of the risk free rate and the impact that has on hurdle rates and compensation for a particular manager. Performance CTA Performance has been challenging over the last decade and investors have debated the beneficial characteristics of a CTAs and trend followers at length. While one can argue that markets trends have been dominated by Central Banks actions thereby limiting the potential of trends to develop, one can also argue that Central Bank policy has started several trends in risky assets. Investors need to carefully judge the investment program, where past performance has not been indicative of future results but where research-oriented efforts have been a clear focus for managers trying to raise assets and outcompete other Futures managers. That said, most investors evaluate CTA based on past performance using a variety of different techniques. CTA performance data tends to freely available to qualified investors and can be found at for instance BarclayHedge, EurekaHedge, NilssonHedge and a large number of other hedge fund databases. ==History== In the United States, trading of futures contracts for agricultural commodities dates back to at least the 1850s.

The additional rules in 1983 increased the CFTC's oversight of such advisors and authorized the National Futures Association (NFA) to carry out processing of registration for entities including CTAs. Those adopted in 1995 aimed to increase disclosure by CTAs leading to increased knowledge and understanding for investors. Current regulation Under the Commodity Exchange Act, CTAs must register with and conform to the regulations of the CFTC, including providing records and reports, unless they meet the Commission's criteria for exemption. Registered CTAs must also become members of the NFA if they manage funds or provide advice to members of the public. Under the Commodity Exchange Act qualifying individuals may be exempted from CTA registration with the CFTC, including if their primary business is not as a CTA, they are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment advisor, and if they have not provided trading advice to more than 15 persons. If an individual is exempt from registration, they must still file with the NFA. A CTA is exempt from registration with the NFA if they have provided commodity trading advice to fewer than 15 people and do not generally use the title commodity trading advisor, or if they provide advice only through publications, a computerized system or seminars. Nonetheless, exempt CTAs are still regulated in some form. They are still subject to CTFC rules concerning market manipulation as well as the anti-fraud provisions of the CEA. They additionally need to file a public notice disclosing their existence and exempt status. They must provide an offering memorandum to their investors, as well as a quarterly account statement and an annual report. In addition, exempt CTAs are subject to “special call” provision, where they are, amongst other things, required to file special reports to the CFTC. These reports are used for market surveillance as well as for investigations or litigation cases. Changes following Dodd-Frank On January 26, 2011, following the 2010 enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the CFTC made additions and amendments to the regulation of CTAs, including two new forms of data collection. The CFTC also increased disclosure requirements and amended the registration criteria. Due to these changes, advisors managing funds that use swaps or other commodity interests may be defined as CTAs, subject to registration with the CFTC. The United States Chamber of Commerce and the Investment Company Institute filed a lawsuit against the CFTC, aiming to overturn this change to rules that would require the operators of mutual funds investing in commodities to be registered, but the lawsuit was unsuccessful and the rule change was upheld.Investment Company Institute v. CFTC, 891 F. Supp. 2d 162 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2012), aff'd, No. 12-5413 (June 25, 2013). Exemption from registration under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 If a commodity trading advisor engages in significant advisory activities regarding securities, it could be required to register under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act). However, most commodity trading advisors are able to rely on an exemption from registration set forth in Section 203(b)(6) of the Advisers Act. This exemption is available to registered commodity trading advisors whose business does not consist primarily of acting as an investment adviser.Lemke and Lins, Regulation of Investment Advisers, § 1:34 (Thomson West, 2013). ==References * National Futures Association * U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Category:Commodity markets Category:Financial services occupations ","title":"Commodity trading advisor"},{"id":"35934465","text":"Lophiocharon is a genus of frogfishes native to the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean. ==Species== There are currently three recognized species in this genus: * Lophiocharon hutchinsi Pietsch, 2004 (Hutchins' anglerfish) * Lophiocharon lithinostomus D.

Managed futures accounts include, but are not limited to, commodity pools. These funds are operated by commodity trading advisors (CTAs) or commodity pool operators (CPOs), who are generally regulated in the United States by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association. , the assets under management held by managed futures accounts totaled $340 billion. ==Characteristics== Managed futures accounts are operated on behalf of an individual by professional money managers such as CTAs or CPOs, trading in futures or other derivative securities. The funds can take both long and short positions in futures contracts and options on futures contracts in the global commodity, interest rate, equity, and currency markets. Trading strategies Managed futures accounts may be traded using any number of strategies, the most common of which is trend following. Trend following involves buying in markets that are trending higher and selling short in markets that are trending lower. Variations in trend following managers include duration of trend captured (short term, medium term, long term) as well as definition of trend (e.g. what is considered a new high or new low) and the money management/risk management techniques. Other strategies employed by managed futures managers include discretionary strategies, fundamental strategies, option writing, pattern recognition, and arbitrage strategies, among others. However, trend following and variations of trend following are the predominant strategy. Notional funding In many managed futures accounts the dollar amount traded is equal to the amount provided by the investor. However, managed futures also allows investors to leverage their investment with the use of notional funding, which is the difference between the amount provided by the investor (funding level) and the mutually agreed upon amount to be traded (trading level). Notional funding allows an investor to put up only a portion of the minimum investment for a managed futures account, usually 25% to 75% of the minimum. For example, to meet a $200,000 minimum for a CTA that allows 50% notional funding, an investor would only need to provide $100,000 to the CTA. The investment would be traded as if it were $200,000, which would result in double the earnings or losses, as well as double the management fee relative to the actual amount invested. As a result, notional funding can add significant risk to managed futures accounts and investors who wish to use such funding are required to sign disclosures to state that they understand the risk involved. Performance Managed Futures performance history from 1980 to 2008 Managed futures have historically displayed very low correlations to traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds. Following modern portfolio theory, this lack of correlation builds the robustness of the portfolio, reducing portfolio volatility and risk, without significant negative impacts on return. This lack of correlation stems from the fact that markets tend to \\"trend\\" the best during more volatile periods, and periods in which markets decline tend to be the most volatile. From 1980 to 2010, the compound average annual return for managed futures was 14.52%, as measured by the CASAM CISDM CTA Equal Weighted Index, while the return for U.S. stocks was 7.04% (based on the S&P; 500 total return index). However, managed futures also have high fees. According to data filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and compiled by Bloomberg, 89% of the $11.51 billion of gains in 63 managed-futures funds went to fees, commissions and expenses during the decade from Jan. 1, 2003, to Dec. 31, 2012. ==History== In the United States, trading of futures contracts for agricultural commodities dates back to at least the 1850s. In the 1920s, the federal government proposed the first regulation aimed at futures trading, and passed the Grain Futures Act in 1922. Following amendments in 1936, this law was replaced by the Commodity Exchange Act. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was established in 1974, under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act. The regulation led to the recognition of a new group of money managers including CTAs. At that time, the funds they operated became known as managed futures. In the late 1970s, the relatively new managed futures funds began to gain acceptance. Although the majority of trading was still in futures contracts for agricultural commodities, exchanges started to introduce futures contracts on other assets, including currencies and bonds. In the 1980s, the futures industry developed significantly following the introduction of non-commodity related futures and by 2004 managed futures had become a $130 billion industry. ==Regulation== Managed futures accounts are regulated by the U.S. federal government, through the CTAs and CPOs advising the funds. Most all of these entities are required to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association and follow their regulations on disclosure and reporting. The 2010 enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act led to increased regulation of the managed futures industry. On January 26, 2011, the CFTC made additions and amendments to the regulation of CPOs and CTAs, including two new forms of data collection. The CFTC also introduced regulation to require greater reporting of data and amend its registration requirements. Under the new amended registration requirement, funds that use swaps or other commodity interests may be defined as commodity pools and as such their operators must register with the CFTC, where previously they did not. On 17 April 2012, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Investment Company Institute filed a lawsuit against the CFTC, aiming to overturn this change to rules that would require the operators of mutual funds investing in commodities to be registered. == References  External links == * Commodity Futures Trading Commission web site * National Futures Association web site Category:Commodity markets Category:Investment funds ","title":"Managed futures account"},{"id":"35934483","text":"Davy Run is an unincorporated community located in Carter County, Kentucky, United States.

It was approved on March 1, 1996 and backed with initial parliamentary approval in 1997. It was enforced until 2001, when the new planning law (Ley del Suelo) required final approval from the Madrid Assembly in order to be enforced.Madrid Community Formal Approval (Spanish) Madrid Reticular Matrix Plan The Madrid Plan was indicative in nature and was a framework for decision-making in regional planning terms for the Community of Madrid (Comunidad de Madrid). Metropolitan Madrid Structural Form ==Reticular Matrix Planning methodology== The Madrid Plan used Reticular Matrix Planning methodology (Ordenacion Reticular del Territorio - ORT). Metropolitan Madrid has a natural directionality along the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain ridge. This main directionality, along with the Tagus valley, has produced a natural pattern of reticular human settlements. The Madrid Plan used this natural pattern to constitute the basic reticular board for larger transportation infrastructure. The traditional radial-orbital system of metropolitan growth was transformed into a large grid-reticular system. The metropolitan system was decomposed into five subsystems: *Environmental ('Green' infrastructure) *Transportation ('Grey' infrastructure) *Housing *Economic activities *Social facilities The last three subsystems exist within the compatible, continuous networks of the 'Green' and 'Grey' infrastructure subsystems. The metropolitan territorial system was composed of two layers of scale intervention: *The Urban layer (scale 1:5,000), which constituted the ‘fabric’ of the metropolitan system and was conformed according to an urban location model called the BUD (Balanced Urban Development - Unidad de Desarrollo Equilibrado) *The Metropolitan layer (scale 1:50,000), which constituted the ‘form’ of the metropolitan system and articulated the structure of the metropolis with regional and national functions The urban layer corresponded to the municipal authority. The metropolitan layer corresponded to the regional (Comunidad) authority. ==Effects of the plan== In the 16 years since its initial approval, the Madrid Plan has led to the following developments:Madrid Regional Parliament official publication (Spanish) *M-45 freeway (26 km): The freeway has had a strategic effect, transforming metropolitan Madrid's structure from orbital-radial to linear-reticular *MetroSur (40 km): A southwest cross-peripheral connection that was built as part of the Metro (The Madrid Plan had proposed it as a commuter train) *Barajas Airport Metro (13 km): An extension of the Metro, connecting it to Barajas Airport *Metro train to Arganda (16 km) and the future airport of Campo Real *Strategic Approval of Campo Real Airport: Expected in operation in 2030s *R-5 freeway (14 km): from Vía Lusitana to Mostoles *R-3 freeway (25 km): from O’Donnell to Campo Real *‘Reservoir road’ (Carretera de los pantanos) M-501 by Boadilla and Brunete *M-100 by Cobeña and Ajalvir *Several ‘Balanced Urban Development units’ (BUD's): up 300,000 housing units in all, with priority given to those with mass public transport potentialities or possibilities of commuter train extension: Meco, Torrejón de Ardoz, Arroyomolinos, Navalcarnero, Getafe, Pinto, Valdemoro, Humanes, Griñón *BUD's and PAU's (Plan de Actuacion Urbanistica) of southeast Madrid: Previously proposed in 1989 and advanced in the Master Plan Draft of 1991 by Mayor Agustín Rodríguez Sahagún *Carpetania productive areas near Getafe's future freight airport as well as the ones in Meco, Parla, and San Fernando- Torrejón *Logistics City of the Campo Real plateau *Metropolitan facilities such as the Warner Brothers Theme Park and Arroyomolinos winter sports complex and shopping center *National and international facilities such as extension of the Castellana project and Olympic facilities located in Valdecarros, East Centrality and Campamento All of these projects originated in the reference framework of the Madrid Plan and are consistent in their approach to building up the structure of metropolitan Madrid. Projects in waiting The following projects were also introduced by the Madrid Plan: *Campo Real Airport *An underground commuter train line between Mostoles and Henares ==Global applications== The plan's technique has influenced other planning processes, among which Bogota's and Dar es Salaam's can be highlighted.

It was the home of the Barons of Belmont. ==History== Belmont Castle was built in the 10th or 11th century for the Freiherr von Belmont. The first recorded member of the family was Lutefridus de Belmonte in 1137/39. The Belmont family was related to a number of other Raetian noble families including the powerful von Vaz. By the 13th century they were one of the most powerful families in Graubünden. They owned castles and villages throughout the region. Konrad von Belmont was the Bishop of Chur from 1273 until 1282. In 1267 Heinrich von Belmont was the first student from Raetia to study at University of Bologna. By 1200 the Belmonts appear to have moved to another castle near Castrisch and then to Tuma Casti by Domat/Ems, probably leaving a bailiff or vogt at Belmont. In 1352 Ulrich Walter von Belmont led a successful uprising against the Counts of Werdenberg-Heiligenberg. Together with the armies of the Montalt and the Rhäzüns families they defeated a Werdenberg-Heiligenberg army at Mundaun near Ilanz. In retaliation, soon thereafter, a Werdenberg army burned Ilanz to the ground. It is unknown whether Belmont Castle was also attacked and destroyed or was bypassed, but by the late 14th century it had fallen into ruins. On 11 July 1371 Ulrich Walter von Belmont died childless and the Belmont lands were inherited by the Montalt and Sax-Misox families. In 1380 the Sax-Misox family traded the ruins of Belmont Castle as well as other lands to Brun von Rhäzüns. After the trade the castle remained abandoned and continued to disintegrate. From 1932 through 1936 the ruins were excavated and repaired. ==Castle site== Floor plan of Belmont Castle The castle was built near the, now abandoned and vanished, Walser village of Fidaz near Flims. It was built on a rocky spire with sheer cliffs on the north and east sides. Very little is known about the construction history and layout of the castle. However, there were two semi-circular ring wall that wrapped around the east, north and north-west sides of the peak with the inner one built first followed by the outer later. The walls connected at least three buildings. The central and eastern building were probably residences. In the center of the half- circle is a deep cistern. On the southern side of the castle is a smaller rocky peak that stands about above the castle and has a flat top that is about . No stone ruins have been found on the small peak, so it was probably topped with one or more wooden buildings. A stone wall which was probably part of the outer fortifications is still visible at the foot of the spire. ==Gallery== Belmont Aufgang.jpgStone wall below Belmont Castle Belmont Wohntrakt.jpgResidential building Belmont Felskopf.jpgUpper peak Belmont Aufstieg.jpgLadder to the upper peak Belmont Wandnische.jpgSmall niche in a wall in the residential building Belmont und Hohentrins.jpgView of the Belmont Castle site ==See also== * List of castles in Switzerland ==References Category:Castles in Graubünden Category:Ruined castles in Switzerland ","title":"Belmont Castle, Graubünden"},{"id":"35934587","text":"This list is of Major Sites Protected for their Historical and Cultural Value at the National Level in Shandong Province, China. 78px72px } ==See also== * Major historical and cultural sites protected by Shandong Province * Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China ==References== Shandong ","title":"List of Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Shandong"},{"id":"35934594","text":"Marvin Bam (born 12 September 1977) is a South African field hockey player who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:South African male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of South Africa Category:2002 Men's Hockey World Cup players Category:2006 Men's Hockey World Cup players Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2002 Commonwealth Games Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for South Africa ","title":"Marvin Bam"},{"id":"35934605","text":"Fairview Heights is an unincorporated community in Wood County, West Virginia. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia Category:Unincorporated communities in Wood County, West Virginia ","title":"Fairview Heights, West Virginia"},{"id":"35934616","text":"Geoffrey Abbott (born 17 April 1985) is a South African field hockey player who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:South African male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of South Africa Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics ","title":"Geoffrey Abbott"},{"id":"35934623","text":"Fairway Acres is an unincorporated community in Wood County, West Virginia, USA. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia Category:Unincorporated communities in Wood County, West Virginia ","title":"Fairway Acres, West Virginia"},{"id":"35934624","text":"Hurricane Bud was a rare May major hurricane that skirted areas of the western Mexican coast. The second tropical cyclone and named storm of the 2012 Pacific hurricane season, Bud developed slowly into a tropical depression from a low- pressure area, centered well south of Mexico on May 20\\\\. It moved generally west-northwestward and by the following day, strengthened into Tropical Storm Bud. Thereafter, further intensification was slow. By late on May 23, Bud reached winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). On the following day, however, rapid deepening commenced, with the storm becoming a hurricane on that day. Bud peaked as a 115 mph (185 km/h) Category 3 hurricane on May 25\\\\. Several hours after reaching that intensity, the storm began to quickly weaken as it moved near Western Mexico. Bud continued to weaken, eventually dissipating the next day. Due to Hurricane Bud's rapid weakening offshore of Mexico, effects were mostly minimal. However, the hurricane still produced heavy rainfall and waves of up to in Melaque. Beach damage resulted from the rough seas. Strong gusts also uprooted trees across the coast, and rainfall washed out some roads. No deaths were associated with the hurricane's impacts. ==Meteorological history== The precursor to Hurricane Bud exited the West Africa coast on May 5 as a tropical wave. The wave slowly intensified as it moved towards the west as an area of thunderstorms, producing showers of the Windward Islands. On May 12, a low pressure system formed from the tropical wave just south of eastern Panama. Under favorable conditions, it slowly began to organize while east of Tropical Storm Aletta, and after a burst in convection on May 15, the National Hurricane Center began monitoring the system. By early on May 18, the system became nearly stationary while just offshore of Mexico. After wind shear caused it to become less organized later that day, the system began showing signs of development starting on May 19\\\\. Although it was re-organizing, the system initially lacked a well-defined surface circulation. On May 20, the system started to rapidly organize while tracking slowly west-northwestward. Later that day, the National Hurricane Center noted that \\"conditions appear favorable for a tropical depression to form tonight or Monday.\\" It is estimated that Tropical Depression Two-E developed at 1800 UTC on May 20, while located about south of Acapulco, Guerrero. Although geostationary and microwave satellite imagery indicated moderate easterly wind shear, the National Hurricane Center predicted quick intensification into a hurricane. As the depression slightly accelerated to the west, the storm continued to organize, eventually intensifying into Tropical Storm Bud on May 22, with 40 mph (65 km/h) sustained winds. Bud remained at this intensity for one day before strengthening, starting early on May 23, and reached winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) during the afternoon. By the morning of May 24, Bud continued its rapid intensification, reaching sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h), and then 110 mph (175 km/h) by the afternoon, as the system turned northward. Later on the same day, Bud turned to the northeast, and began to approach the coast of Western Mexico. Late on May 24, Bud intensified further into a Category 3 Major Hurricane, and obtained a peak intensity of 115 mph winds (185 km/h), with a minimum central low pressure of 960 mbars. Hurricane Bud was able to maintain Category 3 intensity for the next several hours, even when its outer rainbands began moving onshore in Western Mexico. Very early on May 25, Hurricane Bud weakened into a strong Category 2 hurricane. Hurricane Bud rapidly began to weaken, as it slowly moved onshore. Bud quickly lost most of its convection, which was sheared mainly to the north. During the mid- afternoon of May 25, Bud weakened down to a strong tropical storm, as it began making landfall on Western Mexico. Further weakening ensued over the next 24 hours, and Bud degenerated into a remnant low early on May 26. Late on May 26, the remnant low of Hurricane Bud dissipated completely. ==Preparations and impact== Hurricane Bud approaching Western Mexico on May 25 By early on May 24, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Punta San Telmo to La Fortuna. Later that day, the watch was replaced by a warning and extended to Cabo Corrientes, while a hurricane watch was issued for the same area. By 2100 UTC on May 24, the existing portions of the warnings between Cabo Corrientes and Manzanillo were upgraded to a hurricane warning, and another tropical storm watch was issued northward to San Blas. In the event of evacuations, 11 schools in Colima and Jalisco were closed. The port of Manzanillo closed due to the threat of rains. Officials in Puerto Vallarta temporarily banned swimming in the ocean. Hundreds of heavy vehicles were prepared in Jalisco to move debris. Authorities opened a total of 898 shelters in Guerrero and around 200 shelters in Colima. Prior to Bud's rapid dissipation offshore, the storm produced heavy rainfall and waves of in Melaque, a town in western Jalisco. To prevent overflowing, government officials opened a full lagoon in Melague. Wind gusts reached in Manzanillo, strong enough to knock down trees. The storm washed out roads in Mazanillo, but no rivers overflowed. Further north, there was moderate beach damage. Overall. damage from Bud was minimal. ==References *Hurricane Bud Advisory Archive Bud Bud Bud Bud ","title":"Hurricane Bud (2012)"},{"id":"35934639","text":"Thornton McDade (born 28 October 1980) is a South African field hockey player who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics. and the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Britton believed the main entrance porch, consisting of a semicircular arch, with Norman-style cable mouldings, to be of ancient date, brought from some neighbouring church, or even Plympton Castle. Due to subsequent alterations the building is difficult to date accurately and Pevsner states it to be \\"irritating for the historian\\" as it incorporates a multitude of imported period features and materials, giving it \\"a superficially convincing instant patina\\". The house was described by Polwhele in the 18th century as \\"ruinous\\". In about 1800 the whole range east of the entrance porch was demolished, and by 1980 only the walls were standing. In 1986 the restoration of the building began on completion of which it has been used as a hotel. The great hall The double- height great hall survives largely intact and is situated to the left from the now lost screens passage on entering the porch. Two double-height windows are situated on the south side of the Hall, whilst on the north side is the large granite fireplace, on the lintel of which is carved the arms of Parker, and above which on the chimney breast is a very large ornamental plaster depiction of the royal coat of arms of King Charles I (1625–1649), dated to 1640. On either side of the arms is a larger than lifesize female figure, to the viewer's left, Peace, and to the right the figure of Plenty, holding a cornucopia. Many of the door-frames are of granite, yet are not in their original positions, for example that now forming the entrance to the great hall from the screens passage, which has been removed, was formerly in the south-east room, where it had been used as a fireplace.Pevsner, p.190 The ornate plaster ceiling of the great hall is said by Pevsner to be a modern pastiche, albeit well-executed. At each end of the hall is a gallery. Boringdon Arch, a Roman-style triumphal arch designed by Robert Adam, was built in 1783 on the way connecting Boringdon Hall to Saltram House owned by the same family. It is located about 1 mile west of Boringdon Hall at the entrance to Boringdon Park Golf Club in Plymbridge Road. It is grade II listed, and was offered for sale in 2014, but no buyers were found. It is in a state of disrepair, and is on the English Heritage at Risk Register. ==History== In about 956 the Saxon King Edgar (959-75) granted the royal manors of Boringdon and Wembury to Plympton Priory of St Peter. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries King Henry VIII granted Boringdon to Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton. In 1549 Wriothesley sold the manor to Richard Mayhew (or \\"Mayhowe\\" etc.), gentleman, of Tavistock, Devon. In 1582 Richard Mayhew's granddaughter Frances Mayhew, daughter and heiress of Jeronemy Mayhew, became the wife of John Parker (1563–1610) of North Molton in North Devon.Genealogical details of Parker family from National Trust guidebook \\"Saltram, Devon\\", 2005, p.65 Arms of Parker Boringdon remained in the ownership of the Parker family, later Barons Boringdon and Earls of Morley, until the 20th century. John Parker and his wife the Mayhew heiress completed their re-modelling of the house in 1587. The family expanded the nearby village of Colebrooke to house their estate workers. During the Civil War the Parkers remained loyal to the King, and Cromwell's soldiers demolished the whole part of the house to the east of the entrance porch and screens passage, rebuilt in the 20th century. It is possible that this is the house in which Charles I himself stayed on 11 November 1642, when he is recorded as 'being at Colebrook'.The two houses Petition for Treaty presented to the king at Colebrook, Nov. 11. 1642. In 1712 the Parkers acquired the nearby manor of Saltram on which they built Saltram House, described by Pevsner as \\"the most impressive house in Devon\\", which became their principal residence. Boringdon thus began its period of decline, and was serving as a farm-house in the 1920s, although still owned by the Parker family. In 1951 the Parkers incurred a heavy liability to death duties following the death of Edmund Robert Parker, 4th Earl of Morley (1877–1951) and in 1957 gifted Saltram with all its contents and 291 acres, apparently together with Boringdon, to the National Trust in lieu of tax. The National Trust however did not retain Boringdon for long and sold it to Paul Chapman who converted it to a hotel. It suffered a major fire in March 1989. In January 2011 the property was offered for sale for £3 million. It consisted of a 41 bedroom hotel, with 4 banqueting suites and 7 acres of land. It was bought by the Nettleton Collection of hotels. As of 2016 it was the leading hotel in the area with a spa - Gaia spa due for completion in July 2016. ==ReferencesSources== *Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 1991, Boringdon, pp. 189–90 *Britton, John.

The design, completed in May 2011, brings new life to New York residential architecture, and transforms the idea of traditional apartment living. ==History== The idea for the Shutter House came to life while much of Manhattan experienced changes in urban development. The design began as a simple two-story renovation project, in 2005, when a well-known gallery owner Klemens Gasser contacted Shigeru Ban.“Metal Shutter Houses”, Naomi R. Pollock, http://archrecord.construction.com/projects/building_types_study/multi-family- housing/2011/metal-shutter-houses.asp The rezoning of West Chelsea and the Meatpacking District, as a result of the High Line development was the major urban development change to influence the Shutter House design. The High Line previously existed as an elevated industrial railroad, but after much debate, was repurposed as a public park.“Neighborhood Info” http://www.thehighline.org/about/neighborhood-info In 1999, a non-profit group known as The Friends of the High Line formed when threats of demolition loomed over the railroad remnant. Today, Friends of the High Line along with the city of New York work together to preserve the structure as a park.“High Line History”. Rezoning of Chelsea and the Meatpacking District greatly influenced the Shutter House with an art-infused neighborhood. The Special West Chelsea District was created in co-ordinance with rezoning plans, designated to encourage significant economic and residential growth.“West Chelsea Zoning Proposal” http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/westchelsea/westchelsea1.shtml Ban was commissioned by his client the same year in which the rezoning of West Chelsea took place. The rezoning of West Chelsea created great incentives for residential development. These new opportunities influenced Ban and his client to scrap the renovation plans and instead opt for a total rebuild. Although scheduled for completion in 2008, construction was not completed until May 2011. ==Architect== Architect Shigeru Ban (born in Tokyo, Japan, 1957) is known for creating architecture that gives back to society. Ban studied at the Southern California Institute of Architecture, as well as the Cooper Union School of Architecture, in New York City. He received his Bachelor of Architecture degree from Cooper Union in 1984. He owns and operates his own practice, Shigeru Ban Architects, run out of Tokyo, Japan. Ban also has offices in both Europe and the United States.“Profile—Shigeru Ban”.http://www.shigerubanarchitects.com/SBA_PROFILE/SBA_profile_biographies.html Ban is an international architect, having worked on a variety of projects including museums, houses, and shelters. He is very well known for being an innovative designer of temporary housing, needed because of natural and manmade disasters.Voluntary Architects Network: Making Architecture, Nurturing People: From Rwanda to Haiti. Ban, Shigeru. Tokyo, Japan. INAX Publishing, 2010. (page 5). His temporary housing designs are typically low budget and easy to assemble by individuals without skills in building trades. Ban is also well known for his use of unconventional building materials, such as paper tubes and cardboard, which can be configured into structurally sound “log” members.“Shigeru Ban on Designing Shelters for the Quake Victims”. Lasky, Julie. New York Times. March 23, 2011. https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/garden/24qna.html?_r=1&ref;=shigeruban He often campaigns to raise money for the creation and construction of these temporary homes through organizations like Make It Right Foundation New Orleans, founded by Brad Pitt.“Make It Right”. Voluntary Architects Network: Making Architecture, Nurturing People: From Rwanda to Haiti. Ban, Shigeru. Tokyo, Japan. INAX Publishing, 2010. (page 136). From 2006 to 2009, he was a member for the jury of the Pritzker Architecture Prize. Some of his best-known works include the Japanese Pavilion (2000, Hanover Expo in Germany), Paper Arch (2000, Museum of Modern Art, New York), and the Naked House (2000, Saitama, Japan).“Works” http://www.shigerubanarchitects.com/SBA_PROFILE/SBA_profile_biographies.html In addition to being an innovative practicing architect, Ban has taught at many prestigious academic institutions. Among these institutions are Columbia University in New York City, Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and Kyoto University of Art and Design. Shigeru Ban brings his interest in reducing material waste, as well as exploring innovative and ecological material relationships to his teaching. ==Building== Site and Context Shigeru Ban's Shutter House has a unique story because of the site and context of Manhattan's West Chelsea neighborhood. West Chelsea is primarily a low-rise neighborhood, with a mixture of old industrial style buildings juxtaposed with edgy new development. The neighborhood is known for its industrial past, and thriving art gallery district. The Shutter House is located on a narrow lot on West 19th Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues. It is sandwiched between Frank Gehry's IAC building to the west, and the Annabelle Serdof apartments to the east.“Metal Shutter Houses; Shigeru Ban” Pollock, Naomi R. Architectural Record. http://archrecord.construction.com/projects/building_types_study/multi-family- housing/2011/metal-shutter-houses.asp. September 2011. What began as a simple renovation turned into a larger project for a new building, as a result of the re-zoning proposal of West Chelsea and the High Line development. When the High Line was repurposed as a park, much of West Chelsea and the Meatpacking District were re-zoned to create the Special West Chelsea District.“West Chelsea Zoning Proposal: Introduction”. http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/westchelsea/westchelsea1.shtml This new district was created in hopes to encourage significant economic and residential growth. The re-zoning was proposed in 2005, the same year Shigeru Ban was commissioned by art gallery owner, Klemens Gasser, for the project. Community District 4 was re-zoned, from West 30th Street to West 16th Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues. The re-zoning and creation of the Special West Chelsea District encouraged architects to design buildings that engaged and interacted with the new linear High Line pedestrian park. Adjacent developments to the High Line benefited from the creation of the High Line Transfer Corridor, or HLTC, which is intended to preserve light and air around the High Line.“West Chelsea Zoning Proposal: Proposal”. http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/westchelsea/westchelsea3b.shtml The HLTC transfers development rights from the air space around the High Line to designated receiving properties within the Special West Chelsea District. This program allowed developers of selected sites to increase the floor area ratio, or FAR. The Shutter House directly benefited from this program, which influenced the client and architect to rebuild, rather than renovate on the site. The Shutter House is located in an area that was re-zoned to a C6-2 zoning, which increased the floor area ratio from 5.0 to a floor area ratio of 6.0.“West Chelsea Zoning Proposal: Proposal”. http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/westchelsea/westchelsea3a.shtml This FAR bonus was instrumental in the overall design of the Shutter House, because without it, the project would not exist as it does today. Form and Use In plan and massing, the Shutter House addresses the challenges of building on a Manhattan city block. It sits tight on a building lot nestled between a large office building on one side, and apartment building on the other. The lot, a mere 50 feet wide, and 92 feet deep, faces north and south. These tight lot dimensions, strict building regulations (including prohibition of lot line windows), and high property values inspired Ban not only to fill the lot footprint, but also to stack modular units vertically. This desire to build vertically was influenced also by the High Line Transfer Corridor program, as a result of the re-zoning of West Chelsea and the High Line development. Together these two programs allocated bonus FAR to the site of the Shutter House, allowing for increased vertical expansion. The building, eleven stories tall, is made up of eight duplex units, each with a double height living space. This living space is designed to make up for the shallow depth of the apartments, and to draw significant amounts of daylight into the space as a result of the tall glazing. The division into three bays in the vertical direction results in a variety of apartment layouts and provides each unit with street views and balconies enclosed on three sides. The duplex units range from three to four bedroom apartments, or in the case of the penthouse, a five-bedroom apartment. In each apartment, public spaces occupy the lower level, while private bedrooms and bathrooms are on the second level. The design of the building also takes advantage of both northern and southern exposure, enhanced by the retractable perforated metal screens, and the glass garage-like doors that physically and visually open the apartments to the city. In addition to the eight apartment units, the building also includes a ground floor gallery retail space, and lobby.“The Metal Shutter House”. Archicentral. http://www.archicentral.com/the-metal-shutter-house-new-york- usa-shigeru-ban-6020/. February 2009. The inclusion of the retail gallery space is in accordance with the Special West Chelsea District program, which intends to distribute art galleries throughout West Chelsea, as opposed to confining them to the neighborhood center. Materials and Methods of Construction The careful consideration and calibration of construction at the Shutter House maximized interior space on the limiting narrow lot. As mentioned above, each duplex unit was designed to include mezzanine levels, to maximize light penetration in the apartment. Shigeru Ban was also able to design 8-inch deep floor slabs, the minimal thickness required, in order to achieve the desired double-height space in each apartment. The minimized slabs also allowed Ban to slice the vertical volumes to get an even number of units stacked upon one another. The Shutter House gets its name from the metal screens, or “shutters”, incorporated into each unit, controlled by the tenant. Typically, similar elements were used throughout West Chelsea, for industrial warehouses. Ban's Shutter House is the first instance where these screens are appropriated for domestic architecture. Contrary to intuitive site response, the perforated metal roll-up screens were installed on the north façade. The screens, in addition to allowing daylight into each apartment, also serve as a security feature providing privacy in an otherwise transparent space.“Metal Shutter House”. http://www.shigerubanarchitects.com/SBA_WORKS/SBA_HOUSES/SBA_HOUSES_41/SBA_HOUSES_41.html The screens, which are controlled by a motorized roller, are made of standard components. Each screen is 16 feet by 20 feet with a unique perforated pattern that complies with city regulations for facades enclosing habitable space. In addition to using perforated metal screens as a façade system, Ban designed the glass façade behind them as a curtain wall system. The curtain wall incorporates glass bi-fold doors, supporting Ban's design to open each apartment to the surrounding city context. The windows of the curtain wall do not contain metal panes, as is typical for this type of system; but rather they incorporate double-glazed sashes and a hinge in the center. This assembly is controlled by a motorized component which forces the glass doors to open in a manner similar to that of a garage door. On the interior, simplicity defines the architectural features. Translucent sliding doors allow for flexible space. The doors can be opened to create large public spaces, or closed to create smaller private spaces. The sliding partitions pay homage to Ban's Japanese residential design. In the main public spaces, large panels conceal mechanical and plumbing elements.“Metal Shutter Houses; Shigeru Ban”. Pollock, Naomi R. Architectural Record. http://archrecord.construction.com/projects/building_types_study/multi-family- housing/2011/metal-shutter-houses.asp. September 2011. Sustainability Although the Shutter House is not a LEED certified building, many sustainable features are incorporated into the design. The most sustainable element is manifested in the architect's design thesis of opening traditional Manhattan living space to the surrounding city. The perforated metal shutters, controlled by the tenant to allow or block daylight in each double height space, along with the glass garage-like bifold doors, are designated green features. The bifold doors, located on the southern façade, not only open the apartment to surrounding views, but also blur the boundary between interior and exterior to allow for natural air ventilation. Open facades on both the north and south sides of the Shutter House allow for daylight to be maximized in each apartment. The architectural and mechanical process of opening up to or closing off from fluctuating environmental conditions results in energy efficiency for each apartment.“Shigeru Ban’s Efficient, Metal Shutter Houses”. Michler, Adam. Inhabitat. http://inhabitat.com/metal-shutter-houses-glimpse- of-the-future-and-ode-to-the-past/. 29 July 2010. Another sustainable feature of the Shutter House is the building envelope. Each apartment has a partially enclosed terrace, separated from the living space by the perforated metal screens. Behind the retractable screens is an integrated curtain wall system. The curtain wall shields the apartment dwellers from unwanted elements like rainwater, drafts, and noise. ==Significance== The Shutter House, through its innovation and its relationship to context, completely transformed the physical reality of high-end residential architecture on a typical New York City building lot. Although the project was originally intended to be a renovation, Shigeru Ban's architectural design turned into a new construction project because of strong connections to the Chelsea neighborhood, as a result of the High Line development, and the rezoning project that commenced in 2005.“West Chelsea Zoning Proposal: Introduction”. Architect Shigeru Ban challenges the idea of a typical New York apartment, and reconfigures it to reflect the growing surrounding city. Apartments are opened up to the immediate neighborhood, both physically and symbolically, through the implementation of a curtain wall system, and the perforated metal screens from which the Shutter House gets its name. In addition to revitalizing residential architecture in lower Manhattan, the Shutter House also helped to strengthen a thriving art community by incorporating a gallery on the first floor. In conclusion, the Shutter House sets a precedent for architecture as it relates to natural and urban environments, as the architect challenges conventional residential design in an expanding and flourishing post-industrial neighborhood in Lower Manhattan. == References == Category:Apartment buildings in New York City Category:Chelsea, Manhattan Category:Residential buildings completed in 2011 Category:2011 establishments in New York City ","title":"Shutter House"},{"id":"35934650","text":"Worthington Meadows is an unincorporated community in Wood County, West Virginia. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia Category:Unincorporated communities in Wood County, West Virginia ","title":"Worthington Meadows, West Virginia"},{"id":"35934660","text":"Lungile Tsolekile (born 19 April 1984) is a South African field hockey player who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:South African male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of South Africa Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2006 Commonwealth Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2014 Commonwealth Games Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for South Africa ","title":"Lungile Tsolekile"},{"id":"35934670","text":"Thomas \\"Tom\\" Hammond (born 18 September 1984) is a South African field hockey player who plays for the South African national team.

It was built in 1907 for Sephardic Jewish tobacco baron Morris Schinasi. The mansion was designed by Carnegie Hall architect William Tuthill and reportedly retains almost all of its historic detail, including a Prohibition-era trap door that once extended all the way to the river. The structure was designated a New York City Landmark on March 19, 1974 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 1980. It has been cited as being the last remaining detached single-family house in Manhattan. Since 2013, it is owned by Mark Schwartz, a Goldman Sachs executive, who purchased it for $14 million. ==History== Completed in 1909 at the northeast corner of West 107th Street and Riverside Drive, the three-story, 12,000 square foot mansion was designed in neo-French-Renaissance style by William Tuthill.,\\"Schinasi Residence.\\" Landmarks Preservation Commission 19 (1974).

Morris Schinasi, an Ottoman-Jewish immigrant who made his millions on cigarettes, commissioned the design and owned the thirty-five- room mansion until his death in 1928. After that the mansion changed hands several times until 1979 when Hans Smit, a Columbia University Law Professor, bought it and commissioned an extensive interior restoration.Gray, Christopher. \\"Schinasi: A Manor from Turkish Tobacco.\\" New York Times 4 May 1997. Print. It was designated a New York City landmark on March 19, 1974. The mansion is one of a kind, with rich details in every niche of the building. Pineapple motifs, seen as a symbol of hospitality, are repeated throughout the ornamentation and there was originally a tunnel, now closed up, that led under ground to the Hudson River. Until 2013 it was inhabited by Hans Smit's son, Robert Smit, his two daughters, Jessie and Marley, and his son, Lennon. On March 19, 1974 the Schinasi mansion was designated a New York City landmark. The Landmarks Preservation Commission found that this residence had “special character, special historical and aesthetic interest, and value as part of the development, heritage, and cultural characteristics of New York City.” Morris Schinasi who commissioned this mansion in 1909 was an Ottoman Jewish immigrant who came to the United States in 1890. He came from a family with little money and borrowed $25,000 (in US) from a friend to get to the United States. With him he brought a machine that would change his fortune – a cigarette-rolling machine he designed and presented at the Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893. Until this point, every single cigarette had been hand rolled and therefore this novel device created a lot of interest. Soon after, his brother joined him in New York City and they established the Schinasi Brothers Company, which featured their brand “Egyptian Prettiest” cigarettes rolled with Turkish tobacco. The product became very popular and the brothers built their commercial empire from the ground up. After Schinasi had made his fortune, and met his wife in 1903, he decided to build the mansion on Riverside Drive. At the time most mansions were being built along Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue, but it was predicted that patrons commissioning mansions would get tired of the hustle and bustle of the busy East Side and retreat to building their extravagant homes along the quieter Riverside Drive. As this prediction never came to fruition, the Schinasi mansion remains the largest single-family residence along Riverside Drive. Schinasi selected William Tuthill as the architect for the mansion, but the relationship was not a pleasant one. Tuthill later sued Schinasi for a sum of $5655.65. Schinasi lived at the mansion with his wife, Laurette, and three daughters, Victoria, Juliette, and Altina for almost twenty years. In 1928 Schinasi died at the age of seventy-one, and two years later his heirs sold the house to Semple Realty Corporation for $200,000. Since 1930, the mansion has seen many different visitors and uses, beginning as a Semple School for Girls that served as a finishing school for well to-do young ladies. It is said that in 1956 Mrs. Semple herself actually died in one of the mansion's thirty-five rooms. Columbia University was the next to purchase the building in 1960 and turned it into a daycare center known as “The Children’s Mansion”. In 1970-1971, the mansion housed a Columbia / Barnard coed residential program called the \\"Experimental College\\". Photographer Timothy Greenfield-Sanders was one of 45 residents. Columbia sold the mansion in 1979 to Columbia law professor Hans Smit and his wife for $325,000. At this time he initiated an interior restoration that took twenty years to complete. During Smit's ownership, he never actually lived in the building, yet his brother's family did for several years during this time period. Smit also used the mansion for Columbia Law School gatherings and small parties. After Smit completed the restoration in 2006 he attempted to sell with an initial asking price of $31 million. Since then the mansion has made a handful of appearances on the real estate market. It was listed at $15 million in the fall of 2011. It is unconfirmed whether the mansion was sold at that time. Mark Schwartz, a vice chairman at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, bought the Schinasi House at 351 Riverside Drive in 2013. == Building ==  Site and context  The Schinasi mansion sits on the west side of Manhattan in the Upper West Side neighborhood at Riverside Drive and West 107th Street, directly across from Riverside Park. When the mansion was built in the early 1900s there was limited development along Riverside Drive and Park, but the thought was that more mansions would be erected within the near future. Although there are a handful of single- family mansions along Riverside Drive, the prediction for this kind of development never reached its full potential. The largest single-family residence along Riverside Drive at the time was the Charles Schwab mansion \\"Riverside\\" - 85 rooms and occupying a full block. It was later demolished, and thus the Schinasi mansion is now the largest single-family residence there. The surrounding neighborhood is full of residential townhouses and apartment buildings and a few blocks northeast sits Columbia University with its main campus at West 116th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenues. The small historic district, Riverside Drive – West 105th Street, sits just a block south and is made up of rowhouses and townhouses built between 1889 and 1902. There are also the Baumgarten House (1901) and the Master Apartments (1929) in the neighborhood both receiving landmark status, such as the mansion. A unique characteristic of the mansion is that it is completely offset from all four sides, making it detached from all neighboring buildings. The building measures approximately 41 feet by 73 feet, taking up two typical New York City lots (usually 25 feet by 100 feet). Being completely detached allows the mansion to take advantage of treating all four sides of the building and also to create spaces such as a typical English basement. All four facades of the building were treated slightly differently. The front façade faces West, towards Riverside Park, containing the main door that is flush with the exterior. The longer façade is along West 107th street containing end sections and a recessed center. The North section, which faces the neighboring building on Riverside Drive, curiously contains the most elaborate treatment. Finally the back façade, or East side, contains a three- sided copper oriel at the second level. Form and use The form of the Schinasi mansion makes it unique in Manhattan. Since it is detached from any neighboring building, it is completely freestanding and thus, currently, the only such privately owned single-family residence in Manhattan. This huge building, a total of 12,000 square feet, contains entertainment and service rooms in the basement and first floor including a gym, servants quarters, dining room, gallery, waiting area, and two parlor rooms. The second and third levels contain the many bedrooms and bathrooms, along with sitting areas and kitchens as well. Finally on the top floor there is a studio apartment. In total there are twelve bedrooms, eight bathrooms, and five kitchens. When built there was a tunnel connecting the English basement of the mansion underground Riverside Drive to the banks of the Hudson River. However this route has since been since sealed off. The Schinasi mansion was used originally as a single family home. That was the case during the twenty or so years that Schinasi and his immediate family lived there. However, after his death Schinasi's heirs sold the mansion and from then on it never saw the same use. Its use has ranged from a private girls finishing school to a daycare center to a location for law students gatherings. It has also been used as the home to June, the wife of a late conman, who rents the studio apartment to the fictional character Neal Caffrey in the popular USA Network show White Collar. The house is also used as a setting on the popular Hulu show The Mindy Project as 'The Bleecker Friends Quaker School for Toddlers' for Mindy's son, first seen in S4. Materials and methods of construction The Schinasi mansion is made of various carved materials, on the interior there is a mix of Egyptian carved marble, hand carved wood, and hand painted frescos. Within the wood are intricately carved symbols and décor, and the pineapple, a symbol of hospitality, is repeated throughout all carvings. The exterior is built completely of white Vermont marble, structurally and aesthetically. The roof is a mansard terra cotta and green tile with steel girders and copper cornices. The construction manager of the mansion, Charles T. Willis, predicted the house would cost $180,000 to build, and he was right. The mansion completed construction one year after it began in 1909. == See also == * National Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan from 59th to 110th Streets * List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 59th to 110th Streets ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Manhattan Category:Houses completed in 1907 Category:Houses in Manhattan Category:New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan Category:Upper West Side ","title":"Schinasi Mansion"},{"id":"35934681","text":"Sperone Westwater is a contemporary art gallery in the Bowery, in Manhattan, in New York City.

Initially, the building was intended to serve as the venue for water polo events during the 2012 Summer Olympics, but when the city's bid was lost to London, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation proceeded to build the pool anyway. The result is an innovative building with 130-foot-high twin masts and a swooping roof form. The masts are an architectural feature extending up into the Queens skyline as well as the structural supports for the cable-stayed roof. This design provides the clear spans necessary to house an Olympic swimming pool along with an ice skating rink.

Handelarchitects.com. Handel Architects. Retrieved February 14, 2012. The World's Fair was a universal exposition showcasing various cultural exhibitions from all over the world. World's fairs have become historic markers exemplifying commercial and industrial successes of various eras. The organizers of the 1939 World's Fair boasted it was “the greatest exhibition ever held.” They referred to its vast size, the attractive symbolism of the Trylon and Perisphere, and most all for imagining a future after a decade of economic depression. Known as the Corona dumps, Robert Moses headed its transformation into a new park, for the borough of Queens; and the construction of the fair. The theme of the 1939 World's Fair was: “Building the World of Tomorrow.” The fair was to symbolize the world's faith in new technology and unity amongst cultures. Through the various showcases from different countries, citizens around the world were given a chance to learn about countries that they have only heard of in books and movies. From innovative edible products such as instant coffee, to machines that washed dishes automatically, this fair introduced its visitors to a plethora of technological advancements and new consumer products. The magical and futuristic land also housed new buildings, including the iconic General Motors’ Futurama and Democracity, the core exhibit within the Perisphere. Twenty-five years later, the Flushing Meadows Park was selected, again to be the site of the 1964 World's Fair. Americans had a fascination with space and “the new frontier.” The themes of the 1964 World's Fair were: “A Millennium of Progress” and “Man’s Achievements in an Expanding Universe.” Space-oriented pavilions such as the New York Pavilion, which housed an observation platform, symbolized the growing infatuation with the Space Age. Role in park revival The New York State Pavilion, designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, is one of the few structures still standing in Flushing Meadows Park. The oval roof, suspended and cable-hung, was the largest in the world. The pavilion was praised for its suspended roof and two towers that stood as the tallest structures of the fair. This large tent-like structure may have been an influence on the current Flushing Meadows Natatorium. Today, all these structures are either demolished or left in an uninhabitable, dilapidated state. Envisioned in 1999 by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Borough President Claire Shulman to revive the park, the original concept of a moderately sized pool was enlarged to an Olympic-size pool with an indoor ice rink as well. The building's foundation was completed in 2001 but after the September 11 attacks the project was halted due to funding issues. Finally, in 2003, the Natatorium was designated as the swimming arena in New York City's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics.\\"Flushing Meadows Corona Park Aquatic Center Opens\\". The Daily Plant: New York City Department of Parks & Recreation. February 20, 2012. The Parks Department partnered with the Economic Development Corporation and plans re-commenced for New York City to build its first public indoor swimming pool in 40 years. Upon its completion in February 2008, the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Natatorium and Ice Rink became the largest recreation complex ever built in a city park at 110,000 square feet. ==Description== Location The Flushing Meadows Natatorium is sited along the northeast perimeter of Flushing Meadows Corona Park, juxtaposed between the Van Wyck Expressway and the 1250-acre park greenery. The building mediates an urban environment to the north, which consist of major streets and highways, with the park on its western facade. Interior design Main plaza of the Natatorium that leads to lobby within. Interior lobby space of the Natatorium The rectangular pavilion holds both the pool and the ice rink end to end. This placement contrasts opposing environments: liquid and frozen water, humid and dry environments, bare skin and bundled bodies. Constituents can enjoy the facilities year round. The building, a 110,000 square foot facility, engages its natural surroundings. The curtain wall wraps around the western façade, allowing swimmers to engage with the natural environment outside, from flowering crabapple trees in spring, to vibrant maple orchards in fall.\\"Flushing Meadows Corona Park Natatorium & Ice Rink.\\" Dialogue. July 2009: p. 78-87. As users make their way from the lobby to the pool level, they circulate in a spiral path that offers different perspectives of the entry plaza outside and the rest of the surroundings. The large plot of land, which once housed many international pavilions in the 1939 and 1964 world's fairs, has now been paved over with acres of greenery. The siting and procession of the building refers to the World's Fair that preceded its existence. With entrances on both the east and west side following a radial geometry, the designer draws on the historic Fountain of the Planets exhibition. A plaza is located at the eastern entrance of the building that extends from three paths that circulate to the building's park spaces. On the western façade, another entrance opens onto a path that leads to 8 soccer fields, the Flushing Meadows Golf Center, the Industry Pond, and the Unisphere, all of which are on the westernmost part of the 1250-acre park. Architecture Influenced by the World's Fair pavilions, the 110,000 square foot aquatic center is the largest recreation complex ever built in a New York City park. The curved suspended roof spans over both the Olympic size swimming pool and a NHL regulation hockey rink. The programmatic requirements of this complex shaped decisions about structure and materials. Designing the structural system and cable-stayed roof was a feat for Geiger Engineers. The structural engineers developed this structural envelope due to the necessity for a clear span- limiting chlorine from damaging building materials. A clear spanned space proved to be the solution that answered the need for minimal maintenance and avoidance of damage to structural elements. The engineers chose to place the pool and rink end-to–end, so that they would serve, structurally speaking as counterweights of a seesaw. At the midpoint are the “linchpins”: the two 130-foot masts from which the roof is suspended. The masts are composed of 1-¼” plates that are stacked at the junction of the pool and rink. The masts are designed so that as they soar through the roof, the diameter narrows to accommodate lateral movement. In order to support the 120-foot-by-230-foot clear spans, twelve cables were extended from each mast to specific connection points on the roof. The twelve 3-inch diameter A586 strand cables are critical elements in connecting the masts to the roof. To keep the roof from lifting, the roof is decked in concrete planks that counteract windloads. The concrete planks sit on longitudinal girders that create the swooping form of the envelope. Front façade of concrete matrix and multicolored glass tiles Erecting the structure demanded precise calculations. The standards for cable structure construction required that the engineers create a strategy of execution, documenting each step, prior to construction. In order for the structure to be erected, much shoring and preliminary bracing was done to relieve the dead load from the gravity columns prior to cable installation. Geiger Engineers devised a plan in which the perimeter columns were erected first, after which the concrete planks and roof framing were placed, followed by the erection of the masts, and lastly the installation of each cable. The concrete planks on the roof sit on steel framing, including the large longitudinal girders that create the swooping form of the roof. These girders were fabricated with W36x300s in the middle of the W27x194s at the sides. All of the wide flange shapes and masts were fabricated form ASTM A572 Grade 50 steel, while the diagonal roof bracing were A 500 Grade B. Due to the precisely choreographed steel design, the Flushing Meadow Natatorium received the 2009 Innovative Design in Engineering and Architecture with Structural Steel award. (IDEAS2). The IDEAS2 awards recognize outstanding achievements in engineering and architecture on structural steel projects around the country. The project was judged on structural steel innovation, with an emphasis on creative solutions to project requirements.O'Berski, Tasha. \\"Pool/Ice Rink Project at Flushing Meadows Corona Park Wins National Architecture and Engineering Award\\".

Visual interventions within the buildings allow constant interaction between patrons and the outer environment. From floor to ceiling expansive windows in the pool area to the spiraling staircase with windows opening into the park, the building offers patrons different perspectives of environment outside. Regardless of the season, athletes can enjoy physical recreation and the outdoor environment. The building's main façade is cloaked in a single concrete matrix of different aggregates used to form the mixture of surfaces within each section. Tucked between the concrete matrix are multicolored glass tiles reminiscent of the glimmering colors of water. These apertures, which are sprinkled along the building's façade, cast varying shadows on the interior. == References  Bibliography== * * ==External links== * Category:Flushing, Queens Category:Sports venues in Queens, New York Category:Flushing Meadows–Corona Park Category:Swimming venues in New York City Category:2008 establishments in New York City Category:Sports venues completed in 2008 ","title":"Flushing Meadows Natatorium"},{"id":"35934723","text":"Moche is a Peruvian city, the capital of Moche District in Trujillo Province of La Libertad Region in northern Peru.

Lewin is an honorary professor at Hangzhou University and Beijing Normal University. He is the author of numerous books, journal articles and reports on education and development. ==Biography== Lewin was born in Kent in the United Kingdom. He attended school in Kent and South London. From 1968 to 1971 he read physics at Manchester University where he graduated with a first class honours degree. He then went on to complete a Masters in Innovation and Science Policy jointly taught with Manchester Business School and wrote a thesis on the scientific research organisations that were supported by British aid. He then moved to the Institute of Development Studies in Sussex as one of its first graduate students. He joined a large multi-country project on education and development across six countries focusing on the \\"Diploma Disease\\" and the interface between education systems and labour markets. His thesis explored science education in Malaysia and Sri Lanka and the impact of externally supported innovations to improve access, quality and outcomes linked to development. In 1973/74 he took time out from his Doctorate to work with Voluntary Service Overseas teaching physics and maths in Kelantan, Malaysia. In 1977 he was appointed to a tenured post at the University of Sussex. He was appointed Reader in 1986 and Professor in 1995 when he became Director of the Centre for International Education. He is a chartered physicist and an Academician of the Academy of Social Sciences. South and South East Asia Lewin has worked extensively in South East Asia with a special focus on Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and most recently in India. In Malaysia he was a visiting lecturer at University Malaya whilst completing his doctorate working closely with colleagues in the Pusat Perkembangan Kurrikulum (PPK). Subsequently, he co- authored a major report on science education in Malaysia published by the Malaysian Ministry of Education and the UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning and has worked with many students and officials from the Ministry. In Sri Lanka Lewin initially worked with the national curriculum centre and was then an advisor for the establishment of the National Institute of Education (NIE) for UNDP. He also contributed to the development of the Sri Pada College of Education for UNDP. Subsequently, he has organised programs for high level Ministry officials and assisted with the development of the Education Sector Development Framework Programme (ESDFP) which is coordinated by the World Bank. In India Lewin has worked closely with the National University of Educational Planning (NUEPA) on a large scale program of research on access and equity using household surveys and child tracking to understand more about why more than half the children in North Indian states fail to reach secondary school. CREATE, a research consortium that Lewin helped develop, has designed and developed an extensive programme of empirical research involving large scale household suirveys and village level school based data collection. In addition Lewin has worked closely with teams from Bihar, Tamil Nadu, and Madhya Pradesh and with the Ministry of Human Resource Development and NUEPA to develop state level framework plans for Rastriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) with the aim of progressing towards universal access of quality secondary education across India. These plans project participation, activities and costs forward and identify bottlenecks and critical constraints on expanded access. China Lewin established the first educational link programs in China with a UK university in the early 1980s after the end of the Cultural Revolution and the fall of the \\"Gang of Four\\". Hangzhou University in Zhejiang provided a centre for UK-China education links under the leadership of Professor Wang Chengxu. After the links were established, which provided for exchange visits by students and staff, the first phase of work centred around evaluating the impact of the 1986 Basic Education Law. This anticipated the global commitments made at the World Conference on Education for All (WCEFA) in Jomtien to universalise access to primary schooling, and followed from China's \\"Four Modernizations\\" drive to develop. In parallel with the work in Zhejiang a similar exchange was established with Beijing Normal University and Professor Wang Yingjie. This led to a UNICEF supported program to research educational reform in three different districts – one rich, one poor, and one with a national minority population.Implementing basic education in China: progress and prospects in rich, poor and national minority areas, Keith M. Lewin and Wang Jing Yie, International Institute for Educational Planning, 1994. This was consolidated into a book published by the UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning.

Sub Saharan Africa Lewin has worked in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. For ten years he worked with Dr Ude Bude and colleagues on a network to support development for environmental science and agriculture programs across fourteen Sub Saharan African countries. The network engaged national examination boards and curriculum developers and was supported by the German Foundation for International Development (DSE). Over the period there were clear improvements in the quality of national assessments which determine the outcomes from learning and teaching. Lewin was also Special Advisor to the Minister of Education in Mauritius on financing and the implementation of the Education Masterplan, supported by UNDP. Lewin started working in post apartheid South Africa in 1994. He has been involved in a range of work with national departments including sitting on the panel which reconfigured the national research funding system for science and technology. Lewin developed a link program with the University of Durban-Westville (UDW) and was instrumental in locating the Rockefeller Foundation funded African Children's Literacy in Science and Technology programme at UDW. He subsequently developed a close partnership with the University of the Witwatersrand to undertake research on access and equity in Gauteng and Eastern Cape. He was also the director of the Mpumalanga Primary School Initiative (MPSI), the first post apartheid DFID education programme in South Africa. Lewin developed and co- directed the Multisite Teacher Education Research Project (MUSTER) with Dr Janet Stuart. This was the largest DFID funded education research project in the 1990s. It undertook empirical work in South Africa, Lesotho, Malawi, Ghana, and Trinidad and Tobago in initial teacher education and newly qualified teachers and created a collection of six books, over thirty working papers and a special edition of the International Journal of Educational and Development. In 2001 Lewin was invited to be a senior consultant to the Government of Uganda and DFID to develop the national framework for Post Primary Education and Training (PPET). Subsequently, he was also senior consultant to the Government of Tanzania and the World Bank on finance for the Secondary Education Development Programme (World Bank) and for Planning Nine Year Basic Education in Rwanda,MAPPING WAYS FORWARD: PLANNING FOR 9-YEAR BASIC EDUCATION IN RWANDA – report produced by Keith M Lewin and Albert Kwame Akyeampong, March 2005 funded by DFID and the CfBT Education Trust. In each case he developed software for national projection models for recurrent and capital financing to shape sustainable Medium Term expenditure Frameworks, inform Sector Reviews leading to budget support, and focus policy dialogue on key issues. His work in Ghana includes planning and financing teacher education and the extensive program of research of CREATE. In Malawi he has worked closely with the Centre for Educational Research and Training (CERT) in Zomba on secondary school financing and non-state schooling. 2012 he gave the opening plenary at a national research workshop in Ethiopia focused on education access, equity and quality supported by the Ministry of Education, DFID and the British Council designed to support the development of the Education Sector Development Programme. Currently he is undertaking research on low price private schools in Malawi Bilateral and Multilateral Organisations Lewin has acted as an advisor to many multi and bi-lateral development partners. After presenting to the Bellagio group of development partners in Mt St Marie, Quebec in 1981 he became increasingly involved in educational planning working closely with the UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP) in Paris where he developed approaches to planning in financial austerity and to planning science education. The latter developed over time and led to seminars on the development of science education at the World Bank and a book.Lewin, K. M., Education in Austerity; Options for Planners. Fundamentals of Educational Planning Series, International Institute for Educational Planning, 1987 Lewin's interests in financing led to an invitation from UNICEF to co-convene the Round table on \\"Educating all the Children: The Financial Challenge for the 1990s\\" at the World Conference on Education for All (WCEFA) at Jomtien, Thailand in 1990World Conference on Education for All: Meeting Basic Learning Needs, WCEFA, 5–9 March 1990, Jomtien, Thailand, pp. 75 and to the first estimates of the costs of Education for All and the reforms needed to create affordable systems. Downstream this resulted in a flow of activities related to addressing problems of sustainable financing for the expanded access to secondary schooling critical for development dependent on more knowledge intensive production and competitive service sector industries. This was the subject of a Round Table at the World Education Forum in Dakar in 2000 hosted by IIEP. Lewin's work on secondary school financing and development was presented in plenary to the Commonwealth Education Minister's Conference (CCEM 16) in Cape Town and to the Association for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA) biennial meeting in Maputo. In the recent past UNICEF's program to undertake research on out of school children has drawn on models of educational exclusion developed by Lewin for CREATE. These models have also been used by DFID in its 2010 Strategy paper, and by AusAID in its 2011 Thematic Strategy for Education. They were recently presented in the opening plenary of the ninth meeting of the Forum of Education Minister's (FEdMM) in Vanuatu. Lewin gave the plenary address to the Commonwealth Minister's meeting in Mauritius in 2012 on the post 2015 development agenda for education. As a result, a Ministerial Committee was established with Lewin as technical advisor. The resulting matrix of goals, targets and indicators was published in January 2013. Consortium for Research on Educational Access, Transitions and Equity (CREATE) Lewin's main research commitment since 2005 has been to develop the parallel program of work within the framework of the CREATE partnerships. Lewin established this research consortium with initial funding from DFID of £2.5 million. The consortium has undertaken research on access, equity and learning in basic education (including lower secondary schooling) in Bangladesh at BRAC University, India at National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), Ghana at University of Education, Winneba and at University of Cape Coast, South Africa at the University of the Witwatersrand and with the Institute of Education, University of London, and the Centre for International Education, University of Sussex on a large scale with high level partners over five years. The research has also taken place on a smaller scale in Kenya, Malawi, China, and Sri Lanka in partnership with national teams of researchers. It has produced over 150 research products, including five books, 75 research monographs and four special editions of journals working with over 100 researchers. The research is summarised in the CREATE publication Making Rights RealitiesMaking Rights Realities: Researching Educational Access, Transitions and Equity and all other research products are available at the CREATE website. Multi-country research and development programs In addition to the CREATE consortium for Research on Educational Access, Transitions and Equity, Lewin has directed several multi-country research and development programs that include: * The Multisite Teacher Education Research Project (MUSTER) exploring teacher education in Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago (funded by DFID). * The Mpumalanga Primary School Initiative support program, the first major DFID project in education in South Africa. * Financing Secondary Education in Africa. A World Bank Secondary Education in Africa (SEIA) Program. * Financing Secondary Education in Developing Countries (funded by IIEP) in Malawi, Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, China, Costa Rica and Francophone West Africa. * Science Education and Development (funded by IIEP and World Bank) exploring curriculum, pedagogy, planning and financing across a range of countries. * Non Government Providers of Education in Malawi and South Africa. ==Contributions to education and development== Planner's Paradox Lewin has made several contributions to thinking and to the literature on education and development. He has explored the systemic aspects of educational innovation in low income countries. This generated the \\"Planner's Paradox\\". Simply put innovation is needed where education systems fail to deliver quality learning equitably. Although innovation is needed, it can be disruptive, resource consuming, and may be unevenly implemented. As a result, innovation may adversely affect quality learning and equity. If the result is another innovation, the anticipated upward spiral to greater effectiveness and efficiency may become a downward spiral This is related to the result of \\"planning in terms of what ought to be rather than what is.\\" This is also tied to the concept of \\"Zones of Improbable Progress (ZIPS), which Lewin developed, that characterise the pursuit of goals long after it has become clear they are unattainable in the time available. Balanced development strategies Lewin was one of the first analysts to consistently argue for balanced development strategies during and after the Jomtien World Conference on Education for All. Jomtien set the scene for an over emphasis on bi-lateral and multi-lateral support for primary schooling at the expense of investment in other education sub-sectors. This became evident as patterns of disbursement under Education for All programs shifted over the next decade. Lewin's work on financing secondary expansion at IIEP (UNESCO), with the Secondary Education in Africa programme of the World Bank and in DFID advisor's retreats made a substantial contribution to shifting the emphasis to more balanced patterns of investment consistent with what many recipients of development assistance had long argued was needed. Multi Site Teacher Education research Programme The Multi Site Teacher Education research Programme, which Lewin co-directed, remains one of the few cross national studies of initial teacher education with an African focus. It explored in depth what happens to trainees before, during and after training in traditional college based programs and in more innovative distance delivery training. It provided a grounded insight into teacher education curricula and practicums and identified many aspects of more and less effective practice. In particular it drew attention to the importance of matching the duration and costs of training with likely career futures and the \\"half life of a trained teacher\\". In high turnover systems long periods of residential pre-career training often favoured by teacher educators can be very expensive and inefficient if many graduates do not become career teachers. Lewin showed it is better to rebalance investment between initial training and continuous professional development which delivers more training \\"just in time\\" to those who need it when they need it. Consortium for Research on Educational Access, Transitions and Equity (CREATE) Lewin's work in the CREATE consortium, with its extensive network of partners, has made a significant contribution to redefining policy dialogue around access, equity and learning outcomes. The \\"Zones of Exclusion\\" approach, developed within CREATE, has been used widely to unpack different aspects of exclusion and inclusion and has been used by DFID, AusAid, UNICEF, ADEA, UNESCO, and the World Bank. The \\"expanded vision of access\\" which includes enrolment and progression on schedule, high levels of attendance and time on task, and learning achievement consistent with grades, redefines access and is a reminder that it is not 65 million children who have no access to basic education as may be true in enrolment terms, but over 200 million who are unlikely to complete basic education successfully. Its insights into the extent and consequences of over- age enrolment, which is endemic in many parts of Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia, are critical to the achievement of universal access – through to successful completion of – basic education, especially for girls. The findings illustrate how increased participation as a result of massive investments in Education for All programs have yet to provide as much benefit to the poorest as the middle poor. It also lead to confirmations that relate to the role of the state as \\"the provider of last resort\\" to the poorest, which provides a counterpoint to the arguments of those who believe that the role of the state in providing public goods like basic education to the poorest can and should be reduced. The country research reports of CREATE have all been launched at national level meetings attended by Ministers and development partners. Indicators of progress Lewin's work on indicators of progress has also been influential. His work provides insights into the issue that surround the distance between \\"target setters and target getters\\" and the risks that performance targeting leads to \\"gaming\\" the systems used to evaluate outcomes. It also highlights the \\"moral hazards\\" embedded in systems that reward progress by withdrawing support when goals are achieved, and the difficulties when performance asymptotically approaches a limit. He also highlights the difficulties of interpreting composite indices, such as Gross enrolment rates (GERs), net enrolment rates (NERS), gender parity indices (GPIs), and Education Development Indices (EDI), when changes in values in the same direction could indicate improvement or deterioration in performance. ==Publications== Lewin has been the author of numerous books, journal articles and reports on education and development. These include works on educational innovation in developing countries, educational planning and finance, science education and development, access to basic education, non-state providers of education, and teacher education. ; Selected books * 2011, Making Rights Realities: Researching Educational Access, Transitions and Equity.

After the GM&N; was consolidated into the Gulf, Mobile & Ohio Railroad in 1940, the locomotive was renumbered #580 and served in passenger service before being retired in 1950. Today, the locomotive is owned and operated by the Reading & Northern Railroad, based out of Port Clinton, Pennsylvania in excursion service. ==In Service== Locomotive 425 was built for the Gulf, Mobile and Northern by the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Eddystone, PA as the first of two G-1 Pacifics ordered, the second being 426. The two engines later became Gulf, Mobile and Ohio 580 and 582, respectively. Both were retired in 1950. ==Early Excursion Career == Quickly after retirement, 580 and 582 were purchased by Paulson Spence as part of his Louisiana Eastern Railroad. Both 580 and 582 were renumbered to #4 and #3, as part of a large fleet of steam engines which Spence had acquired over time, and hauled trains of gravel and occasional passenger trips. When Spence died in 1961 and the Louisiana Eastern collapsed, #3 was sold for scrap (along with most of the line's engines), while #4 was purchased in 1962 by Malcolm Ottinger and became the main power of the Valley Forge Scenic Railroad of Kimberton, Pennsylvania, where it also regained its original number, 425. In the 1970s, it was purchased by Brian Woodcock and others and moved to the Wilmington & Western Railroad, though it never operated on the line due to its high axle load. In 1983, it was sold to Andrew J. Muller, Jr. to power tourist trains on the newly formed Blue Mountain and Reading Railroad based out of Temple, PA. The engine made many runs on this 26 miles shortline, as well as a few trips on the mainline. The high-stepping Pacific was later joined by Reading Company 4-8-4 #2102 in 1987. The Blue Mountain & Reading became much larger with the purchase of nearly 300 miles of former Conrail trackage throughout the early 1990s. The railroad was renamed to Reading, Blue Mountain and Northern (often shortened to Reading & Northern). In 1995 both names officially merged. Having more track gave 425 and 2102 a large amount of new areas to roam, and the engines became based out of the railroad's own headquarters of Port Clinton. Blue Mountain and Reading Railroad 425 prepares for a tourist excursion On June 12, 1992 the 425 was painted into its most recognizable appearance with a dark blue paint scheme. Inspired by the Reading Company's own blue painted Pacific, the streamlined Reading Crusader (not, contrary to popular belief, the Central Railroad of New Jersey's Blue Comet), the locomotive's blue made it a distinct stand out. The idea came to Mr. Muller to paint 425 in dark blue by former Reading Company Engineer Charles W. Kachel. The locomotive was a featured guest at the Steamtown National Historic Site Grand Opening in July 1995, and made a number of excursions out of Scranton, Pennsylvania. The locomotive returned to Port Clinton in late 1996. 425's last excursion was the Tamaqua Fall Fest on October 13, 1996. From 1997 - 2008 is when steam operations took an extended break. ==Modern Excursion Career (2008-Present)== After nearly a decade of storage, rebuild work began to bring 425 back to service. Following two years of restoration, the Pacific made its first operation under steam in December 2007 in a partially repainted appearance. Another test run was done on May 11, 2008 where the engine debuted in a new lighter blue color and an above-centered headlight. It made its return to excursion service in June 2008 on a round trip from Port Clinton to Jim Thorpe, a run it would make often. The RBMN's new star made many trips to Jim Thorpe and other locations over the next three years, with employee runs, tourist trains on the Lehigh Gorge Scenic Railway, and a featured attraction of the 2010 NRHS Convention. Locomotive 425 in its blue paint scheme from 2007 to 2015. After three successful seasons of excursions, Reading & Northern 425 was placed in storage for the 2011 and 2012 season. Repairs included the rebuilding of the pilot and trailing trucks by the Strasburg Rail Road, including conversion from plain bearings to more efficient roller bearings, rebuilding of the air compressor, a new blower and replacing the bottom part of the smokebox. Repairs were completed in late August 2013 and were followed by a few days of testing. The 425's first public outing after her overhaul was a return to Steamtown for the first time since 1996 for its annual Railfest. While at Railfest 2013, 425 was on display, though under steam, near the entrance to the park. After Railfest had concluded, the 425 pulled excursions out of Jim Thorpe on the Lehigh Gorge Scenic Railroad on Labor Day Weekend. The engine later operated on numerous trips out of Port Clinton, and also doubleheaded with recently restored Central Railroad of New Jersey 0-6-0 #113 on several trips. The Reading & Northern runs regular tourist trains on the Lehigh Gorge Scenic Railway usually with the railroad's fleet of more modern freight diesels. In August 2015, No. 425 was given a new paint scheme and was pulling regular passenger trains when she was visited at Jim Thorpe, PA, by Nickel Plate 765 on a Norfolk Southern 21st Century Steam excursion. On September 4th, 2017, No. 425 struck a car leaving a parking lot in Jim Thrope. ==References== *History of the Reading and Northern Railway ==External links== *Reading, Blue Mountain and Northern Home Page *Railroad Pictures Archive: RBM&N; 425 ==See also== *Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad Category:4-6-2 locomotives Category:Baldwin locomotives Category:Individual locomotives of the United States Category:Steam locomotives of the United States Category:Preserved steam locomotives of the United States Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1928 ","title":"Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad 425"},{"id":"35934945","text":"The ducheke is a type of fiddle played by the Nanai people of the Amur River Basin. == See also == *T'yngryng, a Nivkh instrument of Sakhalin *Huchir, a spike-fiddle of the Buryat Mongols == References == Category:Russian musical instruments Category:Bowed instruments Category:Tungusic culture ","title":"Ducheke"},{"id":"35934948","text":"The 2012–13 FC Augsburg season was the 106th season in the club's football history.

Alistair is the first full companion the player gets if they don't choose the Human Noble origin (and the second if they do), and is a fellow Grey Warden alongside the player character. Over the course of the game, Alistair is revealed to be the heir to Ferelden's throne, and may be put on as king. In addition to Origins, Alistair also appears in the game's expansion pack Awakening (if placed as king during Origins), the Darkspawn Chronicles DLC, Dragon Age II, and the Silent Grove comic series. Alistair has received positive reception, mainly for his sarcastic remarks and romance. However, some writers have compared him to previous BioWare companions, such as Knights of the Old Republics Carth Onasi. ==Concept and characteristics== Steve Valentine is the voice of Alistair in the Dragon Age series. Alistair was mainly written by David Gaider, the lead writer of Origins, and is voiced by Steve Valentine. The character is named after actor Alistair Appleton.Alistair is a relatively new Grey Warden, who are a group devoted to fighting darkspawn. He's believed to be the secret son of King Maric and a serving girl, and was originally raised in Redcliffe Castle by Arl Eamon after his mother's death. However, he was later given to the Chantry for training as a templar, a military order who are trained to kill \\"apostates\\" (mages outside of the Circle of Magi) and watch over the Circle of Magi. Alistair is described as having a \\"wry sense of humor\\", and makes many sarcastic remarks during the game. If the player chooses to be female, Alistair can be romanced. In an interview with GameZone, David Gaider said that Alistair was a bit of a \\"woo-bie\\" and that his romance was \\"very cute\\". However, Gaider said that he wouldn't want to have another Alistair- like romance in the interest of originality. Alistair was originally written to be a \\"grizzled Grey Warden veteran\\", as per Dragon Ages original lead designer James Ohlen. However, such a character would be unlikely not to lead, and the character would have to start out at a low level. Gaider changed the character, and drew some inspiration from the characters Xander Harris and Mal Reynolds. Similarly, Gaider also originally wanted to have Mal's actor Nathan Fillion voice the character, but decided against it as he would have had to perform an English accent. However, Gaider was still pleased with Valentine's voicing. Commenting on the tendency for a lot of games to feature heroes who are superheroes and have an otherworldly quality, Valentine was of the view that the best kind of \\"superheroes\\" are the ones who are insecure; he notes that Alistair is insecure, and that makes him very human and a great character for him to play. ==Appearances== In Dragon Age: Origins Alistair, as he appears in Dragon Age: Origins. Alistair is first introduced in Dragon Age: Origins as a junior Grey Warden once the player character reaches Ostagar, where the Grey Wardens are preparing for a battle against the darkspawn. He accompanies the player character in organizing the preparation for their \\"Joining\\" ritual as part of their induction into the Grey Wardens, where they first encounter Morrigan, a Witch of the Wilds. After Loghain abandons the battle at Ostagar, leaving the Grey Wardens and King Cailan to die, he and the player are rescued by Flemeth. Being the last Grey Wardens in Ferelden, and all other Wardens beyond their reach as Ferelden's borders are closed, the player and he must use Grey Warden contracts to demand help from certain groups against the darkspawn. Alistair also suggests contacting Arl Eamon, who resides in Redcliffe, to help convince the other nobles to help the player. Upon entering Redcliffe, Alistair will tell the player how he is actually the heir to the crown, but was hidden due to being a bastard and instead brought up by Eamon. He also expresses no wish to be king. He will then tell the player about his long-lost sister Goldanna, who lives in Denerim, and will ask to meet her. If brought to Goldanna, she will reject him, and the player may \\"harden\\" Alistair and tell him to stand up for himself more. After all the forces have been recruited by the player, Arl Eamon will call the \\"Landsmeet\\", a meeting between all of the nobles. The player will have to challenge Loghain's current regency by eroding the noble's support of him. After attending the Landsmeet, Alistair may either be made king, or Anora (King Cailan's wife) may be made queen. Alternatively, the player may choose to arrange a marriage between Anora and Alistair, though the latter requires persuading. If Alistair had been \\"hardened\\", he will reconsider and be less anxious of becoming king. The player may also either spare or kill Loghain. If Loghain is spared, Alistair will become so disgusted he will leave the player. If Anora is made queen and not married to Alistair, she will call for Alistair's execution if Loghain is spared. The player may interject and stop Anora, or let him be executed. If Alistair is spared, he is exiled and becomes a wandering drunk. If Loghain is killed and Alistair is not made king, he will simply return to being a Grey Warden. Finally, if Loghain was not spared and Alistair remained in the party, he may sacrifice himself killing the Archdemon – who destroys the soul of any Grey Warden who kills it – unless the player agrees to Morrigan's proposal or kills the Archdemon themselves. Alistair will have a short appearance in Origins expansion pack Awakening if placed as king during Origins. Alistair also appears in the game's Darkspawn Chronicles DLC as the final boss, with it being an alternate version of the game where the player character dies at the start and Alistair is left in charge, and the player playing as the darkspawn. At the end of the DLC, the darkspawn successfully kill Alistair and destroy Ferelden. Other appearances Alistair makes a cameo appearance in Dragon Age II unless the player imports a save from Origins where he was executed. If he remains a Grey Warden, he will appear during the Qunari invasion and tell Hawke that he regrets the Grey Wardens cannot help against the Qunari. If made king, he will briefly appear arguing with Meredith, head of the templars in Kirkwall. If exiled, he will become a drunk at \\"The Hanged Man\\", where Bann Teagan will show up and tell him he can return to Ferelden. Alistair is the main protagonist of The Silent Grove, a digital comic series. The story tells his quest to find his father Maric with the help of Isabela and Varric Tethras. He eventually finds Maric, who was captured by a Tevinter Magister who used Maric's blood to enhance his power. After taking down the Magister, Alistair is forced to put his father out of his misery upon realizing that he was now unable to survive without the Magister's apparatus to which he was attached. He then returns to Ferelden to rule the kingdom the best he can. Alistair also returns in Dragon Age: Inquisition as the King of Ferelden or a Grey Warden unless the player imports a world state from Dragon Age Keep where he died or became a drunk. If made king, he will make a brief appearance after the Inquisitor confronts Alexius in Redcliffe. If he remains as a Grey Warden, he will be contacted by Hawke (protagonist of Dragon Age II). He was branded a traitor by the Warden- Commander Clarel due to his opposition of using blood magic to stop the Blight. Afterwards, he will be trapped alongside the Inquisitor and Hawke in the Fade. Depending on the player's choice, Alistair will sacrifice himself to help the Inquisitor to escape the Fade by battling a nightmare blocking the Fade's exit. Alternatively, the player can choose to sacrifice Hawke, in which case Alistair survives and will send a report to the headquarters of the Grey Wardens in Weisshaupt Fortress. ==Reception== GamesRadar's staff placed him at number 37 in a list of the 50 best game characters of the generation, commenting \\"Dragon Age: Origins had plenty of memorable characters, but chief among them was the would-be bastard king Alistair.\\" Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Alec Meer liked Alistair, and commented that he had some nice comic deflections. Eurogamer's Oli Welsh noted that Alistair and Morrigan the \\"stars\\" of the game's companions, but criticized their storylines as being \\"contrived\\". The wooden dialogue and stiff animation was also mentioned. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Alec believed that Alistair, along with Shale, brought needed levity to the otherwise grim world of Dragon Age, describing the both of them as the game's most vital voices. Mike Fahey, writing for Kotaku, praised Alistair as having some of the most amusing lines in the game during his review of Origins. Fahey particularly praised Steve Valentine's voice acting, calling Alistair's voice his favourite in the game and noting that many of Alistair's lines would have fallen flat were it not for Valentine's timing. During an interview with Ray Muzyka (the co-founder and CEO of BioWare), VideoGamer.com's interviewer said that while he didn't like Alistair at first he grew to like him and his humour, although Muzyka himself did not like the character. Kirk Hamilton, also writing for Kotaku, called Alistair one of his favorite characters, and looked forward to seeing how he got on with the \\"worldly\\" Isabella during The Silent Grove. John Walker, writing for PC Gamer, believed that his friendship with Alistair had an \\"echo of reality\\", and felt that his sarcasm plus balancing his emotions and bravado \\"continue[d] to resonate\\". Walker also praised the conversations he had with Morrigan. Meer felt that Alistair and Morrigan's bickering evoked sexual tension, wishing they would just \\"get it on\\". Kieron from Rock, Paper, Shotgun also wished to be able to set them up together. Tom Senior named Alistair as his personal favorite character, commenting that \\"A little laughter goes a long way, and Alistair shines as the self-aware bastard contender for the throne\\", and gave context that Origins can be very serious and dark in tone. The results of a match-up poll of Dragon Age characters hosted by Bioware as part of a March Madness theme in March 2015 revealed that fans voted the Origins Warden protagonist, Alistair, Varric Tethras and Morrigan as preferred party leader, warrior, rogue and mage in an ideal party respectively. Gamestm named Alistair as one of Bioware's eight most memorable companions. Meer also commented that Alistair made him wish he had made his character female, believing him to be a better love interest than Morrigan due to his cheery put-downs rather than her \\"snide oh-I'm-bit-naughty-me line\\". Kieron believed that Alistair was BioWare's best attempt at a male romantic lead, being \\"good without-out being entirely punchable\\". While romancing Alistair, Edges Chris Dahlen found he related more to Alistair than his female mage player character, and noted many similarities between his life growing up and Alistair. He also put some blame on him being male. Wesley Yin-Poole, writing for VideoGamer.com, felt that the sex scene with Alistair was short and unerotic, calling it an example of video games still needed to learn how to do sex. Walker again, this time writing for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, commented how when playing his male character his heart was always with Alistair, and felt like he was \\"using\\" Zevran when he romanced him. In an article on video game romances, 1UP.com commented on how Alistair grew and developed with the player, despite beginning as an uncertain \\"somewhat naive soldier\\". Natania Barron, writing for Wired GeekMom column, commented that there was something \\"devious and devillish\\" about romancing him due to his ex-Templar roots. Barron also mentioned how, after making him king, she was willing to restart the game as a Human Noble when she found out he would break up with her elf and that she \\"honestly cared\\" about securing his marriage. Barron favorably compared his romance to Anders' from Dragon Age II, saying that she \\"settled\\" for him and most likely chose him because he reminded her of Alistair. Kotaku republished a post by a gay modder who had made Alistair think his character was female, who felt unable to play the game for a month after Alistair broke up with him as king for not being able to produce an heir (because of the darkspawn taint). Meer commented on BioWare's repeated use of themes and called Alistair Dragon Ages \\"Carth\\"; mentioning how he is the first person you recruit, had a heart of gold and is the main female love interest. However, he did note how Alistair wasn't as \\"drippy\\" as Carth, and how he was more someone you could have a conversation with. During a criticism of BioWare's games, GameZone's Dave Snell believed that many characters were too similar, specifically calling both Carth and Alistair the \\"snarky young upstart\\". John Walker, this time writing for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, felt that Alistair bucked the trend of BioWare making all the starting companions tedious. Similarly, several writers compared Anders to Alistair. ==References== Category:Adoptee characters in video games Category:Dragon Age characters Category:Fictional male royalty Category:Fictional soldiers in video games Category:Fictional swordsmen in video games Category:King characters in video games Category:Male characters in video games Category:Orphan characters in video games Category:Religious worker characters in video games Category:Video game characters in comics Category:Video game characters introduced in 2009 Category:Video game nobility Category:Video game sidekicks ","title":"Alistair (Dragon Age)"},{"id":"35934993","text":"The Agency for Renewable Resources ( or FNR), was founded in 1993 as a government initiative intended to support research and development in the area of renewable resources.

An additional 24.6 million euro are allocated for research and development in the field of bioenergy from the Special Energy and Climate Fund (EKF)., FNR Jahresbericht 2014/15 ‘Renewable Resources‘ Funding Programme The ‘Renewable Resources’ funding programme is part of the government's new high-tech strategy to improve Germany's competitive position. It also supports the government's ‘Policy Strategy on Bioeconomy’, which aims to create a resource- efficient economy that makes use of renewable resources. The programme is intended to support the further development of a sustainable bio-based economy. This involves developing innovative, internationally competitive bio- based products, as well as processes and technologies for their production. Furthermore, the programme also supports the development of concepts aimed at improving the sustainability of the bio-based economy, while taking society's expectations into account. == Structure == The FNR is a registered association. Its task is to effectively and continuously contribute to the research and development as well as the use of renewable resources taking into account conflicts of use, direct and indirect land use changes, biomass conversion processes as well as sustainability concepts. The bodies of the FNR are * the General Assembly, consisting of seven members who are entitled to vote and are part of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) as well as supporting members that perform a consultative function, * the Managing Board, * the Specialised Advisory Committee and the Managing Board of the Specialised Advisory Committee, as well as * the Managing Director. Organisation chart == Tasks ==  Promotion of Research and Development  The FNR's main task is to support applied research and development in the field of sustainable development and use of renewable resources. It is our goal to develop promising processes and products to make them ready for the market. The FNR supports around 6800 projects each year.  Information and Public Relations  The FNR is the first point of contact for all matters concerning renewable resources. Alongside specialist information, explanations and advice also play an important role. The FNR operates a variety of thematic portals providing information on the use of renewable resources. In addition, there are numerous publications available in the FNR's media library. Regular events and industry and consumer expos round off the spectrum of activities.  EU and International Activities  As well as taking part in EU funded projects, the FNR is also involved in European and international committees and working groups that develop strategies for the sustainable use of biomass using innovative and efficient technologies. == The Importance of Renewable Resources == Fossil resources like coal, mineral oil and gas decrease worldwide. Germany, like most industrial nations, has to focus more and more on alternative resources. This means that agricultural and forestry resources used in a substantial or energetic way can be a major contribution. Renewable resources are not only important for supply guarantee but also for climate protection. Economic Factor of Renewable Resources Cultivation and local and regional use of renewable resources support economic growth, added value and new jobs – especially in rural areas. They allow economic and social participation and will lead to an increase of quality of life for the people on the ground. Also in the industrial field, e.g. in the chemical industry, renewable resources are being used more and more and as a result new jobs can be provided. == Miscellaneous == In a unique pilot project (2007–2010), the FNR, in cooperation with Wikimedia Germany and the nova-Institute, implemented the first government-funded project in Wikipedia: the development of the thematic portal “Renewable Resources\\"., Abschlussbericht für das Projekt „Nachwachsende Rohstoffe im Wikipedia-Online-Lexikon“ == Further reading == * Fachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe e.V.

He was educated at St Paul's School, London and then Lincoln College, Oxford. Starting late at university because of health problems, he obtained a first-class degree in literae humaniores (classics) in 1918. ==Academic career== Last was appointed as a Fellow of St John's College, Oxford in 1919. His interest in the history of Ancient Rome had been sparked at school by the classical historian T. Rice Holmes, who taught at St Paul's, and continued at Lincoln under William Warde Fowler. His interests also broadened into related spheres such as ancient Oriental history. In 1927, he was appointed as a university lecturer in Roman history, and became Camden Professor of Ancient History in 1936, a post that carried with it a fellowship at Brasenose College. During the Second World War he worked at the British codebreaking centre at Bletchley Park,Michael Smith, The Secrets of Station X, Biteback, London, 2011, p39 and in 1948 became the Principal of Brasenose, despite his health and the college's poor financial position.

The current judicial system is organized in accordance with the 2007 Constitution of Thailand. The Asian Human Rights Commission has called the Thai legal system a \\"mess\\" and called for a drastic overhaul of Thailand's criminal procedures. It cited the rampant use of forced confessions, and the fact that even a senior justice ministry official admitted that 30 percent of cases went to court with no evidence. No stenographic records are made by the trial court and the record is composed of what the judges decide. It also criticized the judiciary for failing to ensure that trials are conducted speedily.M&C;, Human rights group slams Thailand's judicial system, 26 March 2007 Research judges assist the sitting judges. Judges must take an examination and two different examinations are given: one exam is for judges trained in Thailand and a different examination is given for judges who graduate from foreign law schools. All judges are formally appointed by the king. ==Courts of Justice== The Courts of Justice of Thailand (ศาลยุติธรรม) is the largest of the court systems and makes up the majority of courts in the kingdom. The courts as mandated in the constitution consists of three tiers: the court of first instance (ศาลชั้นต้น), the court of appeals (ศาลอุทธรณ์), and the court of last resort, that is, the Supreme Court of Thailand (ศาลฎีกา). The current president of the Supreme Court of Justice is Veerapol Tungsuwan. ==Administrative courts== The administrative court system (ศาลปกครอง) is composed of two tiers: The administrative courts of first instance (ศาลปกครองชั้นต้น) and the administrative court of last resort, that is, the Supreme Administrative Court (ศาลปกครองสูงสุด). The court system was first created in 1997, the court's main jurisdiction is to settle litigation between the state or an organ of state (government ministries, departments, and independent agencies) and private citizens. Civil vs criminal The Council of State is considering adjusting the definition of certain criminal offences so they are punishable by administrative penalties rather than criminal imprisonment. The high number of criminal cases are overwhelming the court system and overcrowding jails nationwide. Thailand reportedly ranked sixth in the world in terms of the number of criminal suspects in the judicial process, about 300,000 persons. The state reportedly spends about 100,000 baht per criminal case — including the wages of police, judges and related officials — and only 6,000 baht per civil lawsuit, according to a study by Thailand Development Research Institute. While serious crimes such as theft and murder would still be subject to criminal prosecution, other offences, such as those involving cheque payments or copyright infringement, could be punished by administrative penalties to unburden the criminal court system. ==Constitutional Court== First set up in 1997, the Constitutional Court of Thailand (ศาลรัฐธรรมนูญ) was created solely as a high court to settle matters pertaining to the constitution. The court has since accumulated huge amounts of power and influence in the wake of the 2006 and 2014 military coups and the constitutions they created, engaging in what critics of the court call political coups, ousting prime ministers from office, and climaxing in a ruling in 2013 that parliament could not amend the constitution according to its terms to elect all senators because that would violate the court's definition of a \\"democratic regime\\". In May 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that the Thai prime minister and nine other cabinet ministers had to resign due to malfeasance. Questions have been raised not only over the court's increasing power over this matter, but why the Supreme Court, which apparently has jurisdiction in such cases, did not adjudicate. There have been repeated calls for reform or outright elimination of the court because of its politicization. ==See also== *Government of Thailand *Constitution of Thailand *Law of Thailand ==References *Supreme Court of Justice of Thailand *Supreme Administrative Court of Thailand *Constitutional Court of Thailand Category:Thai law Category:Government of Thailand ","title":"Judiciary of Thailand"},{"id":"35935021","text":"Martín Sordelli (born 21 January 1969) is an Argentine former field hockey player who competed in the 1988 Summer Olympics and in the 1992 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Argentina Category:Field hockey players at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games medalists in field hockey Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Argentina Category:Field hockey players at the 1987 Pan American Games Category:Field hockey players at the 1991 Pan American Games Category:1990 Men's Hockey World Cup players ","title":"Martín Sordelli"},{"id":"35935035","text":" Den Røde LøveFour ships are listed in the Danish Naval Museum Skibregister with the name Røde Løve - this one from 1596 and later ones from 1611, 1622 and 1666 - but without further details was a 70-ton ship of the Dano-Norwegian navy.

From 1995 to 2008 he worked for the Los Angeles Times, after first freelancing for the newspaper. ==Early life and education== Philips grew up in the Detroit, Michigan area and moved to Los Angeles at 19. He worked for the Wasserman Silk Screen Company of Santa Monica, California while studying at California State University, Long Beach, where he received a B.A. in journalism in 1989. == Career== Philips worked on staff at the Los Angeles Times from 1995 to 2008. He has written for Rolling Stone, Spin, The Village Voice, The Washington Post, AllHipHop, the San Francisco Chronicle and Source. He chronicled the music and entertainment industries in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Richard D. Barnet and Larry L. Burriss credited Philips' continued reporting on sexual harassment in the music industry prompted other media outlets in \\"bringing sexual harassment in the music industry to a national forum.\\" Philips also covered art and crime, corporate and government corruption, and medical malfeasance. Philips said he believed the police and other law enforcement agencies had failed to solve murders of such black figures as Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls. In 2002 Philips' two-part series about the Shakur murder identified Orlando Anderson as Shakur's attacker. Ticketmaster congressional hearings In the early 1990s, Philips wrote a series of stories about Ticketmaster, reporting in 1994 that the rock band Pearl Jam had complained to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice that Ticketmaster used monopolistic practices and refused to lower service fees for the band's tickets. The company had exclusive contracts with large U.S. venues and threatened to take legal action if those contracts were broken. Rap crime Philips reported on the East- West rap feud, including the unsolved murders of Tupac Shakur and Christopher Wallace a.k.a. the Notorious B.I.G.. His 2002 two-part article for the LA Times claimed that Shakur was killed in September 1996 by Orlando Anderson, a member of the Crips gang, supported by others of the gang hired by Wallace. Philips and fellow LA Times reporters wrote articles supporting the theory that Wallace was also killed by the Crips, when he was killed six months later. In March 2008, Philips reported in the LA Times that James \\"Jimmy Henchman\\" Rosemond, a hip-hop CEO, had organized the 1994 attack on Tupac at Quad Studios in New York. The article alleged that Smalls and others knew about the attack a week in advance. He relied heavily on anonymous sources and internal FBI documents. Soon after the article was published, The Smoking Gun revealed that Philips' FBI documents had been forged by his informant, a man convicted of fraud. In April 2008, the LA Times printed a full retraction of the Quad Studios article and released Philips shortly thereafter during a wave of layoffs. Philips blames the Times editors for forcing him to rely heavily on the fake FBI documents, and stands by the facts presented in his story as told to him by his unnamed sources.

It was completed in 2011.Hill, John (2011) Guide to Contemporary New York City Architecture. New York: Norton. p.20. The pavilion and plein (Dutch for \\"plaza\\") is located in Peter Minuit Plaza on State Street at the intersection of Whitehall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. ==Overview== The $2.4 million pavilion's groundbreaking took place on September 9, 2009, and it was officially opened to the public on May 12, 2011. The pinwheel- shaped pavilion is home to a café and also acts as an interactive information center. The surrounding plaza is meant to be a space for both scheduled and spontaneous activities. The Pavilion is positioned in a heavy traffic area just a few feet north of the Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal and next to the South Ferry – Whitehall Street (New York City Subway) making this a busy intersection that is used by approximately 70,000 residents and visitors daily. ==History== The New Amsterdam Pavilion is an addition to the ever changing downtown Manhattan area that was once dominated by the shipping industry. Over time these businesses moved to Brooklyn and New Jersey making room for other commercial business and residential buildings in the area. This resulted in increased population density of the downtown area and the need for redevelopment. These efforts to redevelop the area are ongoing with the Battery Conservancy’s need to redevelop Battery Park. The realization of the New Amsterdam Pavilion was made possible by initiatives undertaken by the Battery Conservancy in 1952 when they removed a section of Battery Park’s original plan to make room for a larger South Ferry Terminal. This paved the way for the creation of Peter Minuit Plaza, a plaza named after the Dutch merchant, representative of the Dutch East India Company, who is known for brokering the deal between the Dutch and the Lenape Indians to share the island. When Henry Hudson first arrived on the island in 1609 it was named Manna-Hata by Native Americans and was soon established as a desirable location for the new Dutch settlement. The first Dutch settlers arrived in 1626 and renamed it New Amsterdam. The Pavilion is geographically located at the mouth of the Hudson River marking the downtown area where New York City started its development and is placed on the plaza named after the famed Dutch merchant making the location of the New Amsterdam Pavilion ideal. ==Site and context== Its location on the mouth of the Hudson River, where Henry Hudson found a desirable location for the new Dutch settlement, and on Peter Minuit Plaza, named after the Dutch merchant who negotiated the deal with the Lenape, makes the site historically appropriate. As the site was once part of Battery Park and on the southern tip of the island, the site is open to light and air without the feeling of oppression by the surrounding skyscrapers. The size of the triangular site is approximately 125’x145’x160’ (38.1m x 44,2m x 48.8m). This location offers high pedestrian traffic due to the Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal, just a few feet away from the Pavilion, as well as the South Ferry Subway station that become essential to the success of this public building. Contextually, the building looks very different from any of the surrounding structures. ==Form and use== The Pavilion's form is based on a pinwheel plan spreading the building's program away from its center while truly mimicking a pinwheel with equally sweeping curvilinear forms. Programmatically, the center of the building houses more permanent and private functions and the tips are usually occupied by concession stands and the information booth which includes an interactive projection. Occasionally these spaces become home to temporary art installations and exhibits. The building's form divides the plaza into four public outdoor spaces for a various functions and events and breaks up the heavily trafficked area with its befitting dynamic shape. ==Construction== Materiality of the Pavilion was kept simple with the use of glass, wood and steel. The Pavilion's complex form is made up of wood ribs and a steel frame. The envelope is made up of plywood and polyurea coating. With only a nine-month period to complete the project the Pavilion was prefabricated in Virginia and hauled to and pieced together on site to speed up the process. Glass allows views of the interior spaces providing glimpses of current installations and access to the Pavilion's concession stands and information booth. Another notable part of the design is the LED lighting of the Pavilion. Every night at midnight the Pavilion exhibits an array of different colors as a tribute to Peter Minuit whose name translates to “midnight” form French. ==Sustainable design== The building's design takes into account the need to passively ventilate the space. The form of the building and its location in open space makes it easy to take advantage of cross ventilation that is achieved through shading fins that allow hot air to escape while protecting against the rain and reducing the need for active heating and air conditioning systems (HVAC). The building's structure utilizes a low maintenance steel that is fully concealed within the building's shell as are all of the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems. The Pavilion was pre-fabricated and hauled onto the site where it was pieced together along with its steel structure that was created through a file to factory process. Despite the attempt at sustainability of this structure the costs are considerable and some of the materials used are questionable. The carbon footprint of some of the materials such as polyuria (commonly used in the making of spandex) and corian (made up of acrylic polymer and alumina trihydrate) used in the building's interior are questionable in regards to sustainability. == References == Notes Sources *Buro Happold (May 18, 2011) \\"New Amsterdam Plein & Pavilion Opens to Public in New York City\\" (press release).

She won three of her first four outings. The daughter of Empire Maker is known for posting a 1-1/2 length score over her stablemate Disposablepleasure in the mile and an eighth Grade II $300,000 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes at Pimlico Race Course on May 18, 2012. == Early racing career == Trained by Todd Pletcher, In Lingerie did not race as a two-year-old. When she hit the track in mid-January 2012, she won her debut in a maiden special weight race at Turfway Park at six furlongs on synthetic surface. In her second start, she came in a close second in an optional claimer on the Gulfstream Park dirt in late February. In her third start, In Lingerie stepped up in class and won by six lengths in the $100,000 Bourbonette Oaks at one mile for 3-year-old fillies at Turfway Park. The race was the top race for fillies on the Spiral Stakes undercard held on Saturday, March 24, 2012. In Lingerie put away all challengers coming off the second turn, including her stablemate Dancing Solo. == Black-Eyed Susan Stakes == Her connections, including owner Eclipse Thoroughbred Partners and trainer Todd Pletcher, skipped the Kentucky Oaks with In Lingerie to give her more time off. They decided two weeks before the Oaks that they would enter her in the second jewel of America's de facto Filly Triple Crown: the $300,000 Grade II Black- eyed Susan Stakes. The Black-Eyed Susan Stakes is the distaff counterpart to the Preakness Stakes and was run on the Friday of Preakness Stakes weekend before a crowd of 32,473. A field of nine three-year-old fillies went to the gate in this one and one eighth mile feature race. Undefeated Momma Kimbo, winner of the Fantasy Stakes last time out, was sent off as the even-money favorite over 3-1 second choice Welcome Guest. In Lingerie stumbled badly at the break, cutting herself and bleeding from one of her front feet. The two favorites shot to the lead early while In Lingerie ran seventh passing the stands for the first time. Momma Kimbo took an uncontested lead of two lengths half through fractions of 23.5, 47.4, with stablemate Disposablepleasure in fourth going into the clubhouse turn. Entering the final turn, In Lingerie moved up into a stalking position in fifth place five lengths behind the lead as she went five wide. As the field reached the top of the stretch, she moved up to third while racing six wide. At the eighth pole, she drew even with the leaders, Momma Kimbo and Wildcat Smile. With 110 yards left, Momma Kimbo fell out of contention, and In Lingerie moved in front of Wildcat Smile by a length. Then her stablemate Disposablepleasure made a late charge, closing fast. However, with jockey John Velazquez aboard, In Lingerie won by a length and a half, paying $9.80. == Late racing career == On July 21, 2012, In Lingerie finished third to Questing and Zo Impressive in the $300,000 Grade I Coaching Club American Oaks at one and one eighth miles at Saratoga Race Course. On October 7, 2012, In Lingerie was entered in the $500,000 Spinster Stakes at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, Kentucky. On that day she went into the race as the 2-1 favorite. In Lingerie broke fourth from the starting gate under jockey John Velazquez and stayed in that position through the first three quarters of a mile. She covered 1-1/8 miles over Keeneland's Polytrack surface in 1:49.42. She veered outside of traffic going five wide and responded with a burst at the sixteenth pole and went on to win the race by two and a quarter lengths over Mystic Star. On November 2, 2012, In Lingerie was entered into the $2,000,000 Grade 1 Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. The race was run at a 1-1/4 miles on firm grass and she just did not handle the track that day. In that race In Lingerie performed poorly finishing ninth out of the field of twelve. In November 2012 after the Breeders Cup, the connections of In Lingerie announced that she would retire and start breeding in 2013. She was sold at auction for $2.2 million at the Fasig-Tipton Auction in November 2012. Her first contract was to be bred with Champion Frankel in February 2013. == Pedigree  References == Category:2009 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 3-o ","title":"In Lingerie"},{"id":"35935388","text":"Santiago Grau (born 2 August 1963) is a Spanish former field hockey player who competed in the 1988 Summer Olympics and in the 1992 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Spain Category:Field hockey players at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:1990 Men's Hockey World Cup players ","title":"Santiago Grau"},{"id":"35935417","text":"Mohammad Paziraei (, August 4, 1929 - March 9, 2002) was a Greco-Roman flyweight wrestler, who was born to an Iranian family living in Azerbaijan, but spent most of his life in Iran.

The temple is dedicated to Narasimha, the fourth incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu. ==Location== Kozha is about north-east of Kottayam and about east of the pilgrim town of Vaikom. ==History of The Temple== The belief is that it is the only swayambhu (self- manifested) idol of Narasimha in Kerala. Till circa C.E. 1752, Kozha, mostly uninhabited and wooded, was part of the Vadakkumkoor principality. It is believed that it was a vanavedan (jungle-dwelling hunter) who happened to find the idol of Lord Narasimha in the jungles of what is now Kozha, The locals, with the blessings of the powers-that-be, consecrated the idol and over a period of time it developed into a full-fledged shrine. Some people believe that he was not a real hunter but the lord Siva himself. The Vettakkarumakan (Son of Siva and Parvathy when they took the forms of Kiratha and his consort) temple situated near by the Narasimha swami temple lends credence to the story. The region is generally Shaivaite. Few Vishnu/Krishna temples suggest later influence of Vaishnavism. ==Legend of Hiranyakashipu== Puranas speak of Hiranyakashipu, an asur (demon), who had acquired special boons from Brahma, the creator among the trinity of the Hindu pantheon. One of the boons was that he be not killed by a man (human being), a deva (a divine being)), an animal or anything animate or inanimate. Obviously deva in this context meant demigods. Another boon was that he could not be done away with - in the air or on earth or indoors or outdoors or during day or night. Insulated as he was with these boons, Hiranyakashipu conquered the whole universe and even dethroned Indra, the king of Swarga (the world of devas and the abode of liberated souls from earth). He declared himself to be the almighty and decimated whoever choosing to accept Narayana (or Vishnu, another supreme being of the trinity and lord of maintenance and sustenance of the universe) as his lord. The word ‘Narayana’ in paeans, panegyrics and prayers was replaced by Hiranyakashipu with his own name. (The asurs in puranas pay obeisance only to Brahma and Siva, the latter being the third of the trinity entrusted with cosmic destruction. The trinity is at the top of the hierarchy of the pantheon). The demon had tried to kill even his own son Prahlada who was a pious devotee of Vishnu; and on all such occasions, he was saved by the divine interference of the lord Vishnu, without manifesting himself on the scene. Hiranyakashipu's atrocities and misdemeanors began bothering even Brahma and upon the latter's request, Vishnu agreed to kill the demon king. Vishnu, whose opportune incarnations were always for ensuring peace and orderliness in the universe, took the form of Narasimha (half man-half lion). The half man-half lion entity, an annihilator not envisaged in the boon, pounced on Hiranyakashipu at twilight (when it was neither day nor night) as the demon king was furiously admonishing his son Prahlad during one of the torture sessions for his continued devotion to Vishnu. Sitting on the threshold of his palace (neither indoors nor out), Narasimha then put the demon on his lap (neither earth nor space). It was disemboweled using his long sharp claw-like nails (neither animate nor inanimate) as weapon. The mighty asur thus met with his gory end, thereby attaining salvation which he was destined to as per the curse of the quartet of sages Sanaka, Sananda, Sadananda and Sanat Kumara. Even after killing Hiranyakashipu, Narasimha could not control his extreme fury. None of the divine beings present including Vishnu's consort Lakshmi, were able to calm down him. Then, at the request of Narada, Prahlada was ushered to Narasimha and finally, he was calmed by the prayers of his devotee. ==Benevolent Narasimha Murthy== Narasimha was all benevolence embodied following the prayers of Prahlada. It is in this form that He is worshipped at Kozha temple, showering his blessings. He is invoked by His devotees to fend off dangers and there are testimonies of people who were saved by Him. As per legends, it is one of the most ancient temples of Kerala with Narasimha (or Narasimha Murthy as he is reverentially addressed. Murthy = divine entity) as its main deity. ==See also== * Temples of Kerala ==External links== *Kozha Sree Narasimhaswami Temple *Vadakkumkoor *https://web.archive.org/web/20121126075217/http://www.keralapilgrimcenters.com/2012/06/kozha- sree-narasimhaswami-temple.html Category:Hindu temples in Kottayam district ","title":"Kozha sree narasimhaswami temple"},{"id":"35935550","text":"Jason Solomons (born 16 October 1969) is a British film critic, journalist, broadcaster and author. ==Career== Solomons is a critic who has appeared on BBC News, Sky News and BBC Radio and is the former Chairman of the London Film Critics' Circle.Rich Cline, \\"London Film Critics Appoint New Officers\\", The Critics' Circle, 9 October 2014.

Much of the biography was taken from Nelson Sayre, \\"Memorial, Julia Ann (sic) Gardner,\\" Bulletin of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists 45, (1961). was an American geologist who worked for the United States Geological Survey for 32 years, was known worldwide for her work in stratigraphy and mollusc paleontology.Obituary of Julia Anna Gardner in The Nautilus, Quarterly publication for Conchologists, Vol. 75, July, 1961-April 1962, p. 122-123. ==Early life and education== Gardner was born in Chamberlain, South Dakota, the only child of Charles Henry and Julia (Brackett) Gardner. At the very young age of 4 months, Julia's father died. Julia and her mother moved back to Dixon (the home of Julia's mother) in 1895, and then by 1898, they moved to North Adams, Mass; here, Julia completed her high school education at Drury Academy. Paying for it with money left to her by her grandmother. She was raised in South Dakota but completed high school in North Adams, Massachusetts. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1905 and a Master's degree in 1907 from Bryn Mawr College. She studied courses such as paleontology and geology. Gardner was the first woman admitted as a full-fledged student to the Department of Geology at Johns Hopkins University, and she earned her Ph.D. in paleontology there in 1911. She continued work as an assistant in paleontology at the university. The Maryland Geological Survey published her studies of the Late Cretaceous Mollusca of Maryland in 1916. ==Professional life== During World War I she served as an auxiliary nurse in France and worked with the American Friends Service Committee in devastated areas of France after the war, returning to the United States in 1920. She then joined the United States Geological Survey, spending most of her career studying the Tertiary beds in the coastal plain, including areas from Maryland south into Mexico. Her work in Texas in the 1920s included consultation with petroleum company geologists and identification of seventy new species of Texas fossils. She did extensive research of Gulf Coast fauna, including in Mexico during the 1930s and 1940s. Gardner served as a United States delegate to the 1926 International Geological Congress in Madrid, Spain and to the 1937 Congress in Moscow. During World War II, as a member of the Military Geology Unit, she became the leader of a group known as \\"The Dungeon Gang\\". Within this group she helped to prepare plans for the armed forces, organized texts, shared ideas, and created maps. Gardner was an incredibly hard worker and because of this she was well respected by all who worked with her. Over the course of the war, she helped find the Japanese beaches used to launch incendiary balloon bombs, where they were being launched by identifying shell fragments in the sand-filled ballast of the balloons.Julia Anna Gardner biography at Cartage.org.lb. After the war she toured Japan, encouraging Japanese scientists to continue their work. Gardner not only encouraged scientists, she also encouraged artists, for she showed interest in Art. Her versatility lead her to being a charter member of the Arts club in Washington. Gardner authored over 40 reports that were used as standards of reference regarding tertiary strata in North and South America. These include \\"The Midway Group of Texas\\" (Texas University Bulletin 3301, 1935); \\"Mollusca of the Tertiary Formations of Northeastern Mexico\\" (Geological Society of America, 1947); and \\"The molluscan fauna of the Alum Bluff group of Florida\\" (U.S. Geological Survey paper 142, 1926-1947). Gardner wrote papers that were primarily taxonomic, strategraphic or paleoecologic. Her published papers dealt mostly with coastal plain geology. Julia took part in fieldwork all over the world, including rougher locations such as those throughout Mexico. She spent weeks visiting and spending time in places that other geographers may not have dared visit. Her report on the \\"Mollusca from the Miocene and Lower Pliocene of Virginia and North Carolina\\" (Professional Paper 199-A), published in 1943, built partially on the work of Dr. W. C. Mansfield, and included work Gardner had started up to 20 years earlier. This report included systemic descriptions of over 40 families of mollusca, representing 24 superfamilies and four separate orders. In the year 1960 at the age of 78, Gardner died at her home in Maryland. ==Awards and honors== Gardner was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi societies, as well as the Geological Society of America, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, and the Paleontological Society. She served as president of the Paleontological Society in 1952 and vice presidency of the Geological Society of America in 1953. When she retired from the United States Geological Survey, she received the Distinguished Service Medal. Hundreds of people wrote Julia letters expressing their affection for her. The letters were bound into two volumes, which were presented to her by her Branch Chief, Preston Cloud when she entered retirement. She was recognized not only for her geological contributions but also for her great friendship. After her death the society published a memorial book.Harry Stephen Ladd, Memorial to Julia Anna Gardner, (1882-1960)], Geological Society of America (1962). Ecphora gardnerae, an extinct snail shell was named after Julia Anna Gardner. In 1994 the state of Maryland designated it the official state fossil shell of Maryland.

Buildings and structures on the Mall include the National Constitution Center (3rd block); the Independence Visitor Center and the Free Quaker Meetinghouse (2nd Block); and the President's House Memorial and the Liberty Bell Center (1st Block). A multi-level underground parking garage lies beneath much of the Second Block, and a small open-air café opened on the east side of the block in 2008.Inga Saffron, \\"Changing skyline: Adding coffee to the culture,\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer, July 4, 2008.

Byrne Federal Courthouse, and the Rohm & Haas Building to the west. ==History==  Conception  Independence Hall, with newly demolished First Block of Independence Mall, 1952. The groundwork for a park area surrounding Independence Hall was laid when the Historic Sites Act of 1935 was adopted. Even before Independence Hall was officially named a National Historic Site in 1943, Architect Roy F. Larson developed the original concept for the site now known as Independence Mall in 1937. His concept called for a 5-block mall extending from Chestnut to Callowhill Streets, and incorporating the approaches to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. and was strongly backed by the Independence Hall Association and its president, Judge Edwin O. Lewis. In 1947, as a national park was being assembled around Independence Hall, Lewis advocated that the federal government purchase the three blocks north of the historic building for the park. The National Park Service (NPS) was only interested in purchasing the First Block. His plan rejected, Lewis took the idea of a three-block mall to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, convincing legislators to build it as a state park and a monument to Pennsylvanians who had died in World War II, a concept that was never fully realized. Independence Mall State Park was created in the 1950s with the intention that the land would eventually be turned over to the NPS. Funded by 40-year state bonds, its construction was a joint venture between Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia, and was overseen by Edmund Bacon, director of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission. A couple hundred 18th-, 19th-, and 20th-century buildings were purchased and demolished for the project. Among these were the surviving walls of the President's House – the \\"White House\\" of George Washington and John Adams during the decade (1790–1800) that Philadelphia served as the temporary national capital. The only building not demolished was the Free Quaker Meetinghouse at the southwest corner of 5th & Arch Streets. It was relocated 30 feet to the west, so that 5th Street could be widened. It is important to note that the original approved design(s) for the Mall were created without involvement from the National Park Service. The first block closest to Independence Mall was completed in 1954. The design for the first block was developed by Wheelwright, Stevenson and Langren, a Philadelphia Landscape Architecture Firm. By their design, the block featured a central lawn surrounded by terraces, walkways and a formal allée of trees. The next block featured a central fountain and a square reflecting pool. It was also surrounded by terraces and two brick arcades to mimic the first block. The northernmost block was designed by Dan Kiley, a Landscape Architect influential in the modernist style. His 1963 plan was designed based on Philadelphia's original five-city-square layout. Each \\"square\\" was represented by fountains placed in scale to the Center City map. Surrounding the fountains was a regularly spaced array of 700 Honey Locust trees planted 12'-6\\" by 18' on-center within a brick paved plaza. The trees ultimately failed due to the tight spacing and urban environment; many were removed, degrading the overall design intent. National Park Service Takeover Independence Mall, circa 1959. The First Block (foreground) is completed. One third of the Second Block is completed, from Market to Filbert Streets, and named the \\"Judge Lewis Quadrangle.\\" The other two-thirds, Filbert to Arch Streets, will become the underground parking garage, with a plaza above. The buildings on the Third Block have not yet been demolished. Concurrent with construction activities through an Act of Congress on June 28, 1947, the Independence National Historic Park (INHP) was created. When it was formally established and first opened to the public on July 4, 1956, the National Park did not include any portion of the Mall. In 1972, the Mall was donated to the NPS and the boundary for the INHP was redefined. In 1974, ownership and operation of the entire Mall was officially transferred to the NPS. Prior to 1976, the Liberty Bell was housed within Independence Hall. In preparation for the Bicentennial celebration, the National Historical Park Advisory Committee made a proposal to have the Liberty Bell relocated outside of Independence Hall as the building was not able to accommodate the millions of visitors expected. The initial plan of 1972 to relocate the Liberty Bell to South Third Street and Chestnut, two blocks east, was met with resistance from residents of the city. An alternate plan was suggested in 1973 to construct a smaller pavilion north of Independence Hall between Race and Arch Streets, but that plan was also met with resistance. Mayor Frank Rizzo then suggested that the pavilion be placed in the block immediately north of the famous building. It was this later idea that prevailed and the plans were drafted to construct the new glass and steel pavilion at the north end of the first block of Independence Mall near Market Street. Designed by Romaldo Giurgola in 1974, ground breaking for construction occurred early in 1975. Later the same year, the Liberty Bell Pavilion would be complete. The bell was relocated as part of the New Years Eve celebration and the Pavilion first opened to the public on January 1, 1976 at 12:01 am. Greiff, pp. 208–14. This would be the official home of the Liberty Bell until October 9, 2003. In 1997, Independence Mall State Park was renamed and is now known as Independence National Historical Park. Renovation Independence Mall. A new master plan for the Independence National Historical Park was developed by the Landscape Architecture firm Olin Partnership (now known simply as OLIN). The extensive redesign proposed the removal of all previous structures, except the Free Quaker Meetinghouse. It proposed to focus all of the proposed buildings along 6th Street at the western edge of the park with smaller pocket parks along 5th Street to the east. The smaller parks along the eastern edge, some of which were raised above the central lawn, would provide more intimate gathering and sitting areas with extensive trees and other landscaping. Several straight brick pathways carved each of the lawn areas within each block including two lateral cuts through the first block corresponding to Ranstead Street and Ludlow Street to the east of the park. There was also a meandering curved path that connected the southeast corner at 5th and Chestnut Streets to the National Constitution Center at the north end of the park. ==Current Layout== Today, Independence Mall still consists of the original three blocks from the early 1945 concept. However, due to the redevelopment, several new features and buildings have been added to the overall design. With Independence Hall to the south, the first block north, between Chestnut and Market streets, is home to the Liberty Bell Center (completed in 2003) and President's House memorial. At the north end of this block is a large granite First Amendment area, also known as People's Plaza, where citizens are encouraged to exercise their First Amendment Rights. The second block, between Market and Arch Streets, contains the Independence Visitor Center (completed in 2001), the Free Quaker Meeting House and a small café. The third and final block, between Race and Arch Streets, is home to the National Constitution Center, which was completed in 2003. ==Gallery== File:Free Quaker Meeting House from northeast.jpgFree Quaker Meetinghouse.

He was the youngest son of Duke Ernest Günther, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and his wife, Auguste of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. In 1675, when his father negotiated with Count Peder Griffenfeld about a marriage with Frederick William's sister, he was promised a profitable post as provost of the Cathedral in Hamburg and governor of Als. He was appointed as provost in Hamburg in 1676, after chairman Kielmansegge died. When his father died in 1689, the will stated that his possessions would go to his widow, who would have the right to settle the succession. She made a decision, which was upheld by the King in 1692. Her eldest living son, Ernest Augustus, was excluded from the inheritance, because he had converted to Catholicism, leaving the Duchy to Frederick William, who was by then the only other surviving son. Almost simultaneously, Frederick William was also appointed governor of Sønderborg. However, when Ernest Augustus reverted to Lutheranism in 1695, he was appointed governor of Sønderborg, because he resided there. Ernest Augustus was also reinstated as heir of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg. Nevertheless, when Ernest Augustus died childless in 1731, Frederick William's son Christian August I would inherit the duchy. When his mother died in 1701, Frederick William inherited Augustenborg Palace, Rumohrsgaard Manor and Evelgunde Manor. In 1703, he purchased Avnbølgaard Manor in Sundeved. Frederick William served as a Major General in the Danish army. On 27 November 1694, he married Sophie Amalie, a daughter of the Chancellor, Frederik Ahlefeldt, Count of Langeland.

Though not officially belligerent during the Korean War (1950–1953), the Soviet Union played a significant, covert role in the conflict. It provided material and medical services, as well as Soviet pilots and aircraft, most notably MiG 15 fighter jets, to aid the North Korean- Chinese forces against the United Nations Forces. ==Background== Manchuria Offensive, October 1945. Soviet Occupation of Northern Korea (1945–1948) The Soviet 25th Army took part in the Soviet advance into northern Korea immediately after World War II had ended, and was headquartered at Pyongyang for a period. Like the American forces in the south, Soviet troops remained in Korea after the end of the war to rebuild the country. Soviet soldiers were instrumental in the creation and early development of the North Korean People's Army and Korean People's Air Force, as well as for stabilizing the early years of the Northern regime. The Shineuiju Air Force Academy was founded under Soviet leadership on 25 October 1945 in order to train new pilots. U.S. Marine with image of Stalin found in a bunker near Yudam-ni during Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, 27 November 1950 Cold War Japanese rule during the Second World War. Because at the time the war broke out in 1950, the Communist Soviet Union, China and their allies were already locked into a \\"Cold War\\" with capitalist countries, both sides felt that the Korean War carried the potential to further destabilize the precarious relations between both sides, while also offering possible advantages. In April 1950, Stalin gave Kim permission to invade the South under the condition that Mao would agree to send reinforcements if needed. Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the US. Kim met with Mao in May 1950. Mao was concerned the US would intervene but agreed to support the North Korean invasion. China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets. However, Mao sent more ethnic Korean PLA veterans to Korea and promised to move an army closer to the Korean border. Once Mao's commitment was secured, preparations for war accelerated.Mark O'Neill, \\"Soviet Involvement in the Korean War: A New View from the Soviet-Era Archives\\", OAH Magazine of History, Spring 2000, p. 21. As American and UN soldiers were already deployed in the war on the South Korean side, it was virtually assured that Soviet forces could not engage in open and direct hostilities against the South without provoking conflicts with other UN countries. Instead, the Soviet Union was compelled to conceal its participation in the conflict (at least to the extent where Soviet involvement could still be plausibly denied by the Soviet government) so as to minimize the risk of escalating the \\"Cold War\\" into a \\"Hot War\\" with NATO and the United States and its allies elsewhere, which could have led to a nuclear war. By officially denying its participation, the Soviets prevented the Korean War from escalating. Participation on the North Korean side was also contrary to the UN Security Council Resolution 84 by which the Soviet Union was technically bound. ==Soviet aid to North Korean forces== Medical aid Along with several \\"Eastern Bloc\\" countries (notably CzechoslovakiaRobert Dornan, Accounting for POW – MIAs from the Korean War and the Vietnam War (1996) pp. 31–32), the Soviet Union sent over 20 doctors to Korea to aid Communist forces there, similar to Indian, Italian, Norwegian, Danish and Swedish medical detachments in Southern Korea who did not have military force engaged, but merely offered humanitarian support instead. Material aid Soviet military aid was instrumental to equipping both the North Korean and Chinese forces fighting in Korea. The Soviet PPSh-41 submachine gun (nicknamed by US forces the \\"Burp Gun\\" after the sound it made) was widely supplied to both countries' armies, as was the T-34/85 medium tank which was of great importance during the initial offensives by the Communist side when no US armour (particularly the M24 Chaffee light tank) or anti-tank rockets (such as the M9 2.36-inch Bazooka) could penetrate its heavy sloped armour. Soviet material aid was also fundamental for the air forces of both North Korea and China. By April 1950, the Soviet Union had provided 63 of the North Korean Air Force's 178 aircraft, which until September 1950 proved highly effective against minimal South Korean air defenses (which was more heavily backed by US and UN air forces instead) ==Soviet air intervention== An important area in which Soviet intervention was key in the Korean War was in the air-war. Soviet innovation in aircraft design, as well as the experience of many of its pilots following the Second World War meant that the 'new' states of China and North Korea were dependent on Soviet help in this area. Both the Chinese and North Korean air forces were structured and equipped along Soviet lines because of the help that the Soviet Union had given them in their first years. In October 1950, the Chinese air force comprised only two fighter divisions, one bomber regiment, and one attack aircraft regiment (a total of two hundred combat planes) and was very much in its infancy. The Chinese committed several Air Regiments to Korea, and these were equipped with the Soviet-supplied MiG 15 fighters, however lack of training meant that the Chinese high command was anxious for Soviet pilots, some of whom were already in China tasked with training the pilots for the Chinese air force. Frustrated by the quality and shortage of Chinese pilots, in April 1951, Stalin took the decision to involve Soviet airforce pilots in the war, flying under the markings of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) or North Korean People's Army Air Force (KPAAF). In addition to the widely known MiG-15 force of 64th Fighter Corps, there were also significant anti-aircraft gun, searchlight and technical units despatched to Korea as part of the same unit. Soviet Pilots * Aleksandr Smorchkov (12 loss) * Nikolay Ivanov (6) * Semyon Fedorets (8) * Yevgeny Pepelyayev (19) * Sergei Kramarenko (13) Soviet pilots were active in Korea from April 1951. In order to hide this direct Soviet intervention, precautions were taken to disguise their involvement, open knowledge of which would have been a major diplomatic embarrassment for the USSR. Soviet pilots wore Chinese uniforms when flying, whilst rules were prescribed to stop Soviet pilots flying near the coast or front lines (where they might be captured if shot down) and from speaking Russian on the aircraft radio. All aircraft flown carried Chinese or North Korean markings.Georgi Lobov, \\"Black Spots of History: In the Skies of North Korea,\\" JPRS Report, JPRS-UAC-91-003 (28 June 1991), p. 30 When not flying, for reasons of ethnicity, on the ground Soviet pilots 'played' the roles of Soviet commercial travellers rather than Chinese or North Korean soldiers. Soviet pilots flying MiG-15 jets participated in battles around the Yalu River Valley on the Chinese-Korean border in the area known as \\"Mig Alley\\" and in operations against UN \\"trainbusting\\" attacks in Northern Korea, with considerable success. The lack of a shared language between Soviet, Chinese and North Korean pilots frequently led to incidences of friendly fire as other MiG fighters were mistaken for American F-86 Sabre jets and shot down.Jon Halliday, \\"Air Operations in Korea: The Soviet Side of the Story,\\" in William J. William, ed., A Revolutionary War: Korea and the Transformation of the Postwar World (Chicago, Illinois: Imprint Publications, 1993), p. 154 MiG-15s Chinese, Korean and Cyrillic The MiG-15 was a jet aircraft, supplied in large numbers to Chinese and North Korean forces during the war by the Soviet Union. Owing to their modern design (they were at least a match for the best American jet fighter of the time, the F-86 Sabre), they played a pivotal role in the air war. At the outbreak of the war, the North Koreans flying Soviet aircraft like the IL-10 ground attack aircraft and Yak-9P fighters were easily outclassed by modern American jet aircraft such as Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star and Republic F-84 Thunderjet fighters, which meant that UN forces quickly achieved air superiority. By contrast, when the MiG-15 appeared in Korea, it immediately challenged this air superiority, since it could outclass all fixed-wing American jets in Korea at the time (not to mention the aged propeller-driven P-51 Mustang). It is believed that Soviet pilots (who all flew MiG-15s) shot down 142-1,106 UN aircraft (depending on whose estimate is used) during the duration of the war, a higher kill total than that of comparable UN units. Despite this superior performance, the MiGs main goal was to counter the USAF B-29 Superfortress bombers rather than dogfight with other fighters. Recognising the importance of the MiG, the UN command devised Operation Moolah to encourage a MiG pilot to defect to South Korea with a functional MiG for testing. $100,000 (USD) and political asylum were offered as a reward, and North Korean pilot Lieutenant No Kum-Sok eventually defected in September 1953 (claiming to be unaware of the reward), finally providing the US with an example for testing. ==Contemporary awareness of Soviet participation== Modern Commemorative Medal for 64th Fighter Group Though the Soviet Union never acknowledged its participation in the conflict, it is clear that many suspected it. Soviet pilots, though forbidden from communicating in any language other than basic Korean across their radios, often resorted to Russian when stressed or when swearing. This was picked up by American pilots. Reports of Soviet involvement in the conflict quickly made their way up the United Nations chain of command. Nevertheless, reports of covert Soviet involvement were always denied by the Soviet Union, and the United States government was not inclined to press the issue so as to avoid escalating tensions further. It was only recently, through the publication of books by Chinese and Russian authors, such as Zhang Xiaoming, Leonid Krylov, Yuriy Tepsurkaev and Igor Seydov, that the extent of the Soviets' participation became clear. ==Legacy for Sino-Soviet relations== Contrary to expectations, the Soviet intervention in Korea did not inspire the Chinese leadership with confidence. Mao, in particular, felt betrayed that the Soviet leadership had refused to send infantry and armoured units, in addition to its MiG squadrons, and join the conflict openly beside China. There is evidence that the Chinese felt restricted by the Russians, who forced them to defer to the Soviet Union for technological and strategic support, but offered only minor support in exchange. Furthermore, the Chinese leadership felt humiliated by the Soviet decision to make the Chinese pay them for all the material support that they had received, which \\"made the Soviets seem more like arms merchants than genuine Communist internationalists.\\"Chen Jian and Yang Kuisong, \\"Chinese Politics and the Collapse of the Sino-Soviet Alliance,\\" in Odd Arne Westad, ed., Brother in Arms: The Rise and Fall of the Sino-Soviet Alliance, 1945–1963 (Washington, DC: Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1998), p. 257 In effect, Zhang Xiaoming argues that the Chinese came to feel that the Soviet Union was both an unreliable and demanding ally and took greater steps to ensure autarky from the USSR in the years following the War. In 1960, China broke from the Soviet Union in an event known today as the Sino-Soviet Split, creating a rift amongst all communist powers which were expected to pick one side of the divide. The North Korean regime, which bordered both countries, successfully navigated the split by playing one power off the other. It did not firmly align with either power until the Soviet reforms under Mikhail Gorbachev compelled the regime to align with China. This split, certainly influenced by the Korean War shaped relations between the two countries until 1989. ==See also== *Soviet Involvement in the Vietnam War == References  *Zhang Xiaoming, China, the Soviet Union, and the Korean War: From an Abortive Air War Plan to a Wartime Relationship, Journal for Conflict Studies (Vol. XXII No. 1 Spring 2002) *Russian Aces of the Korean War *64th Fighter Air Corps in Korea *Wilson Center, Soviet aims in Korea and the Origins of the Korean War 1945-50 - New Evidence *Wilson Center, The Sino- Soviet Alliance and China's Entry to the Korean War *Wilson Center, CWIHP Bulletin 6-7 * КОРЕЙСКАЯ ВОЙНА 1950 – 1953 ГГ Category:Korea–Soviet Union relations Category:Korean War Category:Cold War history of the Soviet Union Category:Cold War military history of the Soviet Union ","title":"Soviet Union in the Korean War"},{"id":"35936193","text":"NVC community M24 (Molinia caerulea - Cirsium dissectum fen-meadow)is one of the 38 mire communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system. ==Community Composition== The following species are found in this community * Molinia caerulea (Purple Moor Grass) * Cirsium dissectum (Meadow Thistle) ==References== * JNCC Report No. 394 The European context of British Lowland Grasslands J.S.

It is in the historic St James Street neighbourhood, within the medieval town walls. The Grange was originally built by Captain Charles Philipps at the site of a former farm house. It was the residence of the Kane family and, later, the Windsor family. The buildings also served as a preparatory school, one of the schools of the Haberdashers' Company, until 2009. In 2011, the buildings were converted into a boarding house for students of Monmouth School, another Haberdashers' Company school. ==History and design== During the eighteenth century, much of the north side of St James Street in Monmouth was devoted to a farm house, barn, stable, buildings for oxen, and an enclosure for sheep or cattle. The Grange is located at the site of the former farm house, and was constructed by Captain Charles Philipps. After having lived at Monnow Street in the mid nineteenth century, the Kane family lived at The Grange on St James Street for at least fifty years. At the time of the 1861 and 1871 census enumerations, John Joseph Kane, Esquire, a native of Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England, resided at The Grange with his wife Sarah Ann, adult children, and servants. Kane continued to live there in 1875, and died the following year on 1 October 1876. In 1881, his widow Sarah Ann, a native of Monmouth, lived there with her two spinster daughters. Sisters Sarah Ann and Ellen Kane, both born in Monmouth, resided there in 1891, 1901, and 1911. At the time of those census enumerations, the address of The Grange was recorded as 14 St James Street, and in 1911 the main house had sixteen rooms. In 1923 and 1934, Frederick Reuben Windsor, an electrical engineer, resided at The Grange. A native of Bushey, Hertfordshire, England, Windsor lived there until his death on 25 February 1955. The Grange at 12–16 St James Street now consists of three connected buildings on the northwest side of the street, as well as an extension at the back of the property. Located within the medieval town walls built around 1300, all three houses are Grade II listed. The three- storey, five-bay main house is currently recorded at 12 St James Street and has railings in front of the street elevation. The listed building has a slate roof and an eighteenth or early nineteenth-century facade with band courses and quoins. The entrance features a pedimented porch with Doric columns and a transom (fanlight). The entablature of the pedimented porch has a frieze with a metope in the style of the Brothers Adam. The pediment has a firemark, a plaque noting that the building owner had given financially to the town fire department. The red brick building next to The Grange at 10 St James Street was once its stable. ==The Grange preparatory school== The Grange, the buildings on St James Street, should be distinguished from The Grange, the preparatory school of the Haberdashers' Company, also known as the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers. While the buildings on St James Street housed the prep school for boys ages seven to eleven for decades, in February 2009 the school moved across the River Wye into new quarters on Hadnock Road, east of the town centre. The site chosen for the new preparatory school is in close proximity to Monmouth School's Sports Complex. The new building was designed by the architectural team of Buttress Fuller Alsop Williams. In addition to classroom space, the new Grange includes a garden, kitchen, ICT suite, science laboratory, and art and music facilities. Pupils at The Grange use the Monmouth School's chapel and sports facilities. While students and staff had already started using the new school building on Hadnock Road in February 2009, it wasn't officially dedicated until 23 September 2009. On that day, the new building was formally opened as The Grange, Monmouth Preparatory School, retaining the name of the school's former quarters. HRH Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, officiated at the September opening ceremonies. After arriving by helicopter, Prince Edward was greeted by the heads of Monmouth School and The Grange, and introduced to town officials. The ceremony included comments from the prince and Elaine Thomas, Head of The Grange. Prince Edward unveiled the commemorative plaque for the new Grange. His visit that day was his third to the Haberdashers' Monmouth Schools since having become a Haberdasher himself. Before the recent move to Hadnock Road, children from the St James Street school distinguished themselves in chess, winning Britain's 2003 national title as under-11 chess champions. ==The Grange boarding house== On 19 August 2010, the Monmouthshire County Council released details of an application to redevelop the former prep school at St James Street as a sixth form boarding facility for older students at Monmouth School. Housing for staff members was planned as well. The application indicated that there were three Grade II listed, connected buildings, as well as an extension that had been added at a later date. The plan was to include a new addition that would be attached to the extant extension at the back of the property. On 13 and 14 December 2010, it was announced that permission for the conversion of The Grange from a prep school to a boarding house had been granted. The alteration of The Grange is a component of the first phase of The Heart Project, a substantial renovation of Monmouth School which has recently been undertaken. The new boarding house opened in September 2011 for students in their last year, with Kingsley Jones as housemaster of the new boarding accommodation. ==See also== * St James Street, Monmouth * Monmouth School == References  External links == * The Grange - Hadnock Road * Monmouthshire County Council * Monmouth School - The Heart Project Category:Houses in Monmouth, Wales Category:Cadw Category:Grade II listed buildings in Monmouthshire Category:Haberdashers' Schools ","title":"The Grange, Monmouth"},{"id":"35936201","text":"Nicole Arrold (born 7 November 1981) is an Australian field hockey player who competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics and in the 2008 Summer Olympics.

He was educated privately and at Balliol College, Oxford. He joined the Diplomatic Service in 1897 and served in British embassies or legations in Turkey, Egypt, China, France, Russia, Morocco, Argentina, Paraguay, Spain, Greece, and in the Foreign Office. At the outbreak of the First World War he was released from the Foreign Office to serve in the Bedfordshire Yeomanry, rising to the rank of major. After the war, in 1919 he was appointed British delegate to, and president of, the international financial commission which had been established in Athens following the Greco- Turkish War (1897) to oversee the public finances of Greece, and also to the Inter-Allied Financial Commission that oversaw loans to help the Greek government recover from the war. Russell was then appointed Minister to Ethiopia 1920–25; Minister to Switzerland 1928–31; and Ambassador to Portugal 1931–35. Claud Russell was knighted KCMG in the King's Birthday Honours of 1930. The Portuguese government awarded him the Grand Cross of the Order of Christ. During the Second World War, at the age of 69, Sir Claud enlisted in the Home Guard. He rented Trematon Castle 1939–59Trematon Castle and died there on his 88th birthday. As Ambassador to Lisbon he was one of very few senior diplomats to write favourably on whether women should be admitted to the Diplomatic Service. In his contribution to the Shuster Committee review in 1934 he said, \\"I have an instinctive prejudice in favour of change, which I associate with improvement and reform ... I do not see why a woman should not cohabit at her post with her husband [particularly if he were] a man of letters or a craftsman of any sort ... We live in a changing world, and no-one can say how mankind will regard anything in 1959.

The company was founded in 1986 by Jan Poot in The Hague. Chipshol owns land around Schiphol Airport, with both residential and commercial locations. In total, Chipshol controlled 1483 acres of land. The company is headquartered in a business park near the airport. The name Chipshol is derived from the name of the airport - Schiphol - and \\"Chip\\", from the high-tech industry which Poot plans to bring to the region in a new airport city. == Chipshol Affair == The Chipshol Affair is a legal issue over land around Schiphol. The matter revolves around the Chipshol company, the Dutch central government, the judiciary and Schiphol airport. In the mid 1980s Jan Poot began to acquire farming land in the area of Schiphol airport. Chipshol, the company which he subsequently formed to manage the assets and which is run by his son Peter, is the largest private owner of land in the area adjacent to the airport. Imagining that cities would grow around airports, as Amsterdam itself had grown around its seaport, Poot sought to build an Airport City. Poot presented his plans to the Management of Schiphol airport, but was turned away. Chipshol then ran into development issues when the airport expressed concerns for aviation safety and other considerations that were not applied to other developers in the same vicinity. In the 1980s, the company owned over 1200 acres, and after the lawsuits and planning measures, the Poot's lost control of over 900 acres. Since then, a sequence of events outlined in several lawsuits occurred that saw significant portions of the Poot's land confiscated with the help of the judiciary and Schiphol officials. Jan Poot (87) and his son CEO Peter Poot (57) started approximately one hundred lawsuits to recover the land. Recently, a Dutch clerk revealed two vice presidents of The Hague court had close ties to Chipshol's opponents. It is alleged to be the reason Chipshol lost the majority of its land. Jan Poot charged perjury in 2009, and only after public and media pressure did the Public Prosecutor decide to prosecute the judges, being the first time in Dutch legal history. Two judges of The Hague court are now accused of corruption and conspiracy to prevent Chipshol from building its airport city. Pieter Kalbfleisch, a former chairman of the Dutch Competition Authority NMA, is one of the judges named. The other judge, Hans Westenberg, and Kalbfleisch are charged with perjury by the Public Prosecutor. == References  External links == * Official website Chipshol * The Chipshol Affair * \\"Chipshol, What happened?\\", artikel RTV Noord-Holland, 2 November 2010 * Interview Peter Poot, TROS Nieuwsshow, 9 April 2011 Category:Economy of the Netherlands Category:Haarlemmermeer ","title":"Chipshol"},{"id":"35936605","text":"Tandil (, also Romanized as Tandīl) is a village in Qaen Rural District, in the Central District of Qaen County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

He served in the War of 1812 and was a renowned healer and orator among Indians and whites. Modern-day historian Laurence Hauptman describes George as an Iroquoian conservative who supported traditional Iroquoian ceremonies, language, and land rights, but also allowed missionaries and schools on the reservation. ==Early life== George was born on the Buffalo Creek Reservation into the Wolf Clan of the Onondaga people. His physical appearance is described repeatedly in historical records, which historian Laurence Hauptman summarizes as a \\"thin, sinewy man with strongly marked features,\\" conveying \\"athletic prowess and presence\\". Accounts note that George was well known for his running abilities and was a consistent victor in foot races. ==Service in the War of 1812== George served on the American side during the War of 1812 in defense of the Niagara Frontier for at least three years, and was paid a $120 pension. During the war, George reportedly ran a round trip from American headquarters at Buffalo to the arsenal Canandaigua (a distance of 150 miles) in two days. Hauptman notes a gap in historical information about George after the War of 1812 until the mid 1840s, when George and his wife and five children moved to Onondaga. ==Years as chief== In 1850, George became a chief, \\"taking the name Hononwirehdonh, the 'Great Wolf', the hereditary keeper of the wampum held by a member of the Wolf Clan of the Onondaga Nation\\". In this role, George fought to restore traditional Indian government on the Allegany Reservation and Cattaraugus Reservation. At the time, state policies pursued a four-pronged \\"Americanization\\" agenda, including missionary activities, state-supported schooling, division of tribal lands to individual Indians, and awarding Indians U. S. citizenship in return for acceptance of the new land ownership arrangements. George was a renowned orator who used his skill to influence the Iroquois Confederacy. He also frequently spoke at public events, where his speeches were translated into English. He was described by his contemporary, Episcopal minister William Beauchamp as \\"eloquent\\" and \\"full of official dignity\\" and \\"fond of storytelling\\". During the American Civil War, more than three hundred Iroquois Indians joined the Union. George was the leading spokesman of the Iroquois to Washington at the time. By 1863, he was recognized as the \\"Principal Chief of the Six Nations\\" by federal officials, who also awarded him the honorary rank of brevet general. George met with President Abraham Lincoln in November 1863 to discuss Iroquois objections to the Enrollment Act, and convinced him to release Iroquois from duty who had not received the \\"bounties\\" owed them. (According to the Act, men who did not want to enroll could pay someone else to enter the service in their place). George continued to negotiate for the discharge of underage Iroquois, as well as object to \\"conscription of Indians into military service without prior tribal consent,\\" as was specified by historical precedent and treaties. ==Healer== George served as a \\"traditional medicine man\\" for much of his life and in 1869 was appointed \\"government physician\\" to the Onondaga, and was formally licensed to practice medicine. Government official R. H. Gardner stated \\"I believe Captain George can doctor the Indians as well as a white man. After considerable experience on the subject, I believe that the Indians live under his treatment and are as healthful as when treated by any other physician\\". ==Death== George served as chief of the Onondaga until his death on September 24, 1873. Although he never converted to Christianity and was buried according to Iroquois rites, Episcopal leaders delivered a sermon at his funeral. ==NotesReferences== * ==Archival Materials== * Onondaga Nation Territory Collection, ca. 1845-1900 includes photograph of Sam George, Onondaga Historical Association Research Center, 321 Montgomery Street, Syracuse, NY 13202.

The next day, the traumatized Deanna subdues a burglar who breaks into her apartment using the rapist's abandoned stun gun. Deanna, convinced the intruder is the same man who raped her, ties the burglar up, strips him down to nothing but his underwear and balaclava, and takes some of his blood. At work, Deanna steals urine samples, makes plans to go out with a friend and co-worker named Leanna on Thursday, and asks her boss, Doctor Tyson, to compare the burglar's blood to a swab of semen she had collected after being raped. Deanna tells Doctor Tyson that a friend was raped, and that the blood belongs to her ex-boyfriend, who she suspects was her assailant. Back at home, Deanna tortures the burglar by covering him in the urine samples, burning him with a blow torch, and jabbing him with syringes. When Thursday arrives, Deanna goes out to a nightclub with Leanne, and hours later returns to her building severely intoxicated. While stumbling up to her apartment, Deanna bumps into a neighbor and acquaintance named Trevor, who she seduces and has sex with. A relationship develops between the two, as Deanna becomes further unhinged, and begins suffering from nightmares. She also continues to torture the burglar, dressing in fetish-wear attire for the occasions, and attaining an almost sexual gratification from the man's suffering. One day, Deanna gives the burglar a handjob, and afterward destroys his genitals with needles and the blow torch. A week after castrating the burglar, Deanna hires a gigolo drug addict to sodomize him. While the addict has his way with the burglar, Deanna leaves and goes to Trevor's apartment. There, Deanna discovers circumstantial evidence indicating Trevor was her rapist, walks in on Trevor and Leanne having sex, and attacks them with a circular saw that was among Trevor's carpentry tools. Deanna beheads Leanne with the saw, and bashes Trevor's face in with it. Returning to her apartment, Deanna murders the gigolo by stabbing him in the neck with a knife after he reveals the burglar had died at some point during the rape. Deanna then goes to the hospital in search of Doctor Tyson, spotting him seated in his parked car, dressed like her rapist and surrounded by sadistic pornography and stun guns identical to the one she was attacked with. When Doctor Tyson tries to pull her into the car, Deanna jams a cigarette lighter into one of his eyes, and knocks him out with one of the stun guns. Having finally found her rapist, Deanna abducts Doctor Tyson, and the film ends as she prepares to torture him. == Cast == * Michelle Boback as Deanna * Tamara Pender as Leanne * Daniel Lomas as Doctor Tyson * Ryan Haneman as Trevor * Rob Scattergood as Hustler * Peter Speers as 2nd Hustler * Rob Carpenter as Lounge MD * Christ Stanley as Patient * Sarah Bergeest as Patient * Nicole Hancock as Reception Nurse * Willard Cochrane as Curious John == Soundtrack == * \\"Fritz Haarman der Metzger\\" performed by Macabre from the album Murder Metal. * \\"Reign in Blood\\" performed by Ill Bill featuring Necro from the album Necro Presents: Brutality Pt. 1. * \\"Fire\\" performed by Necro from the album Necro Presents: Brutality Pt. 1. * \\"Upon Freyed Lips of Silence\\" performed by Necrophagia from the album The Divine Art of Torture. * \\"Parasite Eve\\" performed by Necrophagia from the album The Divine Art of Torture. * \\"Flowers of Flesh and Blood\\" performed by Necrophagia from the album The Divine Art of Torture. * \\"The Big Sleep\\" performed by Goretex from the album Necro Presents: Brutality Pt. 1. * \\"Scumbags\\" performed by Goretex featuring Necro from the album Necro Presents: Brutality Pt. 1. * \\"Festering Beneath the Fog\\" performed by Ravenous from the album Blood Delerium. * \\"Nightmares in a Damaged Brain\\" performed by Ravenous from the album Blood Delerium. * \\"Cheap Transistor Radio\\" performed by SNFU from the album In the Meantime and In Between Time. == Release == Torched was first released in edited form as a segment in co-creator Creepy Six Films's women's revenge-themed anthology Hell Hath No Fury on March 6, 2007.

This edition was limited to 666 copies, and included a commentary and interview with Ryan Nicholson, and a fifteen-minute making-of featurette titled Behind the Burn: The Making of Torched. == Reception == Torched was praised by Film Bizarro, which wrote \\"Even though Torched may lack the realism that's in a movie like Irréversible and is over-the-top with its violence; it is still plenty shocking and brutal enough that I believe it qualifies as one of the more nasty rape-revenge films to be made. It isn't just a shallow exploitation film, there is some genuine character development in the movie, and while the rape scene itself didn't really have the punch that other movies have, the torture and balls-out violence in the end will leave the viewers both disturbed and satisfied. A perfect score of seven was awarded by Independent Flicks, which stated \\"Torched is brutal, sick and twisted! It's a disturbing and creepy film and I recommend it highly to hardcore horror fans!\\" The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre had a negative response to the film, calling it \\"Amateurish extreme sickness\\". Almost every aspect of Torched was criticized by Soiled Sinema, which felt that it offered nothing of interest besides admittedly impressive gore, and unintentional hilarity. == References  External links == * * Category:2004 films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian splatter films Category:2004 horror films Category:Exploitation films Category:Canadian short films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Vancouver Category:Rape and revenge films Category:Films shot in Vancouver Category:2004 direct-to-video films Category:Direct-to-video horror films Category:Films about male prostitution in Canada Category:Films directed by Ryan Nicholson Category:2004 directorial debut films ","title":"Torched (film)"},{"id":"35936622","text":"Zuk (, also Romanized as Zūk, Zaug, Zowk, and Zūg) is a village in Qaen Rural District, in the Central District of Qaen County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

He is the founder of the Ornithological Council and known for his study of the migratory systems, patterns, and geographic variations of North American birds, primarily focusing on the research and analysis of white-fronted geese. In 2011, Banks was named to the Smithsonian's newly created Hall of Fame, established by the Department of Vertebrate, Zoology. The honor was made in recognition of Banks as one of the most influential ornithologists associated with the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH). == Personal background == Richard Charles Banks was born on April 19, 1931 in Steubenville, Ohio. He attended Steubenville High School, graduating in 1949. During his youth, Banks was an Eagle Scout and enjoyed bird watching. He often participated with his father, who was an amateur birdwatcher and a member of the Wilson Ornithological Society. In 1953, Banks attended his first Wilson Ornithological Society meeting with his parents.http://vertebrates.si.edu/backbone_archive/2008-04_BB.pdf In fall 1949, Banks enrolled in classes at Ohio State University and participated in Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). He graduated in 1953 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Wildlife Conservation, after which he joined the US Army in post-war South Korea, qualifying to serve in the Medical Service Corps, due to his training in biology. After Banks returned from Korea in 1955, he enrolled in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley. He earned his Masters (1958) and Ph.D. (1961) degrees under the guidance of doctoral advisor, Alden H. Miller. He was subsequently hired at Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, serving as an assistant curator, specializing in the research and study of white-crowned sparrows.http://www.aba.org/birding/v41n2p18.pdf In 1962, while working at the San Diego Natural History Museum, he met his future wife, Gladys Sparks. They married in 1967. Together, they have two sons, Randy and David. == Professional background == Toward the end of his final year at Berkeley, Banks participated in a scientific expedition to Cerralvo Island in the Gulf of California. While exploring, he recognized differing characteristics in some of the migratory birds that he was collecting. This discovery led him to apply for a National Science Foundation grant to continue his research. As a result of his findings, he is recognized for naming three subspecies of birds that were indigenous to the island. In 1962, following the completion of his grant, he was offered a job as curator of the birds and mammals collections and exhibits at the San Diego Natural History Museum. In 1966, Banks joined the staff at the Fish and Wildlife Service in the National Museum of Natural History, where he served as the chief of the bird section. After Richard H. Manville retired, Banks was promoted to director of the Bird and Mammal Labs of the museum. He served as a curator of the Bird Project for the Biological Survey, USGS Biological Resources Discipline, portion of the NMNH for over 38 years, officially retiring in 2005. , he remains active at the National Museum, recognized as an Emeritus Research Zoologist. In addition to his work with the National Museum of Natural History, Banks is recognized for establishing the Ornithological Council. He became active in the American Ornithologists' Union, where he was elected secretary in 1969 and served as president from 1994 to 1996, having previously served in the same capacity with the Wilson Ornithological Society and the Biological Society of Washington. In 1971, Banks became a member of the American Ornithologists' Union's Committee on Classification and Nomenclature. The Committee publishes the Checklist of North American Birds, which is the official source on the taxonomy of birds in North America. In 1976, the Union began publishing a quarterly newsletter at the recommendation of Banks, who was named as editor. The Ornithological Newsletter was eventually published on a bimonthly basis and circulated to over 5,000 ornithologists. In 1983, Banks participated in the publication of the sixth edition of the Checklist of North American Birds. From 1995 to 2007, he served as the Chair of the Committee. He oversaw publication of the seventh edition in 1997. == Honors and awards == * 1991–1993: President, Wilson Ornithological Society * 1992: Honorary Member, Cooper Ornithological Society * 1994–1996: President, American Ornithologists' Union * 1998: Marion Jenkinson Service Award, American Ornithologists' Union * 1999: Scientific Achievement Award, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center * 2001–: President, American Association of Zoological Nomenclature * 2008: William and Nancy Klamm Service Award – Wilson Ornithological Club * 2011: Smithsonian Institution Hall of Fame – Department of Vertebrate Zoology == Published works == * Banks, Richard C.

A past winner of the Toyota All-Star Showdown and champion of the NASCAR Midwest Tour, he has also completed in the NASCAR Nationwide Series the ASA Midwest Tour. ==Career== Born in Sparta, Wisconsin on May 10, 1979, Schendel began competing in NASCAR-sanctioned competition in 2000, racing locally at the La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway. After several years competing in the regional Elite Series, he won the 2006 NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Midwest Series championship, the final year the tour ran under NASCAR sanctioning. The championship won Schendel a sport in the AutoZone Elite Division portion of the 2006 Toyota All-Star Showdown at Irwindale Speedway, where he won the all-star event, leading 112 of 130 laps in the event, which was extended in a green-white-checker finish from a scheduled 125 laps. Following the closure of the NASCAR Midwest Series, Schendel has competed in the ASA Midwest Tour, which replaced it; his best finish in the series standings has been third in 2008. He also competed in selected races in the ARCA Racing Series and NASCAR Busch East Series in 2006 and 2007, as well as in three Craftsman Truck Series races in the mid-2000s. Schendel debuted in NASCAR in 2004 with two Craftsman Truck Series starts. He made his first start at the Milwaukee Mile in his home state track, starting 28th and finishing 22nd. After failing to qualify at Indianapolis Raceway Park, he made his second start at Homestead-Miami Speedway and finished 28th after crashing. Schendel made his first NASCAR Nationwide Series start in a 2006 start at the Memphis. He completed 51 laps before an accident took him out of the race; he finished last. In addition to competing in the ASA Midwest Tour, Schendel competed on a limited schedule in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, primarily driving the No. 52 Chevrolet for Jimmy Means Racing.

He was born at 3800 mts in Oruro, Bolivia, and then studied medicine at the Universidad Mayor de San Andres in the city of La Paz, at 3513 mt above sea level, all his work was focused on initially high altitude physiology and later evolved to high altitude pathology. He proposed new concepts and understanding of what was known as Chronic mountain sickness. This pathology characterized by an increase of red blood cells, cyanosis, ventilatory and respiratory alterations with pulmonary hypertension and hypertrophy of the right ventricle seen at high altitude, above the normal values for such altitude, was originally affirmed to be due to \\"loss of adaptation\\". He changed this interpretation, as he strongly stood for “The organic systems of human beings and all other species tend to adapt to any environmental change and circumstance within an optimal period of time, and never tend towards regression which would inevitably lead to death”.http://altitudeclinic.com/blog/2010/07/forever-loss- of-adaptation-does-not-exist/ This concept has indeed changed the way high altitude diseases are interpreted. On July 9, 1970, Zubieta-Castillo founded the first high altitude clinic in the world located in La Paz, Bolivia High Altitude Pathology Institute. One of his theories was the proposal that man has the extraordinary capability to adapt to live in the hypoxic environment of the highest point on the planet Earth: the summit of Mount Everest.Zubieta- Castillo, G.; Zubieta-Calleja, GR, Zubieta-Calleja, L.

He toured Argentina with Sir TEW Brinckman's XI in late 1937 and early 1938, making a single first-class appearance on the tour against the Argentine national team at the Belgrano Athletic Club in Buenos Aires. He scored a century in the Brinckman XIs' first-innings, making 104 runs before he was dismissed by K. S. Bush.

The theory was first suggested in 1989 by Stephen Jay Gould in his book Wonderful Life. == Evolutionary iconography == In Wonderful Life, Stephen Jay Gould discusses the iconography of evolution in popular culture and the damaging effects of the march of progress on public understanding of the theory. The march of progress, Gould argues, has led to the popular interpretation that the evolution of increased mental powers, ultimately culminating in the development of man’s complex brain, is the natural outcome of evolution. Thus, the term “Evolution” is often conflated with a linear progression of life towards ever-increasing mental powers and a “comfortable view of human inevitability and superiority.” Gould argues that the definition of Evolution to professional biologists is “adaptation to changing environments”, not progress, and that the composition of life on the planet is rather a “copiously branching bush, continually pruned by the grim reaper of extinction, not a ladder of predictable progress.” In an error that Gould refers to as “life’s little joke”, he discusses society’s obsession with unsuccessful lineages as “textbook cases” of “evolution”. To elaborate, we consistently seek out “a single line of advance from the true topology of copious branching. In this misguided effort, we are inevitably drawn to branches so near the brink of total annihilation that they retain only one surviving twig. We then view this twig as the acme of upward achievement, rather than the probable last grasp of a richer ancestry.” Gould uses the evolution of the horse to illustrate this point, as the unbroken connection between Hyracotherium (formerly called Eohippus) and Equus provides an apparent linear path from simplicity to complexity. The only reason the evolution of horses has become the canonical representation of progressive evolution is because their bush has been extremely unsuccessful. Instead, Gould argues, we should look to bats, antelopes, and rodents as champions of mammalian evolution as they present us with “thousands of twigs on a vigorous bush” and are the true embodiments of evolutionarily successful groups. == The cone vs the pyramid == Gould argues that the conventional view of evolution, as illustrated by the cone of increasing diversity, is flawed. It is typically assumed that early life is restricted in form, and from this restriction of form follows diversification into the variety of animal life that currently exists. This cone can be visualized as an inverted Christmas tree, with a narrow base and numerous branches proliferating outward into the present day. Gould presents an alternative hypothesis, however, which states that the history of life is better described as “decimation followed by diversification within a few remaining stocks”, represented as a pyramid with a wide base of anatomical disparity that becomes increasingly constrained by natural selection and extinction level events as time moves forward. This is evidenced by the fact that the fossils excavated from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia represent a paleo-ecosystem with much greater anatomical disparity than currently exists and that fewer phyla exist today compared to the Cambrian seas. Gould offers the view that life during the Cambrian explosion quickly proliferated into the diversity of forms seen today due to the availability of numerous ecological niches and was subsequently decimated by extinction level events throughout geological time. He also notes that the survival of groups following extinction events bears no relationship to traditional notions of Darwinian success in normal times. For example, Ultimately, Gould explains, both the false iconography of the march of progress and our allegiance to the cone of increasing diversity have led us astray in our thinking about trends in evolutionary biology. == Replaying the \\"Tape of Life\\" == The central question proposed by Wonderful Life is that if life initially proliferated into a greater variety of phyla than currently exist and were subsequently decimated by the stochastic grim reaper of extinction, what then can be said about the inevitability of human intelligence and superiority? Additionally, Gould asks what role historical contingencies play in the evolution of life on Earth. It is these central ideas which prompt Gould to propose a thought experiment called “replaying the tape of life.” Its central essence is this: if we rewind the clock and replay the history of life on Earth numerous times, will we consistently see the same outcome that is the reality we experience today? The outcome of this thought experiment has two possible interpretations, elaborated by Gould, Gould’s opinion, and the central argument of Wonderful Life, is that “any replay of the tape of life would lead evolution down a pathway radically different from the road actually taken.” Additionally, Gould argues, no outcome can be predicated from the start, but the resulting pattern that emerges after replaying the tape of life would be just as interpretable and logical as our current situation. == References == Category:Biology theories Category:Evolutionary biology ","title":"Wonderful life theory"},{"id":"35936881","text":"Emily Hurtz (born 2 January 1990) is an Australian field hockey player. ==References== Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Australian female field hockey players Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in field hockey Category:Commonwealth Games gold medallists for Australia Category:Female field hockey forwards Category:Field hockey players at the 2010 Commonwealth Games ","title":"Emily Hurtz"},{"id":"35936886","text":"The Oak Ridger is an American daily newspaper published Mondays through Fridays in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

This species is a rhizomatous perennial grass with stems growing up to tall. The leaves are up to long and the ligule is very short. There are small terminal and axillary panicles bearing flowers. The panicles are purple in color.Panicum abscissum. USDA NRCS Plant Fact Sheet. The spikelets are just a few millimeters in length. Most of the plant's growth occurs in March through June. It blooms most heavily after a fire, and rarely blooms in the absence of fire. This grass grows in seepage bogs on the Lake Wales Ridge and other ridges in central Florida, an area of high plant endemism. It occurs on moist slopes that receive moisture from areas at higher elevation. It may be found near ponds in Florida scrub, or scrubby habitat, and in marshy flatwoods. Cutthroat grass communities are heavily dominated by the cutthroat grass species. They occur in a number of habitat types, but all are dependent on wildfire for their natural maintenance. Fire keeps the open grassland free of large and woody vegetation. The most distinctive cutthroat grass community is the cutthroat seepage slope, a range of microhabitat types defined by elevation and the water table.Cutthroat grass communities.

Adopted and raised in England by George Pakenham Despard, he accompanied his father to Chile with the Patagonian Missionary Society. After an attack by indigenous people, in 1869 Bridges' father, Despard, left the mission at Keppel Island of the Falkland Islands, to return with his family to England. At the age of 17, Bridges stayed with the mission as its new superintendent. In the late 1860s, he worked to set up a mission at what is now the town of Ushuaia along the southern shore of Tierra del Fuego Island. Ordained and married during a trip to Great Britain in 1868-1869, Bridges returned to the Falkland Islands with his wife. They settled at the mission at Ushuaia, where four of their six children were born. He continued to work with the Selk'nam (Ona) and Yaghan peoples for nearly 20 more years. On Bridges' retirement from missionary service in 1886, the Argentine government gave him a large grant of land. He became a sheep and cattle rancher. As a young man, Bridges had learned the indigenous language of Yamana and closely studied the culture over his lifetime. Over more than a decade, he compiled a grammar and dictionary in Yamana-English of more than 30,000 words. His son Lucas Bridges donated the work to the British Library of London in 1930. Part of the dictionary was published in 1933, then consisting only of the Yamana-English portion. That was edited and published commercially in 1987, since reprinted in 2011. An English-Yamana manuscript, dated 1865, was discovered in the British Library by Alfredo Prieto. The two portions have been published together online at the Patagonian Bookshelf website to provide free access. ==Early life== Thomas was born in England in 1842. According to local legend, he was later found abandoned on a bridge in Bristol, by George Despard, the chaplain of the Clifton Union.UK Census 1851 Westbury-on-Trym entry no 147 Despard adopted Bridges and another boy, educating them in a private school that he ran. Later, upon being told of the adoption, Thomas \\"chose for himself the surname Bridges in honor of the meeting that had saved his life.\\" There is no record of Thomas Bridges in the 1851 UK census. He is believed to be registered as George H. Bridges among the listed students at the private school run by George Despard. The name change was likely due to a transcription error. ==Expedition== From 1853 to 1855, Despard was curate at Holy Trinity Church in Lenton, Nottingham.The Magazine of Lenton Local History Society, Lenton Times, Issue 7, He had previously lived in Bristol where he met Allen Gardiner, a commander in the Royal Navy. Gardiner led expeditions to Tierra del Fuego in southern Argentina. Gardiner tried but was unable to make contact with the indigenous people in Tierra del Fuego. Despard, then secretary of the Patagonian Missionary Society, led the next expedition to the area. He took with him his second wife and his children: four daughters, Emily, Bertha, Florence and Harriet, and his son Emilius. He also took Thomas Bridges, then about 13 years old. This trip was much more successful than earlier ones. Despard made contact with the local indigenous people and persuaded several to go to Keppel Island of the Falklands, where there was a mission and the climate was less severe. Some of the natives learned English while on Keppel Island. Some of the English party, Thomas Bridges in particular, learned the local language of Yámana. ==Missionary work== After an attack on the Allen Gardiner, Despard petitioned the missionary society to be allowed to return to England because of the danger to his wife and children. When the society gave its approval, he and his family departed. Thomas Bridges, then 17, stayed in order to take charge of the Keppel Island mission. Bridges spent the next year on Keppel Island, living with some of the Yahgan who had remained. He began to perfect his knowledge of Yámana. At the time, he started work on a Yahgan grammar and dictionary, which he completed about a decade later in 1879. It included more than 30,000 words, and is considered an important ethnological work. The next superintendent of the base was the Rev. Waite Hockin Stirling. Stirling and Bridges made their first excursion into Tierra del Fuego in 1863. They made contact with the Yahgan, who received them well after learning that the white man Bridges could speak their languages. Stirling encouraged the young man to continue his studies of it. By 1865, Bridges had completed a manuscript of an English-Yahgan dictionary. He noted in a preface that he was using the Ellis Phonetic System established by Alexander Ellis. In 1866, Stirling sailed to England accompanied by four Yahgan boys, and returned with all of them. From 1867–1868, the British assisted a group of Fuegians in setting up a settlement at Laiwaia on Navarino Island. Stirling and Bridges looked in the area for the best spot for a mission. The site chosen was in what is now Ushuaia, near what is called Beagle Channel (after the scientific expedition on HMS Beagle). A small, three-roomed prefabricated hut, about by , was prepared at Port Stanley, Falkland Islands, for installation at Ushuaia. After the hut was erected, Stirling moved in on January 14, 1869. He was joined by one of the Yahgan who had accompanied him to England, and the man's wife. Brief trip to England In 1868, the South American Missionary Society (successors to the Patagonian Missionary Society) decided that Bridges should return to England to study and take Holy Orders. In 1869, when he was about 27, he was ordained deacon by the Bishop of London. He spent some time on a lecture tour of England, when he discussed Tierra del Fuego and his work there, and helped raise funds for the missionary society. While speaking at an award ceremony for schoolteachers in Clevedon, near Bristol, Bridges met Mary Ann Varder, his future wife. She was the daughter of Stephen and Ann Varder; her father was a master carpenter. They lived in Harberton, a village about a mile south-west of Totnes. Five weeks after the couple first met, Thomas and Mary Ann were married by license in the parish church at Harberton on August 7, 1869.Marriage certificate dated 7 August 1869, entry no. 254 Return to South America Two days after they were married, the Bridges sailed for Rio de Janeiro, en route for the Falkland Islands, where settlements had been established by the British. In addition, the Allen Gardiner delivered materials at Ushuaia on Tierra del Fuego for Stirling House, a new mission house to be erected near the first small house \\"at the top of the hill.\\" On October 10, 1870, Bridges and other men from the Falklands sailed to Ushuaia to dig the foundations and erect Stirling House, a prefabricated iron structure sent in pieces from England. Mary Ann was pregnant and stayed in the Falkland Islands until after their daughter was born. After the birth of their daughter Mary, Bridges returned to Ushuaia. He and Jacob Resyck took up residence in Stirling House. Another missionary, Mr. Lewis , traveled to Keppel Island to pick up his family, returning May 14, with his wife, son, and new baby. The baby was baptised Frank Ooshooia Lewis in Stirling House on May 28. On August 17, Bridges sailed with his wife and daughter to Ushuaia, arriving on September 27, 1871. Together with the Lewises, they established the Mission. When Stirling returned to the Falklands in early January 1872, he received a salute of seven guns and was installed as bishop. After visiting Ushuaia, on March 23 he wrote, In his records, Bridges noted meeting his first Ona (Shelk'nam) tribesman in 1875. This group lived east of the Yahgan, in the northeastern portion of Tierra del Fuego. Bridges later gave them space on his property, Estancia Harberton, in an effort to protect them from encroachment and attacks by Europeans. He worked to learn their language. Through the late 1870s, Bridges continued his major work: compiling a dictionary and grammar of the Yahgan language, with translation into English. It had two portions: English-Yahgan, and Yahgan-English. Funeral service performed over the remains of those who perished by the explosion of - The Graphic, London 1881 In addition to ministering to the Yahgan, Bridges was also called upon to serve the British community. On 26 April 1881, suffered a massive explosion while it was anchored near Punta Arenas. The ship sank immediately, and 143 members of the crew were killed, most blown to pieces. There were 12 survivors. Small boats set off from the harbor and other ships to aid survivors. Crews worked all afternoon to recover bodies; only three were recovered whole and the crews put the remains into boxes. Bridges presided over a mass funeral for the sailors on ships and boats in the harbour. ==Family== Thomas Bridges posing with his family The Bridges had six children, four of whom were born in Ushuaia. Mary Ann Varder Bridges (called Mary) was born in 1870. Their eldest son, Thomas Despard Bridges (called Despard), was born in 1872. Stephen (Esteban) Lucas Bridges, called Lucas, was born in 1874; William Samuel Bridges in 1876, Bertha Milman Bridges in 1879, and Alice Couty Bridges in 1882. Mary Ann's younger sister, Johanna Varder, arrived from England in 1874 to join the mission and help care for the growing Bridges family. The children grew up speaking English, Yámana and Spanish. ==Later years== Bridges continued to work with the Yahgan, prosyletizing, teaching English, and trying to help them survive the rapid changes in the area. In the late 19th century, gold was discovered on Tierra del Fuego, and waves of immigrants arrived looking to make their fortune. In addition, Europeans developed sheep farming in the islands. Beginning in the 1880s, they began to settle for the first time in the territories of the Selk'nam and Haush. They particularly encroached on the Selk'nam as they established large sheep ranches in the area, and then attacked the people for hunting the animals as game in their traditional territory. Large sheep ranchers offered bounties to groups of armed men for proof of killing the indigenous people, and a Selk'nam Genocide was carried out. Bridges continued his work in studying the languages and cultures of the indigenous people. He engaged his sons in this work as well. By 1884 Bridges and his son Despard compiled a 1200-word vocabulary for the Kawésqar people (then called Alacalufe), who inhabited areas to the west of the Yahgan. It was in the form of a manuscript.Furlong (1915), \\"The Haush and Ona\\", p. 447 His son Lucas learned Selk'nam and became close to the people; in addition, he compiled a vocabulary of the Manek'enk (or Haush). In 1886, the government of Argentina established a Navy sub-prefecture in Ushuaia. At about age 44, Bridges left the Mission. The government granted him citizenship in Argentina and gave him of land to the east of Ushuaia, which he and his family developed as Estancia Harberton. There they raised sheep and cattle. His house on the ranch was prefabricated in England by his wife's relation, Stephen Varder, and shipped to Tierra del Fuego in the 360-ton brigantine Shepherdess. Bridges offered the Selk'nam space on his estancia where they could continue their traditional lives. Also on board the Shepherdess were two carpenters and Edward Aspinall, the new superintendent of the Ushuaia Mission. Aspinall relocated the mission to the Wollaston Islands, which he felt was more centrally placed in the archipelago to reach the Yahgan. The Stirling House was relocated there for a period. In 1897, Bridges met Frederick Cook, an American doctor and explorer with the Belgian Antarctic Expedition, which stopped in at Tierra del Fuego on its way to (and later, from) the south. During their acquaintance of some weeks, Cook and Bridges discussed the Yahgan at length. Cook asked to borrow Bridges' Yámana grammar and dictionary for reference, and took it with him on the expedition ship Belgica. Bridges was later unable to get him to return it, despite repeated requests until his death. The pastor died in Buenos Aires on July 15, 1898 due to stomach cancer. He is buried in Cementerio Británico. His tombstone records that he was 55 years old. Later buried in the same grave were his grandson, Percival William Reynolds (1904–1940); his son, Lucas Bridges, who published a book in 1948 describing his father's mission experience and the various cultures on the islands;Bridges, E. L. (1948) The Uttermost Part of the Earth, Republished 2008, Overlook Press and Lucas' wife Jannette McLeod Jardine (1890–1976), whom he had met and married in England. Thomas' widow Mary Ann Bridges returned to England after her husband's death; she lived in Shipbourne, Kent, until 1922. ==Posthumous battles and publication of manuscript== In 1910 the New York Times reported that Frederick Cook, whose claim to have been the first to reach the North Pole had been rejected in 1909, had been accused by Charles H. Townsend, director of the New York Aquarium, of trying to have Bridges' Yámana grammar and dictionary manuscript published under his own name, under the auspices of the Commission de la Belgica. Lucas Bridges, the missionary's son, had appealed to the Commission to ensure his father was fully credited for his work and to publish the work. Lucas Bridges donated what he thought was the complete dictionary manuscript to the British Library in 1930. Bridges' 1879 dictionary manuscript, consisting only of the Yahgan/Yámana-English portion, was published in 1933. It was edited by Ferdinand Hestermann (1878-1959) and Martin Gusinde, German and Austrian anthropologists respectively, and published by Missionsdruckerei St. Gabriel in a small edition. Gusinde had done much work among the Yahgan in Tierra del Fuego in the early 20th century. Bridges' manuscripts for his grammar and English-Yahgan/Yámana portions of the dictionary were thought to have been lost. The Hestermann and Gusinde edition, still consisting of only the Yamana- English portion of the dictionary, was reprinted by Zagier & Urruty Publications of Buenos Aires in 1987.Yahgan Dictionary: Language of the Yamana people of Tierra del Fuego, Manuscript of Rev.

Chilean archeologist Alfredo Prieto, of the Universidad de Magallanes, discovered Bridges' English-Yámana dictionary manuscript, dated 1865, in the British Library in London. It included annotations by Rev. John Williams, a later SAMS missionary to the Yahgan. His notes indicated that he had used this manuscript up until the closing of the Anglican mission in 1916. Williams next served as the first Anglican minister at Punta Arenas. Edited and organized by Prieto, the two portions of the dictionary have been published together online (2004-2013) by Campbell and Grace at their \\"Patagonia Bookshelf\\" website. It is the first time that the English- Yahgan/Yámana portion has been published and the complete edition is available for free. Bridges' preface to his English-Yámana manuscript notes that he used the Ellis Phonetic System, developed by Alexander John Ellis, a philologist. ==Books== * Rev.

It is located on Theatre Square in the center of the city. The monastery was built in 1721. The church, designed by architect Paweł Giżycki, was completed in 1789. Removed from ownership of the Bernardine monks in the second half of the 19th century, the complex of buildings was donated to the Orthodox community of Lutsk. In the 1870s, the church was reconstructed by adding a bell tower above the narthex and a central dome. Nowadays the church is the Holy Trinity Cathedral, belonging to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The former Bernardine monastery is used as a library and for small shops. ==History== Bernardine church Documentary sources show that a church already existed in the 15th century, located on the hill near Lutsk. In the 1640s, with the assistance of King Władysław IV Vasa, the church was donated to the Bernardines. The chapel of the Crying Jesus was built in the Catholic cemetery near the church. In 1648, church was robbed during the Cossack attack. An attempt by the organist to guard against theft resulted in the wooden church being burnt to the ground in 1696. A member of the Radziwiłł family granted 40,000 złoty to build a new monastery in brick while 16,000 zloty were allocated to build dungeons. Shortly afterwards, the architect Paweł Giżycki designed a new church in the Baroque style. Although it was built for the Bernardines, the church was typically Jesuit. With funding from Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł, the church was completed in 1798. In 1793, Russian troops seized the complex and used it as a military warehouse until 1800. In the early 19th century, part of the monastery was used as a residence by Bishop Kasper Kazimierz Cieciszowski. Annexed by the Russian Empire in 1795, Volyn had been independent for 30–40 years. It had ordinary cultural, religious and administrative status as a former voivodeship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. But, its autonomy was abolished by the Russian government in the 1830s. As a result of the Russian oppression of the Catholic Church, many churches and monasteries were closed. In 1853, the Bernardine monastery of Lutsk was closed and the monks of the Order left the city. The church was transferred to the Orthodox community of Lutsk. In 1876, the church was reconstructed by architect K. Rastruhanov. The gallery connecting the church and monastery was demolished. A central dome and a bell tower were added, symbolising Russian Orthodox architecture. Volyn belonged to Second Polish Republic from 1920 to 1930. Lutsk was an administrative center of Volyn Viovodship as it was then known. The voivodship administration was located in the former Bernardine monastery. This building was used by the Soviet police and the NKVD. On 12 August 1992, the church became the Holy Trinity Cathedral of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. ==Architecture== Plan The floor plan of monastery is in the shape of a horseshoe. The church is situated at the center. The transept of the church is located at the centre of the curve in the horseshoe semicircle. The complex consisting of the church and monastery represents a combination of Baroque and Classicist styles. The church had a typically Jesuit appearance before it was reconstructed in the Orthodox style. The bell tower and the central dome rise above the roof. The main facade consists of decorated pilasters. Eight small altars are set near the columns which separate the three naves. The walls and ceiling are decorated with bright painted icons. The interior is generally in the Orthodox style although it has a few Catholic features. A gilded oak iconostasis decorates the altar in a pseudo-Russian style. The royal doors consist of two carved sections. it is the one of the most famous church in the world. ==Gallery== File:ІнтерСоборЛуцьк.jpgInterior File:Монастир22.jpgFormer monastery File:ВСоборЛуцьк2.jpgStained glass File:Ц2СоборЛуцьк2.jpgCross ==Sources== * Колосок Б.

Measurable quantities such as position, momentum and energy are all derived from the wavefunction.Davies, p. 1 \\\\mathrm{i}\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\psi(x,t) = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\psi(x,t) +V(x)\\\\psi(x,t), where \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, \\\\mathrm{i} is the imaginary unit and t is time. One peculiar potential that can be solved exactly is when the electric quadrupole moment is the dominant term of an infinitely long cylinder of charge. It can be shown that the Schrödinger equation is solvable for a cylindrically symmetric electric quadrupole, thus indicating that the quadrupole term of an infinitely long cylinder can be quantized. In the physics of classical electrodynamics, it can be easily shown that the scalar potential and associated mechanical potential energy of a cylindrically symmetric quadrupole is as follows: :\\\\mathbf{V}_\\\\mathrm{quad} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda d^2 Cos[2 \\\\phi]}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 s^2} (SI units) :\\\\mathbf{V}_\\\\mathrm{quad} = \\\\frac{Q \\\\lambda d^2 Cos[2 \\\\phi]}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 s^2} (SI units) Cylindrical symmetry should be used when solving the equation. The time independent Schrödinger equation becomes the following in cylindrical symmetry. E \\\\psi(x) = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m s}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial s} (s \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial s}) \\\\psi(s,\\\\phi)-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m s^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial \\\\phi^2}\\\\psi(s,\\\\phi) +\\\\frac{Q \\\\lambda d^2 Cos[2 \\\\phi]}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 s^2} \\\\psi(s,\\\\phi), Using the technique Separation of Variables, the above equation can be written as two ordinary differential equations in both the radial and azimuthal directions. The radial equation is Bessel's equation as can be seen below. If one changes variables to x= k s, Bessel's equation is exactly obtained. \\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} (x \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}) S(x)+(1-\\\\frac{ u^2}{x^2}) S(x)=0 ==Azimuthal equation== The azimuthal equation is given by \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial \\\\phi^2} \\\\Phi(\\\\phi)+( u^2-\\\\frac{\\\\lambda q m d^2}{2 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\hbar} Cos[2 \\\\phi]) \\\\Phi[\\\\phi]=0. This is the Mathieu equation, : \\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+[a-2q\\\\cos (2x) ]y=0, with a= u^2 and q=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda q m d^2}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\hbar} . The solution of the Mathieu equation is expressed in terms of the Mathieu cosine C(a,q,x) and the Mathieu sine S(a,q,x) for unique a and q. This indicates that the quadrupole moment can be quantized in order of the Mathieu characteristic values a_n and b_n. In general, Mathieu functions are not periodic. The term q must be that of a characteristic value in order for Mathieu functions to be periodic. It can be shown that the solution of the radial equation highly depends on what characteristic values are seen in this case. ==See also == * Cylindrical multipole moments == References  * MULTIPOLE EXPANSION * The nonvanishing coefficients of the dipole moment expansion in axially symmetric molecules Category:Quantum mechanics ","title":"Quantum cylindrical quadrupole"},{"id":"35936956","text":"Dursun Ali Eğribaş (1933 - August 2014)Dursun Ali Eğribaş' obituary was a Turkish wrestler.

It states that the evolution of ribosomal RNA was a necessary precursor to the evolution of modern life forms. This led to the advancement of the phylogenetic tree of life consisting of three domains rather than the previously accepted two. While the existence of Eukarya and Prokarya were already accepted, Woese was responsible for the distinction between Bacteria and Archaea. Despite initial criticism and controversy surrounding his claims, Woese's three domain system, based on his work regarding the role of rRNA in the evolution of modern life, has become widely accepted. == Homology as evidence for Woese's Dogma ==  tRNA homology  Evidence for Woese's dogma is well established through comparisons of RNA homology. Modern research allows more liberal use of RNA sequencing, allowing for a better comparative analysis between distant RNA. When analyzing multiple strains of E. coli, Root-Bernstein et. al. have compared tRNA encodings found within rRNA with tRNA found in E. coli to see if the secondary structure was the same as more “modern” tRNA present in E. coli. Comparisons between the tRNA encodings found in the rRNAs and mRNAs of the control sequences found that “sortings” for these sequences were extremely similar, and comparisons of translated protein structure indicated that homology was likely. Additionally, sequences homologous to all tRNAs necessary for translation were present in 16s and 23s rRNAs, and synthetases to load these tRNAs were also found, indicating that many of the functions of transcription and translation present in more modern life exist in rRNA, if vestigially.  rRNA homology  When comparing homologies of rRNA structures, it is necessary to analyze substructures. This is because models that study RNA structure on the whole do not currently exist. Generally, phylogenies of rRNA subunits are created to understand each component, and how they function and evolve. Through phylogenies created that depict rRNA structural elements that are present in all three domains of life, the oldest structural components can be determined through relative dating. These phylogenies were used in a study by Harish et. al., to show that a helical stem labeled h44 in small subunit rRNA can be described as the oldest structural component of rRNA, which holds particular significance, as this structure responsible for linking processes in the small subunit, which is responsible for decoding, with the large subunit, which is responsible for the formation of peptide bonds and the releasing of elongation factors. This essentially shows that the functional origin of the ribosome, responsible for protein synthesis, is common in all modern life throughout each of the three domains. Evidence has also been obtained in studying eukaryotic organelles, such as the chloroplast. Zablen et al.’s phylogenetic analysis conducted electrophoresis on chloroplast ribosomal RNA, specifically on the 16S rRNA of Euglena gracilis. In conducting this experiment, researchers compared the electrophoretic fingerprint of this RNA to other chloroplasts and prokarya. In comparing these results, it was found that generally, these chloroplasts show a close genomic relationship, while a more distant one is seen for algae, and subsequently prokaryotic organisms. This experiment shows that the rRNA of distantly related organisms has a similar origin of that in eukaryotic organelles, supporting the idea that the evolution of rRNA was a necessary precursor of modern life. == Ribosomes as primordial self-replicating entities == One of the reasons that Woese’s Dogma holds significance is because of the potential that RNA was the first primordial self-replicating molecule (see: RNA World), meaning it would be key in the progression of modern life. In particular, it has been proposed that ribosomes exist as a missing link in prebiotic evolution, with rRNA being a vestige of an ancient genome. Some evidence exists for the proposal that rRNA functioned in the past to encode proteins that are key to ribosome function. One notable example is the fact that rRNA proteins are commonly known to bind with their own mRNA. In addition, some ribosomal proteins not only regulate their own expression, but the expression of other proteins as well. These are both indications of self-replication, and indicate the possibility that the mRNA that encodes ribosomal proteins evolved from rRNA.  Criticisms  RNA existing as a primordial self replicating entity is an idea that faces criticism. The idea of rRNA in particular being sufficient on its own to explain the progression of modern life struggles due to the fact that it lacks certain key pieces of evidence. In particular RNA cannot be shown to be prebiotic, as there is no way for the nucleotides or nucleosides that compose it to be non-enzymatically replicated. Additionally, other criticisms exist, such as the fact that RNA is not stable enough to have arisen prebiotically, and that it is too complex to have arisen prebiotically. This has led to the development of other hypotheses, such as 'proteins first', which states that proteins arose prior to RNA, or coevolved with RNA. This has also led to the proposal of other primordial molecules that may have developed into RNA and DNA, such as peptide nucleic acids, which also show evidence of self replication. Despite the fact that criticisms might exist on the primordial or prebiotic nature of rRNA, these criticisms are not aimed at Woese's Dogma on the whole, as Woese's Dogma only claims that the evolution of rRNA was a necessary precursor to modern life, not that rRNA arose prebiotically. ==See also== * Woeseian revolution ==References== Category:Biology theories Category:Evolutionary biology Category:Carl Woese ","title":"Woese's dogma"},{"id":"35937083","text":"Sir Edward Scott (c 1578 – 1646) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1626.

As mandated by the Olympic Charter, the proceedings combined the ceremonial opening of this international sporting event (including welcoming speeches, hoisting of the flags and the parade of athletes) with an artistic spectacle to showcase the host nation's culture. The spectacle was entitled Isles of Wonder and directed by Academy Award-winning British film director Danny Boyle. Prior to London 2012 there had been considerable apprehension about Britain's ability to stage an opening ceremony that could reach the standard set at the Beijing Summer Games of 2008. The 2008 ceremony had been noted for its scale, extravagance and expense, hailed as the \\"greatest ever\\", and had cost £65m. In contrast, London spent an estimated £27m (out of £80m budgeted for its four ceremonies), which was nevertheless about twice the original budget. Nonetheless, the London opening ceremony was immediately seen as a tremendous success, widely praised as a \\"masterpiece\\" and \\"a love letter to Britain\\". The ceremony began at 21:00 BST and lasted almost four hours. It was watched by an estimated worldwide television audience of 900 million, becoming the most-viewed Olympic opening ceremony in both the UK and US. The content had largely been kept secret before the performance, despite involving thousands of volunteers and two public rehearsals. The principal sections of the artistic display represented Britain's Industrial Revolution, National Health Service, literary heritage, popular music and culture, and were noted for their vibrant storytelling and use of music. Two shorter sections drew particular comment, involving a filmed cameo appearance of the Queen with James Bond as her escort, and a live performance by the London Symphony Orchestra joined by comedian Rowan Atkinson. These were widely ascribed to Britain's sense of humour. The ceremony featured children and young people in most of its segments, reflecting the 'inspire a generation' aspiration of London's original bid for the Games. The BBC released footage of the entire opening ceremony on 29 October 2012, edited by Danny Boyle and with background extras, along with more than seven hours of sporting highlights and the complete closing ceremony. London 2012 Olympic Games, BBC Shop, London, October 2012. Retrieved 28 October 2012. ==Preparations== The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) approached Danny Boyle to be the director of the ceremony in June 2010, and he immediately accepted. Boyle explained that there had been four things that made him take the job: he was a big Olympics fan, he lived a mile from the Stadium and so felt invested in the area, his late father's birthday was on the ceremony's date, and he felt his 'Oscar clout' would enable him to push through what he wanted to do. He said it \\"felt weirdly more like a ... civic or national responsibility\\" to take the job. Danny Boyle, the director of the opening ceremony Boyle acknowledged that the extravagance of the 2008 opening ceremony was an impossible act to follow — \\"you can't get bigger than Beijing\\" — and that this realisation had in fact liberated his team creatively. He said \\"..obviously I'm not going to try and build on Beijing, because how could you? We can't, and you wouldn't want to, so we're going back to the beginning. We're going to try and give the impression that we're rethinking and restarting, because they've (opening ceremonies) escalated since Los Angeles in 1984. They've tried to top themselves each time and you can't do that after Beijing.\\" Beijing's budget had been £65m, whereas London's final budget was £27m, which was twice the original provision. The London stadium had the same number of seats as Beijing's, but was half the size; this intimacy of scale meant that Boyle felt he could achieve something personal and connecting. The different sections of the ceremony were designed to reflect aspects of British history and culture, with the title Isles of Wonder partly inspired by Shakespeare's play The Tempest (particularly Caliban's 'Be not afeard' speech), and partly by the G. K. Chesterton aphorism: \\"The world shall perish not for lack of wonders, but for lack of wonder.\\" In July 2010, Boyle started brainstorming ideas with designer Mark Tildesley, writer Frank Cottrell-Boyce and costume designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb. They considered \\"what was essentially British\\", with the non-British Larlarb able to offer a view of what the world thought Britain meant. Cottrell-Boyce had given Boyle a copy of Pandaemonium, (named after the capital of Hell in Paradise Lost) by Humphrey Jennings, which collated contemporary reports from the industrial revolution. It had become traditional during the opening ceremony to 'produce' the Olympic rings in a spectacular manner. Cottrell-Boyce commented \\"Danny had a very clear idea that in the first 15 minutes you had to have a great, startling image that could go around the world; it had to climax with something that made people go 'Oh my God!'\\". Boyle decided that \\"the journey from the pastoral to the industrial, ending with the forging of the Olympic rings\\" would be that image. The ten distinct chapters on which the team started work were gradually compressed into three principal movements: the violent transition from 'Green and Pleasant Land' to the 'Pandemonium' of industrial revolution, a salute to the NHS and children's literature, and a celebration of pop culture, technology and the digital revolution. When Boyle returned to work on the ceremony in the spring of 2011 he asked Rick Smith of Underworld, with whom he had worked on several film projects as well as his theatrical production of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, to be the musical director. At the same time the team moved to the Three Mills studio complex in east London, where a 4x4 metre scale model of the stadium was built. For security reasons, a single CGI-assisted version of the ceremony was kept on editor Sascha Dhillon's laptop; anyone needing it had to come to the studio. The cast included professional performers and 7,500 volunteers. Boyle considered the volunteers to be \\"the most valuable commodity of all\\". In November 2011 they auditioned at Three Mills, and rehearsals began in earnest in spring 2012 at an open-air site at Dagenham (the abandoned Ford plant), often in foul weather. Although key contributors had to sign non-disclosure agreements and some elements were codenamed, Boyle placed immense trust in the volunteers by asking them simply to \\"save the surprise\\" and not leak any information. Further volunteers were recruited to help with security and marshalling, and to support the technical crew. Three weeks before the ceremony, Mark Rylance, who was to have taken a leading part, pulled out after a family bereavement and was replaced by Kenneth Branagh. The Olympic Bell, the largest harmonically tuned bell in the world, weighing 23 tonnes, had been cast in brass under the direction of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry by Royal Eijsbouts of the Netherlands, and hung in the Stadium. It was inscribed with a line from Caliban's speech in The Tempest: \\"Be not afeard, the isle is full of noises\\". Boyle gave significant emphasis to the London 2012 theme 'inspire a generation' and devised a programme relying heavily on children and young people, and built around themes that would relate to the young. 25 schools in the six original East London host boroughs were used to recruit child volunteers for the performance, and 170 sixth formers (16–18-year-olds), between them speaking more than 50 languages, were recruited from their colleges. On 12 June 2012 at a press conference, Boyle had promised a huge set of rural Britain, which was to include a village cricket team, farm animals, a model of Glastonbury Tor, as well as a maypole and a rain-producing cloud. His intention was to represent the rural and urban landscape of Britain. The design was to include a mosh pit at each end of the set, one with people celebrating a rock festival and the other the Last Night of the Proms. Boyle promised a ceremony with which everyone would feel involved; he said, \\"I hope it will reveal how peculiar and contrary we are – and how there's also, I hope, a warmth about us.\\" Some of the set was designed with real grass turf and soil. The use of animals (40 sheep, 12 horses, 3 cows, 2 goats, 10 chickens, 10 ducks, 9 geese and 3 sheep dogs, looked after by 34 animal handlers) drew some criticism from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Boyle, who was being advised by the RSPCA, assured PETA that the animals would be well cared for. After the press conference, much commentary in the UK Press was negative and attracted \\"hundreds of comments online completely supporting...the view that the opening ceremony would be a disaster.\\" The overwhelming majority of the music used was British. The team worked next door to the office of the musical director for the closing ceremony, David Arnold, and so hearing each other's music there was a scramble to claim a particular song first. A.R. Rahman, who worked with Boyle on Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours, composed a Punjabi song 'Nimma Nimma' to showcase Indian influence in the UK, according to Boyle's wishes. More Indian music was also scheduled for inclusion in the medley. Paul McCartney was to be the ceremony's closing act. Sebastian Coe was instrumental in asking the Queen to take part, responding positively when Boyle first pitched the Happy and Glorious film sequence featuring the Queen. Boyle suggested that the Queen be played either a lookalike, or by a world-class actress such as Helen Mirren, in a location to double as Buckingham Palace. Coe asked Princess Anne, a British member of the IOC and LOCOG, what she thought, and she told him to ask the Queen. Coe presented the idea to the Queen's Deputy Private Secretary.Our Queen, documentary film, first broadcast on ITV on 17 March 2013. Boyle was surprised to hear that the Queen would be happy to play herself, and wanted a speaking part. Filming took place in late March 2012, and Happy and Glorious was produced by the BBC, as was the opening film sequence Journey along the Thames. Changes were still being made to the programme in the final days before the ceremony: a BMX bike section was dropped due to time constraints, and the 'Pandemonium' and 'Thanks..Tim' sections were edited down. In 2016 Boyle recounted how he had come under pressure from Jeremy Hunt, then the Olympics and Culture Secretary, to cut back the NHS section, which he had saved only by threatening to resign and take the volunteers with him. Two full dress and technical rehearsals took place in the Olympic stadium, on 23 and 25 July, in front of an audience of 60,000 comprising volunteers, cast members' families, competition winners, and others connected to the Games. Boyle asked them not to 'spoil the surprise' (#savethesurprise) for the billions who would watch on the Friday night. ==Officials and guests==  Royal Box  Seated in the Royal Box were the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, and other members of the British Royal Family. They were accompanied by Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, Prime Minister David Cameron, Spouse of the Prime Minister Samantha Cameron, former Prime Ministers John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Mayor of London Boris Johnson. Officials of the Olympic movement included President of the IOC Jacques Rogge, LOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe and members of the IOC.  International Dignitaries  The ceremony was the largest gathering of world leaders for an Olympic and sporting event in history, surpassing the 2008 opening ceremony. Three multilateral leaders, more than 95 heads of state and government and representatives from five organisations and 120 countries attended the ceremony. ==Proceedings== Schedule {  - !Time (BST) !Section title - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  - ! 21:00–21:04  Countdown - ! 21:04–21:09  Green and Pleasant Land - ! 21:09–21:25  Pandemonium - ! 21:25–21:35  Happy and Glorious - ! 21:35–21:47  Second to the right, and straight on till morning - ! 21:47–21:52  Interlude - ! 21:52–22:09  Frankie and June say...thanks Tim - ! 22:09–22:20  Abide with Me - ! 22:20–00:00  Welcome - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  - ! 00:00–00:07  Bike a.m. - ! 00:07–00:24  Let the Games Begin - ! 00:24–00:38  There Is a Light That Never Goes Out - ! 00:38–00:46  And in the end } Prologue Scene before the ceremony commenced, representing rural Britain At exactly 20:12 (8:12 pm) the Red Arrows performed a flypast over the Olympic Stadium and then over the concert in Hyde Park. This concert featured artists selected to represent the four nations of the United Kingdom: Duran Duran, Stereophonics, Snow Patrol and Paolo Nutini. At the beginning the stadium contained a rural scene including the model of Glastonbury Tor, a model village and a water wheel, replete with live animals (removed shortly before the ceremony began), and actors portraying working villagers, football and cricket players. Frank Turner performed three songs (\\"Sailor's Boots\\", \\"Wessex Boy\\" and \\"I Still Believe\\") on the model of Glastonbury Tor, joined by Emily Barker, Ben Marwood and Jim Lockey, as well as his regular backing band the Sleeping Souls. LSO On Track (an orchestra of 80 young musicians from ten East London boroughs together with 20 LSO members) then performed Edward Elgar's \\"Nimrod\\" from the Enigma Variations, accompanied by extracts from the BBC Radio Shipping Forecast, and maritime images on the big screens, while the audience held up blue sheeting to simulate the sight of the ocean. This performance celebrated Britain's maritime heritage and geographical insularity. Countdown (21:00–21:04 BST) The ceremony began at 9pm after a one-minute '60 to 1' countdown film made up of shots of numbers, such as those on house doors, street nameplates, London buses and market labels. The 2012 Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins opening the ceremony A two-minute film Journey along the Thames, directed by Boyle and produced by the BBC, opened the ceremony. To the sound of \\"Surf Solar\\" by Fuck Buttons, it followed the River Thames from its source to the heart of London, juxtaposing images of contemporary British life with pastoral shots and flashes of scenes from the stadium. The characters Ratty, Mole and Toad from The Wind in the Willows were briefly seen, as was a 'Monty Python hand' pointing towards London on umbrellas, and an InterCity 125 train passing the Olympic rings as crop circles in a field. At Battersea Power Station a Pink Floyd pig was flying between the towers; the clock sound from another Pink Floyd song \\"Time\\" was heard passing Big Ben. The soundtrack included clips from the theme tune of The South Bank Show, \\"London Calling\\" by The Clash, and the Sex Pistols' \\"God Save the Queen\\" as the film followed the route of the band's infamous cruise down the River Thames during the Silver Jubilee. After lifting to an aerial view of East London mirroring the title sequence of the BBC soap opera EastEnders, to the sound of the drum beats from the closing theme, the film flashed down through the Thames Barrier, into Bow Creek, and then below surface through a London Underground train and station, historic footage of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Thames Tunnel, and through the Rotherhithe Tunnel. It then switched to a sequence filmed outside the stadium shortly before the ceremony, superimposed with posters from previous Summer Olympics (all of them except 1900 Paris, 1936 Berlin, 1984 Los Angeles, and 1996 Atlanta), to a recording of \\"Map of the Problematique\\" by Muse. This ended with a live shot of three cast members holding the posters for the 2012 competition. There was then a ten-second countdown in the stadium, with children holding clusters of balloons that burst simultaneously (although one set failed to burst), with the audience shouting out the numbers. Bradley Wiggins, who had won the Tour de France five days earlier, opened the ceremony by ringing the Olympic Bell that hung at one end of the stadium. Four upper-atmosphere balloons were released, each expected to carry a set of Olympic rings and a camera up to the mid- stratosphere. Green and Pleasant Land (21:04–21:09) The depiction of rural life already in the arena was billed as \\"a reminder and a promise of a once and future better life\\". Youth choirs began a cappella performances of the informal anthems of the four nations of the UK: \\"Jerusalem\\" (for England, sung by a live choir in the stadium), \\"Danny Boy\\" (from the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland), \\"Flower of Scotland\\" (from Edinburgh Castle in Scotland), and \\"Bread of Heaven\\" (from Rhossili Beach in Wales – sung in English). These were inter-cut with footage of notable Rugby Union Home Nations' tries, England's winning drop goal from the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final, and live shots from the stadium. As the last choir performance concluded, vintage London General Omnibus Company stagecoaches entered, carrying businessmen and early industrialists in Victorian dress and top hats, led by Kenneth Branagh as Brunel. The 50 men stepped down from the carriages and surveyed the land approvingly. After walking onto the Glastonbury Tor, Brunel delivered Caliban's \\"Be not afeard\\" speech, reflecting Boyle's introduction to the ceremony in the programme and signifying an aspiration of new industry or a new era in Britain. This anticipated the next section of the ceremony. Pandemonium (21:09–21:25) This section encapsulated British economic and social development from rural economy through the Industrial Revolution to the 1960s. Industrial Britain. Rehearsal 23 July 2012 before the ceremony four days later. Proceedings were suddenly interrupted by a loud shout, recorded by volunteers during the rehearsals, followed by drumming (the pre-recorded drumming amplified by 965 cast members drumming on inverted household buckets and bins), led by Evelyn Glennie. The three-tonne oak tree on top of the Glastonbury Tor lifted, and industrial workers emerged from both the Tor's brightly lit interior and the entrances to the stadium, to swell the cast to a total of 2,500 volunteers. So began what Boyle had called the \\"biggest scene change in theatre history\\" and something he had been advised against attempting. Underworld's \\"And I Will Kiss\\" began to play, as the cast rolled away the grass and other rural props. Seven smoking chimney stacks with accompanying steeplejacks rose from the ground, along with other industrial machinery: five beam engines, six looms, a crucible and a water wheel (one of the few items left from the rural scene). Boyle said that this section celebrated the \\"tremendous potential\\" afforded by the advancements of the Victorian era. It also included a minute's silence in remembrance of the loss of life of both World Wars, featuring British 'Tommies' and shots of poppies, during which the names of the Accrington Pals were shown on the stadium screens. Unprompted, members of the audience stood in respect during this segment.Danny Boyle and Frank Cottrell-Boyce, audio commentary track to the BBC DVD of the opening ceremony Volunteers paraded around the stadium representing some of the groups that had changed the face of Britain: the woman's suffrage movement, the Jarrow Crusade, the first Caribbean immigrants arriving in 1948 on board the Empire Windrush, a 1970s DJ float, the Nostalgia Steel Band, and The Beatles as they appeared on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Also included were real-life Chelsea Pensioners, the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, and a group of Pearly Kings and Queens. The Olympic rings Workers began casting an iron ring. As the noise level and tension built, driven by the relentless rhythm of the music and the drumming, participants mimed repetitive mechanical movements associated with industrial processes such as weaving. Four glowing orange rings gradually began to be carried high above the stadium toward its centre on overhead wires, and then the ring seemingly being cast and forged in the arena began to lift. The five rings converged, still glowing and accompanied by steam and firework effects to give the impression that they were of hot metal. When the five rings formed the Olympic symbol above the stadium, they ignited and rained fire in silver and gold. The image of the Olympic rings in flame became the iconic image of the ceremony, reproduced in newspapers and web stories around the world. Happy and Glorious (21:25–21:35) A short film directed by Boyle and produced by the BBC, called Happy and Glorious (after a line in the national anthem), featured the character James Bond, played by current Bond actor Daniel Craig, entering the front gate of Buckingham Palace in a London black cab. His entrance (accompanied by an arrangement of Handel's 'The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba') is noticed by Brazilian children (a nod to Rio de Janeiro, which was to be the next summer Games host city) in the throne room. Bond escorted Queen Elizabeth II (who played herself, acknowledging Bond with the words, \\"Good evening, Mr Bond\\") out of the building and into a waiting AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter. The film followed the helicopter across London, with shots of a cheering crowd on The Mall, Nelson's Column, the Palace of Westminster with an animated Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square, and of the Thames past the London Eye, St Paul's Cathedral, the financial district City of London. The helicopter then passed through Tower Bridge, accompanied by the Dambusters March. The film finished with Bond and the Queen apparently jumping from a real helicopter live above the stadium, accompanied by the \\"James Bond Theme\\". The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, along with Rogge, were then introduced to the audience. The Queen was wearing the same dress as in the film, as if she had just arrived with Bond. The idea of the royal helicopter jump was first pitched by Director Danny Boyle to Sebastian Coe, who loved it so much he took it to Edward Young, Private Secretary to the Queen, at Buckingham Palace in the summer of 2011. Young 'listened sagely, laughed, and promised to ask the boss'. Word came back to Coe that the Queen would love to take part. Young, Boyle and Coe agreed to keep the plan secret so as not to spoil the surprise. For the scenes with the helicopter, the Queen was doubled by actress Julia McKenzie, and for the parachute jump by BASE jumper and stuntman Gary Connery wearing a dress, hat, jewellery and with a handbag. Bond was played by Mark Sutton. The helicopter had flown to the stadium from Stapleford Aerodrome in Essex, piloted by Marc Wolff. The Union Flag was then raised by members of the British Armed Forces, while the first and third verses of the national anthem were performed a cappella by the Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children. Second to the right, and straight on till morning (21:35–21:47) The first part of this sequence celebrated the National Health Service (\\"the institution which more than any other unites our nation\\", according to the programme), which had been founded in the year of the previous London Games in 1948. Music was by Mike Oldfield. 600 dancers, all of whom were NHS staff, along with 1,200 volunteers recruited from British hospitals, entered along with children on 320 hospital beds, some of which functioned as trampolines. They started a short jive routine. Watching from the tor were specially invited hospital staff and nine child patients from Great Ormond Street Hospital. The blankets on the beds illuminated and the beds were arranged to depict a child's face with a smile and a tear (the Hospital Children's Charity's logo). The acronym 'GOSH' then changed into the initials 'NHS', turning into the shape of a crescent moon as the children were hushed to sleep and read books by the nurses. The sequence then moved on to celebrate British children's literature. J. K. Rowling began by reading from J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan (whose copyright was given to Great Ormond Street Hospital). The Child Catcher appeared amongst the children, followed by giant puppet representations of villains from British children's literature: the Queen of Hearts, Captain Hook, Cruella de Vil and Lord Voldemort. Minutes later, 32 women playing Mary Poppins descended with their umbrellas, as the villains deflated and the actors resumed dancing. The music for this sequence included partially rearranged sections from Tubular Bells (with a giant set of tubular bells at the rear of the stage), Tubular Bells III and, after the villains had been driven away by the Mary Poppins characters, In Dulci Jubilo. During this performance the children in pyjamas jumped up and down on their brightly lit beds, creating a memorable image amid the darkness of the stadium. The sequence concluded with a pale, gigantic baby's head, with a rippling sheet for its body, in the centre of the arena. This celebrated the Scottish pioneers of obstetric ultrasound imaging. Interlude (21:47–21:52) Simon Rattle was then introduced to conduct the London Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Vangelis's \\"Chariots of Fire\\", as a tribute to the British film industry. Rowan Atkinson appeared as a Mr. Bean-like character, comically playing a repeated note on a synthesiser. He then lapsed into a filmed dream sequence in which he joined the runners from the film Chariots of Fire, beating them in their iconic run along West Sands at St Andrews by riding in a car, rejoining the race and tripping the front runner. Danny Boyle later explained: \\"It wasn't actually Mr. Bean. Strictly speaking, the name of his character was Derek\\". Frankie and June say...thanks Tim (21:52–22:09) This sequence celebrated British popular music and culture, paying homage to each decade since the 1960s. To the accompaniment of the BBC newsreel theme 'Girls in Grey' and the theme tune from The Archers, a young mother and son arrive in a Mini Cooper at a full- size replica of a modern British house. The 1987 \\"don't worry about a hurricane\\" weather forecast by Michael Fish was shown on the big screens as rain suddenly poured on the house, followed by \\"Push the Button\\", by Sugababes. In the centre of the arena the sides of another house, three times larger, were used as screens to show clips from various TV programmes, music videos and films, including A Matter of Life and Death (June is named for its protagonist), as well as Gregory's Girl, Kes, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Snowman, The Wicker Man, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Spanish TV show Cuéntame cómo pasó, and Boyle's own Trainspotting. A large group of dancers, centred around Frankie and June (19-year-old Henrique Costa and 18-year-old Jasmine Breinburg) on a night out, performed to an assortment of British popular songs arranged broadly chronologically, beginning with \\"Going Underground\\" by The Jam, suggesting a ride on the London Underground. During this track images of the Underground were projected onto the house and former London Mayor Ken Livingstone was briefly seen. Throughout the sequence cast members were texting each other or placing social networking status updates on the Internet. Frankie and June first notice each other as a snippet from \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" by Eric Clapton plays, but when Frankie saw that June had dropped her phone on the Tube, he set off to return it (communicating using last number redial to her sister's phone). Tim Berners-Lee's tweet, \\"This is for everyone\\" An extended dance sequence followed, with songs including \\"My Generation\\" by The Who, \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" by the Rolling Stones, \\"My Boy Lollipop\\" sung by Millie Small, \\"All Day and All of the Night\\" by the Kinks, \\"She Loves You\\" by the Beatles (with footage of the band performing the song), \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" by Led Zeppelin, \\"Starman\\" by David Bowie, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" by Queen (during which the sound of the TARDIS from Doctor Who could be heard), \\"Pretty Vacant\\" by the Sex Pistols (during which dancers on power jumpers wearing large heads with Mohawk hairstyles performed a pogo dance, and the lyrics to the song were spelled out in LED lights around the stadium), \\"Blue Monday\\" by New Order, \\"Relax\\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood (during which Frankie, asked by June for his name, replied by revealing one of the band's \\"Frankie say...\\" T-shirts), \\"Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)\\" by Soul II Soul, \\"Step On\\" by Happy Mondays, \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\" by Eurythmics, \\"Firestarter\\" by The Prodigy, and \\"Born Slippy .NUXX\\" by Underworld, ending with the cast singing \\"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\\" as Frankie and June walked towards each other. A sequence from the film Four Weddings and a Funeral was projected behind them; when they kissed, a montage of memorable kisses from film, TV and real life was shown (including one of the first interracial kisses on British television in Emergency Ward 10 and the first lesbian kiss from Brookside, which in some countries, including Saudi Arabia, then became the first lesbian kiss ever shown on pre-watershed television), while \\"Song 2\\" by Blur was played. A live performance of \\"Bonkers\\" by Dizzee Rascal followed, along with a further sequence in which all the cast (and Britain's Got Talent dancing duo Signature) attend a party at June's house whilst Amy Winehouse's \\"Valerie\\", Muse's \\"Uprising\\", and Tinie Tempah's \\"Pass Out\\" played. At the close the larger house was raised to reveal Tim Berners-Lee working at a NeXT Computer, like the one on which he invented the World Wide Web. He tweeted 'This is for everyone', instantly spelled out in LED lights around the stadium. The programme explained \\"Music connects us with each other and with the most important moments in our lives. One of the things that makes those connections possible is the World Wide Web\\". Boyle wanted to honour Berners-Lee for having made the World Wide Web free and available to everyone (hence the tweet), rather than seeking a commercial profit from it. Abide with Me (22:09–22:20) A filmed sequence showed extracts from the torch relay around the UK, to the music \\"I Heard Wonders\\" by David Holmes. This then cut live to show David Beckham driving a dramatically illuminated motor boat down the River Thames and under Tower Bridge, to fireworks, while footballer Jade Bailey held on to the torch in the boat. This section had been rehearsed on 24 July 2012 when the close-up shots were pre- recorded, and was directed by Stephen Daldry. There was then a tribute to \\"..friends and family of those in the stadium who cannot be here tonight\\", including the victims of the '7/7' 2005 London bombings (on the day after London had been awarded the Games). Photos of people who had died were displayed on screens as a memorial, accompanied by an excerpt from Brian Eno's ambient work \\"An Ending (Ascent)\\". The hymn \\"Abide with Me\\" was then sung by Emeli Sandé while a group of dancers choreographed by and including Akram Khan performed a contemporary dance on the theme of mortality.Amy Raphael, Danny Boyle: Creating Wonder, London: Faber & Faber, published 21 March 2013, , page 434. Welcome (22:20–00:00) Team GB enters the 2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations last The Parade of Nations of athletes (drawn from the 10,490 competing) and officials from 204 nations (and also the \\"Independent Olympic Athletes\\") was led, according to custom, by the Greek team, followed by other competing countries in alphabetical order, and finally the host nation Great Britain. Each of the 205 teams entered the stadium led by their flagbearer, accompanied by a child volunteer carrying a copper petal (later revealed to be part of the cauldron) and a young woman carrying a sign with the country's name in English (and wearing a dress made from fabric printed with photos of people who had applied to be Olympic volunteers). The parade was accompanied by mainly British dance tracks and popular songs, including \\"Galvanize\\" by Chemical Brothers, \\"West End Girls\\" by Pet Shop Boys, \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" by Adele, \\"Stayin' Alive\\" by the Bee Gees and both \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" and \\"Beautiful Day\\" by Irish band U2, with Great Britain entering to David Bowie's song \\"Heroes\\". Welsh drum and bass DJ High Contrast mixed and sequenced the music for the athletes' parade. Music with a fast rhythm of 120 bpm was used in an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was reinforced by the drummers in the stadium; nevertheless the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide. Once all of the athletes were inside the stadium, seven billion small pieces of paper were dropped from a Westland helicopter, each piece representing one person on Earth. Each nation's flag was planted on the Glastonbury Tor. Bike a.m. (00:00–00:07 BST 28 July) Doves at the opening ceremony Once the athletes had gathered in the centre of the stadium, the Arctic Monkeys performed \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" and The Beatles' \\"Come Together\\", the latter whilst 75 cyclists circled the stadium with wings lit by LEDs representing Doves of Peace. Doves were traditionally released at Olympic opening ceremonies, although real birds have not been used since 1992. A single dove cyclist, his beak painted yellow in honour of Bradley Wiggins, appeared to fly out of the stadium. Let the Games Begin (00:07–00:24) Muhammad Ali receives the Olympic FlagThe formal part of the ceremony was introduced by Sebastian Coe, speaking from the Tor and surrounded by flags of the participating nations. He welcomed the watching world to London. He expressed pride in being British and part of the Olympic movement, and said that the Olympics \\"brings together the people of the world...to celebrate what is best about mankind\\". He continued to speak of the \\"truth and drama\\" of sport, and then thanked Britain for \\"making all this possible\\". Rogge responded by thanking London, stating that it was the third time that London had held the Games, following 1908, held at short notice when Rome was unable to do so (after a volcanic eruption), and 1948 three years after the end of World War II. Rogge thanked the thousands of volunteers, to huge cheers. He announced that for the first time in Olympic history, every team had female participants. Rogge acknowledged the important role the UK had played as \\"the birthplace of modern sport\\", codifying its \\"fair play\\" ethos and building sport into the school curriculum. He appealed to athletes to play fairly and be drug-free, according to the values of Baron de Courbertin, reminding them that they were role models who would \\"inspire a generation\\". After expressing these sentiments again briefly in French, he invited the Queen to open the Games. The Queen declared the competition officially open, immediately followed by a trumpet fanfare based on a theme from Tubular Bells by Mike Oldfield and then a fireworks display. The 2012 ceremony was the second time the Queen had opened an Olympic Games, the first being the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal in her capacity as Queen of Canada. It was also the first time any individual had opened a Summer Olympics twice (two more Olympiads had been opened on her behalf, with a further two Winter Games opened on her behalf). The Olympic Flag was carried by eight people chosen from around the world to embody the Olympic values: Ban Ki-moon (as UN general secretary), Sally Becker (for courage), Doreen Lawrence (chosen for her \\"tireless thirst for justice\\"), Haile Gebrselassie (for his \\"fight against poverty\\"), Leymah Gbowee (as \\"a great peacemaker\\"), Shami Chakrabarti (for \\"her integrity\\"), Daniel Barenboim (for bringing \\"harmony in place of discord\\"), and Marina Silva (as UN Champion of the Earth). The flag paused in front of Muhammad Ali (invited to represent 'respect, confidence, conviction, dedication, generosity and spiritual strength'), who held it for a few moments. The flag was received by a colour guard of Her Majesty's Armed Forces and hoisted to the Olympic Hymn, performed by the LSO and the Grimethorpe Colliery Band. The Olympic Oaths were taken by taekwondo athlete Sarah Stevenson on behalf of the athletes, by British AIBA Referee Mik Basi on behalf of the officials, and by Eric Farrell on behalf of the coaches. There Is a Light That Never Goes Out (00:24–00:38) Lighting of the London 2012 Olympic Cauldron Thomas Heatherwick's Olympic Cauldron after being lit This section was named after a song by The Smiths. The motorboat driven by David Beckham arrived with the Olympic Flame via the Limehouse Cut and the Lee Navigation. Steve Redgrave lit his torch from that on the boat, and carried it into the stadium through an honour guard of 500 of the construction workers who had built the Olympic Park. He passed the flame on to a team of seven young people, each nominated by a famous British Olympian to convey the Games' aim to 'inspire a generation'. Six of the team were athletes, and the seventh was a volunteer young ambassador. The teenagers made a lap of the stadium, each carrying the torch in turn, while Alex Trimble, lead singer of Two Door Cinema Club, performed \\"Caliban's Dream\\" with the Dockhead Choir, Only Men Aloud, Elizabeth Roberts, and Esme Smith. This had been written especially for the ceremony by Rick Smith of Underworld. Each young athlete was greeted by their nominating Olympian (watched by 260 British medallists from previous summer and winter Games since London 1948) and presented with their own torch, which was then lit from the flame. They jogged through a corridor between assembled athletes to the centre of the stadium, where the 204 copper petals (each inscribed with the name of the team it accompanied during the parade) were now seen in a circular formation attached to long pipes (the petals were to accompany each team home after the competition, as a souvenir). The young athletes lit some of the petals, and when the flame had spread to all of them, the pipes rose slowly from the floor of the stadium and converged to form the cauldron. The cauldron lighters were (nominator in brackets): *Callum Airlie (Shirley Robertson) *Jordan Duckitt (Duncan Goodhew) *Desiree Henry (Daley Thompson) *Katie Kirk (Mary Peters) *Cameron MacRitchie (Steve Redgrave) *Aidan Reynolds (Lynn Davies) *Adelle Tracey (Kelly Holmes) The cauldron designed by Thomas Heatherwick was described as \\"one of the best-kept secrets of the opening ceremony\\": until this point, its design, location, and who would light it had not been revealed. And in the end (00:38–00:46) A flurry of spectacular fireworks accompanied by Pink Floyd's song \\"Eclipse\\" was supported by images of memorable Olympic victories shown on the big screens, with the stadium pixels showing Jesse Owens running. The climax of this section was a live view of the Olympic rings 34 kilometres (21 miles) above the Earth, transmitted from one of the balloons launched three and a half hours earlier. The sky was then lit by searchlights piercing the smoke (another iconic London image) from the fireworks, the Orbit tower was illuminated. Paul McCartney and his band performed the closing section of \\"The End\\", and then \\"Hey Jude\\", with its chorus sung by the audience to close the ceremony at 00:46 BST. ==Music== Segment of the opening ceremony celebrating British music The eclectic programme of music was chosen to showcase almost exclusively British music with pieces representing the UK's four nations. It included classical works by British composers such as Hubert Parry, and performances by UK choirs and orchestras. The focus was mainly on music of the 1960s onwards, causing one Chinese journalist to ask: \\"Will this be the most rock and roll opening ceremony ever?\\". Rick Smith and Underworld composed pieces for the ceremony, including \\"And I Will Kiss\\" used during the 'Pandemonium' section, and \\"Caliban's Dream\\" heard during the lighting of the cauldron. These were favourably reviewed; in The Guardian, Michael Hann wrote \\"Underworld ... had a bit of a triumph: the builds and fades they learned in the world of dance music lent the sometimes overwhelming visual spectacle a sense of structure\\". Musical motifs were used to bind the ceremony programme together: for example, the 'whistling' theme first heard during the minute's silence embedded within \\"And I Will Kiss\\" returned frequently – behind the fury as the ring was being forged, emerging triumphant as the five rings came together, and again later as the main theme of 'Caliban's Dream' whilst the flame was paraded around the stadium. Mike Oldfield performing \\"Tubular Bells\\" at the opening ceremony Bells were a theme of the opening day of the Olympics, starting at 8:12am with artist Martin Creed's Work No. 1197: All the Bells, when bells were rung across the UK including forty strikes of Big Ben. \\"The sound of bells is the sound of England\\", Boyle had told volunteers during rehearsal. Much of the music for the ceremony contained 'bell' references, linking to the large bell forged for the ceremony and evoking bells as \\"the sound of freedom and peace\\". Modified sequences based on the traditional British eight-bell peal underlaid \\"And I Will Kiss\\" and carried through into the \\"Tubular Bells\\"/NHS section, with handbells and a tolling large bell featured on 'Caliban's Dream' and at key points in the ceremony. A handbell chime also played after the close, as the stadium emptied. Boyle approached many of the artists personally, to see if they would be interested in performing, and he also flew to Barbados for an hour-long meeting with Mike Oldfield. A few turned him down, including Elvis Costello and David Bowie. The performing artists were paid a nominal £1 fee to make their contracts legally binding. The pre-recorded soundtrack Isles of Wonder was released on iTunes at midnight of 28 July 2012, with a two-disc CD set released on 2 August. Within two days the download album had topped the iTunes album charts in Britain, France, Belgium and Spain, and reached No. 5 in the United States, as well as being No. 5 in the British album charts. Rick Smith's concluding comment in the CD cover notes was: \\"The isle is full of noises.

Dismantling the staging took just sixty hours. The infield staging area was 2.5 metres high, and had to accommodate the elements revealed during the ceremony, such as the chimneys and beam engines from 'Pandemonium', and the cauldron. To ensure that it remained secret, the cauldron was code-named 'Betty', and installed and tested at night. The stadium was rigged with a one million watt sound system and more than 500 speakers. Some of staging and 12,956 props were used, as well as of turf including crops. 70,799 25 centimetre (10 inch) pixel panels were placed around the stadium, including between every seat. Each panel connected to a central computer and was fitted with nine full-colour LED pixels by Tait Technology. These enabled images to be broadcast during the performance, such as of a 1960s go-go dancer, a London Underground train, and a representation of the birth of the internet. The audience was also able to participate by waving the paddles to create a twinkling effect. These animations were designed by 59 Productions and the video animations were produced by Chinese company Crystal CG. The 2D to 3D transformation and mapping of video content onto the panels were done by Avolites Media media server consoles. At the technical rehearsal of the Opening Ceremony Technical director Piers Shepperd masterminded the complex change from rural to industrial during 'Pandemonium'. The seven inflatable chimneys were made by Airworks, and varied in height (three were , two were and two were high). They were made of soft fabric, with an outer layer of printed brick pattern. Each contained four industrial fans at the base to inflate them, and a smoke machine near the top, and were hoisted into the air from the overhead rigs. Life-size beam engines were constructed onstage by teams of stage hands and members of the Volunteer Staging Team. At the climax of 'Pandemonium', in the Olympic ring forging scene, amber lights lit in sequence created the illusion of a molten steel river, with pyrotechnic smoke and dry ice as steam. The original grass floor surface had been removed to reveal a giant stylised map of London. Working alongside the professional crew were over 800 volunteers; some were production arts students from British drama schools. Many had been working on the Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies since early 2012 at the Three Mills Studios and Dagenham rehearsal sites, before moving to the Stadium on 16 June. The thousands of cast were cued and co-ordinated by directions received through earphones ('in-ear monitors'), and adjustments were made during the performance: for example during Pandemonium extra volunteers were sent to make sure all the turf was cleared on time. The earphones also carried a continuous electronic metronomic four-beat to keep everyone walking and moving in time with the music. In July 2013 it was revealed that on the morning of the ceremony, Britain's surveillance headquarters GCHQ had detected a credible cyber attack threat that could have killed the lighting system in the stadium. Counter-measures were taken, and in the afternoon contingency plans were discussed with government ministers at a meeting in the Cabinet Office briefing room. However, this attack never materialised. ==Ceremony key team== *Artistic Director: Danny Boyle *Producer: Tracey Seaward *Designers: Suttirat Anne Larlarb and Mark Tildesley *Writer: Frank Cottrell-Boyce *Music Director: Rick Smith (Underworld) *Associate Director: Paulette Randall *Movement Director: Toby Sedgwick *Head of Mass Movement Choreography: Steve Boyd *Choreographers: Temujin Gill, Kenrick \\"H2O\\" Sandy and Akram Khan *Video Editor: Sascha DhillonLondon 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony Official Programme, p. 49 *Visual Effects Supervisor: Adam Gascoyne *Executive Producer, production design: Mark Fisher *Executive Producer, creative: Stephen Daldry *Lighting Designer: Patrick Woodroffe *Associate Lighting Designer: Adam Bassett *Lead Lighting Programmer: Tim Routledge *Soundscape Designer: Gareth Fry *Technical Director: Piers Shepperd *Technical Manager (technical design and staging): Jeremy Lloyd *Technical Manager (aerial): James Lee *Technical Manager (lighting, audio-visual, power): Nick Jones *Technical Manager (services and special projects): Scott Buchanan *Senior Production Manager (audio and communications): Chris Ekers *Executive Producer, broadcast: Hamish Hamilton *Executive Producer, production: Catherine Ugwu *Press & Publicity: Christopher Mitchell *Bike Choreographer: Bob Haro *Bike Project Manager: Paul Hughes *Announcers: Marc Edwards and Layla Anna-Lee *Ceremonies Sound Designer: Bobby Aitken *Ceremonies RF spectrum planning and management: Steve Caldwell *Ceremonies Monitor Engineer: Steve Watson *Ceremonies Front of House Engineer: Richard Sharratt *Production Manager Radio Mics and IEMs: Alison Dale *Artist Security Director: Richard Barry *Production Stage Manager: Sam Hunter *Show Caller: Julia Whittle ==TV coverage== Fireworks at Tower Bridge The BBC's coverage started at 19:00 and continued uninterrupted until 00:50. The BBC audience averaged about 24.46 million viewers and peaked at approximately 26.9 million. This was the largest average audience for any broadcast since 1996 and one of the top 20 most-watched UK television broadcasts of all time. David Stringer of Associated Press described the coverage as \\"a success...so far, the BBC's ambitious – and technically tricky – Olympic plan has worked almost without a flaw.\\" Euan Ferguson of The Observer commented that \\"Coverage of the Olympics so far ... has been near perfect.\\" However, Clive James was critical of the build-up programme, presented by Gary Lineker and Sue Barker. Commentators for the BBC were Huw Edwards, Hazel Irvine and Trevor Nelson, the latter criticised by Andy Dawson of the Daily Mirror as floundering \\"like a ventriloquist's dummy pumped full of low-grade ketamine\\". Private talks were held between Boyle and BBC commentators in the run-up to the ceremony. Boyle was unhappy with a voiceover being imposed on the ceremony, which he wanted viewers to be able to enjoy without commentary. The BBC offered several options including 'no commentary' coverage for both its TV and online transmissions. Nearly 41 million US viewers watched NBC's coverage of the event. Criticism was levelled at its decision to tape-delay this broadcast, and not make a live version available even to cable and web users. There were frequent interruptions by commercial breaks. Many US viewers looked for other ways to watch (such as the live BBC feed), despite both NBC and the IOC vowing to crack down on unauthorised streams. More significant criticism was levelled at NBC for cutting to a Ryan Seacrest interview with Michael Phelps during the 'memorial wall' tribute including commemoration of the victims of the 7/7 London bombings, which was seen as disrespectful and insensitive. An NBC spokesman said the network had left out that segment because its programming was \\"tailored for the US audience\\". There was also criticism of commentators Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira for suggesting that the Queen had actually jumped out of a helicopter. Vieira and Lauer admitted to not knowing that Tim Berners-Lee was the inventor of the World Wide Web, as she commented \\"If you haven't heard of him, we haven't either\\", before Lauer told the audience to Google him. These failings were picked up on Twitter during the broadcast with the hashtag #nbcfail. Commentary by Bob Costas and Lauer during the Parade of Nations was also criticised for their negative opinions about some countries' political environments and for leaving out information about the athletes, which was seen as \\"smug American elitism\\". It was noted that they spoke about some countries with \\"outright condescension\\".Gosztola, Kevin (28 July 2012). Smug American Elitism at the Olympics Opening Ceremony. Firedoglake.com. Retrieved 22 November 2012. The ceremony was recorded by three separate broadcasters: the BBC, the Olympic Broadcasting Services (directed by the Finnish state broadcaster YLE on behalf of the OBS), and by independent production company Done and Dusted, hired by LOCOG and working under Boyle's direction. This was the first time that an independent production company had been used for an Olympic ceremony. This situation led to some tension, as Boyle wanted more artistic control and felt he was getting no co-operation from the OBS. He criticised the OBS coverage during his commentary for the BBC DVD. In addition, the BBC filmed some of the pre-recorded parts of the ceremony. The filming was directed for television by Hamish Hamilton, who described it as \\"easily the most difficult job of my life\\". The BBC released footage of the entire ceremony on 29 October 2012, edited by Danny Boyle and with background extras, filling more than one disc of a five DVD or Blu-ray disc set, which also contained more than seven hours of sporting highlights as well as the complete closing ceremony. A 'BBC commentary-free' option for the opening ceremony is available on the DVD, as well as a commentary track by Danny Boyle and Frank Cottrell-Boyce. In contrast the NBC DVD only has highlights of the opening ceremony. ==Reviews== The Times described the ceremony as \\"a masterpiece\\", with The Daily Telegraph saying it was \\"brilliant, breathtaking, bonkers and utterly British\\". The BBC's chief sports writer Tom Fordyce called it \\"eccentric\\" and \\"tongue-in-cheek\\", saying \\"no-one expected ... it would be quite so gloriously daft, so cynicism-squashingly charming and, well, so much pinch-yourself fun.\\" Two weeks after the ceremony Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian wrote that \\"Boyle's spectacular, so beautifully executed and ingeniously conceived it lingers in the mind even as the closing draws near, stood apart from its predecessors thanks not only to its humour and eccentricity, but also because it had something to say.\\" Writing in The Observer, Jackie Kay commented that \\"it seemed that Boyle had invented a new kind of opening ceremony, a concept ceremony, one that embraces big ideas as passionately as it does technical flamboyancy\\". The Stage said that \\"Danny Boyle's spectacular and moving Olympics Opening Ceremony was undoubtedly the theatrical highlight of 2012\\". Although praise came from across the political spectrum, a few on the British political right were unhappy. Aidan Burley, a Conservative MP, denounced the ceremony on Twitter as \\"leftie multicultural crap\\". Burley's comments were dismissed by many fellow Conservatives, including David Cameron and Boris Johnson. Foreign reaction was overwhelmingly positive. The New York Times said the ceremony was \\"hilariously quirky ... a wild jumble of the celebratory and the fanciful; the conventional and the eccentric; and the frankly off-the-wall.\\" Forbes called it Boyle's \\"love song to Britain\\", while Sports Illustrated noted its political aspects, calling it \\"a celebration of protest and dissent\\". The Sydney Morning Herald said it was \\"an unforgettable start ... at once subversive and sublime\\" and The Times of India said \\"London presented a vibrant picture of Great Britain's rich heritage and culture.\\" The Chinese news agency Xinhua described the ceremony as \\"dazzling\\" and an \\"eccentric and exuberant celebration of British history, art and culture\\". Chinese artist Ai Weiwei praised the ceremony for its \\"human touch\\", saying \\"In London, they really turned the ceremony into a party ... such a density of information about events and stories and literature and music; about folktales and movies.\\" Russian President Putin said the ceremony was \\"wonderful and unforgettable\\". Dmitry Medvedev said \\"It was an exceptional spectacle, very well prepared and quite rich ... it succeeded in creating a very British atmosphere ... they managed to find the right language ... to communicate.\\" Panos Samaras of Greece's NET said \\"it was more like a big musical, a rock opera ... than an Olympics ceremony\\". French sports newspaper L'Équipe wrote that it \\"took the classic from such events and had fun with them\\" whilst Le Parisien said it \\"was magnificent, inventive and offbeat drawing heavily on the roots of British identity\\". Germany's Die Welt hailed it as \\"spectacular, glitzy but also provoking and moving\\". Chinese news CCTV-4 said the ceremony was a \\"stunning feast for the eyes\\". South Korea's Yonhap said it was \\"by turns dramatic, imaginative, humorous and solemn\\" and \\"weaved the story of the country's past, present and future\\". Singapore's Straits Times said it was a \\"grand show\\" noteworthy for both \\"scale\\" and \\"authenticity\\". The Australian Daily praised a \\"glorious pandemonium devoted to London's thriving, chaotic energy ... deliberately revelling in the chaos of Britain's free society and popular culture\\". France's Le Figaro said it reflected \\"the best contributions that Britain has given to the world ... its sense of humour, its music, and of course sport\\". The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said it was a \\"rocking, rollicking, sometimes quiet and brooding ceremony.\\" Qatar's The Peninsula said London did a \\"spectacular job\\" making the ceremony a \\"memorable event\\". In an end of the year review, British magazine Q said \\"It could all have been so different. As the London 2012 Summer Olympics approached, the tide of scepticism seemed almost irreversible. There was the heavy-handed sponsorship, the draconian security, the ticketing problems, the ballooning budget, and the lurking fear that the Opening Ceremony might be, in director Danny Boyle's pungent description, 'shite'. It took less than four hours on the night of Friday 27 July to turn the whole country around. Not only was the ceremony demonstrably not shite, it was the most surprising, moving, spectacular cultural event this country had ever seen...modern Britain, in all its berserk, multi-faceted glory.\\" The writer of the ceremony, Frank Cottrell-Boyce, said: \\"People around us thought it might need defending, so I was told to do press the next morning. I was completely surprised [by the positive response]. A lot of people were surprised. But I don't think Danny was surprised. Danny never blinked. At no point did he show any feeling that it was going to be anything but amazing. And he was right.\\" ==Awards and accolades== *Won the 'Beyond Theatre' award at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards, November 2012. A 'roar of delight' went up from the audience when it was announced that the creative team had won the award. *Won the \\"Theatre Event of the Year\\" at the Whatsonstage.com theatre awards, February 2013. This was decided by public vote. Boyle accepted the award along with some of the volunteer performers. *Won the \\"NME Award for Music Moment of the Year\\" at the NME Awards in February 2013. *Won the prestigious Judges' Award for Danny Boyle at the Royal Television Society Awards, March 2013.

The production team was also nominated for the Television Sport and Live Events 2013 Award. *The ceremony was nominated in five categories at the 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, 15 September 2013 in Los Angeles: **Won Outstanding Art Direction for Variety or Nonfiction Programming. The nominees were Mark Tildesley (Production Designer), Suttirat Anne Larlarb (Production Designer) and Danny Boyle (Art Director). **Nominated Outstanding Picture Editing for Short-Form Segments and Variety Specials. Sascha Dhillon (Editor) was nominated for the \\"Happy and Glorious\\" segment. **Nominated Outstanding Lighting Design/Lighting Direction for a Variety Special.

The nominees were Hamish Hamilton (director of the overall televising) and Bucky Gunts (director of the NBC coverage). In December 2012 the culture critic of The Guardian picked the ceremony as \\"best art event of the year\\". A British public survey by Samsung voted it the second most inspiring television moment of all time, second only to the 1969 moon landing. A Digital Spy survey of more than 25,000 overwhelmingly voted the ceremony as the entertainment highlight of 2012. The ceremony was the second most-mentioned entertainment event on the internet in 2012, with just over 6 million mentions, coming second to the Grammy Awards. The BBC reported that it was the most requested item from 2012 on its iPlayer on-demand service, with 3.3 million requests. Boyle was offered a knighthood in late 2012, but turned it down, saying \\"I'm very proud to be an equal citizen and I think that's what the Opening Ceremony was actually about.\\" ==Legacy== The ceremony was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new mood in the United Kingdom: it \\"had barely finished before it had become a byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's ceremony was hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this was the most important thing he took away from the Olympic experience: \\"How important it is to believe in something. You might make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe in that, you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you.\\" Business leaders also took inspiration from the event, admiring its risk-taking and creative freedom, as well as the trust placed in and loyalty inspired from the workers and volunteers. In February 2013 the BBC's Head of Drama Ben Stephenson told an audience of writers, commissioners and producers that he \\"wanted them to seek inspiration from the opening ceremony of the London Olympics\\" which, he said, \\"had scale and brilliance and, above all, had succeeded not in spite of its Britishness but because of its Britishness, delighting viewers here and around the world by rooting itself in the authentic stories and spirit of these islands.\\" Steve Coogan told Frank Cottrell-Boyce that he felt it was \\"like the emperor's new clothes in reverse ... it made irony and postmodernism feel tired and past its sell-by date\\", and Russell T Davies told Boyce: \\"It changed my idea of the possible.\\" Reviewing the 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony at Sochi, Russia, Owen Gibson of The Guardian observed that with his 'complex, intimate snapshot of \\"who we were, who we are and who we wish to be\\"', Boyle “rewrote the rule book for opening ceremonies”. ==See also== *2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony *2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony, which was also themed on The Tempest *2012 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony ==Further reading== *Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Humphrey Jennings and Marie-Louise Jennings, Pandaemonium 1660-1886: The Coming of the Machine as Seen by Contemporary Observers.

The main topic of discussion was the coronation of Vytautas as King of Lithuania. Other topics included: the siege of Moldavia; a potential coalition against the Ottoman Empire; the desire for improved relations between Denmark and the Hanseatic League; religious unions and divisions; as well as various economic, trade, and tax-related issues. ==Participants and delegates== The congress was hosted by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: Vytautas, other Lithuanian – Ruthenian aristocrats as well as local religious leaders Foreign delegates attending the congress included: *Kingdom of Poland: Jogaila, Bishop of Kraków, Zbigniew Oleśnicki, voivode of Kraków, Jan of Tarnów, and Polish magnates *Hungary: Future Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg and his wife Barbara; also representatives of noble German, Czech, Hungarian, and Croatian families *Danish kingdom: Eric of Pomerania *Livonian Order: Master of the Order Siegfried Landorf Spanheim and his knights *Teutonic Knights: Komtur of Balga *Pope Martin V sent his legate Andrew Dominican *Byzantine Empire: Delegates of Emperor John VIII Palaiologos *Grand Duchy of Moscow: Vasily II of Russia, Metropolitan of Kiev in Moscow Photius *Grand Duchy of Tver: Boris of Tver *Grand Duchy of Ryazan: Ivan III of Ryazan *Moldavian delegates *Khans of Volga, Don, and Perekop Vytautas the Great Guests celebrated, feasted, and hunted until diplomatic negotiations began. Seven hundred barrels of honey, wine, 700 oxen, 1,400 sheep, hundreds of elk, wild boar, and other dishes were consumed daily. Guests also competed in jousting during negotiation breaks. Working for Vytautas, the Jester Henne spied on Sigismund of Luxemburg under the pretense of entertaining the delegates. The diplomatic meeting is thought to have taken place in the Palace of Lubart's Castle, although it is speculated that it may have taken place instead in the Palace of Vytautas, located near the Dominican Monastery. ==Political proceedings== King meal *The Wallachia problem. Hungarians, Turks, and Poles all claimed a right to the land of Moldavia. Under the agreement of 1412, Moldavia had to act on the side of Sigismund in the struggle with the Turks. Moldavia, however, failed to follow the agreement. Thus Sigismund of Luxemburg suggested that this land be divided between Poland and Hungary. *The anti- Turkey coalition. Expanding their interests in the Balkans and the basin of the Danube, the monarchs were concerned about the Turkish threat. Although relations between the Ottoman Porte and the Byzantines had been peaceful at times, there was no hope for a peaceful future following the Ottoman-Venetian War of 1422–1430 ending in favor of the Turks and the Ottoman Siege of Constantinople in 1422. Hungarian and German kings made a proposal to Lithuania and Poland to become members of the anti-Turkey coalition. However, the Polish delegation expressed their reluctance to take such a great risk until the coalition was joined by the majority of the states. *Diplomacy between Denmark and Hansa. The Danish King Eric of Pomerania was interested in regulating the relations with Hansa cities. Battles between Denmark and Hansa had exhausted the kingdom. This problem was discussed at the Congress but the outcome of the discussion is unknown. *Religious problems. The Congress was proposed to realize the idea of a union between the Catholic and the Orthodox churches. Sigismund of Luxemburg and the papal legate supported the union. However, the clergy refused to join the discussion. The split between the Catholic church and the activities of Hussites in Bohemia were also discussed. The main aim of the council, a defense strategy to protect Europe from the Ottoman Turks, was not achieved because the Congress was dominated by another event. King Sigismund of Luxemburg encouraged the crowning of Vytautas as King of Lithuania. He was interested in dividing Lithuania and Poland, with a separate kingdom of Lithuania, to reduce the influence of Poland. ==References== * Stecki.

It first appeared in book form in the short-story collection Three for the Chair, published by the Viking Press in 1957. ==Plot summary== Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin travel to a hunting lodge in the Adirondacks owned by oil tycoon O.V. Bragan. They have been invited at the request of Theodore Kelefy, ambassador to the United States from a foreign country with large oil reserves, so that Wolfe can cook a dish of freshly-caught trout for a meeting of dignitaries at the lodge. In addition to Wolfe, Archie, Bragan, and Kelefy, five others are present - Kelefy's wife Adria; his advisor Spiros Papps; Assistant Secretary of State David M. Leeson and his wife Sally; and James Arthur Ferris, head of a rival oil company who is vying with Bragan for drilling rights in Kelefy's country. At the first night's dinner, Bragan spites Ferris by arranging for him to sit uncomfortably close to the lodge's blazing fireplace. The next morning, Bragan, Ferris, Kelefy, Papps, and Leeson set out to fish on different stretches of the river that runs through the property, in order to catch trout for lunch. After Wolfe starts to cook, Archie goes fishing on his own and finds Leeson's body, showing signs of a fatal head injury. Once lunch is finished and Wolfe begins to pack for the return trip to New York, Archie tells him of the discovery. The state and county police detain everyone at the lodge and soon establish that Leeson was murdered, most likely with a piece of firewood. District Attorney Jasper Colvin questions the group and begins to concentrate on Wolfe and Archie, hinting that someone may have hired them to kill Leeson. Colvin questions Wolfe about the fact that he cooked none of the trout Kelefy brought in, but Wolfe refuses to answer out of irritation over Colvin's attitude. In a private meeting, Wolfe turns down Bragan's offer to hire him to catch the murderer. They are interrupted by Ferris, who threatens to tell the state attorney general of Bragan's attempt to influence Kelefy and Papps so that the negotiations will turn in his favor. Later, Kelefy asks Wolfe what he plans to say to Colvin about the unused trout. Wolfe offers to state simply that he chose not to cook them out of caprice, and also promises to say nothing about the confrontation between Bragan and Ferris. Kelefy takes off an emerald ring and has Adria give it to Wolfe as a token of gratitude. After they leave, Wolfe and Archie examine the stone and find it to be flawed and of poor quality. Wolfe then calls his lawyer, Nathaniel Parker, and the two converse in French to prevent anyone listening in from learning about their discussion. He then has everyone gather in the main hall and calls the Secretary of State to explain his theory of the crime. The real reason he did not cook any of Kelefy's trout was that they were not fresh; they had been caught earlier and kept in a pool of water near the river. Surmising that Kelefy had simply had an unlucky day of fishing, Wolfe said nothing to avoid embarrassing him. However, when Kelefy had Adria give him the ring, Wolfe realized that it was meant as a bribe to conceal the truth, and an insultingly cheap one at that. Wolfe deduced that Kelefy had caught a creel of trout earlier in the day to allow him time to get the firewood piece and take Leeson by surprise. From Parker, he has learned that Kelefy is protected from prosecution by diplomatic immunity, and that anyone who swears out or serves a warrant against him will be subject to a prison term. When Wolfe starts to comment on Kelefy's choice to have Adria give him the ring, she knocks the phone away and Sally angrily confronts her. Adria had seduced Leeson while he was stationed in Kelefy's country, and Sally found out and had him recalled to the United States. When Adria encountered Leeson again at the lodge, she began to seduce him again, prompting Kelefy to kill him. Kelefy, Adria, and Papps leave the lodge to return home, Wolfe gives the ring to Colvin, and he and Archie depart for New York. Kelefy is executed a month later - whether in response to the murder or the failed oil-rights negotiations, Archie never finds out. ==Cast of characters== *Nero Wolfe — Private investigator based in Manhattan *Archie Goodwin — Wolfe's assistant (and the narrator of all Wolfe stories) *O.V.

It first appeared in book form in the short-story collection Three for the Chair, published by the Viking Press in 1957. ==Plot summary== Illustrated by Alex Ross, \\"Nero Wolfe and the Vanishing Clue\\" was the last Rex Stout story to appear in The American Magazine David R. Fyfe, a high school English teacher, asks Wolfe for advice concerning the death of his brother Bert. Twenty years earlier, Bert had left his family to pursue uranium mining opportunities in Canada. He had returned to New York and reconciled with his siblings—brothers David and Paul, sister Louise, and her husband Vincent Tuttle—in order to tell them of his success in finding a profitable site. Johnny Arrow, his Canadian business partner, accompanied Bert to New York. Bert had invited the family to dinner and the theater, but he developed pneumonia in the days leading up to it and was confined to his apartment. Dr. Frederick Buhl, the family physician, was called in from Mount Kisco to attend him and brought his nurse, Anne Goren. Anne gave Bert a dose of morphine to help him sleep, as instructed by Buhl; the next morning, though, Bert was dead. Arrow claims to have made an agreement with Bert that grants control of the mining business and any assets derived from it to either partner if the other dies, causing the family to suspect him. Altercations between Anne and Paul, and between Paul and Arrow, only cloud the matter further. Wolfe accepts a $1,000 retainer from David to investigate the circumstances of Bert's death and decide whether to involve the police. He focuses on the hot-water bags that had been placed in Bert's bed to keep him warm; Paul claims that they were empty when he found the body, but Anne insists that he told Louise he had emptied them himself. The incident is similar to the death of the Fyfes' father 20 years earlier, due to pneumonia worsened by a bedroom window left open during a blizzard. Bert was tried on a murder charge and acquitted, leading to his long estrangement from the family. Archie investigates the idea that Bert may have been poisoned or given an overdose, but Buhl states that the morphine was not tampered with and Anne says that she followed his instructions exactly. Wolfe brings Saul Panzer in to help and takes interest in the matter of some ice cream that Paul had bought for a Sunday party at the family home in Mount Kisco. He had put it in the refrigerator at Bert's apartment on the night of his death, but no one can remember seeing it since then. Archie fails to learn its whereabouts, but Wolfe surprises him by asking him to bring Buhl, Arrow, the Tuttles, and the Fyfes to the office. Wolfe informs the group that he has decided to notify the police about Bert's death and explains his theory of the crime. The ice cream Paul bought had been packed in dry ice to keep it cold; the murderer emptied the hot-water bags and placed the dry ice on top of them to lower Bert's body temperature to dangerous levels without causing frostbite burns or leaving any traces once it evaporated. Wolfe has learned that Tuttle provided an alibi for Bert during the murder trial, and that Bert had returned to New York to check into it. He had visited the landlady from whom he and Tuttle had rented rooms 20 years earlier, and Saul confirms that Tuttle has recently visited her as well. Based on David's statement that his father had refused Louise permission to marry Tuttle, Wolfe accuses Tuttle of opening the window to cause the elder Fyfe's death in revenge, then of causing Bert's death to prevent him from uncovering the truth. Tuttle is convicted of the murder of the Fyfes' father, and Arrow sends Wolfe and Archie a large payment in gratitude for clearing his name. ==Cast of characters== *Nero Wolfe — The private investigator *Archie Goodwin — Wolfe's assistant (and the narrator of all Wolfe stories) *Bert Fyfe — A wealthy uranium prospector, now deceased *David Fyfe, Paul Fyfe, and Louise Fyfe Tuttle — Bert's two brothers and sister *Vincent Tuttle — Louise's husband *Johnny Arrow — Bert Fyfe's business partner *Anne Goren — Bert Fyfe's nurse *Frederick Buhl, MD — Bert Fyfe's doctor ==Reviews and commentary== In a 1957 installment of \\"The Criminal Record\\", Saturday Review magazine's weekly column about detective literature, \\"A Window for Death\\" and the other two stories collected in Three for the Chair were pronounced the \\"usual smooth sailing … Trio of Nero Wolfe yarns finds big boy still lining 'em up and mowing 'em down.\\" Anthony Boucher called the book \\"one of the best of Stout's threesomes ...

It first appeared in book form in the short-story collection Three for the Chair, published by the Viking Press in 1957. ==Plot summary== With illustrations by Alex Ross, Rex Stout's \\"Too Many Detectives\\" first appeared in Collier's for September 14, 1956 — the first of only two Nero Wolfe stories to appear in the magazine Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin have been summoned to appear for questioning in Albany by the New York Secretary of State, part of an effort to investigate wiretapping activities by the state's private detectives. Dol Bonner, her assistant Sally Colt, and three other detectives from New York City have been brought in for the same day. Albert Hyatt, a deputy official, is in charge of the inquiry and calls Wolfe and Archie into his office to go over a statement Wolfe has provided. A man calling himself Otis Ross had asked Wolfe to tap his phone line and report all conversations, believing that his secretary might be leaking confidential business information. Wolfe took the job, but ended it after Archie discovered that the client was not the real Ross. One of Hyatt's staff members finds a man strangled to death in another meeting room; Wolfe and Archie identify him as their client. The city police detain everyone at the scene for questioning, under the direction of Chief of Detectives Leon Groom. Hyatt states that the client had come to see him shortly before the day's meetings were to begin, introduced himself as William A. Donahue, and said that he wanted to give information on some illegal wiretaps he had arranged - including the one performed by Wolfe. Donahue had been sent to another room to wait until Hyatt had more time to speak with him. Wolfe and Archie are arrested as material witnesses and held for most of the day until Wolfe arranges bail through his lawyer, Nathaniel Parker. They take a room at a nearby hotel, not being allowed to leave the city, and Archie calls the other detectives for a meeting so they can share information. Donahue had gone to all of them, giving a different name and address to each one and asking for a wiretap to be set up; from Lon Cohen, Archie learns that the targets were all members of a committee tasked with investigating the use of charity funds. Wolfe asks the detectives to mobilize as many operatives as they can and has Archie call Saul Panzer so that he can be ready to get instructions from Wolfe in the morning. Wolfe gives Archie that morning off, but when Archie returns to the hotel after a walk, he is taken for questioning by the district attorney. After being released, he spends the afternoon at his leisure and has dinner with Sally, only to be interrupted by a call from Wolfe. They find all the other detectives gathered in the room upon their return, and Hyatt and Groom arrive soon afterward. Wolfe and Dol have been taking reports from operatives all day long and gaining information on Hyatt and Donahue. Hyatt had been hired by a profitable fundraising organization to provide legal counsel, but the formation of the committee threatened its activities. Unable to get any information from the members directly, he arranged for Donahue to set up the wiretaps. Donahue's visit to his office was a surprise, and Hyatt killed him to prevent him from exposing the truth. Hyatt is convicted of the murder, and the other detectives invite Wolfe to a celebratory dinner; Wolfe declines, but invites them to dine at the brownstone instead. Archie realizes that Wolfe left him out of the investigation because there was nothing he could do to assist, and also because he could serve as a distraction for the district attorney so that Wolfe and Dol could go through the operatives' reports undisturbed. ==Cast of characters== *Nero Wolfe — The private investigator *Archie Goodwin — Wolfe's assistant (and the narrator of all Wolfe stories) *Steve Amsel, Theodolinda \\"Dol\\" Bonner, Harland Ide, Jay Kerr — Private investigators based in Manhattan *Sally Colt - Dol's main operative *Albert Hyatt — Special deputy of the New York secretary of state *Leon Groom — Chief of detectives of the City of Albany ==Publication history== \\"Too Many Detectives\\" *1956, Collier's, September 4, 1956 *1958, Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, October 1958 *1965, Ellery Queen's Anthology, Mid-year 1965 *1970, Ellery Queen's Mystery Jackpot, ed. by Ellery Queen, New York: Pyramid T-2207, April 1970 Three for the Chair *1957, New York: The Viking Press, May 3, 1957, hardcoverTownsend, Guy M., Rex Stout: An Annotated Primary and Secondary Bibliography.

It lies in the north of the country and is a small tourist center and a coastal bay. The town was formerly known as Blanco (White) or Pueblo Blanco (White Town), possibly after the many Spaniards who came to trade timber. Due to its shape and location, Luperon bay is ideal for sheltering from hurricanes, and many boats anchor there during the hurricane season. Although there is no record of early inhabitants, it is said that Christopher Columbus had to enter the bay to protect his ships from a storm. Columbus named it \\"Bahia de Gracias\\" (Thanksgiving Bay), the current official name. The current mayor is Danilo Morrobel of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD in Spanish), who after a few failed attempts finally beat Mario Martinez of the PRD party to become the local mayor. The slain dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo had plans to elevate Luperon to the status of province but was killed a few months before he was due to do it. Three of the better-known families are the Morrobel, Cueto and Villamán families. They were the pioneers of this town, and their numbers continue to grow. Luperón's beaches have made it well known as a prime vacation location. In recent years, a sizeable population of Luperonians have moved abroad (most notably to Spain), often maintaining their same careers by working within the resort and catering industries. The bay contains extensive mangroves, unique to Hispaniola, and is an ecological habitat for many species. Unlike most of the towns in the northern part of the island, also known as Cibao, Luperon does not have a big cockfighting fan base. The sport is legal in the Dominican Republic and followed by thousands in the country. It has an arena where, every Friday afternoon, the cockfights take place. Money is made out of bets and the entrance fee. The sport though is not as big in Luperón as in the other towns in the Puerto Plata province. Every year the town holds a heavily attended softball tournament. This takes place every Saturday and Sunday at the local field. Games are played only during the daytime as the field lacks electric lights. The Williams family is noted for baseball expertise in Luperón. Basketball is also popular, with a basketball tournament being held every summer. The tournament consists of local players, Luperón-born players and a few players from other municipalities, although there can only be two non-local players per team. Unlike softball, the basketball games are played at night, also during the weekends and the attendees are charged a small fee to enter. == Climate == Luperón has a tropical savanna climate with a pronounced dry season in summer and a wet season in winter (Köppen climate classification: As). == References  Sources == * - World-Gazetteer.com Category:Populated places in Puerto Plata Province Category:Municipalities of the Dominican Republic ","title":"Luperón, Dominican Republic"},{"id":"35937160","text":"\\"Invitation to Murder\\" is a Nero Wolfe mystery novella by Rex Stout, first published as \\"Will to Murder\\" in the August 1953 issue of The American Magazine. It first appeared in book form in the short-story collection Three Men Out, published by the Viking Press in 1954. ==Plot summary== Herman Lewent offers to pay Wolfe $1,000 to solve a problem regarding his family's finances. Lewent's father left his entire estate to his daughter Beryl in his will 20 years earlier, with a provision that she should look after Lewent's needs. She sent him $1,000 per month until her death one year ago, leaving the estate to her husband, Theodore Huck. Lewent has tried to persuade Huck to give him a portion of the money, to no avail; Huck intends to keep sending him only the $1,000 monthly payment. Now, Lewent is concerned that one of Huck's three attractive female employees is trying to seduce him into cutting Lewent off, and he wants Wolfe to find out which one it is. When Wolfe rejects the case as a family squabble, Lewent mentions that Beryl died of ptomaine poisoning at Huck's house; he believes that one of the three women murdered her. Wolfe turns the case over to Archie, who accepts and travels to Huck's mansion, where Lewent also lives. Huck's declining health has confined him to a wheelchair, which is motorized and outfitted with various conveniences. The three employees Lewent suspects are secretary Dorothy Riff, nurse Sylvia Marcy, and housekeeper Cassie O'Shea. Archie questions Huck, using the pretense that Beryl might have hinted at entrusting one of them with part of her father's estate to be turned over to Lewent, in an attempt to draw out information on them. Huck sees through the deception and even believes it might be part of a blackmail scheme on Lewent's part, so Archie questions the women instead, as well as Huck's nephew Paul Thayer, who lives in the mansion and who warned Lewent about the women's possible designs on the money. Stopping at Lewent's room, Archie finds him lying dead on the floor inside, the base of his skull caved in. However, the skin is not broken, there is no blood on the floor, and the blow appears to have been delivered at an upward angle. The geometry of the room leads him to believe that Lewent was killed elsewhere and his body moved to this location. Archie calls Wolfe with an update, then continues his questioning of the household members without revealing his knowledge of Lewent's death to any of them. He is thrown off by Huck's decision to present Dorothy, Sylvia, and Cassie each with an expensive jeweled wristwatch. Finding himself stumped after dinner that evening, Archie calls Wolfe and tricks him into coming to the mansion by faking an attack on himself. Wolfe is furious that Archie would stoop to such methods, but prepares to question the household about both Lewent's allegations and Beryl's death. He learns that Beryl had died after eating pickled artichokes at a party; since she had taken them all and no other guests became ill, it was assumed that the artichokes had been poisoned. Wolfe offers Huck a deal: for $100,000, he will investigate and use what he finds to persuade Lewent that his suspicions are groundless, with the caveat that no one will ever tell Lewent of this arrangement. Huck accepts the terms and everyone agrees to keep them secret, and Wolfe and Archie excuse themselves to speak with Lewent in his room. Only after Wolfe has examined the body and the scene does he allow Archie to call the police and tell the others of the murder. Inspector Cramer and his men soon arrive to question the household members; while this is going on, Archie suddenly realizes that he knows how Lewent's body was transported without attracting attention. Wolfe identifies Huck as the murderer and explains that he tricked Lewent into bending over to pick something up off the floor, then struck him with a spherical paperweight. The smooth surface would not break the skin, and Lewent's posture would make it appear that the blow was delivered upward. Huck then put the body in his lap, covered it with the quilt he always used to keep his legs warm, and drove his wheelchair to Lewent's room to dump the body. He was eager to accept Wolfe's $100,000 offer because he knew that Lewent would never hear of the results, and he had earlier poisoned Beryl in order to inherit her fortune. Cassie provides further motive, saying that Huck had been having an affair with her; when Beryl found out about it, Huck made up his mind to kill her. Sylvia removes her wristwatch and puts it in Huck's lap as Cramer prepares to take him into custody. Even though he is eventually convicted, Archie does not know if Dorothy or Cassie ever returned theirs. ==Publication history== \\"Invitation to Murder\\" *1953, The American Magazine, August 1953 (as \\"Will to Murder\\")Townsend, Guy M., Rex Stout: An Annotated Primary and Secondary Bibliography.

It first appeared in book form in the short-story collection Three Men Out, published by the Viking Press in 1954. ==Plot summary== Leo Heller, a mathematics expert who uses his knowledge of probability to assist his clients with their problems, tries to hire Wolfe for a difficult case. He believes that one of his clients may have committed a crime, but does not want to tell the police of his suspicions without evidence to back them up. Wolfe angrily refuses the job, remembering a past incident in which he lost a client to Heller, but Archie offers to stop by the next day for a preliminary discussion. The following morning, Archie goes to Heller's private office at the agreed-on time but finds it empty, with the door open. Taking note of several pencils lying in an unusual pattern on the desk, he asks the five clients in the waiting room if any of them have seen Heller in person, but all of them say no. That evening, Inspector Cramer arrives at the brownstone with news that Heller has been found dead, shot through the heart and stuffed into his office closet. Accounts of Heller's movements suggest that he was killed shortly before Archie entered the office. The arrangement of the pencils on Leo Heller's desk, with one eraser torn off and placed between the groups. Cramer demands to know Wolfe's involvement in the case for two reasons: an envelope in Heller's desk, marked with Wolfe's name and containing $500 cash; and the pencils, whose pattern he re-creates as best he can. Archie corrects it slightly, tearing the eraser off one pencil and placing it in the middle of the pattern. Cramer is convinced that they stand for Wolfe's initials when viewed from the side, even though one grouping has too many strokes to form a W. Wolfe dismisses Cramer's claims, keeps the $500, and briefly looks through a book from his shelves before locking it in a desk drawer. He asks Cramer to bring in Heller's five clients as well as Susan Maturo, a woman who had left Heller's building just as Archie entered to meet with him, and urges Cramer to watch for instances of the number six. Wolfe and Cramer question these six people one by one, learning of their various reasons for wanting to see Heller. They take a particular interest in Susan, a nurse who had worked in a hospital where a bomb exploded a month earlier, killing 302 people. She had thought of hiring Heller to find the culprit, but changed her mind at the last minute and began to think of hiring Wolfe instead. The number six figures in every person's account, but a remark by one client – about Heller's winning tip on a racehorse named Zero – prompts Wolfe to have everyone brought back to his office. With the pencils laid out on his desk as they were on Heller's, Wolfe explains that the book he consulted earlier was on the history of mathematics. The two groups of pencils were arranged to symbolize a three and a two, and he originally assumed that the eraser between them stood for multiplication; hence his focus on the number six. However, the mention of the horse's name made him realize that the eraser was meant to stand for a zero. Before he was killed, Heller had laid out the pencils to form the number 302 – the death toll in the hospital bombing. Aside from Susan, the only client with any substantial connection to that hospital is Jack Ennis, an inventor who had unsuccessfully tried to persuade the staff to use a new X-ray machine he had designed. Wolfe conjectures that he set the bomb as revenge for this rejection, learned that Heller might have become suspicious enough to call in Wolfe, and killed him. As Ennis is placed under arrest, Archie reassures Susan that he is guilty, and a jury reaches the same conclusion at his trial two months later. ==The unfamiliar word== \\"Nero Wolfe talks in a way that no human being on the face of the earth has ever spoken, with the possible exception of Rex Stout after he had a gin and tonic,\\" said Michael Jaffe, executive producer of the A&E; TV series, A Nero Wolfe Mystery.Quoted in Vitaris, Paula, \\"Miracle on 35th Street: Nero Wolfe on Television,\\" Scarlet Street, issue #45, 2002, p. 36 \\"Readers of the Wolfe saga often have to turn to the dictionary because of the erudite vocabulary of Wolfe and sometimes of Archie,\\" wrote Rev. Frederick G. Gotwald.Gotwald, Rev. Frederick G., The Nero Wolfe Handbook (1985; revised 1992, 2000), page 234 Nero Wolfe's vocabulary is one of the hallmarks of the character. Examples of unfamiliar words — or unfamiliar uses of words that some would otherwise consider familiar — are found throughout the corpus, often in the give-and-take between Wolfe and Archie. * Sennight, chapter 6.

It first appeared in book form in the short-story collection Three Men Out, published by the Viking Press in 1954. The character of Beaky Durkin is not presented as being related in any way to Fred Durkin, a free-lance detective often hired by Wolfe to assist with cases. ==Plot== Illustrated by Thornton Utz, \\"This Won't Kill You\\" first appeared as \\"This Will Kill You\\" in The American Magazine (September 1952) Wolfe and Archie honor a house guest's request to see a baseball game by taking him to the final game of the World Series at the Polo Grounds. The tickets come courtesy of Emil Chisholm, part- owner of the New York Giants, but Wolfe is in no mood to enjoy the game or the surroundings. The Giants fall far behind the Boston Red Sox due to inept fielding on the part of several players, and Archie notices that Nick Ferrone, a talented rookie, is not part of the day's lineup. He and Wolfe are summoned to the Giants' clubhouse by Chisholm, where they meet manager Art Kinney, team doctor Horton Soffer, and talent scout Beaky Durkin. Soffer has discovered that four of the Giants players have been drugged, by drinking beverages laced with a sedative before the game. Suspicion immediately falls on the absent Ferrone, and Archie finds him dead in another room of the clubhouse, his skull fractured with a baseball bat. The Giants lose the game and the Series, and the police arrive to question everyone on the team at length. They begin to focus on catcher Bill Moyse, who had previously confronted Ferrone over his interest in Moyse's wife Lila. As the questioning comes to an end, Wolfe asks that the four players who were drugged remain behind, along with Kinney, Soffer, Durkin, and Chisholm, and comments that one fact has come to light and drawn his attention. Realizing that he had previously seen Lila seated in the stands and looking pleased at the Giants' poor play, Archie leaves the stadium and finds her and a friend sitting in her parked car a few blocks away. He claims that her behavior may lead the police to think that Moyse was paid to drug the drinks and fix the game, but learns from her friend that she was angry at Moyse being left on the bench throughout the entire Series and had taken pleasure in their loss. Lila insists that Moyse had nothing to do with the drugging or the murder, but admits that the two of them had been approached by someone who wanted Moyse to fix the game: her uncle, Dan Gale. She drives Archie to Gale's drugstore in an attempt to persuade Gale to tell the police and clear Moyse's name. Instead, Gale threatens to disfigure her with sulfuric acid; Archie recognizes that he is trying to buy time for his associates to arrive and deal with their intrusion. Gale, a compulsive gambler, lost ownership of the drugstore but had been offered a chance to reclaim it by fixing the Series on behalf of organized crime. Archie and Lila subdue Gale, spilling the acid but not injuring him or themselves, and Archie calls the police to come pick him up and look for his accomplices. Upon Archie's return to the stadium, Wolfe confronts the eight men who have remained in the clubhouse and notes that the assumption that Ferrone drugged the drinks is implausible. Brought into the Giants' organization by Durkin, Ferrone had performed so well that his next year's salary would be increased and he would receive a large bonus if the team won the Series. Instead, Wolfe conjectures that Ferrone caught someone else drugging the drinks and was killed to keep him quiet. The fact that drew his attention is that Durkin had been sitting in the stands from the starting lineup announcement until the time he was called into the clubhouse. Wolfe considers it highly unlikely that a scout who had brought such a promising young player onto the team would not become angry over learning that he was not going to play in a pivotal championship game. Wolfe asserts that Durkin acted as he did because he had killed Ferrone, but he has no proof until Kinney and the players intimidate Durkin into admitting his guilt. He had accepted a bribe to fix the game as a way to pay off his gambling debts; when Ferrone confronted him over a bet he had placed against the Giants, Durkin panicked and killed him. The money is found hidden in a radio, and one of the players knocks Durkin unconscious when he tries to flee. Just before Archie can call the police to inform them of Durkin's capture, they call the clubhouse with news that Gale has confessed to paying him off. Wolfe and Archie find themselves at odds with each other over whether they or the police can take credit for solving the murder. ==Cast of characters== The American Magazine listed and described the characters.Stout, Rex. \\"This Will Kill You\\".

It first appeared in book form in the short-story collection Curtains for Three, published by the Viking Press in 1951. ==Plot== Thornton Utz illustrated \\"The Gun with Wings\\" for The American Magazine (December 1949) Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Mion, widow of opera tenor Alberto Mion, and Frederick Weppler, the music critic for the Gazette, ask Wolfe to investigate Mion's death from four months earlier. His body had been found in his apartment's soundproof practice studio, shot through the roof of the mouth. The police have ruled the case a suicide, but Peggy insists that Mion never would have been able to kill himself even though she was thinking of leaving Mion for Weppler. She pays Wolfe a $5,000 retainer to find out the truth so that she and Weppler can put their minds at ease and start a life together. Six weeks prior to Mion's death, baritone Gifford James had learned from his daughter Clara that Mion had seduced her, and he punched Mion in the neck out of anger. The blow injured Mion's larynx, requiring an operation, and he was having trouble regaining full use of his voice. On the day of his death, he held a conference with James and several other individuals who were professionally affected by the incident, to discuss the issue of restitution to be paid by James. Among them was Dr. Nicholas Lloyd, the surgeon who performed the operation. Some time after the conference ended, Weppler and Peggy visited the apartment to confront Mion about their love for each other, only to find him dead in the studio. The police report states that Mion's gun was found on the floor next to the body, rather than at the base of a bust of Enrico Caruso that was placed across the studio. However, Weppler and Peggy insist that it was not on the floor when they entered. Wolfe believes they are lying, but proceeds with a plan to bring the involved parties to his office by sending out notices that Peggy plans to sue James for damages on behalf of Mion's estate. During this meeting, Clara reveals that she had made up the story she told her father about Mion's seducing her. Lloyd had called on a professional colleague to get a second opinion regarding Mion's prognosis that would confirm his own. The next day, Inspector Cramer visits the brownstone at Wolfe's request. Wolfe surprises Archie by openly telling Cramer of his belief that Mion was murdered, even though he has no evidence to support it. Cramer is incensed, but reluctantly agrees to go along with Wolfe's suggestion that Weppler and Peggy be arrested as material witnesses. They are released on bail the following day but find themselves being followed by the police, and they come to see Wolfe in a panic. Weppler admits that he had seen the gun at the Caruso bust and put it on the floor to divert suspicion from himself and Peggy, but Wolfe hypothesizes that the gun had originally been on the floor but was previously moved by someone else. Archie tricks Clara into admitting that she had entered the studio using her own key, arriving just before Weppler and Peggy, found the gun on the floor, and moved it to the bust in order to implicate Peggy. She refuses to sign a statement to that effect brought by Archie, so he instead has her sign a note documenting her refusal. At the brownstone, Wolfe uses the note to forge Clara's signature on the statement and then calls Cramer, Sergeant Purley Stebbins, and everyone involved to his office so he can close the case. The murderer is Lloyd, who had begun to think that his reputation would be destroyed by Mion's slow recovery and/or an error he might have made during the operation. With assistance from Archie and James, Wolfe demonstrates the manner in which Lloyd could have killed Mion without any resistance. Lloyd had asked Mion to open his mouth for a throat examination; as he did so, his eyes naturally tilted upward toward the ceiling, and Lloyd was able to put the gun in Mion's mouth and fire without being seen. Lloyd runs for the door but is caught by Cramer and Stebbins, and Archie takes advantage of the ensuing chaos to slip out of the office and get himself a glass of milk. Trivia In chapter 2, Archie makes either a mistake or a deliberate error in his statement: > \\"Granted that you're dead right,\\" I observed, \\"which is not what you call > apodictical, someday we ought to make up a list of the clients that have sat > here and lied to us. There was Mike Walsh, and Calida Frost, and that > cafeteria guy, Pratt — oh, dozens. But their money was good, and I didn't > get so far behind with my notes that I couldn't catch up. All that for > nothing?\\" Only Calida Frost (The Red Box) fit the description. Mike Walsh (The Rubber Band) and Pratt (Some Buried Caesar) had not lied to Wolfe, and as far as the published stories, Pratt had never been to Wolfe's office. ==Publication history== \\"The Gun with Wings\\" *1949, The American Magazine, June 1949Townsend, Guy M., Rex Stout: An Annotated Primary and Secondary Bibliography.

It first appeared in book form in the short-story collection Curtains for Three, published by the Viking Press in 1951. ==Plot summary== Thornton Utz illustrated \\"Bullet for One\\" for The American Magazine (July 1948) Wolfe and Archie investigate the week-old murder of industrial designer Sigmund Keyes at the request of five people who worked closely with him: Ferdinand Pohl, Frank Broadyke, Wayne Safford, Audrey Rooney, and Keyes' daughter Dorothy. They believe that Victor Talbott, his sales agent, committed the murder, and want the truth to come out so that the police will stop harassing them. Keyes had frequently gone horseback riding in a local park during the early morning, and Talbott sometimes accompanied him. On the day of Keyes' death, a mounted policeman had seen him on his usual path; not long afterward, the horse emerged from the park with no rider. Keyes' body had been found in a thicket near the path, shot in the chest. Wolfe agrees to find the murderer, regardless of his/her identity, just before Talbott himself arrives at the office. He explains that Keyes had invited him to ride that morning, but he declined in order to sleep in at the hotel where he had been staying. The meeting is briefly interrupted by Inspector Cramer's attempt to enter the brownstone, but Archie refuses him entry and returns to find Safford and Talbott fighting in the office. He breaks up the fight and throws Talbott out. None of the six has an airtight alibi, and all will benefit from Keyes' death in various ways. Dorothy stands to inherit his business and no longer has to deal with his objection to her romantic relationship with Talbott; Pohl was unhappy with the return on his investment in Keyes' business; Broadyke, one of Keyes' professional rivals, was being sued by Keyes for using stolen designs; Audrey, Talbott's secretary, had been accused by Keyes of being Broadyke's accomplice in the theft; and Safford, a stable hand at the riding academy where Keyes kept his horse, had gotten into a fistfight with him over his treatment of Audrey. Wolfe brings Saul Panzer and Orrie Cather in on the case and sends Archie to meet with Officer Hefferan, the mounted policeman who saw Keyes on the path. Hefferan was too far away to see Keyes' face, but recognized his horse, riding outfit, and behavior in the saddle. Calling in to update Wolfe, Archie receives instructions to meet Pohl at Keyes' office and stop him from pestering Wolfe. Pohl provides Archie with a list of Talbott's most recent out-of-town business trips, having been instructed to do so by Wolfe; they are interrupted by the arrival of Talbott and Dorothy, and Pohl and Talbott begin to fight before Dorothy has them both arrested. Audrey arrives next with news that Safford has been arrested as a material witness, and Sergeant Purley Stebbins quickly takes her into custody as well. Broadyke has been arrested on a charge of receiving stolen goods, leaving Dorothy as the only one of the six principals still at liberty. She reveals that she has forged checks in Keyes' name and is terrified that his lawyer will use this fact against her, but Wolfe has no advice to give her and sends her away. While closing up the office for the night, Archie finds a note from Wolfe stating that the case is now closed; the next morning, he is surprised to find Cramer on the stoop when he returns from doing errands. Wolfe explains that he will soon be able to turn Keyes' murderer over to the police. The following morning, Wolfe stages a demonstration in which one of the principals is chosen to dress in a duplicate of Keyes' riding outfit, use his horse, and copy his mannerisms while riding through the park. Hefferan cannot tell this figure from the one he saw on the morning of Keyes' murder, and the rider tries to flee only to be caught by several mounted officers. Talbott had in fact murdered Keyes and was the one chosen to stand in for him. Wolfe used the list provided by Pohl to track down tailors in the cities Talbott had visited, find the one that made a duplicate of Keyes' outfit, and have him make another one for the demonstration. Talbott had constructed his alibi in order to allow himself a chance to slip away from the hotel, shoot Keyes before he ever started his ride, impersonate him to fool Hefferan, and get back to the hotel without raising suspicion. ==Publication history== \\"Bullet for One\\" 280px *1948, The American Magazine, July 1948Townsend, Guy M., Rex Stout: An Annotated Primary and Secondary Bibliography.

She identifies herself as Cynthia Brown, but admits that this is one of several aliases that she uses as a confidence artist. She tells Archie about Doris Hatten, a friend of hers who was strangled to death five months earlier, and a man she had seen entering Doris' apartment that day. She did not tell the police about him at the time, but she has seen the man among the guests and is asking for Wolfe's help in persuading him to leave her alone. However, Wolfe insists that Archie return upstairs to look after the guests. At the end of the gathering, they learn that Cynthia has been strangled to death in the office. Wolfe, Archie, Fritz, and Saul keep all the remaining guests from leaving so that the police can question them. Among them are Mimi Orwin, a wealthy woman that Cynthia had been swindling; Percy Brown, Cynthia's partner in the scam; and food company executive Homer N. Carlisle and his wife, the latter of whom found the body. Inspector Cramer comments that Doris had no visible means of support, speculating that a man may have been paying the rent on her apartment. During the course of questioning all the guests, he has his men examine the office and seal it off to spite Wolfe. Once the police and guests have departed, Wolfe muses on the character of the murderer, concluding that this person would take on the challenge of waiting until Cynthia's body was found in hopes of learning what she might have told Archie. He composes a note and has Archie mail it to one person - the one he believes to be the murderer, based on Archie's report of his conversation with Cynthia. The note claims that Cynthia told Archie enough to let him identify the culprit, and that he wants a face- to-face meeting in order to decide what to do with that information. The next morning, he receives a phone call in which a male voice summons him to a particular address that night. Upon arrival, he is tied to a chair and relieved of his gun by Skinny and W-J, two men working for the murderer. Archie offers to keep silent on Cynthia's murder in exchange for $50,000 and warns that Wolfe will give all information on the case to the police if he does not return home safely by midnight. He announces the murderer's identity to Skinny and W-J as Mrs. Carlisle, disguised as a man; these two manage to restrain her, but she shoots and wounds both Archie and W-J. Once the case is closed and the office has been unsealed, Wolfe explains to Cramer the details that allowed him to deduce Mrs. Carlisle's guilt. Cynthia had said to Archie that she never would have recognized Doris' killer among the guests in the orchid rooms if he had not been wearing his hat. All of the men had left their hats in the front room when they arrived, but the women kept theirs on; Wolfe realized from Cynthia's statement that the culprit was a woman who had disguised herself on the day of Doris' murder. Mimi and Mrs. Carlisle were the only women who stayed until the body was found, and Mimi's build would have made it difficult to pass herself off convincingly as a man. Carlisle had been paying Doris' rent and carrying on a love affair with her, and Mrs. Carlisle donned his clothing and acquired a key in order to enter the apartment and kill her out of jealousy. ==Publication history== \\"Disguise for Murder\\" *1950, The American Magazine, September 1950, as \\"The Twisted Scarf\\"Townsend, Guy M., Rex Stout: An Annotated Primary and Secondary Bibliography.

Archie recognizes the threat as a clipping from a movie advertisement in The American Magazine, in which many Wolfe stories, including this one, first appeared. Wolfe declines the offer, giving Jensen some advice on how to look out for his own safety, and Archie provides him with the name of an agency that does bodyguard work. Jensen had been involved in one of Wolfe's earlier cases,Not part of the corpus of Wolfe stories. It has been stated that Help Wanted, Male is in some sense a sequel to \\"Booby Trap\\" but the two stories are completely independent of one another. in which an Army captain named Peter Root had offered to sell him classified information. Root was brought before a court martial and sentenced to three years in prison. The following morning's newspaper carries a report that both Jensen and the bodyguard he hired have been shot and killed; Wolfe denies to Inspector Cramer that he is taking any interest in the case. That day's mail brings a death threat addressed to Wolfe, identical to the one Jensen received. Since the Root case is all that Wolfe and Jensen had in common, Wolfe and Archie track down current information on everyone connected to it, including Root's family and fiancée, Jane Geer. Archie hurries to fill his end of the order before he must leave for a meeting in Washington, D.C. with his superiors in Army Intelligence. He locates Jane and brings her to the brownstone, but they are both surprised to find Jensen's son Emil—an Army major—waiting at the door. Wolfe does not come down to meet them, but instead orders Archie over the in-house telephone to send them away. While in Washington, Archie notices a help-wanted advertisement in a New York paper, calling for male applicants who are the same height and weight as Wolfe. Sneaking out of his meeting and hurrying back to Manhattan, Archie is surprised to see someone other than Wolfe in the detective's custom-built chair. Wolfe introduces the man as H.H. Hackett, who has responded to the ad and is being paid $100 per day to impersonate him at home and in public. He is using Hackett as a decoy to draw the fire of would-be killers so that he can determine who might want him dead. \\"Archie\\"—Wolfe's tone was sharp—\\"do you think I enjoy this idiotic horseplay?\\" Wolfe has determined, from information provided by Army Intelligence, that Root and his parents had no apparent involvement in the murders. He asks Archie to bring Jane in for an interview, with Hackett doubling for him while he observes from the peephole in the office wall. Archie now understands why Wolfe sent her away earlier; he did not want her to see him in person so that she would be fooled by Hackett as a stand-in. Jane and Emil arrive for the appointment together, having developed a close relationship since Archie last saw them. He puts them in the front room and goes to consult with Wolfe about Emil's unexpected presence, but the sound of a gunshot startles everyone. Rushing into the office, Archie finds that a bullet has been fired through Wolfe's chair and into the wall behind it, apparently from the front room, and that Hackett's ear is nicked. Archie finds an old, recently fired revolver hidden in the front room, and Wolfe reveals himself to the visitors and takes charge. He calls Cramer to inform him about the weapon, which turns out to be the one that killed Jensen and the bodyguard, and pits Jane and Emil against each other in an effort to draw out the killer. However, the case turns in a new direction when he notices a cushion missing from the front room's couch. It is soon found in the bottom drawer of Wolfe's desk; this discovery, along with the fact that one of the guns in Archie's desk has been recently fired, allows him to solve the case and turn the culprit over to Cramer. The murderer is Hackett, actually Root's father Thomas, bent on revenge against everyone he blames for his son's imprisonment. After killing Jensen and the bodyguard, and sending the death threat to Wolfe, he responded to Wolfe's ad and smuggled the murder weapon inside. During a time when he was alone in the office, he took a cushion from the couch, wrapped it around the gun to muffle the report, and fired a shot through the chair and into the wall. He hid the cushion in the desk and the gun in the front room, and made sure to sit in the chair so that his head would cover the bullet hole. While Jane and Emil were waiting in the front room, he took a gun from Archie's desk, fired into the cushion, and used a pocketknife to cut a gash in his ear before returning the gun. Given one more day, Hackett/Thomas would have been able to kill Wolfe and focus suspicion on Jane and Emil. ==Cast of characters== *Nero Wolfe — The private investigator *Archie Goodwin — Wolfe's assistant, and the narrator of all Wolfe stories *Ben Jensen — Publisher and a witness in a prior case against Captain Peter Root *Major Emil Jensen — Ben Jensen's son, an Army major *Jane Geer — Peter's ex-fiancée *H.

It first appeared in book form in the short-story collection Trouble in Triplicate, published by the Viking Press in 1949. ==Plot summary== \\"If he kills me, I want somebody to know about it,\\" Poor said. Eugene R. Poor, co-owner of a novelty products company, and his wife, Martha, bring an unusual problem to Wolfe. Poor believes that his business partner, Conroy Blaney, is going to kill him and take full control of the company; he wants Wolfe to ensure that justice is done on Blaney when it happens. Martha has tried to persuade Poor to sell his share of the company to Blaney, without success, but Poor is determined to see his own murderer punished. Wolfe accepts a $5,000 fee, agreeing only to inform the police of what Poor has told him if Poor dies within one year. Helen Vardis had arrived just after the police got there. She said she had come to see Poor on a confidential matter. That evening, Inspector Cramer calls Wolfe with news that Poor is dead, his head blown apart by an exploding cigar in his own apartment. Visiting the scene, Archie learns from Martha that she and Poor had started off to visit Blaney at his estate in White Plains for a business discussion, but Poor had decided during the trip not to go. She left him at a tavern along the way, went to the meeting alone, and picked him up on the return trip. Once back in the apartment, he had opened a fresh box of cigars and lit one, but it exploded with great force and killed him. Archie also meets Joe Groll, the foreman at the company's factory, and Helen Vardis, an employee. Blaney also arrives at the scene and is shocked to see Poor's remains. The next day, Cramer brings news to Wolfe that every cigar in that box had been rigged with a small but powerful explosive capsule, manufactured for military use by a different company, and that two of Martha's hairs were found inside. Wolfe considers this to be evidence against her involvement, since a person involved in such painstaking work would be careful not to leave any traces. Blaney visits the brownstone as well to argue for his own innocence, but his annoying manner soon drives Wolfe to send him away. Wolfe calls Saul Panzer in to investigate, having taken an interest in finding photographs of Poor when he was alive, and Archie catches up to Groll for a talk and realizes that Helen has been following them. The three search the company offices and find several hiding places, one of which contains four explosive capsules. At the brownstone, Wolfe tests one of the capsules by placing it in a coffee percolator and lighting its fuse; it explodes violently enough to damage the percolator and hurl its lid across the office, barely missing him. Wolfe dispatches Archie to take two of the others to Cramer, who threatens to get a warrant for the last one. Wolfe takes a sudden interest in a newspaper article about a man found dead in White Plains with his head crushed, and calls the local district attorney to confirm his identity as Arthur Howell, an employee of the company that had manufactured the capsules. Once the body has been identified, Wolfe sends Archie to see Martha with a photograph of Poor (obtained by Saul) that has the last capsule taped to it. Archie warns Martha that he has orders to deliver her to either Wolfe or the police, but she instead kills herself by putting the capsule in her mouth and setting it off. A furious Cramer confronts Wolfe at the brownstone, but Wolfe maintains that he has broken no laws in prodding Martha to suicide. He had realized that the man who came to see him was an impostor, since Poor was an experienced cigar smoker and the man had barely been able to light one properly. Martha chose Howell for her plot to kill her husband because he bore a strong resemblance to Poor, and she persuaded him to give her some of the capsules so she could spike Poor's cigars. During her supposed meeting with Blaney in White Plains, she met with Howell and killed him, running over his head with her car. The photograph that Saul obtained was actually of Howell, but Archie mistook it as one of Poor because he did not know of Howell's existence at the time. Cramer points out that it was Martha who paid Wolfe the $5,000, but Wolfe counters by saying that Poor got his money's worth even if he did not directly pay the fee. ==The unfamiliar word== \\"Readers of the Wolfe saga often have to turn to the dictionary because of the erudite vocabulary of Wolfe and sometimes of Archie,\\" wrote Rev.

It first appeared in book form in the short-story collection Black Orchids, published by Farrar & Rinehart in 1942. ==Plot summary== Bess Huddleston arranges parties for New York society. She has been in contact with Wolfe once before, when she wanted him to play the detective at a party that would feature a mock murder; Wolfe declined to participate. Now, she comes with one anonymous letter in hand and a report of another. They were not sent to her, nor do they threaten her directly: rather, one was sent to a client and the other to a member of the circle in which her clients move. The letters imply strongly that Miss Huddleston has been gossiping about her clients' private lives. She wants Wolfe to put an end to the smear campaign – if it continues, her monied clients will no longer trust her and won't hire her to arrange their parties. Miss Huddleston has two employees, an assistant party arranger named Janet Nichols and a secretary named Maryella Timms. Both have access to a box of stationery of the same kind used for the letters. The letters are typewritten, and appear to Miss Huddleston's eye to have been typed on one of her typewriters. Wolfe tells Miss Huddleston to have Miss Nichols and Miss Timms come to his office. They do so, and arrive at a moment when Wolfe and Fritz are discussing another attempt at cooking corned beef. This has long been a problem in the brownstone's kitchen, one never satisfactorily resolved. Miss Timms hears about the dilemma and barges into the kitchen to help.\\"Ah heah yawl makin' cawned beef ha-a-sh … one of my specialties.\\" Miss Timms gives the secret as fresh pig chitlins, fried in olive oil with onion juice. (Chapter 2.) The Nero Wolfe Cookbook elaborates on the chitlin additive: \\"2 pounds pig chitlins; 2 cloves; 1 bay leaf; 1 hot red pepper, chopped; 1 onion, sliced; 1 stalk celery, sliced; ¼ cup red wine vinegar; ½ cup olive oil; ½ teaspoon onion juice.\\" Chapter 12, \\"Dishes Cooked by Others.\\" Wolfe is so impressed by Miss Timms' expertise that he later allows her to link arms with him, and writes to a professor at Harvard concerning chitlins and corned beef. Apart from the culinary, though, Wolfe obtains no useful information from Nichols and Timms, and sends Archie to Miss Huddleston's house and place of business to investigate further. There, Archie is bedeviled by a playful chimpanzee, two pet bears and an alligator. He also meets Miss Huddleston's brother Daniel, her nephew Larry, and Alan Brady, an MD who has been spending time with Janet Nichols. Archie doesn't get much further at the house than Wolfe did in his office, but he has cocktails on the terrace with the various players. As the butler is bringing more drinks, the chimpanzee startles him and a tray of glasses crashes to the ground. Most of the broken glass is cleaned up, but Miss Huddleston's foot is cut by a shard and, because of the presence of the animals, Dr. Brady treats the cut with iodine. Less than one week later, Miss Huddleston is dead, having undergone an excruciatingly painful and drawn out death from tetanus. That, as far as Wolfe is concerned, ends his involvement, but Daniel Huddleston makes a nuisance of himself with the police: he believes his sister was murdered. Daniel is insistent enough that Inspector Cramer comes to Wolfe looking for information. Wolfe has none for him, but after Cramer leaves he drops Archie an exiguous hint: he thinks there's one thing that Cramer should have done during his investigation, and wonders if it has rained during the past week. Elsa Maxwell (1883–1963, photograph by Carl Van Vechten) is considered the likely inspiration for Rex Stout's Bess Huddleston.\\"There's no doubt that the Bess Stout had in mind was Elsa Maxwell, party-giver, promoter and court jester to the 20th century rich,\\" wrote Rev. Frederick G. Gotwald. \\"For the opening of Lady Ribblesdale's house in St. James Park, London, Elsa Maxwell arranged for a murder that was realistic enough to fool a large group of guests and the prime 'suspect,' the austere Duke of Marlborough.\\" The Nero Wolfe Companion, volume 2, p. 95 ==Cast of characters== *Nero Wolfe — The private investigator *Archie Goodwin — Wolfe's assistant (and the narrator of all Wolfe stories) *Bess Huddleston — Party arranger for members of the Social Register *Mister, Logo, Lulu and Moses — Miss Huddleston's pet chimp, bears and alligator *Janet Nichols — Miss Huddleston's assistant *Maryella Timms — Miss Huddleston's secretary *Daniel Huddleston — A research chemist and Miss Huddleston's brother *Larry Huddleston — Another assistant party arranger employed by Miss Huddleston, and her nephew *Alan Brady — A local medical doctor who has become friendly with the Huddleston household *Inspector Cramer — Representing Manhattan Homicide ==The unfamiliar word== In most Nero Wolfe novels and novellas, there is at least one unfamiliar word, usually spoken by Wolfe. \\"Cordially Invited to Meet Death\\" contains this word, first spoken by Daniel Huddleston: * Catholicon.

For the Inca it was known as Pachakamaq (Pachacamac), rather than its original name of Ishma. The Ishmay Kingdom was located south of Lima, Peru in the Lurín River valley; it later spread north into the Rímac River valley. The Ishma culture was formed around 1100 AD following the breakup of the Wari Empire. Ishma autonomy lasted until around 1440 when they were absorbed into the Incan Empire. Despite occupying a desert, the inhabitants of Ishma had a high standard of living, thanks to their expertise in devising multiple irrigation channels as far as the river waters could reach, to give life to an extensive orchard and forest. == Etymology == Ishma is a word belonging to an extinct language related to the Aymaran family, used to denote the Ishma polity, their capital city, and main god. Following the conquest by the Inca, the word Pachakamaq (Pachacamac), the Quechua translation of Ishma, was used alternately, especially by non-Ishma peoples. The neighboring polities of the Chinchaysuyu used to pronounce it as Ishma, but it was pronounced as Ichma by the Cusco-Quechua speaking peoples like the Inca. The word Ichma went into Quechua as a synonym of cinnabar and the vermilion/crimson color because it was commonly employed in Ishma wall paints and clothes, the Inca considering vermilion to be prestigious quickly adopted the word into their vocabulary, Incas (the noblesse) called the vermilion color \\"ichma\\", while the plebeians used the word \\"llimpi\\". == Organization == The Ishma controlled coastal the valleys of Rimac and Lurin rivers in modern-day Lima, from the mouth—sea of the rivers to the middle valley or \\"Chaupi Yunga\\" (middle Yunga altitude, between 500 and 1200 meters of elevation). Ishma territory reached up to the sanctuary of Mama located in Rimac (present-day Ricardo Palma) and the sites of Chontay and Sisicaya in Lurin at 1,000 meters above sea level.(Rostworowski, 1976, 1989; Espinoza, 1963, 1964, 1983). The Ishma were divided into two moiety administrative divisions or saya, these were the anan (upper) saya Ichma and luren (lower) saya Ichma. On the coast, unlike the Andean highlands, the most important moiety often was that of luren (lurin) because it was linked to the sea. Each saya was in turn divided into unu or waranka subdivisions, which in turn were also divided into the anan and luren moieties, The Ishma dominions of Lati, Surco (Sulco), Guatca, Rimac (Lima), and Maranga (Malanca) were located in the Rimac valley, while the dominions of Pachacamac (Ishma), Manchay, Quilcay (Quilcayuna), and Caringa were located in the Lurin valley. The city of Pachacamac, formerly known as Ishma before Inca conquest, was the capital of the Ishma kingdom and seat of its rulers. Many Ishma ruins have been discovered along Lima's coast, however other than Pachacamac and a few other sites, there is no consensus on which the large majority sites could correspond to each domain, neither is known their physical distribution. It has been proposed that the archaeological site of Pampa de Flores could be the head of Manchay dominion and residence of the Manchay ayllu (a subdivision of the waranka). ==History== Huaca San Borja Archaeological site With the breakup of the Wari Empire, several small kingdoms and confederations were created. Over time, two cultures came to dominate the region, the Chancay culture to the north of Lima, and the Ishma culture to the south. Is believed the Ishma people were an Aymara-speaking people that came to inhabit the coastal areas near Lima following the collapse of the Wari empire. The Ishma people inhabited Pachacamac and continued the growth and influence of the city. The Ishma people constructed at least 16 pyramids in Pachacamac, and built or remodeled more structures in the Lima area. Among these are the Huaca Huantille in the Magdalena del Mar district, the Huaca Mateo Salado in Lima's district of Pueblo Libre, the Huaca San Borja in the San Borja District, and the Huaca San Miguel, in the ancient city of Maranga in the San Miguel District. Additionally, archeological sites in Puruchuco and Cajamarquilla have been ascribed to the Ichma people. == Archaeology == A number of cultural and human remains have been discovered in various Ichma sites. In the Huaca Huantille, at least 9 mummies have been discovered, buried with ceramic items and jewelry crafted from copper, silver, and gold. In 2012, excavation in the Pachacamac site yielded a burial chamber with more than 80 mummified remains, and a dozen infant remains. Along with the skeletons, this site also contained various artifacts, including ceramic wares, jewelry, and animal remains. == Collapse of the Ichma == When the Inca Empire expanded into this region, the cultures of the Ichma and the Chancay people, along with smaller cultures, were absorbed into the Inca Empire. ==See also== *History of Peru *Archaeological sites in Peru *Chancay culture ==References== Category:South American culture ","title":"Ichma culture"},{"id":"35937262","text":"Pole Cat Crossing is an unincorporated community in the town of Trade Lake in Burnett County and the towns of Laketown, Luck, and West Sweden in Polk County, Wisconsin, United States. ==Notes== Category:Unincorporated communities in Burnett County, Wisconsin Category:Unincorporated communities in Polk County, Wisconsin Category:Unincorporated communities in Wisconsin ","title":"Pole Cat Crossing, Wisconsin"},{"id":"35937265","text":"Caulophryne polynema is a species of fish in the family Caulophrynidae, the fanfins.

In four separate trials, Brett Kimberlin was convicted of multiple charges related to the bombings. ==The bombings== On September 1, 1978, there were three separate explosions from improvised explosive devices placed in trash bins around the town. The damage was minor, and no one was injured. Speedway authorities called on explosive experts from the Indiana State Police, Marion County Sheriff's Department, 64th Ordnance from nearby Fort Benjamin Harrison and specialists from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms. They formed a 100-strong taskforce to solve the case. The devices were simple homemade bombs constructed from soda cans packed with Tovex 200 and triggered with a rudimentary timing device. The following Saturday, two more blasts hit Speedway with another the day after at the local bowling alley. The next day, a device exploded under the car of an off duty Speedway police officer, who was on sick leave at the time and was not injured. The last bombing took place on September 6 when another explosive device concealed in a Speedway High School gym bag detonated in the parking lot of Speedway High School shortly after a freshman football game. Injuries sustained in the explosion forced the amputation of Vietnam War veteran Carl DeLong's right leg. DeLong had spotted the bag with the explosive device and had walked over to retrieve it. DeLong proceeded to kick the bag with his right leg and this caused the bag to explode. When it exploded, he severed his right leg and also severely injured his left leg and right hand as well as severing an artery in his wife Sandra's leg. ==Investigation== As no motive ever emerged for the series of bombings, law enforcement had no idea why they had stopped, but on September 20, 1978 federal agents arrested 27-year-old Brett Kimberlin for attempting to illegally obtain United States Government credentials. The owner of a Westside printing shop became suspicious when Kimberlin, dressed in a DOD security uniform, asked him to reproduce military driver's licenses with Kimberlin's picture and called the Army and police. Police arrested Kimberlin when he came back to the printer to pick up the documents. After obtaining a search warrant for Kimberlin's home and vehicle, investigators found wiring similar to those used on the explosive devices and \\"Mark Time\\" appliance timers in his 1970 Chevrolet Impala. A subsequent search of his home revealed more than of marijuana and two cases of Tovex 200, used in the IEDs, whose purchase had been traced by their lot number to Kimberlin in 1975. Pictures of Kimberlin were taken to the only local appliance store that sold the \\"Mark Times\\" and a store employee positively identified Kimberlin as the buyer of the timers. Additionally, an eyewitness came forward and identified Kimberlin as the man he saw place an explosive parcel in a trash can on September 1. The ATF positively matched both the timers and wire found in Kimberlin's car but did not press for an immediate indictment; instead, they continued to build on their case. ==Motives== While no motive was established at trial, prosecutors and police believe Kimberlin went on the bombing spree to deflect attention away from an ongoing investigation of the murder of 65-year-old Julia Scyphers. Scyphers \\"violently disapproved\\" of her daughter Sandra Barton's relationship with Kimberlin as well as the \\"strange affection\\" Kimberlin paid to Barton's pre-teen daughter who had accompanied Kimberlin on several long unsupervised out-of-state trips. Scyphers arranged for her daughter and granddaughter to stay with her and on July 29, 1978 she was shot to death just outside her home. Her husband Fred Scyphers, who briefly saw the shooter, identified William Bowman as the man who shot his wife. Bowman was a close associate of Kimberlin in the drug trade but Fred Scyphers died shortly after the murder and Bowman was never charged, as the prosecution's only witness died. Her murder still remains unsolved. ==Trials and conviction== In June 1981 Kimberlin was convicted of receipt of explosives by a convicted felon and sentenced to five years in federal prison and, in December 1981, of possession of an unregistered destructive device, unlawful manufacturing of a destructive device, malicious damage by means of explosives, and malicious damage by means of explosives involving personal injury. KIMBERLIN v. DEWALT 12 F.Supp.2d 487 (1998) United States District Court, D. Maryland. June 30, 1998. Kimberlin received a sentence of fifty years in Federal prison. His sentences, including sentences for other crimes, were aggregated to a total of fifty-one years, six months and 19 days. United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit. - 7 F.3d 527. Kimberlin v. United States Parole Commission. After his conviction, prosecutors released yellow legal pads they had confiscated from Kimberlin which they said detailed his plans to kill key eyewitnesses and prosecutors on the case as well as stage another series of bombings to provide him with an alibi. In 1983, the DeLong family filed a civil suit after Carl DeLong committed suicide after becoming depressed following the loss of his leg and subsequent chronic pain from the bombing. A jury ordered Kimberlin to pay the DeLong family $1.25 million for Carl Delong's suicide and another $360,000 to Sandra DeLong for her injuries. In 1993, an appeals court overturned the $1.25 million for Carl Delong's suicide, but upheld the damages awarded to Mrs. Delong. In 1994 the Indiana Supreme Court overturned the appeals court ruling, restoring the original $1.6 million judgment.No. 49S02-9406-CV-524. Supreme Court of Indiana. June 13, 1994. Rehearing Denied December 15, 1994. Kimberlin was paroled in November 1993 after serving 13 years..

Rupert, was an American Adventist pastor and writer associated with British Israelism and Dispensationalism. He published a number of books which attempted to interpret history from a biblical literalist and millenarian perspective. Rupert's theories were a seminal influence on the 20th-century evangelist Herbert W. Armstrong. His religious ideology was linked to a theory that the Last Days would see a power struggle between the \\"Orient\\" and the \\"Occident\\", a view that helped to fuel the Yellow Peril panic. ==Life== Born in Ohio, Rupert was initially a Methodist, but later joined the Seventh-day Adventists, becoming a minister for a number of years.J. Gordon Melton, Encyclopedia of American religions, Gale, 2003, p.658. He then formed the \\"Independent Church of God\\", which was loosely associated with the Adventist Church of God. Based in Britton, near Oklahoma City, from 1917 he published the journal Remnant of Israel, setting forth his views.Richard C. Nickels, The Remnant of Israel: An Analysis of G.G. Rupert and His Independent Church of God (Seventh Day) Movement,1915-1929, Giving & Sharing, 1972, pp.1-20. Rupert became the head of a number of churches, with generally small followings. These continued to function for a few years after his death led by his close associate John S. Stanford and Rupert's own son and daughter. ==Theories== Religious doctrines Rupert believed that the New Testament had not superseded the rules laid out in the Old Testament, and so the laws of Moses should apply to Christians as well as Jews, including kosher diets and other practices. Adapting the Adventist view of Seven church eras, Rupert argued that the \\"Philadelphia\\" phase was the period in which William Miller worked (from 1833 to 1844). The final era, \\"Laodicea\\" began in 1844 and would last until the End Times. He also denied the immortality of the soul, asserting that man is mortal, but can be given eternal life. Traditional Christian holidays were in fact \\"heathen\\": > Sunday ... Easter, Christmas, Good Friday, Ash Wednesday, and various days > ... are all of heathen origin and belong to Babylon, the mother of harlots. > The majority of teachers know this, but for various reasons they will still > try to keep the people in ignorance and support the old system of Babylon. Rupert's theories were later influential on Herbert W. Armstrong, who adopted many of his ideas about church eras and Jewish holy day observance, along with his British Israelist genealogies of western peoples.Bruce Renehan, Daughter of Babylon, Ch 13 Clarence Orvil Dodd introduced Armstrong to Rupert's ideas., archived by WebCite here Yellow Peril Cover of the third edition of Rupert's The Yellow Peril Rupert was influential in the development of the idea of the Yellow Peril, the theory that East Asians (the \\"yellow races\\") were a present and future threat to the west. These views were published in The Yellow Peril, or the Orient vs. the Occident as viewed by modern statesmen and ancient prophets (1911). Rupert included Russia among the \\"oriental\\" races, which, he believed, would eventually invade America. According to Rupert the reference to \\"the kings from the East\\" in the Book of Revelation 16:12, was a prediction of this event. He believed that Russia would take control of China and Africa; this combined force would then try to overwhelm the West. He claimed that China, India, Japan and Korea were already undermining England and the U.S., but that Jesus Christ would stop them. The final victory of the Occident over the Orient would confirm biblical prophesies — as interpreted by Rupert.David Seed, Science Fiction: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, p. 104. In later editions, Rupert adapted his theory to accommodate world events. In the third edition, published after the Russian Revolution, Rupert identified the rise of Bolshevism and the expansion of communism as the beginning of a process that would lead to the fulfilment of his predictions. ==Publications== *The Yellow Peril, or the Orient vs. the Occident as viewed by modern statesmen and ancient prophets.

Founded by Tom Katis and Matt Ranney, Voxer Walkie Talkie is both a live \\"push-to-talk\\" system and a voice messaging system. Messages on Voxer are delivered live as they’re being recorded and then delivered as a voice message as well. The app works on Android, Windows Phone and the iOS operating systems. In April 2012, the company raised $30 million in venture financing from Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), Intel Capital and other angel investors. == Development == Tom Katis co-founded Voxer (originally named RebelVox) in 2007 after a tour of duty in Afghanistan as a Special Forces communications sergeant. Needing better technology to talk to other soldiers on the battlefield, his idea began and the company was developed. In an interview with TechCrunch, Katis explained that during an ambush in Afghanistan, he attempted to coordinate reinforcements and rescue from a medical team in the middle of a firefight. He sought a way to talk to all parties at the same time, but the government- issued walkie talkies did not have the functionality. ==Voxer Walkie Talkie== In May 2011, the company launched Voxer Walkie Talkie on Apple's iOS operating system. The free app utilizes a number of patents and technology around its live streaming voice service to create a \\"push-to-talk\\" product that makes all communication live. The app has been described \\"as being similar to the Nextel walkie talkie phones, except it lets users listen to messages at their convenience and talk one-to-one with other users.\\" The app also allows users to send text messages and photos and has a location feature that allows users to see on a map where other users are located when they send a message. In November 2011, after launching a version of the app on the Android operating system, Voxer Walkie Talkie began to experience viral success. In an interview with TechCrunch, Gustaf Alstromer, the company's head of growth, explained that users in Cleveland adopted the technology first, followed by users in other cities in the Midwestern United States. The company attributes its viral success to word of mouth and \\"a variety of best practices going for tracking clickthroughs, conversions, and overall usage, using third parties like Mixpanel as well as its in-house systems.\\" As of April 2012, monthly, unique users numbered in the double-digit millions. In a video interview with the Wall Street Journal and All Things Digital, Katis also claimed Voxer's widespread adoption was in part due to the company's cross platform roll out on iOS and Android. This cross platform functionality allows users on different operating systems to communicate using the app which created a viral loop. Today, the company has users across the world with an especially high user base in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Germany, England, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Asia. Voxer Walkie Talkie was among the top 25 social networking apps in more than 60 markets, according to the app tracking website App Annie. The service works over WiFi, 3G, 4G, and EDGE. As of April 2012, the company has 35 employees and is headquartered in downtown San Francisco. The company's employees comes from a variety of backgrounds and companies including Danger, Android, Twitter, and Apple. Katis said that the next steps for Voxer are to continue to improve the app, roll out functionality on other platforms and to create an enterprise-level product with additional features and administrative rights that can be used for governments, hospitals, corporations and other large organizations. ==Technology== Voxer was built using Node.js, Riak and Redis. According to TechCrunch, the company is possibly the largest user of Node.js in the world. Matt Ranney, co-founder and chief technology officer of Voxer, said in an interview with The Register that his team first coded Voxer in C++ and then Python but each proved too rigid or slow for a VoIP app. Later the team switched to Node.js because Voxer Walkie Talkie requires low latency with a large number of open connections.\\"If you want to make something where the user gets a real-time update stream of some kind, you need to keep open a bunch of connections to the server. That's very expensive in, say, a PHP architecture. But in Node, it's nearly free. You can keep the connections open for a very long time, and the incremental cost per connection is very low.\\" ==Venture Financing== Voxer raised its first external capital round in April 2012. Led by Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), Intel Capital, and angel investors including SV Angel, CrunchFund, Chris Dixon, Roger McNamee and other friends of Katis', Voxer raised over $30 million in financing. Katis said Voxer will use the new funding to continue to build out its engineering team. ==Popular culture== Hip-hop artist Soulja Boy and basketball player Kevin Durant have recently talked about using the Voxer Walkie Talkie app. Additionally, singer Harry Styles has tweeted about the app. In a 2012 New York Times article, columnist and TV host David Pogue noted that Voxer is \\"an ingenious crossbreed of text messages and phone calls\\". ==References *Voxer website Category:Software companies based in California Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:2007 establishments in California Category:Walkie-talkies Category:Software companies of the United States ","title":"Voxer"},{"id":"35937401","text":"Lynne Beecroft (born 9 May 1957 in Comox, British Columbia) is a Canadian former field hockey player who competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Comox Valley Regional District Category:Canadian female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Canada Category:Field hockey players at the 1984 Summer Olympics ","title":"Lynne Beecroft"},{"id":"35937405","text":"TeVecine (styled as T.V.

They were U.S. Air Force pilots sent to Vietnam in 1962 and 1963, to assist the South Vietnamese air force (VNAF) in military airlift and transport missions. They primarily flew as co-pilots alongside VNAF pilots on these missions. Other G.I.s had survived in Vietnam and had participated in combat operations. Officially, however the Dirty Thirty (an unofficial adopted nickname) pilots were classed as \\"advisors\\", not combatants. The original group of pilots deployed in 1962 rotated home during early 1963, and were replaced by a second contingent. During the 20-month period they were on loan to the VNAF, the total of sixty Dirty Thirty pilots flew approximately 25,000 hours, earning 97 Air Medals and two Distinguished Flying Crosses. Richard W. Hudson wrote a book about the pilots, entitled \\"The Dirty Thirty\\". ==History== In April 1962, 30 U.S. Air Force pilots were sent to fly as advisors in the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) 43rd Air Transport Group at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. Their arrival permitted the VNAF to release some of its own experienced pilots to form new units for its rapidly expanding air arm. This small group of Americans usually served as co-pilots in VNAF C-47 transports. Missions included flare drops, airborne assaults, airborne resupply, leaflet drops, loudspeaker broadcasts, and cargo and troop movements. Additional USAF personnel arrived at Tan Son Nhut in early 1962 after the VNAF transferred two dozen seasoned pilots from the 1st Transportation Group at Tan Son Nhut to provide aircrews for the newly activated 2nd Fighter Squadron then undergoing training at Bien Hoa Air Base. This sudden loss of qualified C-47 pilots brought the 1st Transportation Group's airlift capability dangerously low. In order to alleviate the problem, United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, on the recommendation of the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) Vietnam, ordered thirty USAF pilots temporarily assigned to the VNAF to serve as C-47 co-pilots. This influx of U.S. personnel quickly returned the 1st TG to full strength. The Americans arrived at Tan Son Nhut during March and April 1962 and immediately began flying with Vietnamese crews. Unfortunately, problems arose between the Americans and Vietnamese and by August the situation had so deteriorated that the 1st Transportation Group commander. Nguyễn Cao Kỳ urgently appealed for closer cooperation and understanding between the two groups. The situation seemed to gradually improve and although there were still problems, the two groups developed a closer working relationship. Unlike the USAF Farm Gate personnel at Bien Hoa Air Base, the C-47 co-pilots actually became part of the VNAF operational structure — though still under U.S. control. Because of their rather unusual situation, these pilots soon adopted the very unofficial nickname, The Dirty Thirty. In a sense they were the first U.S. airmen actually committed to combat in Vietnam, rather than being assigned as advisors or support personnel. The original Dirty Thirty pilots eventually rotated home during early 1963 and were replaced by a second contingent of American pilots. This detachment remained with the VNAF until December 1963 when they were withdrawn from Vietnam. ==References== Category:Military units and formations of the United States Air Force in the Vietnam War ","title":"Dirty thirty (Vietnam)"},{"id":"35937504","text":"Judith K.

Veteran 47-year-old goalkeeper Sue Buckett had a record eight winners' medals from her 10 Cup final appearances, as well as 30 outings for England (1972-81, 1984). Friends of Fulham, Women's FA Cup winners in 1985 and runners-up in 1989 and 1990, came under the auspices of Wimbledon F.C. and played their Premier Division home fixtures at Plough Lane, recently vacated by the male team. The squad included England internationals Theresa Wiseman, Marieanne Spacey, Brenda Sempare, Terry Springett (daughter of Ron) and Debbie Bampton. Newton Ladies, a Merseyside club formed by former England midfielder Liz Deighan in May 1989, linked up with Knowsley United F.C. to join the league as Knowsley United WFC. Deighan, also the WFA's England Under-21 team boss, led Knowsley to a fourth-place finish. Millwall Lionesses had beaten Doncaster Belles in the previous season's FA Cup final but suffered a subsequent exodus of players. Lou Waller remained and Pauline Cope rejoined from Arsenal, to buttress a youthful squad. ==National Division== { style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" abbr=\\"Position\\"Pos !width=150 Team ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" abbr=\\"Played\\"Pld ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" abbr=\\"Won\\"W ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" abbr=\\"Drawn\\"D ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" abbr=\\"Lost\\"L ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" abbr=\\"Goals for\\"GF ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" abbr=\\"Goals against\\"GA ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" abbr=\\"Goal difference\\"GD ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" abbr=\\"Points\\"Pts !width=200  Notes - style=\\"background:gold;\\" 1.align=\\"left\\"Doncaster Belles141400894+8528Champions - 2.align=\\"left\\"Red Star Southampton1410133218+1421 - 3.align=\\"left\\"Wimbledon149233427+720 - 4.align=\\"left\\"Knowsley United146533130+117 - 5.align=\\"left\\"Maidstone Tigresses143471335-2210 - 6.align=\\"left\\"Ipswich Town142481542-278 - 7.align=\\"left\\"Millwall Lionesses1422101130-196 - 8.align=\\"left\\"Notts Rangers1412111756-394 } No relegation as league expanded to 10 teams for 1992-93\\\\. ==References== Premier League Category:FA Women's National League seasons Wom 1 ","title":"1991–92 WFA National League Premier Division"},{"id":"35937620","text":"Attunement was the early term adopted by practitioners of energy medicine, originally developed by Lloyd Arthur Meeker (1907 – 1954) and his colleagues. Meeker taught and practiced Attunement as a central feature of his spiritual teaching and ministry, Emissaries of Divine Light. Attunement is taught as a personal spiritual practice and as a healing modality offered through the hands. Emissaries of Divine Light believe that Attunement is a pivotal factor in the conscious evolution of humanity. Like Qigong, Reiki and Therapeutic touch reiki attunement is a putative practice as defined by the United States National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), lacking published scientific study of its effectiveness. Attunement practitioners and clients rely on personal and anecdotal experience to promote it. ==History== Beginnings Lloyd Arthur Meeker shared the first Attunement with Rudolph Plagge in Wichita, Kansas, in 1929, and developed the teaching and practice of Attunement with colleagues until his death in 1954. From September 14 to 16, 1932, Meeker had a spiritual awakening experience that he described as a “heavenly ordination.” He marked that experience as the initiation of Emissaries of Divine Light. That same year he instituted a series of energy medicine experiments. Meeker reported that he could stand across the room from the client and the client could feel the intensification of life force. He also reported excellent results when his hands were one to six inches from the client. Lloyd Arthur Meeker wrote and lectured using the name Uranda, which was how he was known to his followers. From 1935 to 1945, Meeker traveled across the United States and Canada, establishing centers for healing and spiritual teaching for varying periods of time in Atascadero, Oakland, Burbank and Long Beach, California; Buffalo, New York; Grand Forks, Iowa; and Loveland, Colorado. In December 1945 Meeker established his headquarters at Sunrise Ranch in Loveland, where Attunement continues to be taught and practiced. The Role of G-P-C Chiropractors The G-P-C movement played a significant role in the development of Attunement. G-P-C stood for God – Patient – Chiropractor. It was a no-fee system of service that George Shears created in the late 1930s after he, himself, had a severely debilitating ruptured disk, and vowed to offer his services on a donation basis. Shears had been a Major League Baseball pitcher in 1912, and then a graduate of the Palmer School of Chiropractic in 1917. He experimented with \\"no-force\\" chiropractic adjustments in which he believed it was the healing energy through his hands that brought positive results, shown through x-rays. The G-P-C movement saw the relationship between the chiropractor and the patient as the base of a triangle with God at the apex. Meeker eventually embraced this model for the healing relationship. In 1949, Albert Ackerley, a G-P-C chiropractor in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, was introduced to Lloyd Arthur Meeker’s writings. In June 1949, when Ackerley was preparing to offer an adjustment to his patient, he saw that the patient’s spine had aligned before he had given the adjustment. He believed that this result was a consequence of the flow of subtle energy between himself and the patient, rather than any physical intervention. Ackerley met Meeker in July 1949 and began to practice Attunement under his tutelage. Up to this point, Meeker had referred to Attunements as “treatments.” It was Albert Ackerley who named those treatments “Attunements.” With Lloyd Meeker’s urging, Ackerley began to experiment with long-distance Attunements in which the person receiving the Attunement was not in the physical presence of the practitioner. Albert Ackerley and G.P.C. President, Virgil Givens, were both prosecuted legally due to their practice of energy medicine, but continued to practice nonetheless. In May 1950, Lloyd Arthur Meeker met George Shears. Meeker’s meeting with Shears was followed by G-P-C meetings at a Chiropractic Convention in August 1950 in Davenport, Iowa, and then a G-P-C conference in Huntingburg, Indiana, which was attended by Meeker. Following these events, about twenty-five chiropractors attended a G-P-C Convention from September 2 through 8 of that year at Sunrise Ranch. The prospect of joining with Meeker and Emissaries of Divine Light raised suspicion and concerns among the G-P-C chiropractors. Nonetheless, at the G-P-C Convention in the home of George Shears in Huntingburg, Indiana, on February 24 and 25, 1951, the G-P-C board of directors voted to cooperate with the Emissaries to establish a G-P-C Servers Training School at Sunrise Ranch. Lloyd Arthur Meeker led three six-month G-P-C Servers Training School sessions at Sunrise Ranch from 1952 to 1954. His classes from the 1952 session were transcribed and published as The Divine Design of Man, # 1 and # 2. The audio recordings and the transcripts of Meeker’s classes from the 1953 and 1954 sessions are still extant. The sessions included Attunement technique, nutrition, psychology and a broad spectrum of spiritual teachings. In August 1954, Lloyd Arthur Meeker, his wife, Kathy Meeker, Albert Ackerley and two children died in the crash of Meeker’s small plane in San Francisco Bay. A close associate of Meeker’s, Martin Cecil, assumed the responsibility for the leadership of Emissaries of Divine Light and for carrying forward Meeker’s Attunement work. With assistance from G-P-C chiropractors, James Wellemeyer and Bill Bahan, and from Roger de Winton, Alan Hammond and others, Martin Cecil continued the Servers Training School at Sunrise Ranch and the teaching of Attunement. George Shears eventually moved to Sunrise Ranch in 1968 where he practiced Attunement until he died in 1978. Development As Emissaries of Divine Light grew in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, so did the teaching and practice of Attunement. Martin Cecil emphasized in his teaching of Attunement that the basis of it was a spiritual practice. While many of the early Attunement practitioners were chiropractors, lay people became increasingly active in the practice. Building on the early work of Lloyd Arthur Meeker, Attunement evolved to include groups of people practicing it together. In 1993, a World Blessing time was established for practitioners to share a time of collective Attunement and healing prayer. In the '80s and '90s, the teaching and practice of long-distance Attunement was developed further. Following Martin Cecil's death in 1988, his son, Michael Cecil, become the Spiritual Leader of the Emissaries. In 1996, Emissaries of Divine Light formed an Attunement Guild, which established standards for the teaching and certification of Attunement practitioners. A group of Attunement practitioners, including Chris Jorgensen and Andrew Shier, formed the International Association of Attunement Practitioners (IAAP) in 1999. IAAP developed and taught the practice of Attunement separate from the organization of Emissaries of Divine Light. Roger de Winton continued his Attunement trainings through Attunement Intensives offered at Sunrise Ranch. He also continued his work of long-distance Attunement until his death in 2001. In 1996, Michael Cecil left Emissaries of Divine Light to continue his own work, which includes Attunement through The Ashland Institute. A group of trustees assumed the leadership of Emissaries of Divine Light with Michael Cecil's departure. In August 2004, the trustees of Emissaries of Divine Light named David Karchere as the leader of the global network. Since becoming the leader of the Emissaries, Karchere has developed programs, including Life Destiny Immersion and Journey into the Fire, that are designed to assist people to transform the spiritual and emotional factors that block the experience of Attunement. In 2010, with other Attunement practitioners, David Karchere founded the Attunement School at Sunrise Ranch. ==Philosophy== Attunement is based on Lloyd Arthur Meeker's vision that the human body is designed to be the temple of God. The foundational principle underlying Attunement is what Meeker named as The One Law, or the Law of Cause and Effect. Emissaries of Divine Light teach that the causative factor in spiritual regeneration is the universal power and intelligence within all people, and that through response and opening to that power and intelligence, people experience healing. Attunement practitioners believe that positive shifts in consciousness release a healing energy through a person’s body, mind and emotions. Traditionally, the Attunement practitioner is referred to as a server and the recipient is referred to as a servee. Attunement servers believe they transmit universal life energy through their hands to the servee. The primary connecting points on the servee are the endocrine glands. Attunement servers teach that the endocrine glands are portals for universal life energy that operates through the physical body, and through the mental and emotional function of the individual, and that the servee has the opportunity to open more fully to the life energy within them through receiving an Attunement. Emissaries of Divine Light hold that the origin of universal life energy is divine in nature and that the core reality of all people is divine. The goal of Attunement is to increase the energetic flow while removing blockages to that flow so that a person’s core reality can emerge. Lloyd Meeker taught that the human connection to universal life energy relies on pneumaplasm, which was his name for the aura of subtle energy, or etheric body surrounding the physical body. Attunement practitioners believe that pneumaplasm is generated when the universal life energy flows through a person, and that the clarity of the pneumaplasmic body depends on the clarity of that energy flow. Attunement practitioners focus on clarifying and enriching the pneumaplasm associated with the endocrine glands and the anatomical systems of the body. Practitioners believe that the endocrine glands translate seven aspects of the universal life energy into the human experience. They name these as the Seven Spirits. {  style=\\"text-align:center; width:50%;\\" - ! Gland !! Spirit -  Pineal  Love -  Pituitary  The Womb -  Thyroid  Life -  Thymus  Purification -.  Islets of Langerhans  Blessing -  Adrenal gland  Single Eye -  Gonads  New Earth } Attunement practitioners relate these Seven Spirits to the Seven Spirits of God referenced in the book of Revelation in the Bible. Some Attunement practitioners correlate the seven endocrine glands with seven chakras. ==Technique== At the core of the teaching of the technique is the establishment of an energetic circuit between the practitioner (server) and the client (servee). Practitioners seek to establish that circuit by the radiant extension of life energy through the dominant hand of the practitioner to the gland or organ of the client, and the receiving of life energy through the opposite hand from a corresponding contact point in the body. Meeker taught that the first step in the Attunement process was the alignment of the cervical vertebrae by the radiation of healing energy through the hands on either side of the neck. Contemporary Attunement practitioners continue to teach attunement technique that begins and ends with an Attunement of the cervical vertebrae. Often, the cervical Attunement is followed by Attunement of the endocrine glands and some of the major organs of the body. ==Spiritual practice== As a spiritual practice, Attunement is intended to connect a person more closely to their spiritual source and to open the flow of life current. The practice includes conscious attention to the quality of spirit expressing through the practitioner in the daily living of life, and specific periods of meditation in the beginning and ending of each day, taught as Sanctification in the Evening and the Morning. A central aspect of Attunement as a spiritual practice is referred to by Emissaries of Divine Light as spiritual centering, which they define as a daily practice of opening thoughts and emotions to the spiritual. == References == Category:Energy therapies Category:Pseudoscience ","title":"Attunement"},{"id":"35937629","text":"Ilala is an ancient town in Irepodun LGA, Kwara State.

Their main goal at the time was the integration of the Kurdish community in the Belgian society.A Short History of the Kurdish Institute of Brussels In 1989, the name of the organisation was changed to 'Kurdish Institute of Brussels', which has remained as such ever since. Since the establishment of the Kurdish Institute of Brussels, the organization has expanded its goals, beginning with a project in 1990 subsidized by the Flemish Ministry of Culture, called 'Host Country, My Home Country', in which socio-cultural trainings were provided. In 1998, the organization secured subsidies of the Flemish Ministry of Culture with as goal promoting further integration of the Kurdish community (as well as other minority groups) in Belgium, and the spreading of knowledge of Kurdish culture, history and language. From 2004 on, the Institute's mission was expanded to include both its original goals and new goals, namely, securing the rights of linguistic, ethnic and religious minorities in Turkey, the Middle East and the Caucasus. In light of these new goals, the Institute founded a Kurdish Cultural Center in Tbilisi, Georgia. In March 2006, the Turkish Grey Wolves attacked the Kurdish Institute In Brussels just days after the parents of the Institutes chairman were murdered in Turkey. ==Activities== *Publication of The Kurds, a bi-monthly periodical in Dutch. *Provision of social services for immigrants. *Maintenance of the Institute's library, which contains publications, articles and books about the Kurds and the rest of the Middle East. *Summer projects for children. *Translation services. *Language courses: French and Kurdish. *Cultural programme: exhibitions, Kurdish films and plays, concerts, etc. *Research, information and sensitization activities. ==Organization== The head of the Institute is Derwich Ferho, one of the original founders of the organization. Next to the Flemish Ministry of Culture, the Institute is also recognized by the Walloon Ministry of culture; the service of Peoples Development in Flanders; Permanent Education in Wallonia; and the region of Brussels.Presentation of the Kurdish Institute of Brussels The Institute also frequently collaborates with universities and high schools, peace and human rights organizations, and other cultural organizations. On 22 June 2012, the Institute, along with Senator Karel Vanlouwe, organized a conference at the Belgian Senate concerning the Kirkuk and the progression of Article 140, which was attended by a multitude of Kurdish leaders.http://www.aknews.com/en/aknews/8/313898/ ==Publications== In Dutch: * Volksnationalisme, ook het Koerdische, is geen product van verbeelding maar representeert werkelijkheid, Hugo Van Rompaey, 2007. * De Koerden.

He joined the Smithsonian in 1852 and remained there for fifty-four years until he retired in 1906. He was also a local civic leader, organizing and leading many educational and community organizations. He served in the Washington D.C. House of Delegates from 1871-1874. ==Early life== Solomon Galleon Brown was born on February 14, 1829 in Washington D.C. the fourth of six children to his parents Isaac and Rachel Brown. His parents were former slaves, but he was born a free man. His father died in 1832 and his family was left homeless with heavy debt. Brown was unable to be formally educated because he had to work in order to support his family. When he was fifteen he worked at the Washington D.C. Post Office as a postmaster assistant, receiving his appointment from then assistant postmaster Lambert Tree. Part of his duties in 1844 and 1845 were to assist Joseph Henry, Samuel F.B.

When the Morse Telegraph Company was formed, Brown left the post office and for the next seven years he continued to work for Samuel F.B. Morse as battery tender. He then took a position as assistant packer at Gillman & Brothers manufacturing company in their chemical laboratory. His work at this time included working for the general land office and in bookbinding. Beyond introducing Brown to Morse, Henry, Vail, and others, Tree was an important friend and mentor to Brown. Brown's status in Washington D.C. as a free black man in a slave society was not without stress, and on July 21, 1858, Brown obtained a certificate of freedom, in which he and Tree swore in front of a justice of the peace that Brown had always been free. ==Career with the Smithsonian Institution== In 1852 he was appointed to the foreign exchange division of the new Smithsonian Institution by his former boss at the Morse Telegraph Company, Joseph Henry, where he was hired as a general laborer. In 1864, he became a museum assistant and by 1869 he was the registrar in charge of transportation, registry, and the storage of animal specimens and materials received by the institution. Out of all the three secretaries that he worked with, he worked closely with Spencer Baird. Spencer Baird was a successful ornithologist and Brown spent a lot of time assisting him. When Baird was out of town, he trusted Brown to be the \\"eyes and ears\\" of the Smithsonian. Brown would do clerical duties for Baird, for example, he entertained visitors, opened and forward mail, made the Baird family's travel arrangements, and gave out wages to the workers of the Baird household. During his career at the Smithsonian, he worked for the National Museum, the International Exchange Service, the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the National Zoological Park. He had many duties within the Smithsonian, which include: working as a general laborer who built exhibit cases, moved and cleaned furniture, assisted in preparing maps, and drew for Smithsonian lectures. He worked under the first three Smithsonian secretaries, Joseph Henry, Spencer Fullerton Baird, and Samuel Pierpont Langley. ==Outside the Smithsonian== Brown was an activist who volunteered in civic and educational programs to help the African American community. He was the founder of the Pioneer Sabbath School in Washington D.C. and was also the superintendent of the North Washington Mission Sunday School. He helped organize the Pioneer Sunday School association in the Hillsdale neighborhood and was superintendent of the association from 1868 to 1888. Brown, along with Fred Smoot and Mark McKenzie were early settlers and civic leaders of the Hillsdale neighborhood, which was created on the land of the former Barry Farm under the supervision of the Freedmen's Bureau.Cantwell, Thomas J. \\"Anacostia: Strength in Adversity.\\" Records of the Columbia Historical Society, Washington, DC 49 (1973): 330-370. He was a trustee of Wilberforce University, of the 15th Street Presbyterian church, and of the D.C. public schools. He was the superintendent of the North Washington Mission Sunday School and an active member of the Freedmen's Relief association. He was also commissioner of the poor in the County of Washington. He was elected as president of the National Union League in 1866, which was a political organization in the south of the United States for African Americans. He served three terms as a Republican member of the House of Delegates for Washington D.C. from 1871-1874. He represented all the people who lived in Anacostia. He was the first member to be certified by the governor of Washington D.C., Henry D. Cooke. He was a member of numerous lyceum's, including the Galbraith in D.C, and the St. Paul Lyceum in Baltimore, and gave frequent lectures on scientific questions in Baltimore, Alexandria, and Washington, D.C. His first lectures were in January 1855 and presided by Enoch Ambush, who later promoted Brown as a speaker, and Brown gave lectures over subjects from insects to geology to the telegraph. Brown created the diagrams used in the lectures, and in connection with these, he prepared or assisted in preparing nearly all the important diagrams for scientific lectures given at the Smithsonian during his tenure there. He was an officer in the District Grand Lodge of Masons, and was an assistant honorary commissioner of the colored department of the 1884 New Orleans Exposition World's Fair for D.C. He was director of the Industrial Saving and Building Association of Washington, D.C. and the Washington correspondent of the Anglo-African Christian Recorder when it was edited by Bishop Henry McNeal Turner. He also edited the column, \\"Sunday school Circle\\" of the Christian Index, a publication from Jackson, Tennessee. Brown was also part of the National Black Leadership Committee that arranged for the unveiling of Thomas Ball's sculptor Emancipation Memorial Monument in Washington's Lincoln Park. There was a large group of people who attended the unveiling, such as, President Ulysses S. Grant, and Frederick Douglass. Brown spent some time writing poetry, in which some appeared in the local African American newspapers, such as, \\"The Washington Bee\\". ==Personal life== In his personal life, he was married to Lucinda on June 16, 1864. They did not have children themselves, but they did have a large family of nieces (some they adopted) and boarders, which included William J. Simmons. Together they would have picnics for their local community. ==Death and legacy== He retired on February 14, 1906 and died June 26, 1906 at his home. His funeral was officiated by Francis James Grimke, the pastor at the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church, where he was a member. His burial was at Harmony Cemetery. In 2004 a few trees were planted around the National Museum of Natural History in his honor. When the National Museum of African American History and Culture opened in 2016, it named its fifth-floor Council and conference lounge space the Solomon G. Brown Room. ==References== *This article utilizes public domain content from the Smithsonian Institution Archives.

Kennedy wrote, \\"Of younger writers in America today, surely John Updike is our leading pyrotechnist. Few can make words so obligingly sizzle and flash, so clearly light up the landscape of suburbia. While dazzling his readers in the last five years with five novels and books of stories, Updike simultaneously has been turning out satiric verse and light poetry galore: 66 pieces in this new collection, most of them first contributed to The New Yorker. He is, it seems, like some designer of Explorer rockets who hasn't enough to do, in his spare time touching off displays of Roman candles...It also shows Updike to be on occasion a poet of rare depth and competence. We ought to have expected this — if not from his earlier book of light verse, The Carpentered Hen, then from the grim lyricism of the novel, Rabbit, Run; or from the excellent prose poem 'Archangel' in the story collection, Pigeon Feathers. Admirers of his fiction will see his verse as clearly the work of his hand. The same compassionate scrutiny informs such a poem as \\"The Short Days,\\" with its evocation of a suburban morning: > Then red rims gild the gutter-spouts; The streetlamp pales; the milk-truck > fades; And housewives — husbands gone — wash doubts Down sinks and raise the > glowing shades. In Updike's verse, too, is his wry awareness of the small absurdities we live with daily.\\"X.J.

Each chapter explores a different stage in British prehistory, beginning with the Old Stone Age, when the island was inhabited by hunter-gatherers who likely undertook rituals for use in \\"hunting magic\\". ==Background== Prior to the publication of Rites of the Gods, Burl had already published several books on the subject of prehistoric religion, such as The Stone Circles of the British Isles (1976), Prehistoric Avebury (1979) and Rings of Stone: The Prehistoric Stone Circles of Britain and Ireland (1980). ==Synopsis== Chapter one, \\"Avenues to Antiquity, Blind Alleys and Dead Ends\\", provides an introduction to the study of prehistoric religion, and the associated problems that come with it. Noting that archaeological evidence has to be supplemented with ethnographic comparisons, proto-historical literature and the study of later folklore, Burl highlights a number of prominent archaeological sites found in Britain that can be used to shed light on ancient religious beliefs, such as Skara Brae, Esh's Barrow and Windmill Hill.Burl 1981. pp. 1-17. In the second chapter, entitled \\"The Birth of the Gods\\", Burl turns his attention to Palaeolithic (Old Stone Age) and Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age) Britain, the periods when the populace – both Neanderthals and Homo sapiens – lived as nomadic hunter-gatherers. Using evidence from across continental Europe to supplement the few finds from Britain, Burl notes that it was the period when humans began ritualistically burying their dead, citing examples like that of the Red Lady of Paviland, providing potential evidence for a belief in an afterlife. He furthermore argues that in this period, the people of Britain saw their landscape in an animistic sense, being inhabited by a multitude of spirits, and that there were various animal cults, in particular dedicated to fierce creatures such as the bear. Turning to look at examples of cave art from across Europe, he draws comparisons with the artworks of contemporary Indigenous Australians, believing that in Stone Age Europe they were used for \\"hunting magic\\".Burl 1981. pp. 18-36. Chapter three, \\"Good Lands and Bone- Houses\\", looks at ritual and religion in Early Neolithic (New Stone Age) Britain, discussing the arrival of agriculture and the radical social changes that farming led to. Arguing that religion still centred largely around ensuring fertility by propitiating spirits, Burl identifies \\"sexual carvings\\", such as the chalk phallus found at Maumbury Rings or the goddess figurine from Grimes Graves as evidence of this. He also argues that this period saw the development of an ancestor cult in Britain, resulting in the deposition of the dead in barrows, including the large long barrows such as Fussell's Lodge. Finally, he discusses the defleshing of corpses and the smashing of human bone, possibly in rites designed to allow a human's spirit to depart the dead body, and potential totemism in Early Neolithic Britain, exemplified in the burial of ox heads at certain ritual sites.Burl 1981. pp. 37-60. These themes are continued in the fourth chapter, \\"Dead Bones for Living People\\", which looks at the development of megalithic tombs in Britain, illustrating the existence of a \\"cult of the ancestors\\". Discussing examples ranging from Wayland's Smithy to Newgrange and Belas Knap, Burl highlights how there were regional architectural styles across Britain and Ireland, although all served similar purposes in housing the bones of the dead. He then argues that as the population rose, these stone tombs became too small to house the growing number who were dying, leading to the introduction of wider open henges and causewayed enclosures for the burial of the deceased.Burl 1981. pp. 61-97. The fifth chapter, \\"Rings around the Moon\\", explores the monumental architecture of the Late Neolithic period in Britain, discussing the development of large earthworks known as henges, as well as the construction of the early wooden and stone circles, many of which contained celestial alignments. Proceeding to focus on the Late Neolithic society of Orkney, he discusses the village of Skara Brae and the various ceremonial monuments in the region, such as Maes Howe and Stenness, arguing for the existence of an ancestor cult and totemistic beliefs.Burl 1981. pp. 97-126. ==Reception and recognition== Academic reviews Rites of the Gods was reviewed by the archaeologist Richard Bradley in the Archaeological Review from Cambridge.Bradley 1983. ==References== Footnotes Bibliography * * * Category:1981 non- fiction books Category:Academic studies of ritual and magic Category:Archaeology books ","title":"Rites of the Gods"},{"id":"35937800","text":"Mahyar Rural District () is a rural district (dehestan) in the Central District of Qaen County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

Descendants of Edmund Rice: The First Nine Generations, Edmund Rice (1638) Association. (CD-ROM) ==Personal background== Jonas H. Howe was born in Petersham, Massachusetts on 28 April 1821 to Jonas Howe (1786-1865) and Arethusa (Negus) Howe (1789-1851). He was married on 10 June 1846, to Margaret Adele Swindell at Barre, Massachusetts, and they moved to Minnesota in 1854. Howe was trained as an artist in Massachusetts along with his cousin George Fuller and he was a proficient portrait and landscape artist.Geske, Norman A. 1950. A pioneer Minnesota artist. Minnesota History Magazine 31(2):99-104. web access In Minnesota, Howe was a staunch abolitionist, and he served in a number of local offices including serving as an officer of the Plymouth Home Guard militia, a Justice of the Peace, and as a School Board member. Later, he was a first sergeant from 1864-65 in Company F of the 11th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment of the Union Army during the American Civil War. In 1866 he was elected to a one-year term in the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1866 as a Republican from the 5th Representative District in Hennepin County. He was a close political ally of Ignatius L. Donnelly and was active in the formation and politics of the Populist Party. Howe worked closely with Oliver Hudson Kelley in the founding of The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, commonly known as the Grange, and he was a frequent contributing writer to Farm, Stock and Home, an agricultural newspaper popular in the 1870s. Howe died at his home in Plymouth, Minnesota on 1 October 1898 and was buried at Parker's Lake Cemetery in Plymouth. ==Genealogy and family relations== The artistic talent of Jonas H. Howe was traced back as far as his maternal grandparents, Joel and Basmath (Gould) Negus. Of their children, Nathan Negus, was an artist who received some instruction from John Greenwood and John Ritto Penniman. Nathan Negus worked in Boston for a short time, and later in Savannah and Mobile, but he died at Petersham at the age of twenty- four.Carpenter, Laura Howe Reminiscences of Pioneer Life. undated pamphlet 64pp. The Hennepin County Historical Society, Minneapolis. Some of Negus's portraits are noted in Somebody's Ancestors, a catalogue of an exhibition of paintings by primitive artists of the Connecticut Valley, held in the Springfield Museum of Fine Arts from February 7 to March 8, 1942. Joel Negus's daughter Caroline was also a professional artist, although she was perhaps better known as the wife of Richard Hildreth, the historian. Fanny Negus, another daughter of Joel Negus, married Aaron Fuller at Deerfield, Massachusetts, and their son was George Fuller, who was a notable exponent of personal mysticism in painting. It was yet another daughter of Joel Negus, Arethusa, who married Jonas Howe, and Jonas Holland Howe was her second son. Jonas Holland Howe was a direct descendant of John Howe (1602-1680) who arrived in Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630 from Brinklow, Warwickshire, England and settled in Sudbury, Massachusetts.

Christy Moore added a fourth verse to O'Halloran's original three; this is the version that is most commonly performed. The song is a monologue, documenting the narrator's enlistment and travels with one of Tipperary's flying columns, from Cork, through Tipperary and Wicklow, to Dublin. The Galtee Mountains are in Tipperary the lyrics include farewells to both this county and the town of Clonmel. It references historical figures from the Irish War of Independence and subsequent Irish Civil War, including Seán Moylan, Dan Breen, Dinny Lacey, and Seán Hogan. It portrays the Free State forces as enemies, suggesting that the narrator was fighting in opposition to the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. The narrator is not believed to be any specific historical figure rather to be representative of those who fought in the flying columns in the War of Independence and on the Republican side in the Civil War. However, a number of people claim that the Galtee Mountain Boy is a specific individual, some believe this to be Patrick Davern from Tipperary.https://siulach.wordpress.com/2008/07/05/the-mystery-of-the-galtee- mountain-boy/ ==Recordings== It has been recorded by Christy Moore, Paddy Reilly, the Wolfe Tones, and Patrick Clifford.

(in particular, it is a Hausdorff space). These kinds of fields were originally introduced in p-adic analysis since the fields \\\\mathbb{Q}_p are locally compact topological spaces constructed from the norm \\\\cdot_p on \\\\mathbb{Q}. The topology (and metric space structure) is essential because it allows one to construct analogues of algebraic number fields in the p-adic context. == Structure ==  Finite dimensional vector spaces  One of the useful structure theorems for vector spaces over locally compact fields is that the finite dimensional vector spaces have only an equivalence class of norm: the sup norm pg. 58-59.  Finite field extensions  Given a finite field extension K/F over a locally compact field F, there is at most one unique field norm \\\\cdot_K on K extending the field norm \\\\cdot_F; that is, > f_K = f_F for all f\\\\in K which is in the image of F \\\\hookrightarrow K. Note this follows from the previous theorem and the following trick: if \\\\cdot_1,\\\\cdot_2 are two equivalent norms, and > x_1 < x_2 then for a fixed constant c_1 there exists an N_0 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} such that > \\\\left(\\\\frac{x_1}{x_2} \\\\right)^N < \\\\frac{1}{c_1} for all N \\\\geq N_0 since the sequence generated from the powers of N converge to 0. = Finite Galois extensions = If the index of the extension is of degree n = [K:F] and K/F is a galois extension, (so all solutions to the minimal polynomial of any a \\\\in K is also contained in K) then the unique field norm \\\\cdot_K can be constructed using the field norm pg. 61. This is defined as > a_K = N_{K/F}(a)^{1/n} Note the n-th root is required in order to have a well-defined field norm extending the one over F since given any f \\\\in K in the image of F \\\\hookrightarrow K its norm is > N_{K/F}(f) = \\\\det m_f = f^n since it acts as scalar multiplication on the F-vector space K. == Examples ==  Finite fields  All finite fields are locally compact since they can be equipped with the discrete topology. In particular, any field with the discrete topology is locally compact since every point is the neighborhood of itself, and also the closure of the neighborhood, hence is compact.

The initiative is driven by up to 260,000 polio vaccinators, the largest surveillance network in the world, quality data collection and analysis, state of the art laboratories, and some of the best epidemiologists and public health experts in Pakistan and the world. Pakistan is one of the two remaining countries in the world where poliomyelitis (polio) is still categorized as an endemic viral infection, the other one being Afghanistan. As of 01 October 2020, there have been 74 documented cases in Pakistan in 2020, and 147 documented cases in Pakistan in 2019. The total count of wild poliovirus cases in Pakistan in 2018 was 12. Though the polio immunization campaign in the country started in 1974, the efforts for eradication officially started in 1994. The infection remains endemic despite over 100 rounds of vaccination being carried out in the past decade. Pakistan had the world's highest number of polio cases in 2014. == Eradication efforts in the 20th century == The Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) was begun in Pakistan by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 1970s to combat deaths from six vaccine-preventable diseases. In 1980, the EPI had vaccinated just 2% of the population against polio; by 1990, the coverage had increased to 54%. In a 1994 interview, CDC officials predicted total polio eradication in Pakistan within two to three years; by 1995, the WHO projected total eradication by the year 2000, a target that the organization reaffirmed in 1998. However, despite donor attention, the rate of vaccinations sagged. By 1991, only 83 percent of Pakistani children had been vaccinated. Research by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in April 1998 cited a failure to vaccinate, vaccine failure, and inadequate immunization strategies as causes for the continued incidences of polio in this time. Reasons for under-vaccination included the population being uninformed, considering vaccination unimportant, and having to travel long distances to vaccination sites. In response to these challenges, organizations including the WHO, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), CDC, Rotary International, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pulled together to develop and fund intensive eradication campaigns, including door-to-door vaccinations.A child receives the oral polio vaccine (USAID). == 21st century == In March 2001, about 27 million children were vaccinated across the country in the hope that Pakistan could be virus-free by the end of that year. As of 2004, when there were 30 million children in Pakistan under five, about 200,000 health workers were required for a vaccination campaign that was carried out eight times a year. A documentary, Polio True Stories, was aired on several television channels to make people aware of the problems facing people affected by the disease. Opposition to the polio vaccination program by militant groups continues to thwart the success of eradication efforts. In 2014, the number of polio cases reached 306, the highest it has been since 2000. In August 2015, the country launched an injectable polio vaccine intended to treat four million children and bring Pakistan closer to its goal of eradication by 2016. While the new vaccine is pricier than the traditional oral polio vaccine (OPV) and requires that a doctor or nurse administer it, the injection needs only one dose, not repeated doses, to generate immunity. Connection to the assassination of Osama bin Laden Leading up to the early 2000s, Pakistani vaccination workers were making notable progress in eliminating the polio virus in the highly infected areas of Gadap, Quetta Block (Quetta, Pishin, Kila Abdullah Districts), FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar and the neighboring areas of Mardan, Charsaddah, Nowshehra and Lakki Marwat. In 2011, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employed the services of Pakistani doctor, Shakil Afridi, and local health officials to stage a fake vaccination campaign in an attempt to confirm Osama bin Laden's location in Abbottabad. This ruse was organized in an effort to gain more knowledge on Bin Laden's whereabouts prior to Operation Neptune Spear. While it is still unknown if Afridi was aware of the implications for his services in the campaign, the main goal of the CIA was to collect DNA samples of Osama bin Laden's children from blood left on the needles used to deliver the Hepatitis B vaccination. The CIA's fake vaccination campaign has had severe lasting effects on the North West corner of Pakistan. Since 2012, at least 70 polio workers have been killed in Pakistan. Many of the attacks have been claimed by the Taliban, who forward claims that the vaccination campaigns are a facade for intelligence gathering. The fake Hepatitis B campaign has caused people to question the motivations behind all vaccination campaigns, leading to a spike in poliomyelitis cases from 198 in 2011 to 306 cases in 2014. Many citizens of both the US and various other nations have criticized the CIA's vaccination campaign for the effects that it has had on Pakistan's public health.  Recent government efforts  In 2015, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government issued arrest warrants for 1,200 parents and guardians for refusing to administer vaccine to their children. 512 people were arrested on the charge but were later freed after signing an undertaking that they would not oppose vaccination. By 2015, new cases of polio had dropped by 70% as compared to 2014, due to increased vaccination in parts of the northwest Pakistan that had previously been under the control of militants. These areas were secured by Pakistani forces in the Zarb-e-Azb Campgain against Taliban militants. Previously, vaccination teams were forbidden by militants from vaccinating children in the area. ==Factors affecting eradication== Some of the reasons which affect the eradication of polio are political unrest, poor health infrastructure, and government negligence. The most afflicted areas are those where militants are present and the government lacks absolute control, such as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Transmission of the virus from such areas then leads to spread through other parts of the country.  Misinformation campaigns  Due to the fact that the vaccines are primarily produced in western countries, militant groups like Tehrik-i-Taliban propagandize that they are made out of pig fat or contain alcohol, two things that are forbidden in Islam. Some clerics have also denounced the vaccines. There is also a myth prevalent in many of the areas with low literacy rates that the immunization sterilizes the local population. In early 2012, it was reported that some parents refused to get their children vaccinated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA on religious grounds but overall religious refusals in the rest of the country have \\"decreased manifold\\". Both major sides of the Afghani civil war now support polio vaccination, and polio rates are declining rapidly in Afghanistan, with only seven cases in 2015 (as of August 18, 2015). In Pakistan there were 29 cases in the same period, with organizational difficulties slowing immunization, but more than ten million children have been vaccinated in 2015. This is the last remaining region with active polio cases as of 2015. = The potential role of Saudi Arabia = Some researchers point to the unique role that Saudi Arabia is able to play in the affairs of the Muslim-majority Pakistan, both as the site of the annual Islamic pilgrimage (the Hajj) and as the seat of formal Islamic authority, in terms of the ability to pass fatwas and shape public opinion. Given that over 10% (200,000) of the Hajj pilgrims are Pakistani, Saudi Arabia has a vested interest in eradication campaigns in Pakistan to prevent spread during Hajj. One possible avenue for the Muslim world to eliminate the polio threat is to have local mosques and community centres promote vaccination, emphasizing that the sanctity of life is foremost in Islam. If supported by national and international Muslim organisations, with the aid of world health agencies and Muslim public health scholars, this policy could reduce the extent of misinformation the Taliban is able to spread.  Poor health infrastructure  Pakistan's healthcare system is burdened by poor public-sector funding, an ill-regulated private sector, and a lack of governmental transparency, all of which contribute to limiting the quality of public health services. Though the Polio Eradication Initiative is well funded, it is delivered through the underfunded public infrastructure. Members of the Polio Eradication Committee in Pakistan have also expressed concerns regarding the accountability of the organizations backing the campaign. Since the number of cases began to rise following the raid on the Osama Bin Laden compound, organizations including local health authorities, government workers, WHO, and UNICEF have been asserting blame rather than addressing the public health issues at hand. The public health system provides various avenues for institutionalized malpractice, wherein resources are leached. Staff misconduct is common, where staff members remain absent from duty, fail to run field operations, and divert vaccine for use in private facilities. This can result in the attachment of costs to services intended to be free.  Climate  Fecal-oral transmission is the most common source of transmission of the poliovirus in developing countries, including Pakistan. In addition to the poor health and water sanitation infrastructure, the transmission of the virus is also heightened because of the high population density and climate conditions. Studies have indicated that the polio vaccine has reduced per-dose efficacy in areas near the Tropics, including Pakistan and its neighboring country India. As a consequence of the climate in South Asia, sometimes ten or more doses of the vaccine need to be administered, each a month apart, in order to ensure immunity. The month-long spacing can itself be a reason for families not to complete the vaccination schedule, because transportation could prove unreliable from month to month, and parents might be unable to take time off of work for risk of losing the day's income or losing their job entirely. The threat of natural disaster also plays a role in delaying total eradication of polio. For example, Pakistan is prone to earthquakes and heavy monsoon rains. In the 2010 Pakistan floods, of the 20 million affected, a majority were in the lowest socioeconomic percentile. In addition to cases of dengue fever, cholera, and measles, the WHO reported an upsurge in cases of polio. By November 2010, Pakistan accounted for about 62% of all polio cases from endemic countries, with most new cases being from areas affected by the floods.  Perceptions of Pakistani parents  Another reason for the resistance to the polio vaccine is one of mindset. There is a common perception that other issues are more pressing than vaccination. A manifestation of this is the policy perspective that, if the source of the virus is contaminated drinking water, efforts should be made to purify the water rather than focus on the treatment of disease caused by ingesting the water. Surveys of the Pakistani population show that a significant number feel that the allocation of funding to prevent the problem is more efficient than retroactive treatment once the problem (the spread of polio) has already happened. Additionally, it has been shown that low parental - specifically, maternal - literacy and knowledge regarding vaccines and immunization schedules, poor socioeconomic status, and residence in rural areas all are attributable to decreased rates of immunization completion. Parental education is one of the most important determiners of whether children will complete their vaccinations. In a study of two-parent households in Pakistan, it was shown that the father's knowledge about health most impacted immunization decisions, with an effect so large that some researchers contend improving education will improve health more so than even the provision of health services.  Other factors  Widespread malnutrition in Pakistani children is a factor in lowered resistance to disabling diseases and reduced efficacy of the polio vaccine. In 2019 there were allegedly 'a dozen' cases of the most dangerous P2 strain from vaccine mismanagement.Pakistan accused of cover-up over fresh polio outbreak The Guardian, 2019 == Impact of polio in Pakistan == Polio has had drastic effects on the health of the population of Pakistan and on the nation's healthcare infrastructure and economy. The WHO estimates that 65–75% of polio cases in developing countries occur in children under 3 years of age, with 95% of all cases occurring in children under 5 years of age. Researchers at the School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University quantified the disease burden of various diseases in Pakistan; in the year 1990, a Pakistani person with polio averaged a loss of 1.13 healthy life years to the disease. The duration of disability of polio, averaged over 1000 people, was 81.84 years, the equivalent of diseases including diphtheria, childhood meningitis, and measles. There has been limited research into the impacts of polio in Pakistan in recent years, but a 1988 health survey found that the most common handicaps among polio sufferers were associated with mobility, occupation, and social integration. The survey found differences in participants based on whether they lived in a village or a slum area: there was a higher rate of handicap in the village population, and higher frequencies of infectious, respiratory, and digestive diseases in the slum area. Both areas saw polio victims suffer from a higher incidence of musculoskeletal system diseases, as well as infections of the ear, and respiratory tract.

It was begun as a family workshop by Dimas Uriarte, but today it is run by a business group. However, the enterprise still makes Talavera pottery using 16th century methods. Much of its work still uses traditional colors and designs, and eligible for certificates of authenticity by the Mexican government, but it has also experimented with new designs and forms since the early 20th century. This has included collaborating with various plastic artists to create modern designs and even artistic pieces . ==History== Photograph of Uriarte artisans taken in 1928 Display room inside Uriarte Photo of 1933 of Uriarte Talavera Uriarte is one of the oldest producers of Talavera pottery in Mexico. This is a kind of majolica, named after the city of Talavera de la Reina which had developed in Spain from Arab and Chinese origins and brought to Mexico after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. While majolica was made in a number of places in Mexico, it became highly refined in the Puebla city area, especially from 1650 to 1750. Talavera work is distinguished by the fine clays found in this area, fired with a tin and lead glaze at high temperatures. This glaze is off white to slightly yellow. The decorations are done only in black, cobalt blue, blue, yellow, green, red and sometimes deep rose, with the design slightly fuzed with the glaze which crazes. Authentic Talavera is still made by the same 16th century methods as in the colonial period and all done by hand. By the early 20th century, the craft was waning. However, reconstruction after the Mexican Revolution created a demand for tiles and collectors became interested in the work. Large collections were created in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Museum of Art. In Mexico, German born Franz Mayer started collection. In 1986, he opened his own museum with the largest collection of Talavera in the world with 726 pieces from the 17th to 19th century. The Uriarte workshop was founded in 1824, when the family acquired facilities formerly called La Guadalupana. The first owner was Dimas Uriarte. From then until the end of the 19th century, it remained in the family, with production mostly limited to plates and cups, and later some tiles. In 1897, Catalan artist Enrique Luis Ventosa arrived to Puebla at a time when craft was in danger of disappearing. The Uriarte workshop was one of only six in Puebla. Ventosa worked with this workshop and others to revive the craft with success evident by 1907. In 1910, Uriarte introduced electricity into the workshop, allowing it to produce more and grow, becoming the largest and best known in Puebla. Starting in 1922, Ventosa began to work with Ysauro Uriarte Martinez, who had just inherited Dimas’s workshop. During this time, Ventosa worked on the decoration while Uriarte formed the vessels, with the pieces signed by both men, but by use of decorative initials rather than the standard full signatures. The two men collaborated to elevate the quality of utilitarian pieces and to create unique works of ceramic art introducing pre-Columbian art into the motifs along with the Islamic, Chinese, and Italian influences already present. There was even a touch of Art Nouveau. The two also experimented with some other designs such as a revival of Hispano-Muslim lusterware and firing oxides at different temperatures to change the appearance of the glazes. By 1923, Uriarte was one of only four workshops to survive the Mexican Revolution. It continued to be operated by the family until the early 1990s, when it was sold to a group of businessmen. In 1994, the business decided to franchise the name with the first two stores in Cancún and San Diego. During this same time period, Uriarte became one of the first workshops to become eligible for a certificate of authenticity from the government for their Talavera. ==Production== Demonstration of painting a Talavera piece Uriarte makes about 20,000 pieces a month on average, with about half of the production exported to the United States, France, Italy, Egypt, Australia, Chile and other countries. Still using 16th century methods, their designs and processes are unique with no two pieces exactly alike as they are made completely by hand, with the process taking up to three months, with about of the cost of each piece being labor. The pieces are registered with a serial number and most pieces are signed by the artisan which creates them. The workshop has worked with artists such as José Luis Cuevas, Jan Hendrix, Ricardo Regazzoni, Manuel Felguérez and Georgina Farias to create new designs. These designs are part of a collection called “Contemporary Talavera” which is the work of 57 artists which designed 130 pieces. Examples of these works have been displayed in museums in Mexico, the United States and Canada. ==Museum exhibitions== Artist Diana Salazar with ceramic pieces created with the workshop Pieces from the workshop can be seen in the permanent collections of the Museo José Bello y Gonzalez in Puebla and the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City . In 2012, the workshop, along with the Franz Mayer Museum, sponsored an exhibition called \\"El cinco de mayo de 1862. Uriarte Talavera Contemporánea\\" May 5, 1862. Contemporary Uriarte Talavera. It was a project which involved a number of artists along with the enterprise’s artisans to create 64 pieces and eleven murals related to the Battle of Puebla to commemorate the battle’s 150 anniversary. The artists included Aída Aguilera, Luis Argudín, Silvia Barbescu, Feliciano Béjar, Marna Bunnell, Marcos Castro, Alberto Castro Leñero, Francisco Castro Leñero, Joaquín Conde, Alex Dorfsman, Mónica Dower, Demián Flores, Pedro Friedeberg, Cisco Jiménez, Luis Nishizawa, Maribel Portela and Cristina Rubalcava.

This is achieved by a high-voltage (20 kV typically) electric discharge between two electrodes over the surface of a quartz (or glass) tube. The distance between the electrodes is such that a spontaneous discharge does not occur. To start the discharge a high-voltage pulse (70 kV for example) is applied on an electrode inside the quartz tube. The flash can be triggered electronically by being synchronised with an electronic detection device such as a microphone or an interrupted laser beam in order to illuminate a fast event. A sub- microsecond flash is fast enough to photographically capture a supersonic bullet in flight without noticeable motion blur. ==History== The person credited with popularising the flash is Harold Eugene Edgerton, though the earlier scientist Ernst Mach also used a spark gap as a fast photographic lighting system. William Henry Fox Talbot is said to have created the first spark-based flash photo, using a Leyden jar, the original form of the capacitor. Edgerton was one of the founders of EG&G; company who sold an air- gap flash under the name Microflash 549.http://people.rit.edu/andpph/text- microflash-549-manual.pdf There are several commercial flashes available today. == Design parameters == The aim of a high-speed flash is to be very fast and yet bright enough for adequate exposure. An air-gap flash system typically consists of a capacitor that is discharged through a gas (air in this case). The speed of a flash is mainly determined by the time it takes to discharge the capacitor through the gas. This time is proportional to t_{discharge} \\\\propto {\\\\sqrt{LC}}, in which L is the inductance and C the capacitance of the system. To be fast, both L and C must be kept small. The brightness of the flash is proportional to the energy stored in the capacitor: E = {{CV^2} \\\\over 2}, where V is the voltage across the capacitor. This shows that high brightness calls for a large capacitance and a high voltage. However, since a large capacitance would have a relatively long discharge time that would make the flash slow, the only practical solution is to use a very high voltage on a relatively small capacitor, with a very low inductance. Typical values are 0.05 µF capacitance, 0.02 µH inductance, 10 J energy, 0.5 µs duration and about 20 MW power.Edgerton, Harold E. (19706). Electronic flash, strobe, Chapter 7, Mc Graw Hill, New-York. / 0-07-018965-x. Air (mainly nitrogen) is preferred as a gas because it is fast. Xenon has a much higher efficiency in turning energy into light, but is limited in speed to about 10 microseconds, caused by its own afterglow. The spark is guided over a quartz surface to improve the light output and benefit from the cooling capacity, making the flash faster.Topler, M, Ann Physik, vol. 4, no. 27, pp 1043-1050, 1908Edgerton, H. E. K, K. Cooper and J. Tredwell, Submicrosecond Flash Source, J. SMTPE, vol. 70, p. 117, March, 1961 This has a negative effect in the form of quartz erosion because of high energy discharge. == Spectral properties == Since the spark gap discharges in air generating a plasma, the spectrum shows both a continuum and spectral lines, mainly of nitrogen since air is 79% nitrogen. The spectrum is rich in UV but covers the entire visible range down to infra-red. When a quartz tube is used as ignition tube, it shows a clear phosphorescence in blue after the flash, induced by the UV. ==References *Amateur air-gap flash for ultra-high-speed photography by Niels Noordhoek *MIT Edgerton center *Scientific American article on air-gap flash Category:Photographic lighting Category:Light sources Category:Photography equipment ","title":"Air-gap flash"},{"id":"35938173","text":"The Oceania Hockey Federation is the governing body for the sport of field hockey in Oceania.

If the vehicle can also travel in reverse, then the path follows the Reeds–Shepp curve.Reeds, J.A. and L.A. Shepp, \\"Optimal paths for a car that goes both forwards and backwards\\", Pacific J. Math., 145 (1990), pp. 367–393. In 1957, Lester Eli Dubins (1920–2010) proved using tools from analysis that any such path will consist of maximum curvature and/or straight line segments. In other words, the shortest path will be made by joining circular arcs of maximum curvature and straight lines. In 1974 H.H Johnson proved Dubins' result by applying Pontryagin's maximum principle.Johnson, H. H \\"An application of the maximum principle to the geometry of plane curves\\", Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, 44(2):432- 435, 1974. In particular, H.H Johnson presented necessary and sufficient conditions for a plane curve, which has bounded piecewise continuous curvature and prescribed initial and terminal points and directions, to have minimal length. In 1992 the same result was shown again using Pontryagin's maximum principle. The Dubins path is commonly used in the fields of robotics and control theory as a way to plan paths for wheeled robots, airplanes and underwater vehicles. There are simple geometric and analytical methods to compute the optimal path. For example, in the case of a wheeled robot, a simple kinematic car model for the systems is: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot x &= V \\\\cos (\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot y &= V \\\\sin (\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot \\\\theta &= u \\\\end{align} where (x,y) is the car's position, \\\\theta is the heading, the car is moving at a constant speed V , and the turn rate control u is bounded. In this case the maximum turning rate corresponds to some minimum turning radius (and equivalently maximum curvature). The prescribed initial and terminal tangents correspond to initial and terminal headings. The Dubins' path gives the shortest path joining two oriented points that is feasible for the wheeled-robot model. The optimal path type can be described using an analogy with cars of making a 'right turn (R)' , 'left turn (L)' or driving 'straight (S).' An optimal path will always be at least one of the six types: RSR, RSL, LSR, LSL, RLR, LRL. For example, consider that for some given initial and final positions and tangents, the optimal path is shown to be of the type 'RSR.' Then this corresponds to a right-turn arc (R) followed by a straight line segment (S) followed by another right-turn arc (R). Moving along each segment in this sequence for the appropriate length will form the shortest curve that joins a starting point A to a terminal point B with the desired tangents at each endpoint and that does not exceed the given curvature. File:Dubins1.svgAn RSL Dubins path File:Dubins2.svgAn RSR Dubins path File:Dubins3.svgAn LRL Dubins path ==Dubins Interval Problem== Dubins interval problem is a key variant of the Dubins path problem, where an interval of heading directions are specified at the initial and terminal points. The tangent direction of the path at initial and final points are constrained to lie within the specified intervals. One could solve this using geometrical analysis, or using Pontryagin's minimum principle. ==References External links == * Dubins Curves, from Planning Algorithms by Steven M.

The club was founded in 2006 and competes in the UPSL Premier Division, a fifth-tier United States Adult Soccer Association and Cal South affiliated league in Southern California. The team is coached by Michael Friedman who is also Cal FC's General Manager The 2012 USOC team was coached by former U.S. national team player and current Fox Soccer analyst, Eric Wynalda alongside his former co-host of Fox Football Fone-In, Nick Webster. ==History== Cal FC started to play in the La Gran Liga de Oxnard in 2009. The team was composed mainly of players whom Michael Friedman previously coached at clubs or on a college team. The team developed over the seasons to include players from SDSU and other colleges. Critical to the team's creation and continued success were the Barrera brothers, Danny and Diego. (Friedman previously coached Barrera on a U12 AYSO team). Their addition elevated the team and brought in higher level players and off-season pros looking to get a workout. They achieved great successes in the La Gran Liga and dominated other teams. In 2012 the team entered into the USASA Region IV. The team placed 2nd over the well respected Doxa Italia club and Cal FC earned a berth into the USOC. The team received attention in the 2012 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, when the club upset 2012 PDL Champions Kitsap 3-1, the USL Pro side Wilmington Hammerheads 4–0http://thecup.us/2012-us-open-cup-second-round-eric-wynaldas- cal-fc-upends-host-wilmington-hammerheads-in-stunning-4-0-result/ and Major League Soccer side Portland Timbers 1–0 before losing to Seattle Sounders FC 5–0 in the fourth round of the tournament. Cal FC became the first amateur team to beat an MLS club without needing penalty kicks, as well as the first from the USASA to do so (Dallas Roma F.C. had previously defeated Chivas USA in the 2006 tournament via penalty kicks) Cal FC, Doxa Italia, and PSA battled it out over the next few years. In 2013 Cal failed to Qualify for USOC after losing to Doxa Italia in the USASA Region IV tournament. Cal FC qualified for the 2014, 2015, and 2016 editions of the tournament. On August 21, 2018, Cal FC announced their intention to join the second-division United Soccer League by 2020. However, on November 15, 2018, Cal FC was listed among the founding members of the professional NPSL Founders Cup.

In summer 2011, she could not keep up with friends and after almost collapsing during hiking, she went to see her family doctor. In October 2011, she was diagnosed with advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and was told she needed a double lung transplant. In September 2011, Hélène's lungs function was only 26% and in October it went down to 24%. Since lung transplants were not done in Ottawa, she had to move to Toronto in January to be placed on the transplant waiting list. In late March, Hélène's condition was decaying quickly and her lung function was only 7%. On April 4, she had serious difficulty breathing and was admitted to the Toronto General Hospital. Hélène's lung function was a 6%, and was getting smaller by the minute. Her condition was grave enough that she was almost taken off the list - she was considered a \\"high risk patient\\". On April 6, Hélène underwent a successful double lung transplant at the Toronto General Hospital.

After Bieber retweeted her campaign, over 2,000 people in Ontario alone registered to be organ donors. In March, Campbell was on The Ellen DeGeneres Show through Skype to talk about her cause to encourage people to be organ donors and give people like her a second chance.

Typically, the hair on the top of the head is long and parted on either the side or center, while the back and sides are buzzed very short. It is closely related to the curtained hair of the mid-to-late 1990s, although those with undercuts during the 2010s tend to slick back the bangs away from the face. ==Origins== Historically, the undercut has been associated with poverty and inability to afford a barber competent enough to blend in the sides, as on a short back and sides haircut. From the turn of the 20th century until the 1920s, the undercut was popular among young working class men, especially members of street gangs. In interwar Glasgow, the Neds (precursors to the Teddy Boys) favored a haircut that was long on top and cropped at the back and sides. Despite the fire risk, much paraffin wax was used to keep the hair in place.Christie, Stuart (2002). My Granny Made Me an Anarchist. Oil & Gas USSR. pp. 87–88. . Other gangs who favored this haircut were the Scuttlers of Manchester and the Peaky Blinders of Birmingham, because longer hair put the wearer at a disadvantage in a street fight. During the jazz age of the 1920s and 1930s, hairstyles of this type were considered mainstream fashion. Military barbers of the World War I era gave short back and sides haircuts as fast as possible because of the numbers, under orders to facilitate personal hygiene in trench warfare, and as nearly uniform as possible, with an eye to appearance on parade. This made the short back and sides style the norm in the UK after 1918, and its variant the brush cut became common in North America and France.https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/a-bloke-writes-the-barber-my- father-and-a-short-back-and-sides-1170503.html In Nazi Germany, a version of this haircut which was long on top but shaved at the back and sides was popular among Wehrmacht officers.WWII German haircut The undercut remained common in the UK and America until the 1960s, when longer hair such as the wings haircut was popularised by the mod subculture and British Invasion bands such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. ==Revival== Beginning in the late 1980s, centrally parted undercuts derived from the bowl cut made a comeback among fans of new wave, synthpop, and electronic music as an alternative to the mullets and backcombed hair of glam metal bands. A collar-length version of the haircut, known as curtained hair, went mainstream in the early 1990s and was worn by many celebrities, most notably Tom Cruise. Another variant, with a floppy permed fringe, was known as the \\"meet me at McDonald's haircut\\" due to its popularity among fast food workers during the 1980s.Mcdonalds haircut banned Curtained hair and undercuts went out of style in the early 2000s, but underwent a revival in the early 2010s among hipsters and skaters who imitated the 1930s and 1940s version: longer with pomade in or swept to one side on top and shaved or clipped at the sides. At the time, although the style had many different names, the most controversial were the \\"Hitler Youth\\", \\"Jugend\\", and \\"fasci\\". Some of the most high-profile early adopters of this haircut included Macklemore, Kim Jong Un, David Beckham, and Win Butler. During the late 2000s and early 2010s, undercuts were often associated with villainous movie characters such as Hannibal Lecter in Hannibal Rising, Johnny Depp's portrayal of gangster John Dillinger, Jared Leto as The Joker in Suicide Squad, Guy Pearce in Lawless, and various German officers in war films.Characters from television series such as Jimmy Darmody on HBO’s Boardwalk Empire and various characters from the BBC series Peaky Blinders were also associated with the undercut.

He was a key figure in the East Village art scene in New York from 1982 to 1987 often showing together both Neo-Surrealist paintings and totem- like sculpture. He frequently exhibited with other artists who emerged at the time, including Kiki Smith, David Wojnarowicz, George Condo, Rick Prol, Peter Schuyff, Mark Kostabi and Marilyn Minter. ==Early life== Radakovich was born in Illinois, the son of a corporate executive and an opera singer. His sister is the writer Anka Radakovich. He grew up in Ohio and finished high school in Maryland. After graduating from the Maryland Institute, College of Art with a BFA, he moved to New York City. ==Work== Radakovich's style is a combination of Appropriation, Neo-Expressionism and Neo-Surrealism. In his paintings, he uses cryptic relationships, sexual scenarios and psychologically charged tableaux. His Surrealistic atmospheres, cartoon like drawing and appropriated Modigliani-like heads are painted in a linear but expressionist technique. The paintings are frontal and highly colored often evoking the space of Indian miniatures. The sculptural works often incorporate totem structures that stack body parts and biomorphic elements. Although inspired by primitive cultural forms, the totems are modern urban signposts containing the dramas of city life. Disrupted narratives beg the viewer to unravel the tale that is set before them. His paintings are filled with urban dramas where the participants struggle with the problems of modern life, often with comical results. The figures in his work are posed in psychologically ambiguous terms. The elongated heads are Icons of humans in a mechanized society grappling with the questions of desire and nature. Radakovich's work has entered the collections of many prominent American tastemakers including fashion designer Todd Oldham, Ford Model's owner Katie Ford and hotelier Andre Balazs. ==Career== 1980s As the East Village art scene gained momentum in 1982, numerous group shows lead to his first one-person show at Kamikaze in Chelsea in 1983. He came to prominence by exhibiting, in the East Village, both paintings and sculpture at shows at Sensory Evolution in 1984 and again in 1985. Radakovich and his contemporaries were first documented in Arts Magazine in September 1985. Written by critic Robert Pincus-Witten and photographed by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders for Arts Magazine, \\"The New Irascibles\\" an essay and portfolio of photographs was based on the celebrated photograph \\"The Irascibles\\" of the Abstract-Expressionist Group taken by Nina Leen in 1951. It was meant as a historical overview and photographic record to preserve the participants of a short-lived scene in Manhattan where entrepreneurial artists and dealers opened their own galleries during the period between 1982 and 1987. After that time, most of these galleries and artists were absorbed into the Soho art world eager for new talent and they ultimately ushered in the explosion of the 80's art market boom. Solo shows at Bridgewater/Lustberg in 1986 and 1987 were followed by B-Side Gallery in 1986 and St. Marks Gallery in 1987. 1990s An important survey of work from 1984 to 1991 was exhibited at the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts in 1991. Radakovich had one person shows at the Takahashi Gallery in 1993 in Nagoya Japan, John McAdams Gallery 1995 in Chicago and Mat Thornton Gallery 1998 in Washington D.C. 2000 and after After a one-person show in 2001 at the Sarah Denning Gallery in Chelsea, Radakovich continued to exhibit in groups shows in New York. An update of the East Village Art scene was included in the November 1999 issue of Art Forum. The historical significance of this group of artists was established by \\"East Village USA\\" at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York City in December 2004 and satellite shows at the B-Side Gallery's \\"East Village ASU\\" and the Hal Bromm Gallery's \\"Vintage East Village\\" in January 2005 in which Radakovich's work was exhibited. =Recent exhibitions= In September 2011 Radakovich was exhibited at The Clay Center for the Arts and Sciences in Charleston, West Virginia, as part of their permanent collection, called “Preserving a Legacy: 25 Years of Collecting”. The group show, “Crossing Houston” at the Smart Clothes Gallery on the Lower East Side in New York City, featured Radakovich in a survey of important artists from the East Village scene. September 11 to Oct. 11, 2012.http://www.artslant.com/ny/events/show/234693-crossing-houston Radakovich recently participated in December 2012 at the Overture  Miami pavilion with the Sensory Evolution Gallery as part of the Art  Basel Miami Beach contemporary art fair.http://overturemiami.com/exhibitors/galleries/ ==References== Notes Bibliography * ==External links== * Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century American sculptors Category:21st- century American painters Category:21st-century male artists Category:21st- century American sculptors Category:Sculptors from Maryland Category:Living people Category:Maryland Institute College of Art alumni Category:Painters from Illinois Category:Painters from Maryland Category:Painters from New York (state) Category:Sculptors from Illinois Category:Sculptors from New York (state) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Jim Radakovich"},{"id":"35938655","text":"The Heron Pond Swan Lake Trail is a long hiking trail in Grand Teton National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming.

About Virginia Macari & The beachwear ==Name change== In late 2012, NBC became interested in Dublin Housewives (which is not part of The Real Housewives franchise) and noticed similarities between it and their franchise. After viewing an episode of the show, NBC requested changes be made. It was agreed between NBC and TV3 that the 'Housewives' title of the series would be replaced by 'Wives' and that Dublin's Spire be removed from the programme's logo, which appeared similar to promotional material for The Real Housewives of New York City which features the iconic Empire State Building. According to a report in the Irish Independent, the change came after direct contact from NBC which owns The Real Housewives franchise, recently valued by The Hollywood Reporter as being worth upwards of half a billion dollars. A TV3 source stressed that all contact with NBC had been amicable, and that NBC were impressed by Dublin Wives. ==Cancellation== Jeff Ford replaced Ben Frow as the director of content at TV3 he said major shows will be axed, as he brings in fresh content to lead the channel upmarket and away from the trashy reality shows favoured by his predecessor. By mid 2013 the stars and production company of Dublin Wives have not been contacted by TV3 about a new series, \\"No one has heard one way or the other about its re-commissioning. It's the silence on the matter that would prompt me to believe that it won't be coming back,\\" said a source. It has been revealed that the likes of Tallafornia and Dublin Wives will be axed as Ford believes these are too trashy - with industry insiders saying UTV may consider bidding for the company. A source said: \\"Jeff did hint that he might move them to 3e but it looks like he’s not keen to make them again as he doesn’t feel the money involved in making them justifies the figures. ==Spin-offs== Jo Jordan and Lisa Murphy have been filming their own fly-on-the-wall documentary series, they are calling: Jo And Lisa ...

It is a remake of the 1980 film of the same name, and follows the violent exploits of a brutal serial killer. The film is an international co- production produced by the French film companies La Petite Reine and Studio 37. Unlike the original 1980 film, which is set in New York City, writers Aja and Levasseur chose to set the film in Los Angeles. ==Plot== Frank Zito is a schizophrenic young man who has taken over his family's mannequin restoration business after the recent death of his mother. Frank was traumatized as a child by his mother, a prostitute who made him watch her have sex with her johns. As an adult, he murders and scalps women and attaches their hair onto his mannequins to recreate his one happy childhood memory: brushing his mother's hair before she \\"went out\\" at night. Frank joins a dating site, where he gets a date with a woman named Lucie. The two go out to dinner and return to Lucie's apartment, where she attempts to seduce the virginal Frank, mistaking his increasing panic for nervousness. Frank strangles Lucie, scalps her and takes her hair back to his apartment, where he attaches it to another mannequin. One morning, Frank awakens to find a photographer named Anna taking photos of the mannequins in his storefront. Frank invites her into his store, where she is taken with his work restoring antique department store mannequins. The two develop a friendship, with Frank agreeing to help Anna put together an art exhibit using his mannequins. Frank falls in love with her and starts taking medication to control his violent urges. Frank nevertheless kills again, stabbing a young dancer to death and attaching her scalp to another mannequin. At the opening of the exhibit, Frank meets Anna's boyfriend Jason, as well as art director and Anna's mentor Rita. Both mock him for his interest in mannequins, questioning his sexual orientation. Frank later follows Rita home, subdues her in the bathtub and hog-ties her on her bed. Identifying Rita with his mother, Frank voices his resentment and sense of abandonment, finally scalping Rita alive in a fit of rage. The next day, Frank calls Anna, who tearfully tells him of Rita's murder and of her recent breakup with Jason. Frank comes to Anna's apartment to comfort her but inadvertently reveals his guilt by mentioning things that only the killer would know. Realizing that Frank is the killer, Anna stabs Frank through the hand with a knife before locking herself in her bedroom. Anna's neighbor, Martin, breaks into the apartment to save her, only for Frank to kill him with a meat cleaver. Breaking down Anna's bathroom door, Frank puts her into a choke hold and knocks her unconscious. Frank loads Anna's body into his van and drives home, but as he opens the doors Anna regains consciousness and stabs him in the stomach with a piece of rebar attached to a mannequin hand. Anna flees and is picked up by a passing car, whose driver panics at the sight of a blood- covered Frank and runs him down, crashing & flinging Anna through the windshield. Bloodied, Frank hobbles to the mortally injured Anna and scalps her as she dies. Frank returns to his apartment, attaching Anna's hair to a mannequin dressed in a bridal gown. As he succumbs to his injuries, Frank suffers hallucinations of the mannequins transforming into his victims and begin to tear his body apart, finally ripping off his face to reveal a mannequin head. Before he dies, Frank sees Anna, clad in a wedding dress, lower her veil and turn her back on him. Later that day, a SWAT team breaks into Frank's apartment, only to find Frank's corpse in his closet, alongside his collection of scalps. ==Cast== * Elijah Wood as Frank Zito * Nora Arnezeder as Anna D'Antoni * Jan Broberg as Rita * Liane Balaban as Judy * America Olivo as Angela Zito, Frank's mother * Joshua De La Garza as Martin Nunez * Morgane Slemp as Jenna * Sal Landi as Detective * Genevieve Alexandra as Jessica * Sammi Rotibi as Jason * Megan M. Duffy as Lucie *Bryan Lugo as Officer Burton ==Production== Nearly the entire film is shot from the murderer's point of view, with his face being shown only in reflections and occasionally in the third person. This \\"proved to be challenging on both a narrative and technical level for the filmmakers and cast.\\" Because of this point of view technique, Elijah Wood had to be present nearly every day of filming, which is unusual. Wood told an interviewer, \\"It's the most intriguing element of the film. It meant I could create this character in a completely different way. It became about hearing him and feeling him rather than seeing him. And you only see him in flashes, so they become very intense character revealing moments. I've never played someone so dark before. It was interesting to go there.\\" He added, \\"The four-week shoot was very technical so you kind of become desensitised to what is very disturbing material. None of us had ever made a PoV [point-of-view] film before. There was this whole element of the character that was basically the camera. I've never worked so closely with a DP [director of photography] before. I would be behind him the whole time, tapping on his shoulder to make him move faster or slower. It was a totally fascinating way to work.\\" Director Khalfoun told an interviewer, \\"He has this good guy sort of package. Usually an actor's baggage can hurt your character, but he really is just this good guy sort of persona so I couldn't wait to turn him into a horrible beast. I think for his fans it's shocking too, and it adds to the shock value of the film.\\" Khalfoun said in another interview, \\"POV (Point of View) has been in movies since Peeping Tom, but no horror film had ever been entirely shot that way... I wanted the audience to feel trapped in his body. The cinema plays a big part in that concept since you are stuck in your seat forced to experience the events with little control over the outcome. Much like Frank is stuck in his body. You are therefore at the same time complicit and repulsed. Therein lies the horror.\\" Wood described some of the filming process to The Guardian: \\"The whole film is primarily shown from the character's perspective, so 70% of the process involved working with the director of photography Maxime Alexandre. Maxime was effectively the character as well as me, and the rest of Frank had to be created locally through his inner monologue, which I recorded on an audio stage afterwards... We approached the point-of-view thing with a certain naivety. At first, we thought we'd use a body double. We quickly discovered that didn't work. So I was there the whole time, dancing around behind the camera, leaning forward to put my hand in the frame. Every sequence was a learning process.\\" Wood told another viewer, however, that they did use a body double's hands in some scenes: \\"I also had a counterpart who could 'be' my left or my right hand because I couldn't always use both hands in a natural way, depending on where the camera was. So we literally held things together and handed things off as if it were the same person. It was a lot of choreography!... Most of the time I couldn't get both of my hands on either side of the camera, because the rig was too big. So there'd be times when I'd be on one side with my right hand, and then my double would be on the left side with his left hand, so we'd have to work together a lot, like moving an object from one hand to another. And if you're trying to do that with two different hands, it's pretty challenging to make that look pretty natural.\\" Blocking the scenes, Wood said, was \\"a 'puzzle' as they had to map out how each scene was covered within the context of the POV nature.\\" Wood added, \\"Being on set felt far more technical than emotional. I was thinking about how I was going to fit into the construct of a shot. It had more to do with physicality than my emotional state of being except for the reflections that were relatively intense moments.\\" Khalfoun said, \\"It was a real marriage between Maxime's camera work and Elijah. You see Frank throughout the movie sporadically and Elijah was there to make sure the camera moved the right way and the lines were delivered correctly. It was important he be there. It was the first time I had seen an actor work so closely and technically with the camera to guide it through where he would be or actually do.\\" Khalfoun employed angles and mirrors to conceal the cameras while filming reflections. Post-production Only some of Wood's dialogue was recorded while shooting. Wood said that the additional dialogue recording (ADR) was crucial to creating the character of Frank: \\"I knew that the character had to come alive when you didn't see him. So most of that was done in the ADR stage in post-production; I felt the character was kind of created there, for the most part.\\" He told an interviewer, \\"I always felt like the heart of the character and the depths of the darkness of the character were going to happen in the ADR stage.\\" The film poster was designed by the award- winning Sam Ashby. Score The film was scored by French composer Robin Coudert, credited simply as \\"Rob\\". Bloody Disgusting judged the music to be \\"one of the best parts\\" of the film, and Screen International wrote that the \\"'80s style synth score is reminiscent of John Carpenter,\\" a horror movie director who has provided the musical score for many of his own films. The Hollywood Reporter declared, \\"The nerve-shredding score, by the mono-monikered Rob, salutes the music Italian prog-rockers Goblin provided for [Dario] Argento's early horror-thrillers, the 1980s electronica lending a deeply melancholic city-at-night vibe.\\" Fangoria called the soundtrack \\"delightful.\\" A reviewer for the Geeks of Doom website thought that \\"composer Rob's synth- heavy score\\" was \\"reminiscent of Cliff Martinez's Drive soundtrack and the electronic music composed by Wendy Carlos for Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.\\" ==Distribution== The film's North American rights were picked up by distributor IFC Midnight in August 2012. ==Release== A red band trailer was released May 25, 2012 and the film was screened at the Cannes Film Festival the following day. Warner Brothers released an online video of the first six minutes of the film in late 2012. An international behind-the-scenes \\"featurette\\" was made available online in December 2012. Maniac opened in German theaters in December 2012, and in other European countries in March 2013. '\\"Maniac had its USA premiere at the Mad Monster Party horror convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, on March 23, 2013. It was released at the IFC Center in New York City on June 21, 2013. DVD release company Blue Underground is cited in the opening credits. The film was made available through iTunes, cable video on demand, Amazon Video, SundanceNow.com, and elsewhere. ==Reception== Critical reaction Maniac has a 53% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 74 reviews and an average score of 5.08/10. The consensus says, \\"Shocking and bloody, Maniac is smarter than your average psychological slasher, but it's often undermined by its excessive gore.\\" Front Row Reviews called it \\"one of the strongest and most beautiful classic horror stories of our generation.... visually and audibly stunning.\\" Complex magazine wrote that \\"having seen it, we can confirm that Maniac is an early frontrunner for 2013's best horror movie.\\" The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Wood's \\"forever-young face, often an asset in projecting innocence, is here a sign of a man-child emotionally interrupted, as he stalks down women and removes their scalps in a rampage that begins shortly after the death of his mother.\\" Megan Lehmann, who watched the film at the Cannes Film Festival for The Hollywood Reporter, wrote in her review, \\"Wood's limpid saucer eyes are used here to telegraph unhinged blood-lust and insanity, even if only sporadically, as he plays a sicko with mommy issues who scalps his female victims. The twist, and what helps elevate the nasty, no-holds-barred Maniac from the grindhouse to an out-of-competition midnight-screening slot in Cannes, is that the entire movie is shot from the killer's POV – we only glimpse Wood in reflection and in photographs. It's a daring decision, potentially stripping the film of the suspense of not knowing where the killer is and obliquely inviting the audience to have empathy with him. For the most part Khalfoun and cinematographer Maxime Alexandre pull it off, although the technique more than once tips over from inventively arty to film-school-grad pretentious. Slasher-movie fans, however, need not be put off by the stylized camera work and arty patina: this is down and dirty genre filmmaking, and the various slaughters, excruciatingly detailed scalpings and other atrocities are no less gruesome because of the highfalutin approach... The movie is essentially a sadistic art-house bloodbath, with opera music and ballet dancers and funky little art galleries.\\" A reviewer for SciFiNow praised the film's \\"fresh and challenging approach\\" and said, \\"Khalfoun's version is arguably a more troubling piece of work than its predecessor. By forcing us to see through the eyes of a man who brutally murders women, the issues of voyeurism and misogyny rear their ugly heads before you've even settled in... Maniac is certainly brutal and gory, but it's the manner in which the violence is presented that really turns the stomach. This unsavoury but powerful trick is contrasted by the decision to switch out the grimy night-time world of Eighties New York for the neon landscape of Los Angeles, complete with a superb synth-heavy soundtrack that makes the film feel more like Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive than anything from the gloomy Platinum Dunes remake stable or the winking throwbacks of the Grindhouse movies.\\" Daniel Krupa reviewed the film for the IGN website, calling it \\"violent, gruesome, shocking, and extremely cruel\\" but \\"also entertaining, darkly amusing, smart, and impeccably well-made.\\" The first-person point of view filming, he said, is not \\"an idle stylistic flourish, though, since it has a serious impact on how the audience experiences the movie... It's uncomfortable and queasy stuff, but it occasionally achieves a kind of weird beauty.\\" A review on the Geeks of Doom website said, \\"Elijah Wood provides a chilling, downright eerie performance as Frank – even though he's seldom on-screen. Wood communicates Frank's mental illness by muttering to himself and carrying on conversations with his mannequins – grunting like a rabid animal as he stalks his prey – while Arnezeder makes for a compelling, sympathetic 'final girl' who challenges Wood's maniac in unconventional ways. Overall, Maniac is a well- made, artistic take on Lustig's guerrilla-gore flick that manages to give the viewer the requisite blood and brutality while adding some much-needed psychological underpinning to the characters and their motivations. There's a lot to appreciate in Khalfoun's film – a stylish, modern-day slasher that is deeply disturbing and compelling.\\" The ScreenRant.com review called the film a \\"solid revival of a genre that's gone rather stale in the last decade\\" and said, \\"With its throwback synthesizer score, sustained point-of-view shots, and shadowy lighting, the preview certainly evokes a sense of gut-churning dread.\\" Wood's acting was praised: \\"Though this isn't the first time Wood has played a serial killer, the trailer makes it clear that this isn't simply a rehash of his wordless, goggle-eyed performance as Kevin in Sin City. With a voice that mixes breathy, genuinely unsettling obsession with a childlike honesty, Wood's interpretation of Frank looks to be a new creature entirely.\\" New Empress Magazine criticized the film, saying, \\"The digital cinematography by Maxime Alexandre uses an annoyingly stylized gloss over a lot of the potential scuzziness, leaving run-down downtown Los Angeles as industrial and neglected, but not forbidding, creating an atmosphere reminiscent of a video game. The aesthetic choices also make the murders seem unreal and even pixelated, with a blotchy and heightened crimson colour accompanying every scalping. Such a pity then, that the opportunity for a truly horrifying cinematic experience has been botched through odd directional choices by Franck Khalfoun and photography that creates style over substance, reducing the impact of a serial killer with so much potential to horrify and disturb us.\\" Audience reaction Khalfoun said that audience members have vomited and fainted, and he took the reactions \\"as a compliment,\\" explaining, \\"We had a screening here in Los Angeles and somebody passed out, which I pat myself on the back for. The movie had to creep on you – it's a different kind of fear; it's more of a nauseating fear. You really have the opportunity to maybe feel the [nausea] of committing crime rather than glorifying it just for the aspect of fun and thrill. The audience gets to experience for the first time how sick [it is to commit murder] – we're certainly not condoning it, but making a real statement about serial killers.\\" Awards *2013 – Audience Award for Feature Film at Stanley Film Festival. *2013 – Best Actor in Leading Role: Elijah Wood, Best Editing: Baxter, Franck Khalfoun – Fright Meter Awards *2014 – Best Actor: Elijah Wood, Best Score: Robin Coudert – Fangoria. ==Discography== The CD soundtrack composed by Robin Coudert (aka Rob) is available on Music Box Records label website. ==References* * Category:2012 films Category:2012 horror films Category:2010s serial killer films Category:2010s slasher films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American slasher films Category:American splatter films Category:English-language films Category:Films about prostitution in the United States Category:Films directed by Franck Khalfoun Category:Films shot from the first-person perspective Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films scored by Robin Coudert Category:French films Category:French remakes of American films Category:French slasher films Category:French horror thriller films Category:Horror film remakes Category:Mannequins in films Category:Relativity Media films Category:English-language French films ","title":"Maniac (2012 film)"},{"id":"35939115","text":"Panicum amarum is a species of grass known by the common name bitter panicum.

During her time in Germany she was largely associated with the theatrical producer/director Max Reinhardt and acted in plays by such writers as Christian Friedrich Hebbel, Friedrich Schiller, William Shakespeare, Aeschylus, and Ferdinand Bruckner. Between 1916 and 1932 Fein appeared in at least twenty-three German films working with pioneer movie directors Robert Wiene, Uwe Jens Krafft, Hanna Henning, Rochus Gliese, Walter Schmidthässler, Frederic Zelnik, Albert Lastmann, Paul Leni, Rudolf Walther- Fein, Michael Curtiz, Rudolf Meinert, and Fritz Friedmann-Frederich. Following the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938, Fein fled to the Netherlands and in 1941 found refuge for the duration of the war in Switzerland. Fein remained active on stage over the balance of her life in her adopted Switzerland and abroad until shortly before her death. ==Early life and family== Fein was born in Vienna to a Jewish family that reportedly at some point converted to Catholicism. She was the daughter of Fanny Süssermann and Otto Fein, editor of the Neue Freie Presse, and the older sister of Franz Fein, an author and translator of American novels. Maria Fein married the German actor Theodor Becker with whom she had two daughters, Thea and actress Maria Becker. Fein’s marriage to Becker ended in divorce in the mid-1930s after a long separation.Maria Fein, Institut für Theaterwissenschaft Retrieved August 29, 2014Maria Fein, Steffi-Line.de Retrieved August 29, 2014Jacobsohn, Siegfried, 2005, p. 521 - Gesammelte Schriften 1900-1926 Retrieved August 14, 2014Weniger, Kay, 2011, p. 165 - Es wird im Leben dir mehr genommen als gegeben ... Lexikon der aus Deutschland und Österreich emigrierten Filmschaffenden 1933 bis 1945 Retrieved August 14, 2014 Fein studied at the Academy for Music and Performing Arts in Vienna from 1909 to 1911 and made her professional debut at the National Theatre Mannheim, where she rose to play the title role in Hebbel's tragedy, Judith. ==Stage career== Over the next several seasons Fein appeared at the Royal Theater, Dresden, the Royal Theatre, Berlin and the Deutsches Theater, Berlin. Under the direction of Max Reinhardt, in October 1915 she played the title role in the Deutsches' production of Schiller's Maria Stuart. She continued in Berlin under Reinhardt’s directing in such parts as Ariel in Shakespeare's The Tempest at the Volksbühne, Elektra in Aeschylus' The Oresteia, Regan in Shakespeare's King Lear, both staged at the Großes Schauspielhaus, and in 1919 returned to the Deutsches playing Rebekka in Jaákobs Traum by Richard Beer-Hofmann.Jaákobs Traum, The Guide to World Drama, - 4 wall.com Retrieved August 27, 2014 Fein joined the Vereinigte Bühnen, Breslau for the 1921–1922 season and, between 1924 and 1926, performed at the Theater in der Josefstadt, Vienna, where in 1924 she played Lady Milford in Schiller's Kabale und Liebe. At the Deutsches she was Kudelka in the world premiere of Bruckner's Die Straf, staged by Heinz Hilpert. After her expulsion from the Ministry of Arts in 1935, Fein left for Vienna, where she performed at various theatres including the Burgtheater and Urania. At the latter venue appeared as Jocasta in Jean Cocteau's The Infernal Machine. ==Film== Fein’s film work in Berlin overwhelmingly occurred between 1916 and 1919; she appeared in just a handful of films after 1920. She began with the brothers Robert and Conrad Wiene in Der Mann im Spiegel and Das Leben ein Traum and went on to appear in mostly melodramas and the occasional comedy over the following several years. Her final film and only talkie was Frederica, a 1932 adaptation of the book by and Fritz Löhner-Beda.Maria Fein, Internet Movie Database Retrieved August 30, 2014 ==Later career== After Nazi annexation of Austria, Fein appeared on stage in the Netherlands, France and Switzerland. Under the direction of Leopold Lindtberg, Fein appeared at the Schauspielhaus Zürich as Anisja in Leon Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness. Fein later returned to France, where she was detained until Maria Becker, by then a resident of Zurich, was able to secure her safe passage to Switzerland. Over the remainder of the war years Fein was active in Zurich giving evening recitations. In 1945 Fein rejoined the ensemble of actors at the Schauspielhaus playing such characters roles as Ranjewskaja in Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, Sichle in the German language premiere of Paul Claudel's The Humiliation of the Father, a mother in Oscar Wilde's A Woman of No Importance, and the title role in Franz Grillparzer's Medea. In 1948 Fein toured Switzerland with Heinz Woester in their adaptation of Somerset Maugham's Theatre, and the following year played Clytemnestra to the title role of Maria Becker in Jean Giraudoux's Électre. In a subsequent Swiss tour Fein played the title role in George Bernard Shaw's Mrs. Warren's Profession and at the Lucerne Festival revived her role as Jocasta in The Infernal Machine. In 1951 Fein returned to Berlin to perform for the first time since the Nazi era. At the Schloss Charlottenburg she played Weisheit in Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Das Salzburger große Welttheater. During the early 1950s Fein toured England, France and Switzerland giving recitations and lectures and later appeared on BBC Radio in performances that included a 1956 radio play presenting an English-language adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's anti-war play, Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder.

As a young teenager, she used to sprint for Berkshire in the under-16 squad. She has a younger brother, actor Josh Bowman who starred in the ABC series, Revenge. Before acting, Bowman aspired to be a television presenter. ==Career== Bowman's first break was her role on the BBC teen soap short, The Cut. She is best known for her role as Queen Bee Maddie Morrison on the Channel 4 British soap opera Hollyoaks. Bowman joined the Hollyoaks cast in summer 2011, as part of a group of new sixth-form students, to mixed reactions from the viewers. Bowman has described her character as a \\"psychopath\\" and confessed that she loves playing Maddie because it is fun to play a bitch. Bowman has insisted that she is nothing like Maddie in real life, noting that her character is \\"An absolute nightmare!\\" and has admitted that she finds it quite offensive when people assume they are alike. Bowman recently praised Maddie for setting a good example for teenage girls, noting that she should be a role model for young girls who are not ready to lose their virginity. The Hollyoaks storyline, in early 2012, saw her character impose a three-month sex ban on her boyfriend, Callum Kane, until she felt ready to sleep with him. Bowman has described her experience at Hollyoaks as \\"Very busy but a lot of fun.\\" and added \\"I'm loving it. We all get on really, really well here and tend to form bonds quite quickly.\\" She has noted that she is particularly close to fellow Hollyoaks actor Lucy Dixon, with whom she used to share a flat, saying \\"We do have a great dynamic and spend lots of time together. It happened very quickly. We had no time to get to know everyone, we did our casting together and we said: ‘Let’s move in.’ It’s so special to find someone you really gel with when you’re away from home.\\" Bowman has also stated that she is close friends with Steven Roberts who plays her on screen best friend George Smith. In 2012, Bowman was nominated for the 'Sexiest female' award at the British Soap Awards but lost out to Coronation Street actress, Michelle Keegan.

Elections to the Wigan council were held on Thursday, 5 May 1988, with one third of the seats up for election as well as an extra vacancy in Beech Hill. Following the previous election, two by-elections had taken place, with the Labour Party successfully defending their seats in Ince and Newtown. This year's election seen an improvement in participation, with all wards fought and five parties contesting in some form, by way of the Greens fielding their first ever slate of four candidates and the return of long-time Communist contender H. Kedward in Leigh Central. Despite this, the number of candidates contesting actually fell by five from the previous year's 64, as the turbulent new merger of the old SDP-Liberal Alliance, Social and Liberal Democrats, fielded just half the number of candidates they'd managed in 1987 and, at 11, the lowest since 1980. This was reflected by the results on the night as the SLD suffered a large drop in their vote, returning them to third place behind the Conservatives and reducing their vote total to four figure for the first time since the aforementioned 1980 election. The overwhelming beneficiary of SLD losses were the Labour, helping their vote share hit a record high of 68.6% and the highest vote figure gained - beyond the anomaly of 1979 - since the council's creation. Seat wise, Labour made two gains of the night, one in the SLD-Labour marginal of Aspull-Standish and the other in the more significant SLD bastion of Langtree, which until this point had only elected SLD candidates, where Labour managed to equal SLD votes and draw the larger straw.

It was also released as a single. It has been covered by a number of artists, including Bangs, Everclear and Gilby Clarke. ==Lyrics and music== \\"Southern Girls\\" was in Cheap Trick's repertoire by September 1975, when it was included on a demo the band made at Ardent Studios in Memphis, which also included \\"Come On, Come On,\\" \\"Taxman\\" and the still unreleased \\"Fan Club.\\" Authors Mike Hayes and Ken Sharp detect influences on the song from The Beach Boys and The Yardbirds. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine concurs with the Beach Boys influence, calling it a \\"'California Girls' homage\\". UPI's Bruce Meyer also notes that it cops \\"some Beach Boys licks and harmonies.\\" Nielsen compared the drum beat of the song to a \\"glam style Gary Glitter rhythm. Bun E. Carlos' drumming on the song has been praised by critics, and it is one of Carlos' favorite Cheap Trick songs. For example, author John M. Borack claims that Carlos' drumming \\"propels this poppy, peppy treat straight into the stratosphere. Nielsen also claims that one of the beauties of the song is that it only uses a few chords. The lyrics were inspired by women the band met in Canada, north of their Illinois roots; it is actually about girls from Southern Canada. However, using the phrase \\"Southern Canadian Girls\\" in the hook didn't sound good to Nielsen, so he just left it as \\"Southern Girls.\\" The single version of \\"Southern Girls\\" differed from the album version in using a \\"repeat-fade ending\\", which producer Tom Werman liked better than the album approach. In The Rough Guide to Rock, critic Jonathan Swift called \\"Southern Girls\\" a \\"classic,\\" as did Allmusic's Erlewine. Author Scott Miller called it \\"a treasure.\\" CD Review stated that in \\"Southern Girls\\" Cheap Trick \\"knew how to wrap winning hooks around subversive romantic notions that made them sound punk credible.\\" Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic called \\"Southern Girls\\" In Color's \\"most infectious pop song.\\" Andrew McGinn of Springfield News-Sun claimed that \\"it doesn't get any catchier than 'Southern Girls.'\\" ==Other appearances== Although \\"Southern Girls\\" was included in the Budokan concerts, the live version was not included on the original 1979 release of Cheap Trick at Budokan, but it was later included on the 1994 live album Budokan II. It was later included on 1998's At Budokan: The Complete Concert and the 30th anniversary version of Cheap Trick at Budokan, released in 2009. which also included the performance of the song on DVD. SPIN claimed that while the live version does not \\"one-up the essentially perfect studio original,\\" it does \\"thunder gorgeously.\\" The song has been included on several Cheap Trick compilation albums, including Sex, America, Cheap Trick, Authorized Greatest Hits and The Essential Cheap Trick. It has also been included on several multi-artist power pop compilations. ==Covers== Bangs covered \\"Southern Girls\\" on their 2000 album Sweet Revenge. CMJ described their version as \\"ghostly\\" and noted that \\"in less restrictive times this could have been their \\"Crimson and Clover.\\" J.M. Lim of the Associated Press called it \\"an entrancing mid-tempo turn\\" which helps \\"distinguish 'Sweet Revenge' from the usual garage bash set.\\" Gilby Clarke also covered the song in 2000, on Cheap Dream: A Tribute to Cheap Trick. Everclear covered \\"Southern Girls\\" on their 2008 album The Vegas Years. Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the Everclear version as a \\"lead-footed boogie.\\" The Decemberists played \\"Southern Girls\\" to close their March 27, 2007 show with a solo performance by Colin Meloy on acoustic guitar. The show was broadcast live on 88.5 WXPN FM in Upper Darby, PA. Mike Doughty covered the song on his 2012 album The Flip Is Another Honey. According to Cheap Trick lead singer Robin Zander, at one point Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings were considering having Nelson perform \\"Southern Girls\\" for the 1980 movie Urban Cowboy, but that didn't materialize. ==References * Category:Cheap Trick songs Category:1977 singles Category:Songs written by Rick Nielsen Category:Songs written by Tom Petersson Category:Song recordings produced by Tom Werman Category:Everclear (band) songs Category:1977 songs Category:Epic Records singles ","title":"Southern Girls"},{"id":"35939297","text":"Steadfast Benjamin (German:Der standhafte Benjamin) is a 1917 German silent comedy film directed by Robert Wiene and starring Arnold Rieck, Guido Herzfeld and Martha Altenberg. ==Plot== After inheriting a large sum of money, a shoe store worker has to continue in his job due to his ten-year contract, but lives the high life each night.Jung & Schatzberg p.28 ==Cast== * Arnold Rieck * Guido Herzfeld * Magda Madeleine * Agda Nilsson * Emil Rameau ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Jung, Uli & Schatzberg, Walter.

The film follows the story of Frank, a gay teenager in the 80's who runs away from his home to start a new life and later his struggle against the recently discovered AIDS. ==Plot== Gay teenager, Frank (Layke Anderson) is part of a typical bourgeois family in Luxembourg in 1984. For unknown reasons, he decides to run away with his best friend, Rita. They settle in Amsterdam, where Frank starts enjoying life. When Rita leaves with her boyfriend, Frank is left with nowhere to go. He goes to a gay cabaret bar called the \\"House of Boys\\" in which young, attractive men dance and provide sexual services for older men. The place is run by the mysterious performer and drag queen Madame (Udo Kier), who takes Frank in and employs him. In the club he meets Angelo, who aspires to transition from male to female, and raises funds for her gender reassignment surgery; and Jake (Benn Northover), a veteran performer and favorite of customers, who considers himself to be straight. Frank falls in love with him, but struggles with Jake's claim of heterosexuality in light of his male-hustler lifestyle. Jake's long time girlfriend steals his money and uses it to have an abortion. He breaks up with her and finds comfort in Frank's arms. They start a relationship which for both seems to transcend superficial sex into love. Soon Jake begins to fall ill, faints, and develops spots on his skin. He's diagnosed with AIDS. Meanwhile, Europe sees the start of the AIDS epidemic. The remainder of the film chronicles Jake's decline and eventual death while the \\"House of Boys\\" closes. The closing scenes show Frank travelling to Morocco to scatter Jake's ashes over the sea. ==Critical reception== The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 57% based on reviews from 7 critics, with a rating average of 6.4 out of 10. Critics agreed the film starts slow but later develops into a deeper story.

Slavery continued in the Danish West Indies until July, 1848, when all unfree people in Danish lands were emancipated. == Danish slave trade during the Viking Age == During the Viking Age, thralls (Norse slaves) were an important part of the economy and one of the main reasons for the raids on England where slaves were captured. This practice was abolished once Denmark became Christian in the 10th century. == Danish transatlantic slave trade == Trading African slaves was part of the transatlantic slave trade by Denmark- Norway around 1671, when the Danish West India Company was chartered until 1 January 1803 when the 1792 law to abolish the slave trade came into effect. However, an illegal trade in enslaved Africans continued. Slavery in the Danish West Indies continued until 3 July 1848 when slaves gathered at Frederiksted and demanded their freedom. Fearing a revolt Danish Governor Peter von Scholten issued a proclamation that \\"all unfree in the Danish West Indies are from today emancipated.\\" As of 1778, it was estimated annually Dano-Norwegians shipped approximately 3,000 African slaves to the Danish West Indies. During the 1720s, many of these African slaves were sourced from the Akan-region Akwamu, Ga-Adangbe in present-day Ghana, with a large number taken to the island of St Jan (now Saint John in the U.S. Virgin Islands) promptly rebelling and attempting to found an Akwamu-led nation, including one of its leaders Breffu. The country's ships transported approximately 100,000 African slaves, about 2% of the total number in the early 19th century. ==See also== * Danish West Indies slavery * Danish Africa Company * Danish West India Company * Danish Gold Coast * Dane gun * Fort Christiansborg ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Jensen, Niklas Thode; Simonsen, Gunvor. \\"Introduction: The historiography of slavery in the Danish-Norwegian West Indies, c. 1950-2016.\\" Scandinavian Journal of History Sep-Dec2016, Vol. 41 Issue 4/5, p475-494.

On inducting with his battalion at Zimithang in 2003, Colonel Misra, as the Commanding Officer of the 26 RAJPUT, noticed several aspects that impacted operational and administrative imperatives of his battalion, so he decided to raise his concerns with his brigade headquarters. These issues pertained to crumbling defences; the poor state of habitat of his troops; deficiency of mechanical transport affecting operational efficiency; excessive commitment of battalion manpower on sundry guards and duties which negated his capacity to maintain mandated operational reserves; supply of inferior quality of ration to his men besides, deduction of troops' ration at the Supply Depot and continual demand on regimental and public funds of his battalion, etc. To address these issues on priority, he commenced writing to his immediate superior, not realizing that doing his duty would lead to a court martial. A general court martial was conducted wherein false complaints were lodged against him through a subordinate of his, which eventually led to his court martial in 2005. Col. Avijit Misra was not allowed to defend himself against these charges on purpose, and at the end of a speedy trial was convicted and sentenced to be cashiered and suffer one year of rigorous imprisonment. On being released from prison in 2006, desolate and penniless, he took it upon himself to fight for his honour. In 2007, he met the noted human rights activist and lawyer Ms Maitrayee Trivedi Dasgupta, who took up his cause pro bono. == Acquittal by Armed Forces Tribunal and reinstatement as colonel == The case created national media attention, and in a landmark judgement, the Kolkata Bench of the Armed Forces Tribunal overturned the verdict of the court martial and ruled on 17 April 2012 that Col.

In 1637 Whipple received a grant of land in Dorchester near the Indian lands (his land was near modern day Butler Street near the current Dorchester-Milton Lower Mills Industrial District bordering Phillips Creeke and the Neponset River). At some point in the late 1630s Whipple married a woman named Sarah (of unknown origin), and no record of their marriage is known to exist, and Sarah's gravestone states that she was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1624 (despite this pre-dating the founding of the town).https://whipple.org/charles/johnandsarah/ In 1641 Sarah Whipple joined the First Parish Church of Dorchester (John Whipple presumably joined earlier), and in 1650 Sarah joined a petition by the women of Dorchester to allow Alice Tilly to work as a midwife.2043: RECORDS: GENERAL COURT http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ArchivesSearch/RevolutionarySearch.aspx For at least 17 years in Dorchester, the Whipples raised a large family in Dorchester, where eight of his 11 children were baptized.

In February 1665 he was given a lot in a division of lands, and the following year took an oath of allegiance in Providence. In 1666 he served as a deputy to the General Assembly, a position he held for seven of the next 11 years. In 1669 and again in 1670 he was paid for allowing the Providence Town Council to meet at his house, probably referring to his tavern for which he was later granted a license in 1674.

He is primarily known for his portrait paintings, which are held in several North American museum collections. He should not be confused with John Bradley of Keighley, Yorkshire (1787–1844), British artist and drawing-master to the Brontës, or John Bradley of Pall Mall, London (1786–1843), a printmaker and portraitist.See discussion of the various John Bradleys at ArtUK - Art Detective ==Career== John Bradley's origin is documented through the inscription, \\"Drawn by I. Bradley from Great Britton\\", found on the reverse of each of five portraits of Totten family members. Bradley's birth and death dates have not been discovered, nor is there evidence of any formal education as an artist. The use of distemper as a medium for some of his portraits may suggest that he also worked as a decorative or commercial painter as well as a portraitist. Possible evidence of the artist's early career expanded with the discovery in 2005 of Painting of a Prize Cow in a Field, signed \\"Drawn by I Bradley, Honington, Suffolk 1827\\", as well as a pair of children's portraits, signed \\"I. Bradley, Limner, Suffolk 1830\\" that were consigned to Bonhams Ipswich. The earliest paintings by Bradley in U.S. collections, including The Cellist, painted in 1832, may have been painted in Britain. By the end of 1832, he was evidently working on Staten Island, where he painted Asher Androvette holding a copy of the 29 November 1832 issue of The New York and Richmond County Free Press. A record of someone named John Bradley as a \\"deranged\\" resident of Sailors' Snug Harbor, a Staten Island home for retired seamen, may indicate that he had at least one family member in the area. Listings in the New York City directories for the period 1836 through 1847 show John Bradley as a portrait painter, and sometimes a miniature painter as well, at three different locations near present-day Houston Street in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. From 1836 to 1837 he was at 56 Hammersley Street; from 1837 to 1844 he was 128 Spring Street; and from 1844 to 1847 he was listed at 134 Spring Street. These addresses are inscribed on some of Bradley's paintings and have been used to establish their dates of creation. There are no known works or any other evidence that John Bradley's career continued after 1847. ==Paintings== Among John Bradley's best known works are The Cellist, 1832 (in The Phillips Collection), Little Girl in Lavender, ca. 1840 (in the National Gallery of Art), and portraits of Staten Island residents who were members of the Totten, Cole, and Ellis families, painted in the 1830s (in the Staten Island Historical Society). Emma Homan, a portrait of a young child painted ca. 1844, is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Bradley is often grouped with naïve, itinerant, or folk artists. His work was carefully composed and richly detailed, and directory listings for New York City indicate he made his living as a professional artist. Many of his portraits have a waist-length format, but those depicting children, or adults with musical instruments, show the full length of subjects who are either seated or standing. Mille Farm, 1835 (in the Staten Island Museum, New York), a Staten Island scene with animals in the foreground, is a rare example of a landscape signed by Bradley. Depictions of animals appear in a number of Bradley's works. Emma Homan and Little Girl in Lavender feature domestic cats, while farm animals are seen in Mille Farm, as well as the earlier English painting Painting of a Prize Cow in a Field. In Young Boy Feeding Rabbits, 1831 (present location unknown) the animals hold a central place in the composition. Bradley's portraits have been noted for their extraordinary attention to personal attributes that reveal the characters of his sitters. In addition to children with pets or adult musicians with legible sheet music, other works that feature notable accoutrements are Boy with Sinumbra Lamp (private collection) and John Totten, who is shown with drafting instruments. Bradley's works often show rich, deep colors, such as reds for draperies and greens for his representations of floor and surface coverings. His children's portraits, in particular, show bold color choices. He often used light outlines to highlight the contours of his subjects, giving an appearance that is clearly delineated rather than finely modeled. His portraits of John Totten and Ann Cole Totten were stolen from the museum of the Staten Island Historical Society in 1970. John Totten was quickly recovered, but the companion portrait remains missing.Staten Island Historical Society, catalog numbers P01.0035 and P01.0036. Some paintings that had once been attributed to John Bradley were later identified as the work of Ammi Phillips. ==References * Bradley portraits in the Staten Island Historical Society Online Collections Database * Bradley portrait, Metropolitan Museum of Art * John Bradley, Folk Artist, Update by Milton Trexler * John Bradley, The Cellist, The Phillips Collection Category:19th- century American painters Category:American male painters Category:19th- century British painters Category:British male painters Category:Naïve painters Category:American portrait painters Category:British portrait painters Category:Artists from New York (state) Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:British emigrants to the United States ","title":"John Bradley (artist)"},{"id":"35939651","text":"Ranjit Gupta may refer to: * Ranjit Kumar Gupta - Kolkata police commissioner, who played an important role during the Naxalite movement * Ranajit Gupta – ICS officer, chief secretary of West Bengal, elder brother of Indrajit Gupta * Ranjit Gupta (sports administrator) – joint secretary of Indian Football Association * Ranjit Gupta (diplomat) - India's Ambassador to Yemen, Venezuela, Sultanate of Oman, Thailand, Spain and Head of Office in Taiwan ","title":"Ranjit Gupta"},{"id":"35939659","text":"The Virginia Beach Airport is a private civilian airfield located in Pungo, Virginia, approximately South-East of Virginia Beach, Virginia.

The facilities include an Art Deco main building, one grass landing strip, a checkered water tower, and a large number of medium-size hangars.

These intentions fairly quickly did not pan out, and so much of the land was returned to agriculture. The runway did remain active, and was used for crop dusting planes and banner towing planes. In the early 2000s, the founder of the Military Aviation Museum, Gerald \\"Jerry\\" Yagen, purchased the property as a home for his collection of warbirds, and began planning the creation of the Museum. == External links == * VA Beach Airport * FAA Information Category:Transportation in Virginia Beach, Virginia Category:Airports in Virginia Category:1969 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Virginia Beach Airport"},{"id":"35939668","text":"Jackie Lee \\"Jack\\" Turner (June 29, 1930 – October 5, 2014) was an American basketball player for the New York Knicks in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

She is often associated with the group of Language poets from her days living in San Francisco in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but her work is also considered central to the avant garde black aesthetic developing after the Civil Rights Movement and Black Arts Movement. Through the 1990s and 2000s, Hunt worked with several non- profits that encourage black philanthropy for black communities and causes. From 1999 to 2010, she was executive director of the 21st Century Foundation located in Harlem. Currently, she is writing and teaching at Wesleyan University. == Biography == Hunt was born in Manhattan to working-class parents. Her father, Thomas Edward Hunt (b. 1914), was a mail carrier and worked for the MTA; mother, Daphne Lindsey Hunt (b. 1918), who was blind, worked as a transcriptionist for the city of New York. Her older sister, Fern Hunt (b. 1948), holds a PhD from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University (1978), and works as a mathematician at the Computing & Applied Mathematics Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\\"Fern Y. Hunt: Mathematician of the African Diaspora\\" In a 2000 panel for the Poetry Society of America, Hunt said, \\"I come from a family of acute social observers, natural mimics and shrewd survivors. These traits, I've come to realize, go together, where observation has evolved to the point that we were situationally multilingual, able to speak several vernaculars, meaning always at least doubled, filling the form while tunneling under the wall.\\" Hunt attended University of Vermont - where she studied the philosophy of language, anthropology and folklore — and received in 1980 a BA in English from San Francisco State University, where she studied poetry with Kathleen Fraser and Michael Palmer.Al Filreis’s announcement of Hunt as CPCW Fellow During her time in the Bay Area in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hunt was an active part of the poetry scene, particularly the group of so-called Language poets who held readings at The Grand Piano, a coffeehouse at 1607 Haight Street in San Francisco. She read as part of the series with Alan Bernheimer and Rodger Kamenetz on June 13, 1978, and then with Steve Lavoie on July 21, 1979.The Grand Piano Project In 1981, Hunt moved back to New York City, carrying with her the energy and taste for public talks and social gatherings about poetry so endemic to the San Francisco area scene. From 1985 to 1999 she worked as senior program officer and donor advisor at the New World Foundation, a national foundation supporting social justice in New York City. After moving back to New York, Hunt quickly became immersed in the avant garde jazz scene and thought she might do music writing for a living. Here is where she met her husband, the saxophonist Marty Ehrlich, in 1983. During the late 1980s, Hunt served on the board of directors for the Segue Foundation, an arts group that founded Roof Books, funded arts programs in prisons, and sponsored many artists' individual projects. Since 1976, Roof Books \\"has produced over 100 titles of contemporary poetry and criticism, several of which are now esteemed as classics of experimental literature. In the late 1970s/early 80s, Segue published the poetry journal Roof and distributed the critical journal L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E with 500 other related literary titles.\\"The Segue Foundation With the filmmakers Abigail Child and Henry Hill and the dancer Sally Silvers, Hunt restored an abandoned building into an artists' living, studio and performance space. The project was completed in 1988 and the space sponsored artists until 2002. According to the foundation’s website, \\"In 1987, SEGUE sponsored the renovation of an abandoned city-owned property at 303 East 8th Street into 12 artist live/work co-ops and a 1200 sq. ft. performance space, the only successfully completed Manhattan artist housing project of the eighties.\\" == Poetic works== While living in the Bay Area in the late 1970s, Hunt regularly attended poetry readings and associated with many of the writers now linked with the Language poetry school of experimental writers. This affiliation eventually led to a few of her poems being included in Ron Silliman’s Language poetry anthology, In the American Tree, along with some Language poetry-related publications like Vanishing Cab (Cummings).Allison Cummings, “Public Subjects\\" Her best known work, Arcade (1996), is a collaboration with the visual artist Alison Saar that engages such issues as women’s self-image, race in the media, surrealism, love, city life, and loss, all through an experimental poetic that allows the reader to see the vocabularies that convey and thus shape these themes. Her other writings include Local History (1993) and Piece Logic (2002), and numerous contributions to literary periodicals such as boundary 2, tripwire and Poetics Journal. Hunt’s work is notable for its political engagement. As James Sherry wrote in his paper during the “Poetry and Politics” panel October 26, 2000, at the Poetry Society of America, Hunt \\"has a somewhat more pragmatic view of poetry and politics. Conditions dictate poetical and political attitudes.\\"“Poetry and Politics”, Poetry Society of America, 2000 Panel via Al Young’s website. In other words, her poetry engages the political moment by objectifying its language and asking the reader to make meaning of that language. Poetic engagement with politics should, Hunt writes in the same panel, produce not pronouncements of policy positions but \\"poetry that extends beyond the boundaries of the self, to the open question of the possible, the construction of a society that promotes the ‘best’ (free, democratic, just, flexibly dialectic, etc.) in our human natures.\\" == Criticism and non- fiction== Drawing on years of journal writing, her non-fiction prose work is marked by a blending of memoir, critical theory, political activism, and literary criticism. Her most widely quoted work is \\"Notes on an Oppositional Poetics\\" from the influential 1990 collection, The Politics of Poetic Form, edited by Charles Bernstein and published by Roof Books. She defines oppositional poetics as \\"a field of related projects which have moved beyond the speculation of skepticism to a critically active stance against forms of domination. By oppositional, I intend, generously, dissident cultures as well as ‘marginalized’ cultures, cutting across class, race and gender.\\"\\"Notes for an Oppositional Poetics\\", in The Politics of Poetic Form. Ed. Charles Bernstein. New York: Roof Books, 1990. 198. Her notion of an \\"oppositional poetics\\" has been influential in the direction of thought about the confluence of radial aesthetics and political concerns. == Bibliography ==  Poetry books and chapbooks * Time Slips Right Before the Eyes (New York, Belladonna Chapbooks, 2006) * Piece Logic (Durham, North Carolina, Carolina Wren Press, 2002) * Arcade with prints by Alison Saar (Berkeley, California, Kelsey Street Press, 1996) * Local History (New York, ROOF Books, 1993, reprinted 2003)  Poetry in anthologies * Nineteen Lines: A Drawing Center Writing Anthology (New York, ROOF Books, Lytle Shaw, editor, 2007) * Gathering Ground: A Reader Celebrating Ten Years of Cave Canem (New York, Cave Canem, Toi Derricotte, Cornelius Eady, editors, 2006) * Cave Canem Anthology 2004 (New York, Cave Canem, Douglass Kearney, editor, 2004) * Moving Borders, Three Decades of Innovative Writing By Women (Jersey City, New Jersey, Talisman House, Mary Margaret Sloan, editor, 1998) * Anthology of Love Poetry by Women Poets (London, UK, Wendy Mulford, editor, Virago Press 1990) * Boundary 2 “43 Poets” (Binghamton, New York, Charles Bernstein, editor, 1984 * In the American Tree (Orono, Maine, Ron Silliman, editor, 1983)  Poetry in selected magazines * Mixed Blood (University Park, PA, Cecil Giscombe, William Harris, editors, 2004) * Nocturnes (Berkeley, California, Nocturnes, 2002) * Conjunctions (Annandale, New York, Brad Morrow, editor, Bard College, 2001) * BOMB: Quarterly of Arts and Culture (New York, BOMB, 1997) * Iowa Poetry Review (1996). * Pessimistic Labor 2 (Los Angeles, CA, Michael Amnasan, editor, 1987) * Vanishing Cab 5 (San Francisco, CA, Jerry Estrin, editor, 1982) * Vanishing Cab 4 (San Francisco, CA Jerry Estrin, editor 1981)  Selected non-fiction prose * \\"My Life with Cars\\".

The Ramoshis retreated to the village at the foot of Talwargera and began operating from behind its mud wall. Many Rajputs fell in this daring attack. But Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung did not stop there. He sent Rao Dalpat Bundela to another mound which was taken and the Ramoshis fled to the village of Dhedpura, where he was ambushed. But Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung held his position. A few days afterwards Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung made a strategic move and captured the wells from where the Ramoshis used to draw their water. He attacked Talwargera on April 27 taking the village. ==Siege== The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb leads his final expedition (1705). With the arrival of Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung the Ramoshis were now hard pressed. The siege weapons were pushed forward to the fort, and on the day appointed for the assault, Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb mounted his horse to take part therein, and took his position at a cannon-shot distance from the fort. The enemy was overpowered, and some positions were captured. Being greatly dispirited, Pedda Pidia Nayak, commander of the fort, directed his people to take their wives and children, their jewels, and whatever they could carry, and after setting fire to the temple and other buildings, they went out from another gate, and by some outlets which had been prepared for such an occasion, they made their way to the Maratha army, in parties, in the dark of night. They then fled with the Marathas. The conflagration in the fort and the cessation of the firing made the Mughals aware of their flight. A party of men entered, and found only disabled and wounded persons who were unable to fly. On the 14th Muharram, the Mughal Army took possession of the place after a siege of three months. The name Wagingera was changed to Fort Rahman Bakhsh. The Mughal Army then retired to pass the rainy season at Deogaon, three or four kos from the River Krishna. Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb bestowed on Asaf Jah I was also gifted a female elephant and now aged 20 he was bestowed with the title of \\"Chin Kilich Khan\\" (boy swordsman) for surviving an attack that blew off three of his horse's legs during the Siege of Wagingera Fort. For fighting on and capturing the fort he was raised to rank of 5000 horse and awarded 15 million dams, a jeweled sabre and a third elephant. ==Aftermath== A plaque embedded on the wall to the entrance of the fort reads in Persian; \\\\- signifying the fall of the fort in 1705. By now the elderly Emperor was exhausted and returned to Ahmednagar on January 31, 1706. The siege of Wagingera would be his last battle.

The astronomer and mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus worked here as a canon (1512–16 and 1522–43). He wrote his epochal work, De revolutionibus orbium cœlestium in Frombork.J R Ravetz Plate, Nicolaus Copernicus 1473-1543 in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, London 1602, p. 7 link Shortly after its 1543 publication, Copernicus died there and was buried in the cathedral where his grave was thought to have been found by archaeologists in 2005. This was subsequently confirmed in November 2008 by the publication of the results of DNA tests on fragments of bone and hair found on the skeleton; hair that matched two strands of hair which belonged to Copernicus and are currently located in Uppsala University.Copernicus skeleton identified The Guardian (November 22, 2008) In the northwest corner of the cathedral grounds is Copernicus' tower, and in the southwest corner an octagonal building with a square bell tower and a small planetarium and a Foucault's pendulum. The city suffered destruction during the Polish–Swedish wars. Between 1626 and 1635 it was occupied by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden who looted the cathedral and removed many cultural artefacts, including Copernicus' manuscripts to Sweden. The town and cathedral were badly damaged in World War II. After the war the cathedral was meticulously reconstructed. == See also == * Castles in Poland ==References *History and photos of the Frombork cathedral Category:Frombork Category:Basilica churches in Poland Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Poland Category:Gothic architecture in Poland Category:Churches in Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship Category:Hall churches ","title":"Archcathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Andrew, Frombork"},{"id":"35939802","text":"Peripsocus alboguttatus is a species of Psocoptera from Peripsocidae family that can be found in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Madeira, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.Distribution The species are brown coloured.Description and habitat == References == Category:Peripsocidae Category:Insects described in 1823 Category:Psocoptera of Europe ","title":"Peripsocus alboguttatus"},{"id":"35939811","text":"John W. \\"Fozzie\\" Miller is a retired United States Navy Vice Admiral who last served as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command/Commander, U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Manama, Bahrain. Prior to assuming the duties of NAVCENT/C5F, Miller was special assistant to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Operations, Plans, and Strategy (N3/N5) in Washington, D.C.. He has also served as NAVCENT deputy commander. ==Biography== Early life He graduated from the Naval War College and received a master's degree in International Relations from Salve Regina University. Military career He was commissioned an Ensign upon graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1979, and received his Naval Flight Officer designation in 1980, after which he reported to VF-101 for training in the F-14A Tomcat. His sea duty includes tours as a division officer in VF-31; maintenance officer at VF-84; and six command tours: VF-142; VF-101; USS Dubuque; USS Juneau; USS Constellation, as her final commanding officer; and USS John F. Kennedy. As a flag officer, Miller also commanded Carrier Strike Group 11. Ashore, he has served as an instructor at VF-101; leadership section head at the Naval Academy; a White House Fellowship as special assistant to the NASA Administrator; and aviation commander assignment officer at the Bureau of Naval Personnel. Since being promoted to flag rank, Miller has had particular focus on the CENTCOM area of responsibility, serving as deputy commander of NAVCENT/Fifth Fleet; deputy director, Strategy, Plans, and Policy (J5); and as CENTCOM chief of staff. He has also commanded the US Navy Strike and Air Warfare Center. Retirement and Later Work Miller was named to the position of Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans, Policy, and Operations (N3/N5) in March 2014. However, his planned successor was unable to assume the Commander Fifth Fleet/Naval Forces Central Command role due to being under investigation as part of the Fat Leonard scandal, one of several flag officers not involved in the scandal who had transfers and promotions delayed due to the investigations. Miller retired from the Navy in 2015. Since retirement, he was worked with the Middle East Institute and the American Enterprise Institute.

Kuhl took part in the robbery of a mail stage wagon in Jarbidge, Nevada, US; the driver, Fred M. Searcy, was killed. The incident became a myth: \\"Staging a Robbery Without a Coach\\". While most of the evidence against him was circumstantial, a bloody palm print on an envelope led to Kuhl's conviction. Kuhl's trial, which began in September 1917, was noted to be the first time palm prints were used as evidence in a U.S. courtroom. State v. Kuhl also set the precedent that palm prints were as valid as fingerprints in criminal cases for identifying individuals. ==Biography== Ben Kuhl was from Michigan. In 1903, he was jailed in Marysville, California for petty larceny, and had also been sentenced to do 1 to 10 years in Oregon for horse theft. Kuhl arrived in Lander County, Nevada in 1916 and lived in a tent with two other drifters, Ed Beck and Billy McGraw. He worked as a cook at the OK Mine for about a month before he was fired for attempting to jump another man's mining claim. He was arrested for trespassing in Jarbidge. The Jarbidge Stage Robbery occurred on December 5, 1916, just before 6:30 PM. The mail wagon from Three Creek, Idaho, drawn by two horses, was ambushed. Searcy was killed by a .44 caliber slug to the head, and about $3,000 was stolen. While the money was never recovered, almost fifty pieces of evidence were collected. Kuhl, Beck, McGraw, and another acquaintance, B.E. Jennings, were caught soon after the incident occurred. Most of the evidence against Kuhl was circumstantial. However, there was a bloody palm print on a letter from the wagon's mail pouch; and Kuhl became the first American convicted of murder based on a palm print. His death sentence was commuted to life in prison at the Nevada State Prison in Carson City, Nevada, but he was paroled on May 7, 1945. Kuhl was slender and nearly tall; he had light blue eyes. His wife, Minnier (nicknamed \\"Minnie\\"), and a son lived in Salt Lake City, Utah; she divorced Kuhl after the conviction. His mother lived in Kalamazoo, Michigan; his father in Walla Walla, Washington. Kuhl is thought to have died of pneumonia or tuberculosis in northern California, possibly Sacramento or San Francisco, within 6 to 12 months of his release. ==References * Ben E.

In 1946, he was appointed Lecturer in Zoology at University College London, and from 1951 to his retirement in 1982, he was University Reader in Taxonomy. At the time of his death from a sudden heart attack, he was Emeritus Reader. ==Natural history bibliographies and collections== Through regular contacts with booksellers (antiquarian and otherwise), by attending auctions (including at Sotheby's), visiting libraries, correspondence with scholars, his own studies, and through buying trips to the west country in England and elsewhere, Freeman built up an immense first-hand knowledge of his subjects. In the process, he also accumulated an imposing library of Darwin and natural history works.R.B. Freeman, The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist (London: Dawsons, 1965), Preface. In 1967, Freeman was persuaded by David Esplin, an associate librarian at the University of Toronto, to sell to that institution his Darwin collection – which included some 140 copies of The Origin of Species.Richard G. Landon, Notes on Collections of the University of Toronto Library. No 2: Charles Darwin. Species of Origin; a bibliographical exposition of the works of Charles Darwin at the University of Toronto (Toronto: University of Toronto Library, 1971), p. 4.

Esplin: a commemorative exhibition (Toronto: Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, University of Toronto, 28 March – 11 May 1984), p. 30. Darwin Freeman called The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist his first attempt to list “all the editions and issues [of works by Charles Darwin] which I have seen, or seen reliably recorded\\" no more than \\"a list\\" which is \\"far from complete.\\"Freeman, The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist, p. ix. That 1965 work contained some 541 items; 12 years later, a second edition numbered 1,805 entries, though it maintained the same title.R. B. Freeman, The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist, second edition, revised and enlarged (London: Dawson, 1977). Citing another scholar’s assertion that “it would be as hopeless a task to search out all the reprints [of Darwin’s Origin of Species] as it would be to discover those of its great – and almost as shattering – coeval, The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám\\", Freeman wrote: “I have tried to do just that for all of Darwin’s works.”Freeman, The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist, second edition, p. 9. The second revised edition of The Works of Charles Darwin was “virtually a new book”H.A. Feisenberger, review of The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist, second edition, in Times Literary Supplement, 9 December 1977, p. 1455. and “a required purchase for students of Darwin and of the history of evolutionary biology generally” which “stands second only to a facsimile of the first edition of The Origin of Species.”Sandra Herbert, review of The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist, second edition, in Isis, Vol. 69, June 1978, pp. 305–6.

British Natural History Books In 1980, Freeman published British Natural History Books 1495–1900: A Handlist, which \\"any self-respecting library and every calculating collector should possess.\\" The work listed some 4,206 items. Philip Henry Gosse In 1972, the University of Toronto Library offered to buy Freeman's Gosse and natural history collection of some 1,000 volumes, a transaction completed in 1974.Elizabeth Hulse, \\"A Victorian Natural History Collection\\", Victorian Studies Association Newsletter (Ontario), Number 14, November 1974, pp. 19–21. In 1980, Freeman published Philip Henry Gosse: A Bibliography (co-authored with Douglas Wertheimer).

Moore, review of Philip Henry Gosse: A Bibliography, in Isis, Vol. 72, June 1981, pp. 288–9. In 1974, Freeman had Entomologia Alabamensis, an unpublished manuscript volume of insects of Alabama drawn by P.H. Gosse while he lived there in 1838, photographed in color. At the same time, he enlisted K.G.V. Smith to oversee an \\"Annotated Index to Insects Mentioned in [Gosse's] Letters from Alabama (1859).\\" That project drew on Smith's expertise and that of 18 others who were also at the British Museum of Natural History, as well as two experts from the US Department of Agriculture. They gave modern scientific names to the insects in Gosse's Letters from Alabama, co-ordinating those identifications with the illustrations in Entomologia Alabamensis. The project included a bibliography but was never published, and fell from view after Freeman's death.Douglas Wertheimer, Philip Henry Gosse: Science and Revelation in the Crucible, University of Toronto, PhD thesis, 1977, pp. 87, 103fn139. In 2010, Gary R. Mullen and Taylor D.

The opposite of exploratory thought is confirmatory thought, which is reasoning designed to construct justification supporting a specific point of view. Both terms were coined by social psychologist Jennifer Lerner and psychology professor Philip Tetlock in the 2002 book Emerging Perspectives in Judgment and Decision Making. The authors argue that most people, most of the time, make decisions based on gut feelings and poor logic, and reason through issues primarily to provide justification, to themselves and to others, of what they already believe. Lerner and Tetlock say that when people expect to need to justify their position to external parties, and they already know those parties' views, they will tend to adopt a similar position to theirs, and then engage in confirmatory thought with the goal of bolstering their own credibility rather than reaching a good conclusion. However, if the external parties are overly aggressive or critical, people will disengage from thought altogether, and simply assert their personal opinions without justification. Lerner and Tetlock say that people only push themselves to think critically and logically when they know in advance they will need to explain themselves to external parties who are well-informed, genuinely interested in the truth, and whose views they don't already know. Because those conditions rarely exist, they argue, most people are engaging in confirmatory thought most of the time. ==In statistics== Princeton statistician John Tukey wrote about selection between confirmation or rejection of existing hypotheses and exploration of new ones, focusing on how practicing statisticians might decide between the two modes of thought at various junctures.

Sony's former slogans have been \\"The One and Only\\", \\"It's a Sony\\", \\"Go Create\\" (Europe), \\"like.no.other\\" and \\"make.believe\\". Its current slogan is \\"Be Moved\\". ==General campaigns== It was for the TR-6 radio that Sony first contracted Atchan, a cartoon character created by Fuyuhiko Okabe, to become its advertising character. Now known as \\"Sony Boy\\", the character first appeared in a cartoon ad holding a TR-6 to his ear, but went on to represent the company in ads for a variety of products well into the mid- sixties. It's a Sony It's a Sony Sony's famous \\"It's a Sony\\" slogan was introduced in 1982 alongside the \\"S\\" mark. The slogan continued to be used until 2005. make.believe Sony announced a brand strategy at IFA 2009 to replace the \\"like.no.other\\" moniker. The words \\"make.believe\\" form the \\"Sony Group Brand Message.\\" The words are designed to unify the company's efforts at communication, and to reinvigorate the Sony brand. This marks the first time any message has served to represent the company's entire range of products. Previously, the company adopted separate strategies in its promotion of entertainment and electronics products.Ramsay, Fiona. \\"Sony to Roll Out Global make.Believe Activity.\\" Marketing Nov 04 2009: 3-. ABI/INFORM Global; ProQuest Research Library. Web. 26 May 2012. Following the announcement of the \\"make.believe\\" brand strategy, the company included the logo at the end of advertisements. Not until November 2009 did it make its first advertisement. Sony expanded the initial ad to print, television, digital, and outdoor advertisements across Europe. The company launched the \\"make.believe\\" strategy in the United States in January 2010. Sony budgeted US$100 million for its \\"make.believe\\" campaign in 2010.Tarr, Greg. \\"Sony Seeks New 3D Dimensions, Marks 2nd Leg of make.Believe.\\" TWICE 25.13 (2010): 50-. ProQuest Research Library. Web. 26 May 2012. That same year, Sony rolled out the second portion of the campaign, focused on promoting its 3D offerings. It broadcast television advertisements featuring American football player Peyton Manning as well as pop singer Justin Timberlake. The ads were intended to teach consumers about 3D and reduce misconceptions about the technology. As a part of the push, the company planned to conduct several thousand demonstrations in retail settings, allowing consumers to see 3D technology first-hand. ==Product-line specific campaigns== BRAVIA The BRAVIA brand uses the slogan \\"Evolve\\" =Specific commercials= The launch of the BRAVIA was supported by an advertising campaign, with a commercial featuring 250,000 brightly colored rubber balls (real, not computer-generated) bouncing down a San Francisco street. The idea was brought to life by director Nicolai Fuglsig with the help of Los Angeles-based special effects guru Barry Conner. In addition to the 12 air mortars, Conner deployed three giant skips, each lifted 50 feet into the air and containing 35,000 colored bouncy balls. The first shot required 50,000 balls to be sent cascading down a hill, colliding at a road junction with a further 50,000 that had been fired along a side street. A team of 50 interns was on hand to gather up the balls for the six takes it took in the more than four days to film the advertisement. Golf nets were erected at the sides of the street and every drain was blocked. The idea was originally a segment of the Late Show with David Letterman in 1996, in which bouncy balls rolled down the same street. Fallon, the advertising agency involved with the commercial, denied ever having watched the episode and claimed the similarity was a coincidence. The commercial is accompanied by the song \\"Heartbeats\\", written by Swedish duo The Knife and performed by José González. The track became very popular on radio stations in the UK after it was released by Peacefrog Records and helped his debut album Veneer reach number 7 in the UK albums chart. The commercial shows a similarity to The Knife's original Heartbeats-video which was directed by Johannes Nyholm, Andreas Nilsson, Bo Melin. It is probable that the original video inspired the makers of the commercial video. ==Parodies== A parody of this commercial was run in the UK by Tango, a brand of soft drink. Filmed in Swansea, Wales, it featured fruit in place of bouncing balls and used the same music. Circulating only throughout the internet, a video filmed by a clan features 64 players simultaneously hopping down a slope and over Humvees on the Sharqi Peninsula, a map in Battlefield 2. Instead of \\"BRAVIA - Colour like no other\\" at the end of the original commercial, the clan's video read \\"Bunny hopping - Like no other\\". On Belgian television, channel VT4 showed a commercial for a soccer event, using soccer balls and the same music as the Sony commercial. At the Game Developers Conference of 2008, video game developer Crytek reproduced the commercial to demonstrate its CryEngine 2 game engine. Instead of multi-colored bouncy balls, Crytek used bouncing Utah teapots. At the end of the demonstration, the video reads \\"Realtime - Like no other.\\" ==\\"Paint\\"== Glasgow tower block, the day after filming Following on from the original advert, Jonathan Glazer directed the second in which a condemned tower block in Toryglen in Glasgow, Scotland was covered in 70000 litres of environmentally friendly paint with the help of over 1400 separate explosions featured as imitation fireworks, concluding with a simulated \\"reverse demolition\\" of the building. This was filmed with a crew of 200 people over a 10-day period in July 2006. The music used in this commercial is the Overture to The Thieving Magpie by Gioachino Rossini. The tower block was demolished in 2007. ==\\"Play-Doh\\"== It was filmed in a street in New York City where 200 bunnies made from 2.5 Tonnes of plasticine united to form a 30-foot giant rabbit. The accompanying soundtrack is \\"She's a Rainbow\\" by The Rolling Stones. The commercial was filmed in New York City. ==\\"Pyramid\\"== An advert filmed in Egypt that features thousands of coloured cotton reels tumbling down a pyramid. The cotton reels were not actually rolled down the pyramid but was rather a composition of real footage and CGI. ==India== Advertisement in India features thousands of square anthropomorphic pixels. A Kathakali dancer's green face turns into pixels which run away from him. He finds his face later in a Sony BRAVIA television. ==Dominos== This advertising campaign was launched in October 2008. Shot on location in India's states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The 60 second Dominos video takes viewers on a journey on a tumbling journey of color, from a magnificent fort in Jaisalmer through a desert all the way to the Taj Mahal in Agra. The music for the spot was created by Song Zu and Darker My Love's Rob Barbato. ==BRAVIA-drome== The BRAVIA-drome at Venaria, in Northern Italy In December 2008, Sony filmed a large zoetrope called the BRAVIA-drome in Venaria, Italy to advertise Motionflow 240 Hz in the Sony BRAVIA KDL-52XBR7. Motionflow 200 Hz/240 Hz is Sony's motion interpolation technology, where three new frames are added per second to smooth the picture. Sixty-four Da Pro footballer Kaká were used inside the BRAVIA-drome to demonstrate that with increased frame rate (speed at which the zoetrope rotated), there is increased smoothness of motion. Measuring 10 metres in diameter and weighing 10 tonnes, the BRAVIA-drome has officially been declared the world's largest zoetrope by Guinness World Records. The advert was directed by Vernie Yeung, produced by Fallon Worldwide, the agency behind the \\"Balls\\", \\"Paint\\" and \\"Play-doh\\" trilogy, and is currently airing in Australia. The music used in this commercial is \\"Underdog\\", by Kasabian. ==UBS Network News: Tale of the Tape== On November 10, 2008, a video was uploaded on YouTube by \\"UBS Network News\\", a mock news report about an anonymously sent video purporting to be an \\"Unidentifiable Fast Moving Object\\" (UFMO). The second part, uploaded on November 24, showed a reporter interviewing a \\"scientist\\" about the object, which seems to leave behind exhaust like a rocket. However, in the final video, uploaded on November 25, it is revealed that the videos were part of an advertising campaign by Sony and that when BRAVIA Televisions were installed, the footage actually \\"shows\\" (the original footage does not actually show) Canadian skater Cindy Klassen. PlayStation The PlayStation brand uses several slogans for their advertisements, these slogans are \\"Greatness Awaits\\", \\"This Is For The Players\\" and \\"The Best Place To Play\\" =Kevin Butler= Kevin Butler (portrayed by actor Jerry Lambert) is a marketing character used by Sony Computer Entertainment America as part of their It Only Does Everything (2009–2011) and Long Live Play (2011–present) advertising campaigns for the PlayStation 3 in North America. The string of commercials starring Kevin Butler has been met with positive acclaim due to its humorous and lively tone. Gaming site Kotaku commented on the first two commercials that were released, \\"What we didn't mention is how funny they are.\\" Sony Computer Entertainment America Senior Vice President Peter Dille said that the commercials have \\"been tremendously successful. Consumers love it. It's great to hear people like you guys love it. And the results are really in the sales because it's really been flying since this coincided in September with the launch of the new PS3.\\" Engadget also loved the commercials saying, \\"We have to hand it to Sony, they've followed up nicely on their \\"worst kept secret\\" trade show jokes with an ad campaign that is fittingly self-aware\\". Destructoid praised the commercials, saying that they were much better than Sony's previous White Room series of ads, which was met with mostly negative reception, with most calling it \\"creepy.\\" When Butler appeared at E3 2010, he was met with large praise from the audience. =It Only Does Everything= The \\"It Only Does Everything\\" campaign ran from 2009 to 2011, showcasing the multimedia and non- game features of the PlayStation 3. =Long Live Play= From 2011 to 2012, SCEA used the tagline, Long Live Play to promote its home console. Sony admitted in late 2005 to hiring graffiti artists to spray paint advertisements for their PlayStation Portable game system in seven major cities including New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco,Graffiti ads spark debate in US. BBC News Online. and Sydney, Australia. The mayor of Philadelphia filed a cease and desist order. According to Sony, they paid businesses and building owners for the right to graffiti their walls.Wired News. Wired.com. Retrieved 7 July 2011. Sony made no plans to keep or withdraw the ads. In November 2006, a marketing company employed by Sony created a website entitled \\"All I want for Xmas is a PSP\\", designed to promote the PSP through viral marketing. The site contained a blog, which was purportedly written by \\"Charlie\\", a teenager attempting to get his friend \\"Jeremy\\"'s parents to buy him a PSP, providing links to T-shirt iron-ons, Christmas cards, and a \\"music video\\" of either Charlie or Jeremy \\"rapping\\". However, visitors to the website soon discovered that the website was registered to a marketing company, exposing the site on sites such as YouTube and digg, and Sony was forced to admit the site's true origin in a post on the blog, stating that they would from then on \\"stick to making cool products\\" and that they would use the website for \\"the facts on the PSP\\". The site has since been taken down. In an interview with next- gen.biz, Sony admitted that the idea was \\"poorly executed\\". Sony Ericsson Sony Ericsson, a joint venture between Sony and Swedish firm Ericsson, employed a \\"liquid identity\\" logo.Sony Ericsson Adapts to Sony's Brand Message of make.Believe. Hyderabad, India, Hyderabad:, 2009. ProQuest Research Library. Web. 26 May 2012. The company adopted the \\"make.believe\\" tagline in 2009. As part of its rebranding effort, the company deployed its logo in seven color variations. The company's goals were to appeal to consumer emotions and promote itself more effectively on digital media. Saatchi & Saatchi, Iris and Dare put together the campaign. Another component of the company's campaign was a viral marketing campaign known as \\"Spark Something.\\" Advertisements in the viral effort poses the question: \\"what if dreams could become reality?\\" Sony Mobile Xperia currently uses \\"Entertainment To The Extreme\\" for their 2018 flagships, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium, Sony Xperia XZ2 and Sony Xperia XZ2 Compacthttps://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/premium- android/#gref the brand have previously used \\"Everything Becomes Wow\\" for the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, Sony Xperia XZ1 and Sony Xperia XZ1 Compacthttps://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/xperia/world-of-wow/#gref and \\"Capture the Wow of Now\\" for the Sony Xperia XZ and Sony Xperia X Compact.https://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/wowofnow/ Walkman Sony's marketing team produced their first Walkman advertisement, a print ad, in 1979 named Bridging the difference.Du Gay, 9 The marketing of the Walkman introduced the idea of 'Japanese-ness' into global culture, synonymous with miniaturization and high-technology.Du Gay While it was also launched as Walkman in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. It was launched as Freestyle in Sweden, since the Sony staff in Sweden objected to the illicit connotations of the word \\"stowaway\\". The use of these different names meant that the same product had to be promoted with different logos and package designs. Before the release of the Walkman, Sony distributed 100 cassette- players to influential individuals like magazine editors and musicians.Du Gay, 57 The introductory United States advertising campaign for the Sony Walkman was created in the New York office of the international advertising agency, McCann-Erickson, who had won the Sony account just a year before. The \\"Walk- men\\" and \\"Walk-women\\" in advertisements were created to be the ideal reflections of the subject watching.Du Gay, 25 This suppositional link that the consumer can have with the product allows one to identify with the personalized device, which then can become an integrated part of his or her life. The advertising of the Sony Walkman served to portray it as a culturally \\"hip\\" item. The advertisements contained youthful and fit people using the Walkman in order to entice people into purchasing it. The people in the commercials embodied the \\"identities we can become\\",Du Gay, 39 thus making the Walkman a more appealing product for consumers. Teenagers were targeted by the advertising in particular, as Sony's executives hoped that by marketing their product to teens, the Walkman brand would become associated with \\"youth, activity, sport, leisure, the outdoors, fitness, health, movement, [and] getting-out-and-about\\".Du Gay, 38 The word \\"walk-man\\" itself provides consumers with a vision of the product. In addition to these other modes of advertising, the walkman can be marketed through its idea of being a definition of today's culture. \\"It belongs to our culture because we have constructed for it a little world of meaning; and this bringing of the object into meaning is what constitutes it as a cultural artefact\\".Du Gay, 10 Today, Walkman still maintains its role in popular culture, albeit a diminished one due to the large number of competitors in mobile audio devices today. Through Sony's effort to \\"[sustain] certain meanings and practices which have become emblematic of--which seem to stand for or to represent--a distinctive 'way of life': the culture of late-modern, post-industrial societies\\",Du Gay, 18 the Walkman remains, largely due to effective advertisement, a symbol of the freedom and portability that Sony sought to convey among the younger demographic. A main component of Walkman advertising campaign was personalization of the device. Having the ability to customize a playlist was a new and exciting revolution in music technology. Potential buyers had the opportunity to choose their perfect match in terms of mobile listening technology. Despite \\"all this technological diversity, there must be one which is the perfect choice for you\\".Du Gay, 31 This method of marketing to an extremely expansive user-base while maintaining the idea that the product was made for each individual \\"[got] the best of all possible worlds—mass marketing and personal differentiation\\". Sony accomplished the genius feat of mass individualized and targeted advertisement, enabling the Walkman to be recognized as an influential piece of technology. ==References== Category:Sony Category:Advertising campaigns ","title":"Sony marketing"},{"id":"35939961","text":"Nude per l'assassino (English: Strip Nude for Your Killer) is a 1975 giallo film directed by Andrea Bianchi. Written by Massimo Felisatti, the film stars Nino Castelnuovo, Edwige Fenech and Solvi Stubing, and features music by Berto Pisano. Nude per l'assassino has received mixed to negative reviews from critics. After a model dies while undergoing an illegal abortion, a killer disguised in a motorcycle helmet tracks down and kills the doctor involved. Several models and photographers working at the same agency as the dead girl are also murdered, leading two surviving photographers to fear for their lives as they try to track down the killer. Nude per l'assassino is one of several collaborations between Bianchi, Felisatti and cinematographer Franco Delli Colli. The film has been described as a formulaic giallo thriller, and has been cited as an influence on the development of the American slasher film genre. == Plot == After a fashion model dies while undergoing an illegal abortion, the attending doctor moves her body back to her home, staging her death to remove any trace of his involvement. However, he is murdered by a stranger disguised in racing leathers and a motorcycle helmet. At the Albatross Modelling Agency, womanising photographer Carlo (Nino Castelnuovo) embarks on an affair with fellow photographer Magda (Edwige Fenech). Meanwhile, a newly hired model, Patrizia (Solvi Stubing), fends off the unwanted advances of Maurizio (Franco Diogene), whose wife owns the agency. One evening, Mario (Claudio Pellegrini), who also works at the agency, invites a guest in racing leathers into his home for a drink, and is stabbed to death. The police question the agency's owner Gisella (Lia Amanda) and another model, Lucia (Femi Benussi) about the killing, but learn very little. Gisella and Lucia are sleeping together; one night when Gisella leaves after a fight, Lucia is attacked and killed. Maurizio propositions another model, Doris (Erna Schürer), but when she refuses to sleep with him for money, he attempts to rape her. However, he suffers from premature ejaculation and Doris leaves unharmed. Shortly afterwards, Maurizio is stabbed by the killer. Carlo later witnesses Gisella being murdered, and is able to photograph the attack; however, he runs off and is injured in a hit and run accident. While he is in hospital, Magda recovers his camera and attempts to develop the film, but the killer breaks in and destroys the negatives. Carlo hurries home, but the killer has gone—going instead to kill Doris and her abusive boyfriend Stefano. Carlo finds Madga alive, but the killer returns to attack them both. During the struggle, the killer is knocked down a flight of stairs. The killer is unmasked and revealed to be Patrizia, who accuses Carlo of causing the death of her sister—the girl who died in the botched abortion, and whose death it is revealed Carlo helped to conceal. However, Patrizia dies of her injuries, leaving no trace of Carlo's involvement. == Production == Writer Massimo Felisatti did not wish to be seen as having solely written the film, and gave director Andrea Bianchi credit for the story in order to \\"deflect his role and not have to bear full responsibility\\" for the script. Bianchi, Felisatti and cinematographer Franco Delli Colli would collaborate again the following year in La moglie di mio padre. Nude per l'assassino score was written by Berto Pisano, who would also go on to write the score for Bianchi's 1979 film Malabimba – The Malicious Whore. Bianchi would later cast Femi Benussi, who portrayed one of the slain models, in two other films—La moglie di mio padre and Cara dolce nipote. Nude per l'assassino has been described as following \\"the giallo formula almost to the letter\\", demonstrating that \\"the giallo conventions established by Bava and Argento and elaborated upon by a number of directors in the early 1970s had become well codified\\" by the time the film was produced. The film has also been cited as being \\"the perfect bridge to the American slasher film\\", with its emphasis on \\"violence and sex\\" and a plot \\"dumbed down to the barest minimum\\". == Release == Nude per l'assassino was released on 26 August 1975. Upon release in the United Kingdom on October 4, 1979, it was rated X by the British Board of Film Classification, following the removal of five minutes of material from the film. It has subsequently received home media releases in English by Blue Underground as Strip Nude for Your Killer, first on DVD on October 25, 2005, and on Blu-ray Disc on March 27, 2012. Shameless Screen Entertainment also released a DVD version under the title Strip Nude for Your Killer on October 27, 2008. The film has also been distributed under the titles Tenebre braccia della morte and Strip Naked for Your Killer. == Reception == Nude per l'assassino has been met with mixed to negative reviews. Martyn Auty of the Monthly Film Bulletin, stated that \\"For all its clichéd direction (voyeuristic threateningly subjective camerawork) and perfunctory sexual diversions, this routine sex-ploiter is at least tolerably shot and unfussily plotted.\\" Writing for AllMovie, Jason Buchanan rated the film two stars out of five, calling it \\"unabashedly sadistic\\". Budd Wilkins, writing for Slant magazine, rated the film three stars out of five, calling it \\"one of the more sordid examples\\" of the giallo genre. Wilkins noted that the film's violence \\"isn't necessarily stronger than in contemporary giallo films like Argento's Deep Red\\", but that it is \\"more resolutely tied to aberrant sexuality than almost anywhere else in the genre\\". Wilkins also compared the film's central premise—that of revenge for a failed abortion—to that of Massimo Dallamano's 1972 film What Have You Done to Solange?. DVD Talk's Adam Tyner also gave the film two stars out of five, summarising it as \\"not much of a movie\\". Tyner noted that Nude per l'assassino \\"doesn't set out to be revered as an artistic triumph\\", and described it as \\"worth at least a rental\\" for fans of the genre. Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray compared the film to Sergio Martino's 1972 film Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key (Il tuo vizio è una stanza chiusa e solo io ne ho la chiave), noting that \\"both take place among the idle European aristocracy, with vapid models, rugged motocross drivers, bigoted executives, and debauched artists wandering through a world of soft fabrics and bloody, gashed skin\\". Bloody Disgusting's Mike Pereira rated Nude per l'assassino 0.5 out of 5, writing that it \\"reeks of amateur hour\\". Pereira felt that the film featured \\"dead-on-arrival pacing\\" and \\"terrible filmmaking and acting A staff review for the Italian magazine Nocturno rated the film four out of five, describing it as \\"one of the most daring\\" giallo films of the 1970s. Previewing the film's Blu-ray release, IGN's David McCutcheon described Nude per l'assassino as an \\"infamous shocker that packs more grisly violence and sexual depravity into each frame than just about any other film\\". == Notes  Footnotes ==  References  * * * == External links == * * Category:Giallo films Category:1975 films Category:1975 horror films Category:1970s thriller films Category:Italian thriller films Category:Italian films Category:Italian-language films Category:Italian serial killer films Category:Films directed by Andrea Bianchi Category:Films scored by Berto Pisano Category:Films about modeling ","title":"Nude per l'assassino"},{"id":"35939968","text":"Amanda \\"Manny\\" Ziener (5 October 1887 – 4 May 1972) was a German stage and film actress.

However, Cheaney only played just nine games due to a strained left hamstring. At midseason, the Nuggets traded Keon Clark to the Toronto Raptors for Kevin Willis. Antonio McDyess finally realized his potential averaging 20.8 points and 10.1 rebounds per game, while being selected for the 2001 NBA All-Star Game. The Nuggets were a playoff contender posting a record of 26–18 as of January 27. However, they faded in February and March winning just nine of 28 games as they missed the playoffs with a 40–42 record, sixth in the Midwest Division.

However, Rider would play in just ten games before being waived on November 20. After finishing just two games below .500 the previous season, the Nuggets suffered another disastrous setback as Antonio McDyess suffered a preseason knee injury, which limited him to just ten games. Things would only get worse in December as head coach Dan Issel got into hot water after yelling a racial slur at a Mexican fan. Issel was suspended for four games and was forced to resign, being replaced by his assistant Mike Evans.

The band also announced on their Facebook page they would keep their fans up to date on their Mobile Twilight Tavern and with a weekly studio diary on Spinefarm's YouTube channel. The album would also include guest appearances by members of Die Apokalyptischen Reiter and the Finnish singer and actor Vesa-Matti Loiri. In late March, the band was in the final stages of the recordings for the album and completed recordings in early April. In May, the band revealed the title for the album, Unsung Heroes and announced its release date, 27 August 2012. The album would also be released through Spinefarm Records. Then in late June the band unveiled the album cover artwork, again designed by Kristian Wahlin. On 9 July they posted on their Facebook page a YouTube video with Burning Leaves, one of their new songs on the album. On 17 July the band posted a link with the making of their new video clip for In My Sword I Trust, also a new song to be featured on the album. The video was shot in Wrocław, Poland by Grupa 13 who were also recruited for the recent video clips of other notable bands like Amon Amarth and Behemoth. The actual video was uploaded on August 8 on Spinefarm's YouTube channel, which reached over a hundred thousand views within the first week. ==Track listingPersonnel== Ensiferum *Petri Lindroos - harsh vocals, guitar, backing vocals *Markus Toivonen - guitar, acoustic guitars, dulcimer, bouzouki, clean vocals, backing vocals *Sami Hinkka - bass guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals (harsh/clean) *Janne Parviainen - drums, backing vocals *Emmi Silvennoinen - keyboards, hammond, grand piano, pump organ, backing vocals Guest musicians *Vesa-Matti Loiri - speech on \\"Pohjola\\" *Laura Dziadulewicz - vocals on \\"Celestial Bond\\" *Ulla Bürger - soprano vocals on \\"Passion, Proof, Power\\" *Lassi Lógren - nyckelharpa *Timo Väänänen - kantele *Pasi Puolakka - flute, descant & sopranino Recorders *Kasper Mårtenson - moog *Volk-Man, Ady & Fuchs (Die Apokalyptischen Reiter) - additional voices on \\"Passion, Proof, Power\\" *Heidi Parviainen (Dark Sarah, ex-Amberian Dawn) - choir vocals ;Crew *Kristian Wåhlin - album artwork *Hiili Hiilesmaa - production, engineering and mixing ==References== Category:2012 albums Category:Ensiferum albums ","title":"Unsung Heroes (Ensiferum album)"},{"id":"35940029","text":"Piranha, also known as Piranha, Piranha or Caribe, is a 1972 American adventure-thriller film starring William Smith and Peter Brown who had previously starred together in the Laredo Western TV series and Ahna Capri. ==Synopsis== Art Greene (Tom Simcox) and his sister Terry (Ahna Capri) are a couple of wildlife photographers exploring the Amazon region with their American guide Jim Pendrake (Peter Brown).

Research into object-based attention suggests that attention improves the quality of the sensory representation of a selected object, and results in the enhanced processing of that object’s features. The concept of an ‘object’, apropos object-based attention, entails more than a physical thing that can be seen and touched. It includes a perceptual unit or group, namely, elements in a visual field (stimuli) organised coherently by Gestalt factors such as collinearity, closure, and symmetry. ==History== Early researchers initially postulated that space-based considerations were the driving force behind visual attention; however, it became evident that their views needed to include the “thing” that attention selects. This object-based focus was extended, from Kahneman & Henik’s leading question: “If attention selects a stimulus, what is the stimulus it selects?” and their consideration that attention might also be object-driven, through Duncan’s influential and explicit delineation between space-based and object- based theories of attention, to the current status presented in this article. A classic example of a cuing study undertaken to evaluate object-based attention was that of Egly, Driver, and Rafal. Their results demonstrated that it was quicker to detect a target that was located on a cued object than it was to locate the target when it was the same distance away, but on an uncued object. Pertinently, Duncans’s efforts were later verified by Vecera & Farah’s findings that shape discrimination tasks are dependent upon object-based representations, which in turn result in object-based attentional effects. The contribution of object-based attentional guidance to visual processing is widely accepted, with both object-based and space-based perceptual representations now included in recent models of visual attentional selection. ==Nature and effects of object-based attention== When considering the nature and effects of object-based attention, three research theories are commonly mentioned; these are presented below. Consideration is then given to the enhancing effect of object-based attention on memory, and its inhibitory effect during certain kinds of visual search. Distribution of attention The first theory posits that visually perceived objects affect the distribution of conscious and unconscious attention. Therefore, consciously attending to one aspect of an object automatically facilitates the processing of other aspects of the same object (including those currently task- irrelevant), whether in terms of accuracy or response times. When a visual search involves locating two features, it is more efficient when both of the features occur in the same object, as opposed to two features separated in two different objects. Furthermore, that when re-viewing a previously attended object, recognition is faster when there is continuity between the representations (form, colour, orientation, etc.) of that object and the previewed one. Orienting The second theory asserts that object-based attention can shift quicker within an object than between objects. Egly and colleagues provided evidence for an object-based component of such visual orienting in a cued reaction time task involving both normal participants and parietal-damaged patients. As an extension, research has indicated that when looking for a target among objects, there is also a preference to make eye- shifts within the same object, rather than between objects. Distractors The third theory contends that there is greater interference of object-based attention when any flanking distractors (e.g., visual scene crowding or noise) are present. Particularly, if these distractors belong to the same object or object-group as that being attended (noise similar), as opposed to coming from different objects (noise dissimilar)—irrespective of the distinguishing characteristics of the objects themselves (e.g., colour, motion direction, shape, orientation). An influencing element is that an object-like representation can engage attention even when it is not the intended target of a visual search. Therefore, an important consideration is that the perceptual resemblance between distractors and a target object influences the efficiency of visual search; increases in similarity among the distractors, increases search efficiency. Similarly, visual search efficiency increases the less similar the target is to the distractors. Memory The effect of object- based attention on memory has also received increasing attention. Three experiments conducted by Bao and colleagues have shown that the binding of different information to a single object improves the manipulation of that information within working memory, suggesting a relationship between outer visual attention and internal memory attention. Research into object-based exogenous attention has also identified concurrent enhancement of recognition memory, thereby enabling better information retrieval. This occurred when the memory formation was encoded simultaneously with a change in an accompanying task-irrelevant visual scene, provided they are both presented in the attended object. Inhibition of return Object-based attention has also been found to have inhibitory qualities. Posner and Cohen unexpectedly found that visual search reaction times to detect objects appearing in a previously cued location took longer than when they appeared in a non-cued location, provided the time in waiting for the target (object) to appear was longer than 300 ms after the initial cueing. This was termed the inhibition of return paradigm: “An inhibitory effect produced by a peripheral (i.e., exogenous) cue or target”. Klein hypothesised that inhibition of return is a mechanism that allows a person not to re-search in previously searched visual fields as a result of “inhibitory tags”. ==Factors that influence object-based attention== The deployment of attention depends jointly on the goals and expectations of the observer, and the properties of the image. Cues and attentional focus The kind of cues—exogenous (peripheral) or endogenous (central)—have been found to differentially affect the role of object-based attention in visual searches. Chen reported that object-based effects were found with exogenous but not with endogenous cues. However, further research into this finding suggests that it is rather the extent of attentional focus that a cue evokes that influences the functioning of an object-based effect, than the kind of cue used. Object effects are less elusive when the peripheral nature of exogenous cues is responsible for stimulating the use of a broad focus of attention vis-à-vis the narrow attentional focus generally induced by central- type cues. Confirmatory findings in the ‘extent of attentional focus’ versus ‘type of cue’ debate by Chen & Cave, and others, have shown that object-based effects are also evident in the case of endogenous cues when research- participants adopt a broad attentional focus while attending to the cues. Representational quality The perceptual representation of an object must be sufficiently defined (a viable object representation) in order for object- based attention to be elicited and used in a visual search. Some factors that might influence the quality of such a representation are: The duration of a stimulus that is presented in order to produce an object-based perceptual representation—longer durations are generally more reliable; the more ‘complete’ the object-based representation the better, e.g., a closed as opposed to a disconnected outline; greater uniformity in the representation of an object is also more effective, e.g., consistency in colouration and luminance throughout the representation; the amount of perceptual load, as it has a modulatory effect on object-based attention, for, with a low perceptual load, attention spreads along the cued object—an outcome that supports an object-based attention account. ==Mechanisms that evoke object-based attentional effects== The visual system does not have the capacity to process all inputs simultaneously; therefore, attentional processes assist to select some inputs over others. Such selection can be based on spatial locations as well as discrete objects. Three mechanisms are hypothesised to contribute to selective attention to an object. Sensory enhancement Object-based attentional effects are attributed to the improved sensory representation of the object that results from attentional spread (an object-guided spatial selection). When attention is directed to a location within an object, other locations within that object also acquire an attentional advantage (via enhanced sensory processing). Two or more features belonging to a single object are identified more quickly and more accurately than are features belonging to different objects. Attention to a single visual feature of an object, such as its speed of motion, results in an automatic transfer of attention to other task-relevant features, such as, colour. Studies measuring neuron response in animals provided evidence supporting the theory that attention spreads within an object. Attentional prioritisation It is held that the order of a visual search is important in the manifestation of object-based effects. The object-based attentional advantage could be mediated by increased attentional priority assigned to locations within an already attended object, namely, where a visual search starts by default from locations within an already attended object. This prioritisation account proposes that the main effect of attention is to order the analysis of attentional search, and that the attended object is processed ahead of unattended objects, and more specifically, that currently unattended portions of an attended object will be searched ahead of currently unattended portions of a different, unattended object. However, it is also proposed that observers adopt either an implicit configural scanning strategy (unattended locations within an attended object receive a high priority) or an implicit contextual scanning strategy (where objectively high probability locations receive a high priority) depending on the requirements of, and time availability for, a task. Attentional shifting Lamy and Egeth found object-based attentional effects when attentional shifts during tasks were required, but no attentional effects when the shifts were not required. Attentional shifting theorises that the cost of switching between objects, rather than within objects, occurs due to three individual components. These being the attentional operations that take place when attention needs to be: Disengaged (released) from a current object; redirected (switched) to another location outside the initial object of attention; and then re-engaged (the refocusing of attention) on the new object. Furthermore, Brown and Denney identified that within the three stages it took longer response times to disengage attention from an object than it did to disengage attention from a location, or to shift attention within an object; they proposed that separate processes could be involved when shifting attention from an object than doing so from a location. ==Neural correlates of object-based attention== When attention moves between spatially superimposed perceptual objects, such as faces and houses, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revealed transient transfer activity in posterior parietal and frontoparietal regions; the latter region controls spatial attention. The time-course of cortical activity demonstrates the functional role that these brain regions fulfil in attentional control processes. In a recent study Baldauf and Desimone show that a region in frontal cortex, the inferior-frontal junction (IFJ), is involved in the top- down guidance of object-based attention by selectively synchronizing its neural activity with respective networks in IT cortex representing relevant object information. It is thought that object-based attention effects are mediated in the ventral stream, which is the visual stream associated with object recognition and form representation. This prediction is on the basis of a model of visual systems in which shape representations in the ventral stream inform perception, whereas shape representations in the dorsal stream guide actions. A 2009 case study involving “DF”, who had suffered bilateral damage to the lateral occipital lobe (LO) area of her ventral visual stream, showed that while she had a normal spatial orienting system, her deployment of attention was not at all sensitive to the presentation of objects. DF did not exhibit the usual advantage for within- over between-object attentional shifts or figure comparisons, a clear indicator of the absence of normal object-based attentional effects. ==References== Category:Cognitive psychology Category:Attention Category:Vision Category:Visual perception ","title":"Object-based attention"},{"id":"35940061","text":"The Las Cruces bowling alley massacre occurred in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on February 10, 1990. Seven people were shot, four fatally, by two unidentified robbers at the Las Cruces Bowl at 1201 East Amador Avenue before setting fire to a desk in the office where they shot the victims, prior to leaving. The case is currently unsolved. ==Shooting== On the morning of February 10, 1990, the bowling alley's manager, 34-year-old Stephanie C. Senac, was in her office preparing to open the business with her 12-year-old daughter Melissa Repass and Melissa's 13-year-old friend Amy Houser, who were planning to supervise the alley's day care. The alley's cook, Ida Holguin, was in the kitchen when two men entered through an unlocked door. One pulled a .22 caliber pistol on Holguin and ordered her into Senac's office, where she, Repass, and Houser were already being held by the other gunman. The gunmen ordered the women and children to lie down while taking approximately $4,000 to $5,000 from the bowling alley's safe. Soon after, Steve Teran, the alley's 26-year-old mechanic, entered. As Teran had been unable to find a babysitter for his two daughters—two-year-old Valerie Teran and six-year-old Paula Holguin (no relation to Ida)—he intended to drop them off at the alley's day care. Not seeing anyone in the alley, Teran entered Senac's office and stumbled onto the crime scene. The gunmen then shot all seven victims multiple times at point- blank range. They then set the office on fire by igniting some papers before leaving the alley. The bowling alley fire was reported at 8:33am. Officers responding to the call discovered that Amy Houser, Paula Holguin, and Steven Teran had died at the scene. Valerie Teran was rushed to a hospital, but declared dead on arrival. Repass, despite being shot five times, called 9-1-1 on the office phone, allowing emergency services to respond immediately and saving her life along with her mother's and Holguin's. However, Senac died in 1999 due to complications from her injuries. Police set up ten roadblocks surrounding Las Cruces within an hour of the shooting, and carefully screened anyone leaving the city. The U.S. Customs Service, Army and Border Patrol searched the area with planes and helicopters. No arrests were made. == Investigation == The event remains unsolved, but is still under active investigation by the Las Cruces Police Department . In 2016, 26 years after the shooting, a brother of victim Steven Teran (who died in the shooting), Anthony Teran, was included in an issue of the Las Cruces Sun newspaper and one of his remarks was noted \\"In this day and age, things like this don’t go unsolved. How did we not get these guys? That’s the question I ask myself every day. Numerous people saw these gunmen, so someone out there knows something, and they need to come forward.\\" ==In popular culture== Movies A full-length documentary film called A Nightmare in Las Cruces was released on the 20th anniversary of the massacre. It uses actual crime scene video, pictures and interviews with family members. Filmmaker Charlie Minn hopes it will \\"move someone to come forward with fresh information and break the case\\". Since its release, more tips have been reported to the local police. The event is also referenced in Odd Thomas (2013) TV crime informational series  This case was featured on Unsolved Mysteries two and a half months after the murders, and on America's Most Wanted twice, once in November 2004 and again in March 2010. ==References * IMDb A Nightmare in Las Cruces (2011) * A Nightmare In Las Cruces (2011) Category:Las Cruces, New Mexico Category:Unsolved mass murders in the United States Category:Mass shootings in New Mexico Category:Mass murder in the United States Category:Murder in New Mexico Category:1990 in New Mexico Category:1990 murders in the United States Category:Mass murder in 1990 Category:February 1990 events in the United States Category:1990 mass shootings in the United States Category:Mass shootings in the United States ","title":"Las Cruces bowling alley massacre"},{"id":"35940095","text":"The Palazzo Hercolani or Ercolani is a large Rococo or Neoclassic-style palace in Strada Maggiore in central Bologna, which now serves as the offices for the Political Science Department (Facoltà di Scienze Politiche) of the University of Bologna. ==History== Statues at Palazzo Hercolani.

Timesofindia.indiatimes.com. Retrieved on 20 June 2014. The movie was remade in Telugu as Saheba Subramanyam and in Tamil as Meendum Oru Kadhal Kadhai. ==Plot== The story starts with a flashback in which two school boys, Vinod Nair and his friend, are at the Thalassery pier. Vinod Nair sees a Muslim girl who he finds attractive and he prays to God to make her his wife in the future. Then movie shifts focus to the present, in which Vinod, hailing from a middle-class Hindu Nair family, is jailed for trespassing the property of a rich Muslim politician, Abdul Khader. Realizing that he went there to meet the Muslim girl, Aisha, the politician's niece with whom he's madly in love, Sub-inspector Prem Kumar and his men request him to tell his love story. From here, the movie goes back in time by a few months, when Vinod first saw Aisha while attending his friend's marriage. He accidentally collides with her while running along a corridor and she falls down a staircase, ending up unconscious in a hospital. Vinod goes to the hospital and finds a little girl beside Aisha's bed. With her help, he leaves a 'sorry' letter to Aisha, written using a stencil. Then with his close friends Abdu and Mustafa, Vinod tries to win Aisha's heart. To get a chance to talk to Aisha, Vinod next tries to participate in a Daffmuttu competition in Kannur University Cultural Festival in which Aisha also is participating. He goes to a trainer Najaf. But Vinod and Najaf have a history of bitterness when during his 12th grade, the duo had a tiff. The storyline goes into further flashback mode, to a few years prior. Vinod along with his friends back then, Nijad and Majid had a gang, named Smartboyz. Majid was in love with Fatima, the daughter of the local shrimp merchant. But Fatima was in love with Najaf. Thus the trio decides to take on Najaf and beat him by covering faces. After beating Najaf, in an act of heroism, Majid accidentally threw away his driving license along with some money. The driving license gives his credentials away, and the next day all three are beaten up by Najaf's friends. Despite this history, Najaf who is now married to his new lover Khadeeja accepts to teach him Daffmuttu. During the cultural festival, Vinod meets Aisha and wishes her a happy birthday. He is won over by her radiance and decides to confront her. After the festival is over, Vinod goes to Aisha's house late at night and confesses his feelings. There is no reply from Aisha, but after a few days, Aisha reciprocates his feelings by writing a letter. Then one night, when he believes that no one is at her home, he tries to meet her. Only to be caught and sent to police custody. With this Vinod winds up his story. Listening to this with full attention, S.I Premkumar lends his full support to Vinod and promises to help him unite with Aisha. Vinod tries to find a way of reaching out to Aisha by exchanging letters with her. He finds Hamza, Aisha's tutor, a friend of Abdu. Hamza is in love with Vinod's sister and he agrees to help Vinod. To make money Vinod opens a Purdah shop with the help of Sub-inspector Premkumar and asks Aisha to inaugurate the shop. She agrees to come on Friday afternoon when she's alone in her house. Aisha inaugurates the shop and meets Vinod's parents. While returning, they are blocked by some men who are enraged to Aisha in the car with two men. After reaching home, Aisha is put into house-arrest by her father's elder brother, Abdul Khader. An accident happens in Khader's factory, which leads to a communal riot leading to which Aisha's father Abdul Rahman gets attacked. While in hospital, Khader informs his brother that they are shifting to Trivandrum the next day to prevent any untoward incidents further. Abdul Rahman agrees and Aisha sees Vinod one last time in the night. The next day, Abdul Rahman realises that he should allow Aisha to live with the one she loves. Khader departs and Aisha calls Vinod but finds that Vinod's phone is switched off and he is nowhere to be seen. Finally, with the help of SI Premkumar, they find him in sitting by the sea bridge and Aisha proposes him to marry her. Vinod asks to kiss her which she agrees. The scene shifts back to the first scene at the same sea-bridge where Vinod prays to God to get that beautiful girl he saw and as he leaves, a woman calls out to the little girl as 'Aisha'.

Left to right: A. T. Magarey, L. A. Wells, G. L. Jones, C. F. Wells and G. A. Keartland The expedition was financed by Albert Frederick Calvert (1872–1946), a London-based mining engineer and author, and conducted under the auspices of the South Australian Branch of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia. Its main aim was to build on the achievements of the 1891 Elder Expedition in exploring a still largely unknown inland area of Western Australia, mainly in the Great Sandy Desert. Other aims included, as well as the collection of scientific specimens, finding evidence of the fate of the lost Leichhardt expedition of 1848, and opening a stock route between the Northern Territory and the Western Australian goldfields.Birman, Wendy, 'Calvert, Albert Frederick (1872–1946)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 26 May 2012.

By 21 July, they had reached the limits of previously explored territory and known water supplies. In early August, they were advancing into the Great Sandy Desert and having problems with the availability of water and with camels falling sick through the consumption of poisonous plants. In October, Charles Wells and Jones left to make a side journey towards the north-west, intending to rejoin the others later. On 9 November, the main party reached the track from Derby to the Fitzroy Crossing, and Quanbun Station on 13 November. Concern for the two missing members of the expedition led to a series of search parties, with their mummified bodies eventually being found on 27 May 1897. Jones' diary, found with his body, indicated that they had died from extreme heat and lack of water on about 21 November 1896 while following in the tracks of the main party. The bodies were returned to Adelaide, where a state funeral was held for them on 18 July 1897. ==Aftermath== Albert Calvert was unable to meet the full costs of the expedition and the subsequent search parties, with the shortfall made up by the South Australian and Western Australian governments. Larry Wells’ leadership was heavily criticised in the media, though some two years later a Parliamentary select committee cleared him of any blame. ==See also== * Carnegie expedition of 1896 ==References== Category:Exploration of Western Australia Category:Australian expeditions Category:Great Sandy Desert Category:1896 in Australia Category:1897 in Australia Category:Canning Stock Route Category:19th century in Western Australia Category:1890s in Western Australia ","title":"Calvert expedition"},{"id":"35940181","text":"\\"Railroad\\" is the first solo single released by Maurice Gibb, best known as a member of the Bee Gees.

The easiest way to access the falls is by way of the Jenny Lake boat shuttle which goes from South Jenny Lake to the entrance of Cascade Canyon. From there it is a roundtrip hike along the Cascade Canyon Trail to viewing points for the falls. Another option is to hike roundtrip from South Jenny Lake on the Jenny Lake Trail.

It was released on January 24, 2012, as the first single from the album. == Background == The song was produced by Ian Eskelin, and the song was co-written by David Frey, Ben Glover and Ben McDonald. This song was recorded at Dark Horse Recording Studio in Franklin, Tennessee. The song is meant to teach believers to live according to how Jesus Christ lived, which means a true reliance on God, and that needs to come from a contrite individual. This song is meant as the primary theme the album is based upon. The band utilized two versus of scripture as inspiration for the album, and those come from Hebrews 12:1-2 and 1 Thessalonians 1:2-6. == Composition == It has been called a Brit-rock type song that has many questions to be asked of the believers. This is in order for us to live our lives that others see Jesus Christ through them, and choose to follow our Savior. == Release == \\"Live Like That\\" was digitally released as the lead single from Live Like That on January 24, 2012. ==Critical reception== Christian Music Zine's Joshua Andre wrote that the song meant \\"As Christians, living our lives for Jesus and being the light and salt of the world is what ultimately will draw people into the love of God. If we are not living out our faith, how can we expect non-Christians to respect Christianity and Jesus enough to become Christians themselves?\\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Roger Gelwicks said the song \\"asks hard questions about the nature of grace to change one's life and pleads for a living testimony for Jesus\\". New Release Tuesday's Kevin Davis wrote the song \\"sums up the theme of this great band’s mission which is to reflect Christ in their songs and actions and is a wonderful worship anthem with some Brit-rock guitar work layered throughout. == Videos ==  Music  The band has made a music video of the song that in portions contains lyrics.

Pigment and paint grinding equipment was found in a cave at Twin Rivers near Lusaka, Zambia. * 31,000 BCE – Representational painting was invented. Murals of stampeding bulls, cantering horses, red bears and woolly rhinoceros are found in the Chauvet Caves in France. * 22,000 BCE – Sculpture was invented by Paleolithic tribes who created the female statuette called the Venus of Willendorf, found in near Willendorf, Austria. * 4000 BCE – Papyrus, the precursor to paper, was invented by the Egyptians by pounding flat woven mats of reeds. * 2500 BCE – Egyptian blue pigment was invented by Egyptian chemists using a mixture of limestone (calcium oxide), malachite (copper oxide) and quartz (silica) fired to about 800–900 degrees Celsius. * 500 BCE – Encaustic paints are invented by Greek artists by mixing colored pigments and wax. * 450 BCE – Depicting the illusion of three-dimensional form on a two- dimensional surface was invented with the chiaroscuro painting technique that employs highlights and shadows. * 250 BCE – Glassblowing was invented by Syrian craftsmen in Babylonia. * 105 – Paper was invented by Ts’ai Lun, a Chinese court official. * 650 – Porcelain was invented by Chinese artists in the Tang Dynasty as a fired mixture of kaolin (a clay) and petuntse (a feldspar). * 1306 – A more naturalistic means of representational painting was invented by Giotto di Bondone using depth, perspective and temporal realism to present a single moment in time. * 15th century – A cupola or dome which did not require a framework supporting its curves was invented by Filippo Brunelleschi. To transport the large stones to the construction site, Brunelleschi invented a unique boat capable of moving heavy cargo upriver and was granted exclusive rights to use his boat to move heavy loads, patent rights.Patenting Art and Entertainment by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim * 15th century – Linear perspective was invented with work by Filippo Brunelleschi, and a treatise on perspective theory by Leon Battista Alberti. Perspective is a method for depicting the illusion of three-dimensions on a two-dimensional surface.ArtLex at www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Li.html * 1420 – The use of a single, consistent light source in painting with figures painted to appear three-dimensional was invented by the Italian artist Masaccio (Tommaso di Giovanni). See his 1427 painting, \\"Tribute Money\\". * 1485 – Sfumato, a painting technique in which an atmospheric or blurry effect is created with minute transitions between color areas, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci. Sfumato is seen in Leonardo's \\"Virgin on the Rocks\\" and \\"Mona Lisa\\". * 1503 – Surrealism was invented by Flemish artist Hieronymus Bosch with his triptych \\"The Garden of Earthly Delights\\". * 1774 – Jasperware, a dense vitreous pottery that could be turned on a lathe, was invented by Josiah Wedgwood. * 1816 – The first recorded image was invented by Joseph Nicephore Niepce using a sheet of silver-plated copper sensitized with chlorine or bromine fumes in addition to the iodine vapor. * 1816 – a resolution contrast technique of painting and drawing was invented by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres who used it to depict faces in high resolution with the rest of the image in low resolution, as for example in his drawing \\"Mrs. Charles Badham\\". * 1861 – The color photograph was invented by physicist James Clerk Maxwell. * 1863 – Multiple subject painting was invented by Édouard Manet. His \\"Le dejeuner sur l'herbe\\" presents four disconnected figures not looking at one another, lighted from different directions. Dejeuner sur l'herbe also has a disconnected background-to-foreground perspective that eliminates the middle ground. * 1865 – Chromolithograph prints were invented by Jules Chéret. * 1872 – Serial photomontage, the precursor to motion pictures, was invented by Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey by using multiple cameras to photograph moving objects. * 1873 – Nonlinear horizon lines were invented by Édouard Manet, eliminating the horizon line in his 1874 painting \\"Boating\\". * 1882 – Multiple time depiction was invented by Édouard Manet in his \\"A Bar at the Folies-Bergère\\", which depicts a bar scene from two points in space at two different moments in time. * 1884 – Pointillism was invented by Georges Seurat, who created entire paintings using small dots of pure unmixed color. * 1886 – Trompe l'oeil was invented by William Michael Harnett, an American painter. * 1888 – A technique of portraying a subject from different perspectives and of distorting subject matter in painting was invented by Paul Cézanne. * 1891 – A technique of unfreezing time in still images was invented by Claude Monet, who painted the same subject at many different times during the day, showing how it appeared differently largely due to the change in natural light. He painted the cathedral at Rouen at 40 different times of the day and he painted the same haystack at 20 different moments in a year. * 1902- A technique of indeterminate time was invented in painting by Paul Cézanne in his painting \\"Mont Sainte-Victorie\\", in which the sources and direction of light are not discernible. * 1902 – The teddy bear was invented by Morris and Rose Michtom based on a cartoon of a bear saved by President Theodore Roosevelt. * 1903 – The 3-D (three-dimensional) movie was invented by Auguste and Louis Lumière with their one-minute film \\"L’Arrivée du Train\\". * 1904 – Fauvism was invented by Henri Matisse, Maurice de Vlaminck, André Derain and others. * 1907 – A variety of special effects for film were invented by Georges Méliès in his film Tunneling the English Channel, including stop-motion photography, split-screen photography, stop action animation and the combination of live action with full-scale mechanical backgrounds. * 1915 – The multistable image was invented by W. E. Hill, with his drawing \\"My Wife and My Mother-in-Law\\", an image that can present either a young woman or an older woman.Patenting Art and Entertainment by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim * 1908 to 1917 – Cubism was invented by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.

Cubism revolutionized western art, and influenced other art forms like music and literature. * 1912 – Collage was invented by Picasso with his \\"Still Life with Chair Caning\\". Attaching a material from the real world that was not ever used in high art into a painting violated what was previously considered the integrity of the artwork. Collage was a new process for making art, a new art form, and it expanded the definition of art. * 1912 – The Construction was invented by Picasso when he created \\"Guitar\\" in 1912 by joining parts together.

Sister Jane EBSB holding a crucifix donated to the convent chapel. The Benedictine Sisters of Bethany (EBSB) is a religious Order for women within the Anglican Church in Cameroon, West Africa. Its mother house (main convent) is in Bamenda. Its principal work is the care of orphaned street children. ==History== The community's history begins with the Emmanuel Sisterhood, an order of nuns in the Presbyterian Church of Cameroon. One of the sisters of this order, Sister Jane Mankaa, who joined the community aged 16, felt a strong calling years later to convert to the Anglican Communion and start new work with homeless street children.Anglican Religious Life 2012-13, Canterbury Press, Norwich, , page 145. She did so, but with the permission of the Bishop of Cameroon, she remained living under vows and adopted the Benedictine Rule. After studying convent management in the United States for one year and living with the Episcopal Community of St. John Baptist in Mendham, New Jersey, Sister Jane returned to Cameroon. Women gathered around her to learn from her and the Benedictine Sisters of Bethany were born. The order became Cameroon's first Anglican religious community.The community is referenced on the international and interdenominational website of the worldwide Benedictine Order. The community is called the \\"Benedictine Sisters of Bethany\\" (BSB), but sisters use the post-nominal initials EBSB, in which the \\"E\\" is a reference to \\"Emmanuel\\", the sisterhood in which Sr Jane first took vows.Anglican Religious Life 2012-13, Canterbury Press, Norwich, , page 200. In Bamenda, a convent and dormitory with chapel and refectory have been constructed. Redeemer Nursery School is in operation on the compound. The Roberto Rovere Health Clinic is under construction on site to meet the needs of the children and area villagers. Plans are currently underway to construct Good Shepherd Academy, Anglican, a co-ed secondary/high school for 600 residential students in Bafut, Cameroon. http://www.goodshepherdhome.org There are future plans to construct a residential home and hospice for children with AIDS. ==The Good Shepherd Home, Bamenda== Sister Jane felt a strong call to care for the many homeless children of Cameroon, some of whom were orphans (often due to their parents having died of AIDS), whilst others were simply more than their parents (with over-large families) could care for. The Good Shepherd Home in Bamenda, Cameroon now cares for 100 children who would otherwise be homeless.See the report of American supporters at this webpage . They are given a loving family life, food, shelter, and protection from the sometimes violent life of the city. Today, the Home has four self-sustaining projects - a chicken farm, pig farm, bakery and three vegetable farms. In addition, Good Shepherd Home relies on donations of food from local people and donations of money from overseas supporters.. ==Security== Following a series of robberies and attacks that culminated in a raid by armed robbers who threatened to kill the sisters, a security system has been installed to alert the local neighbourhood if the convent is attacked.See report here at the Episcopal News Service, USA. ==Batibo== In 2010 the community opened a second convent and orphanage at Batibo, Cameroon, for special needs orphans, expanding the outreach and care provided. The Sisters of Bethany now care for approximately 150 orphaned children across the two sites, as well as many others who are fed or supported with medical care.See report on page 9 of this 2012 newsletter . A second bakery and a store are the two self-sustaining projects of the Batibo home. ==Media== *Geitz, Elizabeth I Am That Child: Changing Hearts and Changing the World Morehouse Publishing, 2012. *Licostie, Nadine, Director The Good Mother of Abangoh.

The book presents a dialogue between Girard and the psychiatrists Jean- Michel Oughourlian and Guy Lefort; the dialogue interrogates and develops Girard's central thesis. Girard's explicates three core mechanisms that govern widespread social interactions: mimesis, the process by which individuals copy one another in escalation, leading to conflict; scapegoating, a process by which collective guilt is transferred onto victims, then purged; and violence. Mimetic theory posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: \\"It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world,\\" but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: \\"rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another.\\" ==Publication history== Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World was first published in French in 1978 by Éditions Grasset & Fasquelle. In 1987, an English translation was published by The Athlone Press in the United Kingdom and Stanford University Press in the United States. ==Reception== The book became a national bestseller in France, and according to Chris Fleming offers \\"very substantial\\" reflection on the Judaeo-Christian texts and provoked \\"intense (and often heated) discussion in the upper echelons of the French academy. Theorists such as Michel Serres, Paul Ricoeur, and Philippe Sollers were all admirers of the work, and, later, other theorists such as the renowned Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo and the Canadian social and political theorist Charles Taylor expressed - and, indeed, continue to express - more than a token admiration for Girard's project.\\" ==References== Bibliography ;Books * * Category:1978 non-fiction books Category:Books by René Girard Category:Éditions Grasset books Category:French non-fiction books ","title":"Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World"},{"id":"35940655","text":"The 1985–86 NBA season was the Warriors' 40th season in the NBA and 23rd in the San Francisco Bay Area.1985-86 Golden State Warriors ==Draft picks== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 17319c;color:yellow;\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 17319c;color:yellow;\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 17319c;color:yellow;\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 17319c;color:yellow;\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 17319c;color:yellow;\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 17319c;color:yellow;\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  7  Chris Mullin  SG/SF   St. John's - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  42  Bobby Lee Hurt    Alabama - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  3  49  Brad Wright    UCLA - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  4  71  Luster Goodwin    Texas-El Paso - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  5  95  Greg Cavener    Missouri - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  6  117  Gerald Crosby    Georgia - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  7  141  Eric Boyd    North Carolina A&T; } ==RosterRegular season== *On Wednesday, January 15, 1986, the Warriors scored 150 points in a 150-104 regulation victory over the Utah Jazz.

The Warriors got off to a bad start losing 14 of their first 18 games, but posted two six-game winning streaks afterwards winning 12 of their next 15 games. However, midway through the season they struggled and fell below .500, missing the playoffs by finishing fifth in the Pacific Division with a 37–45 record. In a win over the Boston Celtics in the 38th game of the season, Hardaway, Mullin and Richmond all surpassed 20 points in the same game for the first time. The Warriors led the NBA in scoring during the season. ==Draft picks== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 17319c;color:yellow;\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 17319c;color:yellow;\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 17319c;color:yellow;\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 17319c;color:yellow;\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 17319c;color:yellow;\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 17319c;color:yellow;\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  14  Tim Hardaway  PG   Texas-El Paso } ==RosterRegular season== Season standings :z - clinched division title :y - clinched division title :x - clinched playoff spot Record vs. opponents {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=281989-90 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !008080;color:#800080;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000080;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"CLE !008000;color:#00008B;width=35\\"DAL !0000CD;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"DEN !0000FF;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"DET !0000FF;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"GSW !FF0000;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !006400;color:#B22222;width=35\\"MIL !0000FF;color:#228B22;width=35\\"MIN !B0170C;color:#00056D;width=35\\"NJN !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !FF0000;color:#0000FF;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !0000FF;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#FFC322;width=35\\"SEA !36004A;color:#FFFF00;width=35\\"UTA !DC143C;color:#0000CD;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  1–3  2–0  0–5  2–3  0–2  1–1  3–2  2–0  2–0  2–3  1–1  0–2  4–0  3–2  1–1  2–2  1–3  5–0  2–2  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  2–2 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Boston  3–1  —  2–0  2–2  3–1  1–1  1–1  2–2  1–1  2–0  1–3  1–1  0–2  5–0  2–2  1–1  5–1  4–1  4–0  3–2  1–1  0–2  2–0  1–1  2–0  1–1  2–3 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Charlotte  0–2  0–2  —  0–2  1–1  1–3  3–2  0–2  2–2  1–4  1–1  2–2  0–4  1–1  0–2  2–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  0–2  1–3  0–4  1–3  0–5  0–4  0–5  0–2 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Chicago  5–0  2–2  2–0  —  5–0  2–0  1–1  1–4  2–0  1–1  2–3  1–1  1–1  4–0  4–1  2–0  3–1  3–1  3–2  2–2  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  0–2  3–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Cleveland  3–2  1–3  1–1  0–5  —  0–2  0–2  1–4  1–1  0–2  3–2  1–1  1–1  4–0  3–2  1–1  4–0  2–2  4–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  3–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Dallas  2–0  1–1  3–1  0–2  2–0  —  2–3  1–1  3–1  4–1  2–0  3–1  0–4  2–0  1–1  4–1  2–0  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–3  0–4  3–1  3–2  2–2  1–3  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Denver  1–1  1–1  2–3  1–1  2–0  3–2  —  0–2  2–2  4–1  0–2  2–2  0–4  2–0  1–1  5–0  2–0  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–3  2–2  4–0  1–3  2–2  0–4  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Detroit  2–3  2–2  2–0  4–1  4–1  1–1  2–0  —  1–1  1–1  4–1  1–1  1–1  3–1  3–2  2–0  4–0  4–0  5–0  1–3  2–0  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  4–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Golden State  0–2  1–1  2–2  0–2  1–1  1–3  2–2  1–1  —  2–2  1–1  3–1  1–4  2–0  1–1  3–1  2–0  0–2  2–0  1–1  0–5  2–2  3–2  1–3  2–3  2–2  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Houston  0–2  0–2  4–1  1–1  2–0  1–4  1–4  1–1  2–2  —  1–1  2–2  2–2  1–1  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  2–2  1–3  4–0  2–2  2–2  3–2  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Indiana  3–2  3–1  1–1  3–2  2–3  0–2  2–0  1–4  1–1  1–1  —  0–2  0–2  3–1  3–2  1–1  4–0  1–3  4–1  0–4  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  3–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  L.A.

March 17, 1929 in Tepatitlan, Jalisco), also known as \\"El Catorce\\" (The Fourteen), was a Mexican General of the Cristero War known for his excellent combat skills. == Early life == Map of the southern half of Los Altos de Jalisco. San Miguel el Alto municipality, Ramirez's birthplace, is labeled with the number 8. Victoriano Ramirez was born on April 13, 1888, at the Buena Vista ranch in the municipality of San Miguel el Alto to parents Carlos Ramirez and Viviana Lopez, and he had four siblings: sisters Francisca and Paulina, as well as brothers Pedro and Vicente. It was noted that, as a child, Ramirez was very humble and smiled often. Ramirez, like many children living in the rural areas of Los Altos during the late 19th-century, never attended school. He was never taught to read or write, but his parents taught him how to pray and taught him basic life skills. Victoriano's father, was a farmer, barely making enough money with which to sustain the family, and his mother tended to the household, caring for him and his siblings while educating them on matters such as behavior as well as the Catholic religion, where she instilled in her children a disapproval of Protestants. Ramirez had his first Holy Communion when he was ten years old, almost certainly during the liturgical Easter season in the spring of 1898. During his teenage years, Victoriano was taught how to protect livestock and how to farm. == Adulthood ==  In the United States  At the age of 20, Ramirez decided to head north to the United States in order to make more money. He arrived in \\"the north\\" probably sometime in 1908, and he sent money and letters to his parents back in Jalisco. After a year and a half, Ramirez returned home. Shortly after, his mother, ill and weakened by her age and the absence of her son, died, predeceasing her husband and leaving behind her five grown children.  Alias  Legend holds that once, when he escaped from a prison in San Miguel el Alto, Jalisco where he was waiting for a murder trial after quarrel, a detachment of fourteen armed men went to look for him at a hill. Forced to fight against his pursuers, the fugitive hid among the crags of a ravine and after a long firefight killed all his opponents. When he was sure of his victory, he took the field and picked up the fourteen arms of his victims and sent them to the mayor of San Miguel with a message, advising him \\"not to send such few people\\", earning him the name \\"El Catorce\\" (The Fourteen). ==Cristero War==  Military success  Encarnación de Diaz. Ramirez, was among the first to join the Cristero rebellion. He was one of the few Cristeros who did not desert the fight in May of 1927. He commanded the \\"Fourteen Dragons\\" squadron, which was part of the San Julian regiment under the command of General Miguel Hernandez. His first acts as a Cristero were spoken of as legendary feats, and tradition goes that when \\"Callistas\\" (federal troops) heard the cry of \\"Viva El Catorce!\\", it struck fear in their hearts during fighting. Additionally, Ramirez also had a reputation for superb accuracy. On March 15, 1927 the Battle of San Julian began, and \\"El Catorce\\" had to resist a day of federal charges by General Espiridión Rodriguez before General Miguel Hernandez arrived the next day to support him. Eventually, the battle resulted in a Cristero victory, and the federal army suffered their worst defeat in the entire war.  Downfall  The difficulties that arose between Ramirez and his companions began, it seems, with organizational reforms that General Enrique Gorostieta Velarde deemed necessary to establish between contingent Cristeros. Ramirez, perhaps feeling that his authority was being undermined, put a number of obstacles to the proposed new organization. In view of his attitude, he was relieved of his duties, and was banned from having armed men, except for a small escort. Ramirez did not obey these orders, and as he was liked by the people of San Miguel el Alto, they increased his armed escorts. Father Aristeo Pedroza invited him to refocus on the Cristero struggle but Victoriano refused. These refusals antagonized other Cristero leaders, and Aristeo Pedroza, Heriberto Navarrete, and Mario Valdes, eventually pursued Ramirez with 300 men. By then, Ramirez was fortified at the top of El Carretero, along with 100 colleagues. Death and burial San Miguel el Alto, the town where Ramirez is buried. Ramirez was eventually arrested and accused of embezzlement, insubordination and resistance to higher orders. For these accusations, Father Aristeo Pedroza ordered his execution, and to avoid commotions amongst the Cristeros, as El Catorce was highly esteemed, it was resolved immediately to fulfill the sentence. The details surrounding Ramirez's death are uncertain. One source states that, in order to avoid a popular uproar of the locals in Tepatitlan, Valdes had Ramirez stabbed to death in a discrete manner. Another source states that at the time of his execution, he barricaded himself in his cell, so they had to break down the door with a battering ram to lead him to the place of execution. However, he jumped out with intentions of snatching a rifle of the nearest man, but was mortally wounded by a bullet to the chest. His remains rest in the Guadalupana catacombs, under the Temple of Our Lady of Guadalupe in the city of San Miguel el Alto. == Personal life == Victoriano Ramirez married Dolores Gutierrez, and the couple had a daughter, Natalia Ramirez Gutierrez. Even though Ramirez as married, he was known to be unfaithful. Locals commented that it was easy to figure out in which ranches you could find \\"his women\\". Ramirez and Father Heriberto Navarrete had a conversation, and it is said that the priest was struck by Ramirez's behavior and asked him the name of his legitimate wife, to which he replied: \\"Any woman is legitimate\\". ==Legacy== At hearing about Ramirez's death, the Mexican Army General Saturnino Cedillo said, \\"El Catorce was killed by his own comrades, idiots! They don't realize what they did. They cut the head of the snake, and left the tail to me\\". The death of \\"El Catorce\\" generated confrontations between General Miguel Hernandez and General Enrique Gorostieta Velarde as well as an extremely negative reaction from the local population, which had held Ramirez with high regard.  In popular culture  El Catorce was portrayed by actor Oscar Isaac in the film Cristiada (also titled For Greater Glory), an epic historical drama also starring Andy Garcia, Eva Longoria, Eduardo Verástegui and Peter O'Toole. In the film El Catorce meets a much more heroic end. ==References *Personajes políticos mexicanos pages p179-182 Category:Cristero War Category:1888 births Category:1929 deaths Category:People from Jalisco Category:Mexican generals __FORCETOC__ ","title":"Victoriano Ramírez"},{"id":"35940726","text":"Sir John Frederick Rossiter KBE (17 December 1913 - 18 January 1988) was an Australian politician.

Hardaway and Mullin were both selected for the 1993 NBA All-Star Game, but Mullin did not participate due to injury. Following the season, Tyrone Hill was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers. ==Offseason== Draft picks { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 003399; color:#FFCC33\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 003399; color:#FFCC33\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 003399; color:#FFCC33\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 003399; color:#FFCC33\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 003399; color:#FFCC33\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 003399; color:#FFCC33\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  24  Latrell Sprewell  SG/SF   Alabama - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  43  Predrag Danilović  SG/SF   - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  50  Matt Fish  C   North Carolina- Wilmington } ==RosterRegular season== Season standings :z - clinched division title :y - clinched division title :x - clinched playoff spot Record vs. opponents {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=281992-93 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !008080;color:#800080;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000080;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"CLE !008000;color:#00008B;width=35\\"DAL !0000CD;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"DEN !0000FF;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"DET !0000FF;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"GSW !FF0000;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !006400;color:#B22222;width=35\\"MIL !0000FF;color:#228B22;width=35\\"MIN !DC143C;color:#0000CD;width=35\\"NJN !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !FF0000;color:#0000FF;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !0000FF;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#FFC322;width=35\\"SEA !36004A;color:#FFFF00;width=35\\"UTA !DC143C;color:#0000CD;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  2–2  3–2  2–2  0–5  1–1  2–0  2–3  2–0  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  3–1  3–2  2–0  1–3  2–2  1–3  3–1  0–2  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  2–0  2–2 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Boston  2–2  —  3–1  1–3  3–1  2–0  2–0  1–3  2–0  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  3–1  2–2  2–0  4–0  1–4  3–2  4–1  0–2  2–0  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  4–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Charlotte  2–3  1–3  —  2–3  1–3  2–0  1–1  4–1  2–0  0–2  0–5  1–1  1–1  2–2  3–1  2–0  2–2  1–3  3–1  4–0  0–2  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  4–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Chicago  2–2  3–1  3–2  —  2–3  2–0  1–1  3–1  2–0  0–2  5–0  2–0  0–2  3–1  4–1  2–0  4–0  1–3  3–1  2–2  1–1  2–0  2–0  0–2  2–0  2–0  4–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Cleveland  5–0  1–3  3–1  3–2  —  2–0  1–1  3–2  2–0  1–1  4–0  1–1  2–0  2–2  4–1  2–0  2–2  1–3  2–2  4–0  2–0  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  3–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Dallas  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  —  1–5  1–1  0–4  1–4  1–1  0–4  1–3  0–2  0–2  1–4  0–2  0–2  1–1  1–1  0–4  0–4  0–4  0–5  1–3  0–5  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Denver  0–2  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  5–1  —  1–1  3–1  2–3  1–1  2–2  1–3  0–2  1–1  3–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  1–3  1–3  3–1  1–4  1–3  2–3  2–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Detroit  3–2  3–1  1–4  1–3  2–3  1–1  1–1  —  0–2  1–1  3–2  1–1  1–1  1–3  2–2  1–1  3–1  2–2  3–1  3–1  0–2  1–1  2–0  0–2  0–2  0–2  4–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Golden State  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  4–0  1–3  2–0  —  2–2  0–2  2–3  1–4  2–0  1–1  3–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–4  0–5  4–1  3–1  1–4  3–1  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Houston  1–1  1–1  2–0  2–0  1–1  4–1  3–2  1–1  2–2  —  2–0  4–0  3–1  2–0  1–1  4–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  2–0  2–2  1–3  4–0  4–1  1–3  4–1  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Indiana  2–2  2–2  5–0  0–5  0–4  1–1  1–1  2–3  2–0  0–2  —  1–1  1–1  2–2  2–3  1–1  3–1  1–3  2–2  3–1  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  2–0  0–2  3–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  L.A.

During the offseason, the team acquired B.J. Armstrong from the expansion Toronto Raptors and signed free agent Jerome Kersey. With Armstrong in the lineup at point guard, Tim Hardaway played off the bench for most of the first half of the season. Midway through the season, he was traded along with Chris Gatling to the Miami Heat for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles.

Also following the season, Price was dealt to the Orlando Magic, Burrell was sent to the Chicago Bulls, and head coach Rick Adelman was fired. ==Offseason== Draft picks { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 003399; color:#FFCC33\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 003399; color:#FFCC33\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 003399; color:#FFCC33\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 003399; color:#FFCC33\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 003399; color:#FFCC33\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 003399; color:#FFCC33\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  11  Todd Fuller  C   North Carolina State - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  40  Marcus Mann  PF   Mississippi Valley State } ==Roster== Roster Notes *Center Jon Koncak missed the entire season due to a knee injury. *Center Mike Peplowski missed the entire season with a torn knee ligament. ==Regular season== Season standings :z - clinched division title :y - clinched division title :x - clinched playoff spot Record vs. opponents {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=301996-97 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !008080;color:#800080;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000000;color:#5787DC;width=35\\"CLE !00008B;color:#008000;width=35\\"DAL !141A44;color:#BC2224;width=35\\"DEN !0C7674;color:#BB222C;width=35\\"DET !0000FF;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"GSW !002366;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !00471B;color:#5C378A;width=35\\"MIL !044D80;color:#000000;width=35\\"MIN !DC143C;color:#0000CD;width=35\\"NJN !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !FF0000;color:#0000FF;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !6846A8;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#992634;width=35\\"SEA !7436BF;color:#BE0F34;width=35\\"TOR !644A9C;color:#149BC7;width=35\\"UTA !0CB2AC;color:#000000;width=35\\"VAN !DC143C;color:#0000CD;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  3–1  1–3  1–3  3–1  2–0  1–1  1–3  2–0  1–1  3–1  2–0  1–1  1–2  4–0  2–0  3–1  1–3  3–1  4–0  1–1  2–0  2–0  2–0  1–1  4–0  1–1  2–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  1–3  —  0–4  0–4  1–2  1–1  1–1  0–4  1–1  0–2  1–2  0–2  1–1  0–4  1–3  0–2  0–4  0–4  0–4  1–3  1–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  3–1  0–2  0–2  0–4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Charlotte  3–1  4–0  —  0–4  3–1  1–1  2–0  2–2  2–0  2–0  2–2  1–1  1–1  1–2  2–2  2–0  4–0  3–1  1–2  4–0  1–1  0–2  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–2  0–2  2–0  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Chicago  3–1  4–0  4–0  —  3–1  2–0  2–0  3–1  2–0  1–1  4–0  2–0  1–1  2–2  4–0  2–0  3–1  2–2  3–0  4–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  3–1  1–1  2–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cleveland  1–3  2–1  1–3  1–3  —  2–0  1–1  2–2  1–1  0–2  3–1  2–0  1–1  0–4  2–2  2–0  4–0  1–3  2–2  3–0  1–1  1–1  2–0  0–2  0–2  3–1  1–1  2–0  1–3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Dallas  0–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  —  3–1  0–2  0–4  0–4  1–1  2–2  0–4  0–2  0–2  1–3  1–1  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–3  1–3  2–2  1–3  1–3  0–2  1–3  3–1  0–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Denver  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  1–3  —  0–2  1–3  1–3  0–2  1–3  0–4  0–2  1–1  0–4  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  2–2  0–4  2–2  2–2  0–4  1–1  0–4  3–1  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Detroit  3–1  4–0  2–2  1–3  2–2  2–0  2–0  —  2–0  1–1  3–1  2–0  1–1  0–4  3–1  2–0  4–0  1–2  2–2  2–1  0–2  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  3–1  1–1  2–0  4–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Golden State  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  4–0  3–1  0–2  —  0–4  1–1  1–3  0–4  0–2  1–1  1–3  2–0  0–2  1–1  2–0  0–4  2–2  1–3  4–0  0–4  2–0  0–4  3–1  0–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Houston  1–1  2–0  0–2  1–1  2–0  4–0  3–1  1–1  4–0  —  1–1  3–1  3–1  0–2  1–1  4–0  2–0  1–1  0–2  2–0  2–2  2–2  4–0  3–1  3–1  1–1  2–2  3–1  2–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Indiana  1–3  2–1  2–2  0–4  1–3  1–1  2–0  1–3  1–1  1–1  —  2–0  1–1  1–3  2–2  2–0  2–2  1–3  1–3  3–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  4–0  0–2  2–0  1–3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  L.A.

During the offseason, the Warriors acquired second-year center Erick Dampier from the Indiana Pacers, and Brian Shaw from the Orlando Magic. Early into the season, they traded B.J. Armstrong to the Charlotte Hornets for Muggsy Bogues and Tony Delk. However, the Warriors struggled, losing 13 of their first 14 games of the season. Things would get worse in December as Latrell Sprewell choked new head coach P.J. Carlesimo during practice, and was suspended for the remainder of the season, which was 68 games. Without Sprewell, the Warriors then suffered a 14-game losing streak as the season progressed. Midway through the season, the team traded Shaw along with Joe Smith to the Philadelphia 76ers for Jim Jackson and Clarence Weatherspoon, while acquiring Jason Caffey from the Chicago Bulls. The Warriors finished sixth in the Pacific Division with an awful 19–63 record. Following the season, Sprewell was traded to the New York Knicks, Jackson signed as a free agent with the Portland Trail Blazers, and Weatherspoon signed with the Miami Heat. The Warriors new uniforms lasted until 2002, while the logo remained in use until 2010. ==Offseason== Draft picks { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  8  Adonal Foyle  C/PF   Colgate - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  2  37  Marc Jackson  C   Temple } ==RosterRegular season== Season standings :z - clinched division title :y - clinched division title :x - clinched playoff spot Record vs. opponents {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=301997-98 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !008080;color:#800080;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000000;color:#5787DC;width=35\\"CLE !00008B;color:#008000;width=35\\"DAL !141A44;color:#BC2224;width=35\\"DEN !0C7674;color:#BB222C;width=35\\"DET !072E63;color:#DC5A34;width=35\\"GSW !002366;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !00471B;color:#5C378A;width=35\\"MIL !044D80;color:#000000;width=35\\"MIN !12305B;color:#C4CED4;width=35\\"NJN !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !000000;color:#BB9754;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !6846A8;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#992634;width=35\\"SEA !7436BF;color:#BE0F34;width=35\\"TOR !644A9C;color:#149BC7;width=35\\"UTA !0CB2AC;color:#000000;width=35\\"VAN !044D7D;color:#BC7A44;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  2–1  4–0  1–3  4–0  2–0  2–0  2–2  2–0  1–1  1–3  2–0  0–2  1–3  3–1  0–2  1–2  2–2  2–2  3–1  0–2  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  4–0  0–2  2–0  4–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  1–2  —  1–2  1–3  1–3  1–1  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  0–4  2–0  1–1  0–4  2–2  1–1  2–2  2–2  2–2  3–1  0–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  3–0  0–2  2–0  3–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Charlotte  0–4  2–1  —  1–3  2–2  2–0  2–0  3–1  1–1  2–0  3–1  2–0  1–1  3–1  3–1  1–1  2–2  1–3  3–1  2–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  4–0  1–1  2–0  2–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Chicago  3–1  3–1  3–1  —  2–2  1–1  2–0  3–1  2–0  2–0  2–2  2–0  1–1  2–1  4–0  1–1  4–0  4–0  3–1  2–1  1–1  1–1  2–0  2–0  1–1  4–0  0–2  2–0  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cleveland  0–4  3–1  2–2  2–2  —  1–1  2–0  3–1  2–0  1–1  2–2  2–0  1–1  1–3  2–2  2–0  3–1  1–2  2–2  3–1  2–0  1–1  2–0  0–2  0–2  3–1  1–1  2–0  1–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Dallas  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  1–1  —  3–1  0–2  1–3  0–4  1–1  1–3  0–4  0–2  0–2  2–2  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–4  0–4  0–4  0–4  2–2  1–1  0–4  4–0  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Denver  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–2  1–3  —  0–2  1–3  0–4  0–2  2–2  0–4  0–2  0–2  1–3  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–4  2–2  1–3  0–4  0–4  0–2  0–4  1–3  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Detroit  2–2  2–2  1–3  1–3  1–3  2–0  2–0  —  2–0  1–1  1–3  2–0  0–2  1–2  2–2  0–2  2–2  2–2  1–2  3–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  4–0  0–2  0–2  2–2 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Golden State  0–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  3–1  3–1  0–2  —  1–3  0–2  1–3  1–3  0–2  0–2  0–4  0–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–4  1–3  2–2  1–3  1–3  0–2  0–4  1–3  0–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Houston  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  4–0  4–0  1–1  3–1  —  1–1  4–0  1–3  0–2  1–1  1–3  1–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  1–3  1–3  4–0  2–2  1–3  2–0  0–4  3–1  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Indiana  3–1  4–0  1–3  2–2  2–2  1–1  2–0  3–1  2–0  1–1  —  2–0  0–2  3–1  4–0  2–0  2–1  2–1  3–1  4–0  1–1  1–1  2–0  0–2  0–2  4–0  1–1  2–0  4–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  L.A.

It defines a criminal offence of distributing or exhibiting a film that was \\"organised or directed in such a way as to involve the cruel infliction of pain or terror on any animal or the cruel goading of any animal to fury\\"Section 1 of the Act, retrieved 26 May 2012 \\\\- in other words, one in which actual cruelty to animals (as distinct from simulated, e.g. through the use of special effects or CGI) was photographed and/or occurred during the production. Offences under the Act are punishable by a fine and/or up to three months' imprisonment. Section 2 of the Act creates a valid defence that the defendant \\"had reasonable cause to believe\\" that scenes of animal cruelty in a film were simulated, not actual. The definition of an animal under the Act is that of the Protection of Animals Act 1911. ==History== It is unclear why the Act was passed when it was, or if any single event prompted it to be put before Parliament. Concern had been expressed in the press during the early to mid-1930s at scenes in mainstream feature films that were suspected of showing actual animal cruelty, one prominent example being Island of Lost Souls (1932). According to the British Board of Film Classification's website, the Act was a response to \\"widespread public concern about the mistreatment of animals on film sets, especially in Westerns.\\"Students' BBFC - Criminal Law , retrieved 26 May 2012 If true, this would explain why the Act made distributing and/or exhibiting animal cruelty footage an offence, but not producing it, given that Westerns were produced outside the jurisdiction of United Kingdom law. ==Contemporary usage== The Act has never been repealed, and remains in force. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), in keeping with their policy of not sanctioning the release of any film if it believes that the release itself could constitute a criminal act, will occasionally refuse a certificate or require cuts to scenes it suspects involve actual animal cruelty. A notable case was the UK release of Amores perros in 2001, in which the BBFC accepted the producers' claim that controversial dog fighting scenes were simulated, not actual, and passed the film uncut.Review of the Film in The Daily Telegraph, 4 May 2001, retrieved 26 May 2012 The phrase 'cruel infliction' is understood to mean cruelty to animals that was specifically and gratuitously inflicted with the sole purpose of creating an entertainment film. Therefore, for example, the screening of a documentary about bullfighting or an educational film about vivisection in medical research would be unlikely to result in prosecution under the Act, because any footage of actual animal cruelty would be of an event that would have taken place regardless of whether or not it had been filmed, and the purpose of screening that footage is not entertainment. However, a film such as Electrocuting an Elephant would probably fall foul of the Act (had it been in force at the time), as the electrocution took place primarily as a public spectacle, and it was filmed purely for popular entertainment purposes. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Hunnings, Neville March, Film Censors and the Law, London, George Allen & Unwin (1967), . * Richards, Jeffrey, The Age of the Dream Palace: Cinema and Society in Britain, 1930-1939, London, Routledge (1984), . ==External links== * Full Text of the Act * BFI Screenonline article.

The type was introduced in 1995, and was the first new rolling stock introduced on the Keio Inokashira Line in 33 years, after the 3000 series of 1962. It was the first type on the Inokashira Line to feature 20 m cars with four pairs of doors per side. Third- batch sets from 1711 onward, built from 2003, incorporate system and interior modifications. A new batch of 12 (batches 5-6) 5-car 1000 series sets built by Nippon Sharyo were delivered from fiscal 2008 to replace ageing rolling stock on the Inokashira Line.\\"２００８年度京王グループ経営計画\\" (Keio Group 2008 Business Plan), 9 May 2008, accessed 23 June 2008 These new trains feature full-colour LED destination indicators. Refurbishment Starting in 2016, the original batch of ten sets is undergoing a programme of refurbishment. Refurbishment includes converting the centre trailer car to a motor car to provide three motored cars per five-car set, as is the case with later-build sets. The ten original sets are all scheduled to be refurbished by 2020. ==Livery variations== The cab ends are painted one of several different pastel colours as shown below.

He was separated from the US Army because of his action as a military intelligence officer. Concerned with human rights violations occurring in the proximity of US forces in Haiti in September 1994 and perceiving what appeared to be indifference on the part of his command toward those suffering from these violations, he conducted an unauthorized survey of the National Penitentiary in Port-au-Prince for which he was court martialed and dismissed from active service.The case of Capt. Lawrence P. Rockwood, By Dan Coughlin, in Haiti Progres, Vol. 12, no. 51, 20 March 1995) ==Early life== He was born in Trenton to Lt. Col William Peck Rockwood, US Air Force, and Jane Hope (Priesti) Rockwood, a former Air Force nurse. As a service brat, he lived in Turkey, France, and Germany during his childhood. In 1968, his father retired from the military and moved to Gainesville, Florida where both parents worked for the University of Florida. After a traumatic experience during the eighth grade at a military school in South Carolina, he enrolled as a minor seminarian in the tenth grade at Saint Francis Preparatory Seminary run by the Capuchin Franciscan order in Lafayette New Jersey. After leaving the seminary and church due to a religious crises (after leaving the Roman Catholic Church as a young adult, he was a practicing Buddhist (Zen / Vajrayana) for 15 years), he received a diploma as a Licensed Practical Nurse.The Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, FP: Florida Politics, Lawrence Rockwood (FP 72) == Military career == He was a fourth-generation soldier with 23 years of uniformed service (1977-He served as an enlisted soldier / noncommissioned officer from 1977 to 1983 serving as a substance abuse / behavior science counselor in Germany. He was commissioned while enrolled in ROTC at the University of Florida while in graduate school from 1984 to 1986. He was trained as a surface-to-air missile operations officer and later managed a surface-to-air missile (Patriot) fire direction center interfacing the NATO / US command structure (Federal Republic of Germany). He was rebranched as a counterintelligence officer in 1990 and served as counter-drug intelligence operations officer responsible for the operation of three counter-drug surveillance vessels and a forward based operations in Latin America and the Caribbean. It was while he was serving a counterintelligence officer during Operation Restore Democracy in Haiti in September 1994 that he was arrested and later court martialed in May 1995 for exceeding his authority for trying to document the identities of political prisoners being held by the illegal regime of General Raoul Cédras. He appealed his court martial all the way to the US Supreme Court on the basis of the military doctrine of command responsibility (his command’s responsibility for political prisoners in territory his command occupied). He was given various awards by the ACLU and other organizations for the very offense that was the subject of his prosecution. Between his court martial and the US Supreme Court denying his petition for a Writ of Certiorari in 2001, he pursued his PhD in diplomatic history at the University of Florida and worked as a human rights activists. ==The Rockwood / Haitian Affair== Upon arriving in Haiti, Capt. Rockwood, as a military counterintelligence officer, received reports on the despicable prison conditions experienced by opponents of the Cédras government. He expressed concern to his commanding officers over the fact that no actions were being taken to inspect the prisons and confirm reports of conditions. After meeting with senior officers, the staff Chaplain, and the Inspector General, Capt. Rockwood was asked to continue to perform his duties as a military counterintelligence officer in the capacity of 'Force Protection' (or the minimization of American casualties), as that was the current mission of the military intelligence assets assigned to the Task Force. He was told that his complaints would be addressed in the coming days, and that he was not to inspect the prisons without \\"full military support\\". After this process, on his seventh day in Haiti, Capt. Rockwood departed the secure military facility without permission, or 'went AWOL'. He then transited to a local prison, where he carried out an 'inspection', threatening the Warden and guards with his weapon. At midnight Major Spencer Lane, USA \\"...persuaded him to unchamber the round in his rifle and to accompany him back to the barracks compound.\\" He was flown back to Ft. Drum, NY the next day after a Psychiatric Evaluation. At the time of the deployment, Capt. Rockwood had been diagnosed with depression and was taking the anti-depressant Prozac. ==Human Rights / Political Activism== After his separation from active military service, he served as a Fellow for Center for International Policy, a consultant for the Institute for Policy Studies, Amnesty International's Military, Police, and Security Working Group, and has been contracted as a human rights instructor for the Department of the Army and Department of Defense. He received his Ph.D. in American Diplomatic History in 2005 from the University of Florida.

In his forty- third year, he discovered that he possessed the ability to pass effortlessly through walls. In search of a cure he consulted a doctor, who prescribed intensive work and a medicine. Dutilleul made no change to his rather inactive life, however, and a year later still retained his ability to pass through walls, although with no inclination to use it. However, a new manager arrived at his office and began to make his job unbearable. Dutilleul began using his power to annoy his manager, who went mad and was taken away to an asylum. Dutilleul then began to use his ability to burgle banks and jewellery shops. Each time, he would sign a pseudonym \\"The Lone Wolf\\" in red chalk at the crime scene, and his criminal exploits soon became the talk of the town. In order to claim the prestige and celebrity status \\"The Lone Wolf\\" had gained, Dutilleul allowed himself to be caught in the act. He was put in prison, but used his ability to frustrate his jailers and repeatedly escape. He then fell in love with a married woman, whose husband went out every night and left her locked in her bedroom. Dutilleul used his power to enter her bedroom and spend the night with her while her husband was away. One morning, Dutilleul had a headache and took two pills he found in the bottom of his drawer. His headache went away, but later that night, as he was leaving his lover's house, he noticed a feeling of resistance as he was passing through the walls. The pills Dutilleul had thought were aspirin were, in fact, the medicine his doctor had prescribed for him a year earlier. As he was passing through the final outer wall of the property, he noticed he was no longer able to move. He realized his mistake too late. The medicine suddenly took effect, and Dutilleul ended up trapped in the wall, where he remains to this day. == Adaptations == The story has inspired several cinematic adaptations, including the following: * 1951 - French comedy farce film known in English as Mr. Peek-a-Boo, directed by Jean Boyer, * 1959 - German The Man Who Walked Through the Wall, directed by Ladislao Vajda. * 1977 - French TV film Le Passe-muraille, directed by Pierre Tchernia with Michel Serrault starring. * 2007 - French short animation film Passe-muraille, directed by Damien Henry. * 2016 - French TV film :fr:Le Passe-muraille (téléfilm, 2016), directed by Dante Desarthe.

He was sold to a hermitic goatherder at seven and after the goatherder's death, he lived alone with the wolves in the Sierra Morena. At 19, he was returned to civilization, but had difficulty adjusting. Gabriel Janer Manila went on to write a PhD thesis about his case, which was titled He jugado con lobos (English title I Have Played with Wolves). He later became the subject of the film Entrelobos (English title Among Wolves), in which he appears briefly. In March 2018 he gave an interview in which he said he was disappointed in human nature and wished he could return to the mountains and leave society. ==Biography== Marcos was born in Añora, Spain, in the province of Cordoba. He emigrated with his parents to Madrid, where his mother died giving birth to her fourth child, who died shortly thereafter. Marcos was three years old at the time. His father then married another woman who already had a child from a previous marriage. His stepmother subjected him to cruel abuse while she was in charge. In the 1950s they settled in Fuencaliente, Ciudad Real, in the Sierra Morena, where they dedicated themselves to the manufacture of coal. By 1954, Marcos had spent all of his young life being abused. That year, aged seven, he was sold or delivered to a local landowner who owned a goatherd. The child was to serve as a slave, but was abandoned to nature at some point after this change in guardianship. In 1965, the Civil Guard found him after eleven years living in complete isolation from human beings and with the sole company of the wolves. The Civil Guard moved him to Fuencaliente by force, bound and gagged, as he howled and bit like a wolf. The police never brought charges against the father, who was still alive at the time, and when he recognized his son, he only reproached him for having lost his jacket. Nuns employed at a nearby hospital along with a priest taught him, again, the use of speech, how to dress, walk upright, and eat with cutlery. He was admitted to the Hospital de Convalecientes of the Vallejo Foundation in Madrid, until he was reintroduced as an adult to life in society. He was sent to Mallorca where he lived in a hostel paying with his work. He did military service and dedicated himself to work as a pastor and in the hospitality industry. He suffered numerous scams and deceptions, having limited financial and cultural sense given his time spent in complete isolation. After unstable living arrangements in Fuengirola, Malaga, even living in a cave, he moved to a village in the interior of Orense, Rante. There he was welcomed by Manuel Barandela Losada, a retired police officer. Marcos called him the \\"boss\\" and considered him to be family until his death. Currently, Marcos is sponsored by a Dutch family, being frequently invited by city councils, associations and diverse organizations to give talks and narrate his experience. In addition, he has been interviewed in numerous television programs. ==Case study== The study of the case was carried out by the anthropologist and writer Gabriel Janer Manila, who between November 1975 and April 1976, interviewed with Marcos Rodríguez in order to study the educational measures necessary for their integration. The anthropologist stated that the causes of Marcos' abandonment were not fortuitous, but deliberate and the result of a socio- economic context of extreme poverty. The researcher also stressed that Marcos' survival was possible thanks to the basic skills acquired in the previous phase of his abandonment, as well as his extraordinary natural intelligence. During his isolation the child learned the noises of the animals with which he lived and used them to communicate with them, while little by little he abandoned human language. Once he was again immersed in a social environment, after his rescue by the Civil Guard, he made a slow readaptation to human customs (food, clothing, language, etc.), still manifesting in adulthood preference for life in the field and animals (with which he has a special understanding) and developed some animosity for the noise and smell of cities, considering that life between humans is worse than life with animals. He considers that the hardships he suffered once he was reintroduced into society could have been alleviated in large part if the State had intervened in time. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Feral children Category:People from the Province of Córdoba (Spain) Category:Humans and wolves ","title":"Marcos Rodríguez Pantoja"},{"id":"35941157","text":"In Currents is the third studio album by the Early November. ==Release== In Currents was released on July 10, 2012 following an extended hiatus, marking the band's first release in six years.

1880 – 13 March 1919) was a Latvian poet, particularly noted for his interest in philosophical and pantheistic themes. ==Biography== Fricis Bārda was born in the Pociema district, on the rural estate of Rumbiņi. He studied at the local school in Pociems, in Umurga, and at the Limbaži city school. From 1898 to 1901 he attended the Valkas teachers seminary, then located in Rīga. From 1901 he worked as an assistant teacher in Katlakalns's school, but in 1906 traveled to Vienna. There he studied philosophy, and followed concepts of idealism, and gained an enthusiasm for German Romantic writers. After a year he returned to Latvia, and worked as a teacher at the Atis Ķeniņš's school in Rīga. During this period he contributed to the magazines \\"Stari\\" and \\"Zalktis\\", he met and associated with the composer Emīls Dārziņš, and the painter Janis Rozentāls. He also attended the drama lectures of Jēkabs Duburs. In 1917 Bārda was a teacher at the high school he instituted in Valmiera, and later became a school inspector. He also became Reader in Latvian language and literature at the Baltic Technical Institute. During most of latter part of the First World War, Bārda was a refugee in Russia. He returned to Latvia in 1918, but died in 1919 of a kidney disease he had been suffering from since his time in Vienna. ==Main works== In 1911 he published his first collection of poems, Zemes dēls (Son of the Land), and his only collection to be published during his lifetime. His other major collection, Dziesmas un lūgšanas Dzīvības Kokam (Songs and Prayers for the Tree of Life), was published in 1919. Bārda is considered an exponent of romantic poetry, reacting to the prevalent realism of the preceding years. His treatments of traditional poetic themes – one's home land, love, nature, life, death, the soul, and eternity – are given original imagery and rhythms, and presented in philosophical generalisations.FRICIS BĀRDA (1880 – 1919), Kaleidoscope Comenius ProjectAustralian Latvian News, Nr. 3072, 1 Feb 212, page 8 (article by Edmunds Smalkais) (in Latvian) His poems have been translated into Russian, English, German and Polish.

Led informally by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, the Province of Carolina was controlled from 1663 to 1729 by these lords and their heirs.

They were eventually betrayed to the Gestapo, tried and, along with her mother Elisabeth Kuznitzky (1878–1944), executed by beheading by the Fallbeil guillotine on 30 November 1944; their fate was publicized as a warning.The Second World War: A Complete History by Martin Gilbert, pg 615The Atlantic: World War II Women at War, picture 36 ==Biography== Lilo Gloeden (born Elisabeth Kuznitsky) was a lawyer who married architect Erich Gloeden. Erich was the son of Siegfried Loevy (died 1936), a Jew who had married a Christian. Brothers Siegfried and Albert Loevy established a successful and important bronze foundry, SA Loevy, and became purveyors to the royal court in 1910. Erich and his sister Ursula (1897–1972) were adopted by family friend and high school teacher Bernhard Gloeden in 1918, with the consent of their parents, simply to mask their Jewish background with a non-Jewish surname, and Erich was baptized. After the start of World War II, Erich Gloeden worked for the Organisation Todt as an architect. Living in Berlin, the Gloedens secretly opposed the Nazi movement and provided temporary accommodation to Jewish people fleeing persecution. In July 1944, the Gloedens became aware of a plot against Hitler, and five days after the failed assassination attempt, took in General Fritz Lindemann, who was hiding from the manhunt for the plotters. They passed him off as a retired major and journalist named Exner. On 3 September, the Gestapo raided the Gloedens' home, capturing Lindemann and taking Lilo, Erich and Lilo's mother, Elisabeth, into custody. Lindemann was shot in the stomach and leg during the raid, dying of his wounds on 22 September. On 27 November, the Gloedens and Elisabeth Kuznitsky were brought before the People's Court (Volksgerichtshof) in a widely publicized trial for treason. Erich Gloeden claimed the others had not known who Lindemann was. He was sentenced to death, while the women received long prison sentences. However, his wife stated she had known Lindemann's identity. Her mother then made the same admission. As a result, all three were put to death by beheading three days later on 30 November at Plötzensee Prison. ==Legacy== Lilo and Erich Gloeden, and Elisabeth Kuznitzky, are memorialized by three bronze plaques, stolpersteine, installed outside the location of their apartment. President of the Bundestag Norbert Lammert has noted that the national history of each country is the sum of the many, personal stories of people who usually remain unobserved or quickly forgotten like those of the Gloedens, whose story is an example of how in Germany a few generations ago people were excluded from the nation whose self-evident members they were. == References  External links == * Photograph of Elisabeth Gloeden in the Nazi courtroom * Elisabeth Gloeden entry, Stolpersteine in Berlin, including a photographic portrait * 1937 photographic portrait of Erich Gloeden, Spiegel Online Category:1944 deaths Category:German people executed by Nazi Germany Category:German civilians killed in World War II Category:People condemned by Nazi courts Category:People executed by Germany by decapitation Category:People executed for treason against Germany Category:Stolpersteine ","title":"Execution of the Gloeden family"},{"id":"35941326","text":"David Palmer McCagg (born March 13, 1958) is an American former competition swimmer, world champion, and world record-holder.

The Green Line runs through north downtown to Township 9 in the River District, and is projected eventually to reach Sacramento International Airport. Service is currently provided on Mondays to Fridays only. ==History== In the 1990s, Sacramento RT started identifying corridors for new light rail extensions and selected an alignment for a new line that would reach the Sacramento Airport from Sacramento via Natomas. Formal planning for the line began in the early 2000s. Construction for the initial segment of the Green Line that runs to the River District began in late 2009 after finalizing environmental review in early 2009. The initial line opened for service on June 15, 2012 with a single new station at Township 9. In 2016, low ridership on the Green Line and the lack of development at Township 9 led the Sacramento RT Board to consider closing the line in 2017. ==Line description== The Green Line begins at its current northern terminus at the 7th and Richards / Township 9 station in the River District. From there it initially travels south on 7th Street on a single-track. Reaching downtown, the Green Line goes to two tracks at G Street as one-way tracks for 7th and 8th Streets where it joins the Blue and Gold Lines. It then turns westward on O Street, southward on 12th, then eastward in an alley paralleling Q and R Streets, before reaching its southern terminus at 13th Street station. ==Stations== Note: former stations are highlighted in gray.

During campaign, by using social media and mobilizing the general public online, Obama was able to raise awareness and financial support of his campaign. Obama used over 15 social networking sites.Edelman Research, “The Social Pulpit,” 2009, p. 1 The topic of Barack Obama's usage of social media in his political campaigns, including podcasting, Twitter, Myspace, Facebook, and YouTube has been compared to the adoption of radio, television, MTV, and the Internet in slingshotting his presidential campaign to success and as thus has elicited much scholarly inquiry. In the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama had more \\"friends\\" on Facebook and Myspace and more \\"followers\\" on Twitter than his opponent John McCain. Obama's usage of the wider Internet has often since been compared to Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy's adoption of the radio and television media, respectively, in the history of communication between the White House and the American public. ==Twitter== Twitter activity of Barack Obama from his first tweet in April 2007. Retweets are not included. First Lady after she had introduced him at a 2012 election campaign event in Davenport, Iowa. The campaign tweeted a similar photograph from the campaign photographer on election night and many people thought it was taken on election day. Barack Obama's Twitter account (@BarackObama) is the official account on social networking site Twitter for former President of the United States Barack Obama, and has been used for his election efforts. Obama also used the White House's Twitter account (@WhiteHouse) for his presidential activities. , Obama's account has 110,179,369 followers, making him owner of the most followed Twitter account. Obama also follows 611,054 accounts, and has posted 15,685 tweets. Well into 2011, it was following the most people of any account on the network and was the third to achieve ten million followers. It is one of only two accounts in the world to be in the top ten in both followers and followees (Twitter friends). , the White House account is also among the two-hundred most followed with nearly three million followers. On May 18, 2015, Obama sent his first tweet from the first Twitter account dedicated exclusively to the U.S. President (@POTUS); his first reply to a tweet directed at him was a tongue-in-cheek exchange with former President Bill Clinton (@billclinton). Obama has used Twitter to promote legislation and support for his policies. He has been the subject of various controversies on Twitter. Obama is also the subject of various debates on Twitter. He had also used his account to respond to the public regarding the economy and employment. Based on its rate of adoption, Twitter will have a complementary role to other communication efforts that is more significant in Obama's 2012 presidential campaign than in prior elections. Statistics on Twitter usage Graph of Obama's follower growth The account is among the top ten worldwide in both followers and followed. The account held the record for following the most people. On August 13, 2019 at 14:39 PDT Obama's account overtook Katy Perry and has the most number of followers with over 107 million followers, and followed 612,655 accounts. During his 2008 campaign the account was intermittently the world's most followed. In May 2010 Obama's Twitter account ranked as the fourth most followed account with about 4 million followers. By May 16, 2011, @BarackObama was followed by 7.4 million people, including twenty-eight world leaders. His account became the third account to reach 10 million followers in September 2011. Account usage history Obama \\"using Twitter\\" on May 24, 2012 in response to hashtagged questions @BarackObama was launched on March 5, 2007 at 16:08:25. It is his official account, although he also tweeted through @WhiteHouse which is usually used by the presidential administration, while @BarackObama was for his election campaign staff. @WhiteHouse predates the Presidency of Barack Obama, since it was created on April 21, 2007. Following the 2008 United States presidential election, the Democratic National Committee was believed to have taken over the account and in a speech in November 2009, Obama stated \\"I have never used Twitter\\", although he had over 2.6 million followers. The @BarackObama account is \\"run by #Obama2012 campaign staff. Tweets from the President are signed -bo.\\" Although his staff does most of his tweeting, Obama became active on the account in June 2011, tweeting under his own initials, beginning with the father's day message \\"Being a father is sometimes my hardest but always my most rewarding job...\\" alt=three people in dark suits thumbtyping on BlackBerry's while seated Obama has at various times held public forums in which he fielded questions posted on Twitter. On July 6, 2011, he participated in what was billed as \\"Twitter Presents Townhall @ the White House\\". The event was held in the East Room of the White House and was streamed online. Only written questions on the site about the economy and jobs were accepted for oral response by Obama. His average responses were over 2000 characters and when Speaker of the United States House of Representatives John Boehner tweeted \\"Where are the jobs?\\" to the hashtag #AskObama, it took Obama 3111 characters to respond. The event was moderated by Twitter executive Jack Dorsey, and Obama started the session with a sample tweet to himself through @WhiteHouse that said \\"in order to reduce the deficit, what costs would you cut and what investments would you keep – bo\\". Dorsey said afterwards that Twitter received over 110,000 #AskObama-hashtagged tweets. Boehner was quite active with his questions from the outset. Some in the media proposed May 24, 2012, as the date when Obama became the first President to respond to questions on Twitter. On July 29, 2011, during the United States debt-ceiling crisis, the account lost over 40,000 followers when the president asked \\"Americans Friday to call, email and tweet Congressional leaders to 'keep the pressure on' lawmakers in hopes of reaching a bipartisan deal to raise the nation's $14.3 trillion debt limit ahead of an August 2 deadline.\\" During the day, he sent about 100 tweets that included the Twitter accounts of Congressional Republicans. Later in 2011, Obama used Twitter again to try to encourage the people to voice their opinion on legislation when he was attempting to pass the American Jobs Act. Hacking On January 5, 2009, Obama's campaign account @BarackObama was among several celebrity accounts that were hacked and domain hijacked. The hacker phished the password of a Twitter administrator's account, gaining access to other accounts to which he then changed the passwords, and subsequently offered access to accounts upon request at Digital Gangster. The case eventually led to a non-financial settlement with the Federal Trade Commission by Twitter. On July 4, 2011, Obama was the subject of a death hoax on Twitter when Fox News' Politics Twitter account (@foxnewspolitics) was hacked. The hackers were unfamiliar with Twitter and started their hoax messages with @BarackObama, thus only making the message appear in the Twitter timelines of those who follow both Fox News and the Presidential account. Eventually the hackers switched to hashtag references, increasing the visibility of their activities. Fox News acknowledged the breach and apologized. Significance of Twitter in campaigning alt=Barack Obama in a blue suit typing on computer at a podium while a white man in a light grey suit looks on Although both Obama and his Republican adversary Mitt Romney were active on Twitter and Twitter has \\"become an essential tool for campaigns\\", the Pew Research Center has determined that only about 13% of American adults had joined the site. Thus, Twitter's impact on the election was only \\"one slice of an enormous communication effort\\". Its impact grew significantly that as many tweets are sent in 8 minutes as were sent on all of Election Day 2008. As of May 25, 2010, 48% of Obama's followers resided outside of the United States and 47% were female. At that time, the top five industries in which his followers were employed were # Hospitality, # Law, # Marketing/Public Relations, # Fashion and # Education. Measuring social influence has become a new consulting career opportunity. According to discussants on the PBS NewsHour, Obama has 5,000 times as much social media influence as Romney; however, according to The Hill, Obama only has 12 times as much social media influence. ==Other social media platforms== barackobama.com The official website of Barack Obama is barackobama.com. It is run by Chris Hughes, one of the three co-founders of Facebook, and has been described as a \\"sort of social network\\". Steve Spinner, a member of Obama's National Finance Committee, says that while previous campaigns have used the internet none had yet taken full advantage of social networking features. The website included online tools that allowed members to identify neighbors that the Obama campaign thought might be potential backers and then report back on any resulting conversations. Members of the site could also create blogs, post photos, and form groups through the website, but each member must publish limited biographical profile and no more than one photo. According to Hughes, during the 2008 campaign, over two million accounts were created for the website to \\"organize their local communities on behalf of Barack Obama\\". He estimates that more than 200,000 events were organised through the website. Moreover, 400,000 articles were written in blogs. Four hundred thousand videos that supported Obama were posted into YouTube via the official website. Thirty-five thousand volunteer groups were created. Thirty million dollars were spent by 70,000 people into their own fundraising webpages. In the final four days of the 2008 campaign, three million phone calls were made through the website's internet virtual phone. Reddit President Barack Obama made a surprise half-hour visit to the social news website Reddit on August 29, 2012. Using an Ask Me Anything (AMA) format, the President garnered 3.8 million page views on the first page of his self-post. Users left 22,000 comments and questions for the President, 10 of which he answered. The answered questions' topics included more serious topics, from the most difficult decision made during his first term to a plan to end the corruption of money in politics. Some included a more lighthearted focus, like the recipe for the White House beer. In response to Obama's use of Reddit, many noted the bypassing of generally established channels of mainstream media in use during the 2012 campaign in favor of less-filtered and closer forms of communication. When asked why Obama logged on to Reddit, one campaign official responded \\"Because a whole bunch of our turnout targets were on Reddit.\\" By using a newer, underused media channel like Reddit, Obama's campaign acknowledged a largely unaddressed demographic of unlikely voters on social internet boards. ==Facebook== The Barack Obama Facebook (@barackobama) is currently the official Facebook for the former president and was his Facebook during the campaign trail. Looking back onto the election, Obama was able to mobilize the public through social media, especially Facebook. In fact, by the peak of the Obama campaign, his Facebook has around 3 million friends.Edelman Research, “The Social Pulpit,” 2009, p. 3 Marc Anderson, board member of Facebook and founder of Netscape, said “Other politicians I have met with are always impressed by the Web and surprised by what it could do, but their interest sort of ended in how much money you could raise. He was the first politician I dealt with who understood that the technology was a given and that it could be used in new ways.”Carr, David. “How Obama Tapped Into Social Network Power”, The New York Times, Nov. 9 2008. The use of effective social media campaigns, especially on Facebook, were developed and used under the Obama campaign. The transformation of social media sites into capital gain can show how he was so effective in mobilizing voters and volunteers. “By converting everyday people into engaged and empowered volunteers, donors and advocates through social networks, email advocacy, text messaging and online video. The campaign’s proclivity to online advocacy is a major reason for his victory.” Through Facebook, Obama was able to create a sense of ethos between the voters and his personal campaign. This created a sense of trust, support and effective campaigning that made his campaign so successful. In March 2007, the Barack Obama team created an interconnection between a user's account in Obama's official website and Facebook account, so a user may publish activities via sending postings from one to another.Harfoush 2009. \\"Social Networks\\", pp. 139-140\\\\. Retrieved August 3, 2012, at Google Books. In 2008, the Obama presidential campaign spent $643,000 out of its $16 million Internet budget to promote his Facebook account. On June 17, 2008, after Hillary Clinton ended her campaign, number of followers of Barack Obama's Facebook account increased to one million. Meanwhile, in addition to Facebook accounts of Barack and Michelle Obama and Joe Biden, the Obama team created ten more Facebook accounts for \\"specific demographics, such as Veterans for Obama, Women for Obama, and African Americans for Obama.\\" == Social media and the general public == The main key of making a campaign more successful is going where the public is. 60 percent of the American general public belong to a social media page.Edelman Research, “The Social Pulpit,” 2009, p. 7 This is a huge demographic of individuals to reach through an online platform. Most of the general public only has an account to one social media login. So what the Obama campaign did knowing this information is Obama created use faces for over 15 social mediums, including Facebook. “he also was the first presidential candidate to have profiles on AsianAve.com, MiGente.com and BlackPlanet.com, influential social networks for the Asian, Hispanic and African American communities.” Through the individual interfaces, Obama was able to spread awareness about his campaign and raise money and volunteers to mobilize his public. == Controversy == The topic of social media regarding presidential campaigns come with a bit of hesitation to the general public. The concept of micro-targeting is the use of personal information, garnered from online social media sources and public records, builds profiles for that of the voting demographic. Through Obama's successful online presence, his supports and online friends were able to build an incredible amount of information toward his campaign that helped micro-targeting and social media strategy. This received a lot of criticism under the Trump administration due to his policy use of Cambridge Analytica, which a Britain based company who provides information and strategies for micro-targeting and other tactics along those lines. “Obama's 2008 campaign was famously data-driven, pioneered micro-targeting in 2012, talking to people specifically based on the issues they care about,\\" Cambridge Analytica said on Twitter.Urbain, Thomas. “Facebook as an election weapon: from Obama to Trump”, PHYS. March 23, 2019. Phys.org. The firm, under the Trump Campaign, gathered over 50 million profiles from Facebook to gain information about Facebook users. The Obama campaign team member Micheal Simon, responded to allegations of similar actions with “We didn't steal private Facebook profile data from voters under false pretenses. OFA (Obama's campaign) voluntarily solicited opinions of hundreds of thousands of voters. We didn't commit theft to do our groundbreaking work.\\" == Lasting impact of Obama campaign and social media == Obama was able to change the way in which the campaign trial used social media and micro-targeting. The social media footprint of a presidential candidate plays an integral role in how a candidate portrays themselves on the social medium. Obama's Facebook has left a lasting legacy, as it currently has over 54 million likes and 53 million friends.

It depicts the love story of a Masurian woman and an officer of the Armia Krajowa in postwar Masuria. == Plot == In summer 1945 Tadeusz, an officer of the Armia Krajowa and veteran of the Warsaw uprising, whose wife was raped and murdered by the Germans, moves to Masuria, a region in former German East Prussia, which became part of Poland as a result of the Potsdam Agreement after World War II. He visits Róża, a widow of a German Wehrmacht soldier whose death Tadeusz had witnessed, to hand over her husband’s possessions. Róża invites Tadeusz to stay at her farm to protect her against marauders and the brutal rapes she had previously experienced during the Soviet East Prussian Offensive and in the lawless atmosphere of postwar Masuria. From this partnership of purpose, slowly respect and love arises - a \\"frowned-upon relationship\\" attracting the \\"unwelcome attention of the new Polish nationalists as well as the notorious Soviet NKVD\\". While Róża is regarded a German by the new Polish authorities, thus facing her expulsion, Tadeusz wants her to declare her Polish nationality as many Masurians did in a \\"humiliating nationality verification procedure\\" As director Wojciech Smarzowski calls it, the Masurians \\"fell victim to two instances of renationalisation and were later destroyed\\". == Reception == Wojciech Smarzowski with the Polish Academy Award for Best Film, 2012 Variety has called the movie \\"almost unbearably brutal yet hauntingly romantic\\" and commended \\"Genre-savvy helmer Smarzowski's gritty mise-en-scene augments the force of the narrative, putting into visual terms its themes of ill-fated love and a nation doomed by nationalism. What in other hands might have played as costume melodrama focused on the victimized title character here takes the perspective of the loner hero, as Smarzowski gives the pic the hallmarks of a latter-day Western.\\" Giuseppe Sedia in a review for the Krakow Post wrote: \\"From a moral point of view Róża is a Western crammed with violence but filmed without complacency. Smarzowski referred to himself as the “third Cohen brother” and there may be a kernel of truth in this, at least in his commitment to injecting a dose of realism into movie genres that have never been fully developed in Polish cinema\\".\\" Róża distribution in Russia has been banned by authorities in 2015 for depicting rapes and other atrocities committed by Red Army soldiers in East Prussia. == Cast == * Agata Kulesza as Róża Kwiatkowska * Marcin Dorociński as Tadeusz * Edward Linde-Lubaszenko as pastor * Szymon Bobrowski as Kazik * Jacek Braciak as Władek * Malwina Buss as Jadwiga Kwiatkowska * Kinga Preis as Amelia * Marian Dziędziel as Mateusz * Eryk Lubos as Wasyl * Lech Dyblik as Woźniak * Robert Wabich as Hawryluk * Grzegorz Wojdon as Madecki * Mateusz Trembaczowski as Georg == Awards == *Grand Prix, Warsaw Film Festival 2011 *Polish Film Awards: Best Film, Best Directing, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Script, Best Sound and the Audience Award. *Critics’ Award National Film Festival in Gdynia 2011 *Special Jury Prize of the 23rd Polish Film Festival in America for Artistic Excellence and Importance == References  External links == * *Wojciech Smarzowski - Rose at culture.pl Category:Polish films Category:Polish-language films Category:2011 films ","title":"Rose (2011 film)"},{"id":"35941613","text":"Ko Dong-sik (born 25 December 1973) is a South Korean field hockey player who competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics and in the 2008 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of South Korea Category:Field hockey players at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games medalists in field hockey Category:Field hockey players at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Asian Games gold medalists for South Korea Category:Asian Games silver medalists for South Korea Category:Medalists at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 2006 Asian Games ","title":"Ko Dong-sik"},{"id":"35941621","text":"Kim Byung-hoon (born 22 October 1982) is a South Korean field hockey player who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of South Korea Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics ","title":"Kim Byung-hoon"},{"id":"35941630","text":"Christopher Hall (born Robert Christopher Hall, May 18, 1966) is an American musician best known as a founding member and vocalist for the band Stabbing Westward.

According to the United Nations, 108 people were killed, including 34 women and 49 children. While a small proportion of the deaths appeared to have resulted from artillery and tank rounds used against Taldou, the U.N. later announced that most of the massacre's victims had been \\"summarily executed in two separate incidents\\". UN investigators have reported that some witnesses and survivors stated that the massacre was committed by pro-government Shabiha. In August 2012 UN investigators released a report which stated that it was likely that Syrian troops and Shabiha militia were responsible for the massacre, concluding that: \\"On the basis of available evidence, the commission has a reasonable basis to believe that the perpetrators of the deliberate killing of civilians, at both the Abdulrazzak and Al-Sayed family locations, were aligned to the Government. It rests this conclusion on its understanding of access to the crime sites, the loyalties of the victims, the security layout in the area including the position of the government’s water authority checkpoint and the consistent testimonies of victims and witnesses with direct knowledge of the events. This conclusion is bolstered by the lack of credible information supporting other possibilities.\\" The Syrian government alleged that Al-Qaeda terrorist groups were responsible for the killings, and that Houla residents were warned not to speak publicly by opposition forces. This account received support from a report published by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, but is contested by most media coverage and by the report published by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in August 2012. Channel 4 News reported that Houla residents stated that the Syrian military and government-hired Shabiha were the perpetrators of the massacre, as claimed by opposition groups. Townspeople described how Shabiha, who were thought to be men from Shia/Alawite villages to the south and west of Houla (Kabu and Felleh were named repeatedly) entered the town after several hours of shelling. According to one eyewitness, the killers had written Shia slogans on their foreheads (the Alawi faith is a Shia sect). The fifteen nations of the U.N. Security Council unanimously condemned the Syrian government for firing heavy weapons at civilians. The U.S., U.K., and eleven other nations jointly expelled Syrian ambassadors and diplomats from their territories. On June 1 2012, 41 out of 47 countries in the UNHRC supported a resolution condemning \\"in the strongest possible terms such an outrageous use of force against the civilian population\\".\\"Russia backs Syria amid global condemnation\\" CBS News. June 1, 2012. The resolution, which blamed Syrian government troops and pro-government militias, instructed an expert panel to conduct an \\"international, transparent, independent and prompt investigation\\".\\"UN calls for investigation into Houla killings in Syria\\" BBC News. June 1, 2012. Russia, China and Cuba voted against the resolution, with Uganda and Ecuador abstaining, and the Philippines was absent during the vote. On June 27, the UNHRC published a preliminary report on rights violations in Syria. The report noted that the commission had \\"yet to be afforded access to the country,\\" which \\"substantially hampered the investigation, and its findings should be viewed in that light.\\"\\"Oral Update of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic.\\" United Nations, Office of High Commissioner of Human Rights. A/HRC/20/CRP.1, 26 June 2012. http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session20/COI_OralUpdate_A.HRC.20.CRP.1.pdf The report states that \\"with the available evidence\\" the Commission of Inquiry (CoI) could not rule out any of three possible perpetrators, but that \\"while the CoI could not rule out the possibility of anti-Government fighters being responsible for the killing, it was considered unlikely.\\" In August 2012, following continued investigations focusing on identifying the perpetrators, a report published by the UNHRC concluded there was a reasonable basis to believe the perpetrators were aligned to the Syrian government. == Background == Al-Houla is an area mainly comprising three towns named, as given north-to- south in the UN's June report, Tal Addahab, Kafr Laha and Taldou. They report the towns have a combined population of more than 100,000 \\"of which the majority is Sunni Muslim,\\" but are \\"ringed by Shia villages to the southeast, and Alawi villages to the southwest and the north.\\" Houla was a regular protest hub, even before army defectors formed the Free Syrian Army. The Syrian army had been accused of raiding and killing protesters in the Houla region before. But by May, 2012 FSA or allied rebels were in general control of the area, according to both pro-government (acceptable citation needed) and anti-government sources. Der Spiegel was told over the winter \\"a unit of the Free Syrian Army took up residence (in Houla) and it has been considered liberated since then\\" although the state's army still controlled \\"roads into the town.\\" Syria's My Lai: The Houla Massacre Marks a New Level of Violence By Ulrike Putz in Beirut, Der Spiegel, May 28, 2012. Accessed January 2, 2015 The UN's investigators only really considered Taldou, the southernmost town in Houla, and found \\"opposition forces may have been in control of parts of the city, mostly in the north.\\" According to Al Jazeera's correspondent Hadi al- Abdallah, this FSA control of Houla is why the Syrian Army was unable to enter on May 25, and had to shell it from a distance prior to the massacre. However, the UN's June report noted \\"Government forces are present in Al-Houla\\" with \\"fortified checkpoints\\" they show on an attached map. This shows only the south end of Taldou, between rebel-held Houla and the Alawi and Shia villages. All the reported massacre sites, also labeled on that map, are in this immediate area of Taldou. ==Events== Opposition and United Nations account On May 25, 2012, activists say Syrian soldiers dispersed a crowd of protesters with gunfire at a checkpoint in Taldo, a village of Houla. Shortly after, they say, armed rebels attacked the checkpoint, destroying an armored personnel carrier, and the Syrian military responded by bombarding the town with tank and artillery fire. The UNHRC's commission of Inquiry concluded (in their June report) “the protestors appear to have been fired upon or shelled by Government forces. Either in retaliation, or in a premeditated attack, anti-Government armed groups, including the FSA present in Taldou, fired upon the security forces checkpoints, probably overrunning one or two of them.\\" They note \\"several people were killed in these clashes or as a result of the shelling...” (p. 7) In particular, they found the \\"clocktower checkpoint\\" located at the central roundabout in Taldou \\"was overrun at some point” in the day, giving militants access to Saad road (where the Abdulraaq families were killed). (p. 10) A Military Intelligence Post ways south on Main Street is marked on their map as “(likely overrun by anti-gov't forces).” (p. 21) Even in August the commission suggests that post did fall; \\"the checkpoint at Al- Qaws\\" or arches - the next post to the south - \\"demarcated the new front line between the opposition and Government forces.\\" (p. 66) However, as a mobile post (soldiers in vehicles that tend to park there), the position of the Qaws post isn't as certain; their June report's map noted it \\"may be further south\\" than shown. (p. 21) That is, the small force there may have retreated to some degree. Following the violence of the day, the Commission of Inquiry decided the FSA offensive failed to break the government's control of the massacre area via the checkpoint at the arches (Qaws), the force stationed at the National Hospital, and the fortified army post on the ridge southeast of Taldou (\\"Water Company\\"), which all remained in government hands. Therefore, \\"the crime scene remained in Government-controlled territory the entire time.\\" (p. 66) Considering this, the commission found in their August report \\"a reasonable basis to believe that the perpetrators of the deliberate killing of civilians, at both the Abdulrazzak and Al-Sayed family locations, were aligned to the Government.\\" (p. 67) Witnesses said Shabiha militia forces from neighboring Alawite villages, entered the town around 7 pm, shortly after nightfall. Some were wearing uniform, while others were wearing casual civilian clothing. The men proceeded to loot homes for the next five hours, killing many civilians as they moved from house to house. In some cases, gunmen herded whole families into rooms and sprayed them with bullets. Satellite images showed a large Syrian military contingent 1.5 km southeast of the massacre site. According to the U.N. investigation, of the 108 confirmed dead, \\"fewer than 20\\" were killed by tank and artillery fire. Most of the remainder were killed in \\"summary executions\\", and \\"entire families were shot in their houses\\" in the village of Taldo. The Local Coordination Committees, a network of opposition activists inside Syria, stated that the attack by the military was preceded by mortar shelling of the town, which in itself left entire families dead. Activists stated that they had attempted to contact U.N. monitors during the night of the massacre, but the monitors refused to come. According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the massacre was perpetrated by the Syrian army, which attempted to break into Houla after the town saw many anti-government protests. Political activists said that Syrian government forces and loyalists fired heavy weapons. Other activists blamed Assad loyalists of the surrounding Alawite towns for the violence. A local man, who gave his name as Abu Bilal al-Homsi, accused Alawites in ranks of Shabiha of executions of locals in the town of Taldo, where they bayoneted civilians as a retaliation for a previous demonstration and an attack of Free Syrian Army fighters on army checkpoints in the vicinity of the towns. In interviews with Channel 4 News, townspeople described how Shabiha from Alawite villages to the south and west of Houla (Kabu and Felleh were named repeatedly) entered the town after shelling for several hours. According to one eyewitness, the killers had written Shia slogans on their foreheads. Reporter Alex Thomson stated that he had been told many bodies were yet to be recovered, and that he had seen at least two bodies not included in the initial U.N. count. On May 28, Human Rights Watch released a report of interviews with survivors and area activists, in which all stated that the massacre was committed by pro-government gunmen in military fatigues. However, the witnesses were unable to say whether gunmen belonged to armed forces or Shabiha. HRW was also given a list of casualties, from which 62 victims were members of the Abdel Razzak family. Video later emerged on the Internet showing the bloodstained bodies of many children huddled on a floor in the dark, some with their skulls split open, some with their throats cut, and others knifed or shot to death. The video also featured a man's voice screaming, \\"These are all children! Watch, you dogs, you Arabs, you animals – look at these children, watch, just watch!\\" Another video showed what was said to be a mass burial of victims. The U.S. State Department later published satellite photos said to show mass graves in Syria that line up with images from the ground supplied by Syrian opposition forces. Syrian government and Rainer Hermann account The Syrian government stated that the massacre fit a pattern of armed groups escalating attacks prior to Security Council sessions on Syria, as in the March 15 Karm Allouz massacre in Homs. According to the Syrian government's account of the massacre provided to the United Nations on May 28, hundreds of gunmen gathered around the locations of the massacres, armed with heavy weapons including anti-tank missiles, at 2:00 pm on 25 May. The account listed as victims \\"several families, including children, women and elders,\\" listed the names of the dead, and stated that armed terrorist groups had burned crops and houses and vandalized the national hospital in Taldo. Five government positions outside the affected area had also been attacked by the militia, killing three soldiers and injuring 16. Rainer Hermann, the Middle East correspondent of the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, has published an account of the events according to which elements opposed to the Syrian government, rather than government (or pro-government) ones, were responsible for the massacre (an unofficial translation is available here: http://www.democraticunderground.com/1002820144) Citing anonymous opposition sources from the area, Hermann concludes that three Syrian army checkpoints near Taldou were attacked on the evening of May 25 by more than 700 rebel gunman from Rastan, Kafr Laha and Akraba, under the leadership of Abdurazzaq Tlass and Yahya Yusuf. During and after the fighting rebel forces and Taldou residents, according to Hermann, wiped out the Sayyid and Abdarrazzaq families \\"who had refused to join the opposition.\\" The Berliner Morgenpost also carried an article questioning the narrative of Syrian government responsibility, quoting anonymous eyewitness saying that the massacre victims were opponents of the revolution, and that any testimony to the contrary would result in retribution from rebels.http://www.morgenpost.de/politik/ausland/article107255456/In-Syrien- gibt-es-mehr-als-nur-eine-Wahrheit.html (translation supplied by Wikipedia editor; see this article's talk page) The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung's account received attention in the international press, but is not supported by eyewitness testimony from other sources, including Channel 4 and the BBC, and was originally rejected by a report in Der Spiegel based upon interviews with Houla residents. However journalists from Der Spiegel went back to Houla in December, 2012, and were able to confirm the massacre was conducted by the shabiha.http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/gaining-a-clearer-view-of- the-increasing-barbarity-in-syrian-civil-war-a-874027-2.html The United Nations investigation report, released on 15 August 2012, specifically contested the alternative accounts provided by the Frankfurter Allgmeine Zeitung, stating that the paper had interviewed two witnesses also quoted in the Syrian government's report. In a speech in September 2012, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay didn't directly accuse Syria of responsibility, but noted that government forces played a role in the Houla massacre. ==Aftermath== On the day of the attacks, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the Syrian government's \\"unacceptable levels of violence and abuses\\", including use of heavy weapons on civilian populations, before the U.N. Security Council. U.N. observers visited the al-Houla on the day after the massacre, viewing the bodies of the dead in a morgue. They confirmed that at least 90 civilians were killed, including at least 32 children. Robert Mood, the U.N. mission head, described the killings as \\"indiscriminate and unforgivable\\" and said that U.N. observers could confirm \\"the use of small arms, machine gun[s], artillery and tanks\\". The U.N. report on the killings in the days following the massacre strongly implied that forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad were responsible for the slaughter, demanding \\"that the Syrian Government immediately cease the use of heavy weapons in population centers.\\" Several towns held rallies to protest the killings. In a Damascus neighborhood women were filmed carrying papers that read \\"Banish the U.N. tourists\\" and \\"The Syrian regime kills us under supervision of the U.N. observers\\". The Free Syrian Army stated that it could no longer honor the ceasefire if the safety of civilians was not guaranteed, and that the peace plan negotiated by Kofi Annan was \\"dead\\". Members of the group stated their intent to retaliate against government forces. On May 27, 2012, France, Germany, Great Britain and the U.S. proposed a collective statement at the U.N. condemning the Syrian government in \\"blistering\\" language, accusing it of using tank shells and artillery on a civilian population. However, Russia blocked the statement's adoption. Kuwait called for an emergency meeting of the Arab League to discuss the attacks. Later in the day, the fifteen nations that comprise U.N. Security Council unanimously condemned the Assad government for its role in the attack, though the language avoided direct blame for the deaths. On the same day, opposition activists claimed that the Syrian government renewed shelling of Houla, and set up snipers in the area in an apparent attempt to prevent any more civilians from speaking with observers. On May 29, 2012, Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the U.S. announced that they were expelling Syrian diplomats in response to the massacre. Turkey and Japan later expelled Syrian diplomats, increasing the number of nations to do so to 13. The Syrian government described the expulsions as \\"unprecedented hysteria\\", and in turn, ordered the Dutch chargé d'affaires to leave the country within 72 hours. Russia called the expulsions of Syrian diplomats \\"counterproductive\\" and insisted that a U.N. Security Council statement Sunday condemning the incident was \\"a strong enough signal to the Syria parties.\\" The following day, Denmark, the European Union, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the U.S. proposed a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council to discuss the massacre. The request was supported by 51 nations. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that \\"They do not want to listen to Damascus, and that, from our point of view, does not improve matters in the current situation.\\" Russia also called for no new U.N. Security Council action for the time being. Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Denisov stated that: \\"One cannot take decisions on military operations in Syria by being guided by only emotions...the Russian position is not formed on the basis of emotions, which our respected French partners have unfortunately not escaped in the formulation of their position.\\" Despite the U.S. State Department's earlier hope that the events in Houla might prove a \\"turning point in Russian thinking\\", Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said: \\"We have always said that we are categorically against any outside interference in the Syrian conflict because this will only exacerbate the situation for both Syria and the region as a whole.\\" A Syrian military officer, Major Jihad Raslan, stated that he defected to the opposition after \\"witnessing hundreds of pro-regime militiamen\\" carry out the massacre. Raslan stated that defections rose sharply following the attack. The Arab League held a special meeting on Syria following the attack, and on June 2, called on the U.N. Security Council \\"to take the necessary measures to protect Syrian civilians, including increasing the number of international monitors\\". The following day, Assad addressed Syria in a 70-minute televised address in which he denounced the Houla attacks as \\"massacres which even monsters would not have carried out\\". He stated that the attackers had been funded by \\"outside forces\\" and promised a \\"real war\\" against them. ==Reactions== Domestic * – Syrian government: Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad said that \\"[t]here is a huge, misleading, well-planned campaign to distort the facts on the ground and mislead the people.\\" Jihad Makdissi, spokesman for the Syrian Foreign Ministry, said in a press conference on May 27, \\"We completely deny responsibility for this terrorist massacre against our people\\". He also repeated the claim that the Syrian government was the target of a \\"tsunami of lies. […] Women, children and old men were shot dead, […] This is not the hallmark of the heroic Syrian army.\\" As had already been claimed the day before by the state-owned news agency SANA, Makdissi also pointed to the \\"suspicious coincidence\\" that the attacks occurred in conjunction with the visit to Syria on May 28 by Kofi Annan, making them \\"a slap to the political process\\". The foreign ministry spokesman informed that a military judicial committee is investigating the massacre and that its findings would be announced in three days. He also emphasized that no tanks or artillery had entered al-Houla town, and that law enforcement units \\"never left their positions\\", being pinned down in self-defense. He also said, \\"The Syrian state is responsible for protecting civilians according to the constitution and Syria preserves its right to defend its citizens.\\" Assad's government denied responsibility. * Local Coordination Committees: \\"We in the Local Coordination Committees are pained by the international community's apparent blindness to the bloodshed, and believe the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) bears the responsibility for its inability to protect Syrian civilians.\\" * Syrian National Council: The SNC called on the U.N. Security Council to examine the massacre that had taken place in Houla. Burhan Ghalioun, former leader of the SNC, called for a \\"battle of Liberation\\" in Syria, asking Syrian civilians and FSA alike to engage in combat with the Syrian government until foreign countries intervene. *Other: A Syrian honorary consul general in California resigned and defected because of the killings he blamed on the Syrian Government.

Those responsible for this crime must be punished.\\" * – According to the Hungarian government's website, the Hungarian Foreign Ministry \\"most firmly condemns the murder of more than hundred persons including children in Houla, Syria. We express our most sincere condolences and deepest compassion to the families of the victims […] The deployment of military force against civilian population in such a brutal and inhuman manner is the most ruthless violation of fundamental human rights and the earlier commitments of the Syrian leadership. We call upon the Syrian Government to immediately end violence, support the mission of U.N. observers, and fully implement Kofi Annan’s six-point plan.\\" * – On May 28, Iran's foreign ministry released a statement via its official media condemning the killings in Houla, stating that \\"[t]he killing of a number of innocent people in the area has distressed the Islamic nations.\\" The ministry denounced the \\"suspect act\\" and urged authorities \\"to identify and punish those responsible.\\" On May 30, the country's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, told French TV station France 24 in an interview that \\"[a]ll those who carried out these murders are guilty and I hope the people responsible are punished.\\" * – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had until the massacre refrained from any comments regarding Syria, expressed \\"appall at the continuous slaughter of innocent civilians by Assad's forces.\\" He called on the international community to take action in light of \\"the continuous slaughter of innocent civilians\\" and added that \\"Iran and Hezbollah cannot be separated from Assad's massacre, and the world needs to take action against them as well.\\" The Israeli President Shimon Peres, meanwhile, proclaimed that \\"their president, who is supposed to be the father of their nation, became their murderer\\".

The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs again called for the Syrian regime to \\"cease urgently any forms of violence\\" and requested full support for the UN supervision mission in Syria. On May 30, Foreign Minister Andrei Marga recommended expelling the Syrian ambassador in Bucharest, calling the events in Houla \\"intolerable\\". The move was supported by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who added however that Romania will maintain some diplomatic personnel in Damascus to assist Romanians who have yet to leave Syria. * – Although before the massacre Russian rhetoric had often focused on Assad as a \\"reformer\\", Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in Moscow following a meeting with the British foreign minister, \\"The government bears the main responsibility for what is going on\\" and that \\"Any government in any country bears responsibility for the security of its citizens\\". Russia's reaction was considered to be a condemnation of the Syrian government. However, Lavrov also stated that the rebels shared the blame for the killings, noting that some victims had been killed at close range in a district controlled by the opposition fighters. Later, Alexei Pushkin, a foreign affairs committee chair in the Russian government, took this rhetoric further, saying that \\"We have very strong doubts that those people who were shot at point-blank [range] and were stabbed, that this was the action of forces loyal to President Assad... The shelling was probably...the troops of Mr Assad, but the stabbing and point-blank firing was definitely from the other side.\\" In response to reports that Russia had shipped weapons to the Syrian port of Tartus in the same week as the massacre and American criticism of Russia's policy on Syria, Putin denied that Russia was shipping any arms to Syria \\"which can be used in a civilian conflict\\".

On May 30 Turkey and Japan joined other nations and expelled senior Syrian diplomats. * – The UAE called for an Arab League meeting regarding the massacre, describing the killing as \\"a violation to our humanity, and signifies the tragic failure of our collective Arab and international efforts to put an end to the violence against the civilians in Syria.\\" * – British Foreign Secretary William Hague called the massacre an \\"appalling crime\\" and stated that the British government would seek a \\"strong response.\\" He blamed the Syrian government and called an emergency meeting at the U.N. security council.

G. Thompson & Co. It served for the Cunard Line. One passenger, the musician Philo Adams Otis, noted: :There were only four good ships of the Cunard Company in the Liverpool service in 1873: Russia, Scotia, Cuba, and Java. The two former were side-wheelers and were largely advertised as \\"carrying no steerage passengers\\". Among old travellers the two latter ships were respectively called the \\"rolling Cuba\\" and the \\"jumping Java,\\" from certain peculiarities manifested by these ships in heavy weather, not especially conducive to the comfort of the passengers. In 1877 the ship was re-engined with compound engines by Fawcett, Preston & Co., Liverpool, and chartered to Warren Line, until it had been sold to Red Star Line one year later and renamed to SS Zeeland. In 1889 it was sold to a French company and renamed the Electrique. In 1892 it was sold again to J. Herron & Co of Liverpool and again renamed the Lord Spencer. During an 1895 voyage from San Francisco to New York it went missing. One account claimed it collided with the Prince Oscar on July 13th and sunk shortly thereafter. == References == Category:Ocean liners of the United Kingdom Category:Ships of the Cunard Line Category:Passenger ships of the United Kingdom Category:Passenger ships of France Category:1865 ships Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:1865 in Scotland Category:Maritime incidents in 1895 Category:1895 in the United States Category:Shipwrecks Category:Missing ships Category:Ships lost with all hands ","title":"SS Java (1865)"},{"id":"35941654","text":"Kang Seong-jung (born 21 October 1977) is a South Korean field hockey player who competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics and in the 2008 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of South Korea Category:Field hockey players at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games medalists in field hockey Category:Field hockey players at the 2002 Asian Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Asian Games gold medalists for South Korea Category:Medalists at the 2002 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 2006 Asian Games ","title":"Kang Seong-jung"},{"id":"35941663","text":"Yoon Sung-hoon (born 16 February 1983) is a South Korean field hockey player who competed in the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of South Korea Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:2002 Men's Hockey World Cup players Category:2006 Men's Hockey World Cup players Category:2010 Men's Hockey World Cup players Category:2014 Men's Hockey World Cup players Category:Asian Games medalists in field hockey Category:Field hockey players at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2010 Asian Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2014 Asian Games Category:Asian Games gold medalists for South Korea Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for South Korea Category:Medalists at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 2014 Asian Games ","title":"Yoon Sung-hoon"},{"id":"35941665","text":"Stiletto Spy School is an espionage training school for women.

She is the first Bangladeshi and first Bengali to complete the Seven Summits on 18 November 2015. National Geographic recognized Nazreen as one of their Adventurers of the Year 2014/2015. She was selected in honour of her activism and commitment to empowering women through her work in the field of adventure. She was again selected as one of their Emerging Explorers in 2016. becoming the only woman to hold the simultaneous title of National Geographic Explorer and Adventurer of the Year. She was named by Outside as one of 40 women in the last 40 years who have advanced and challenged the outdoor world through their leadership, innovation, and athletic feats, and by Men's Journal as one of the 25 most adventurous women of the past 25 years. Nazreen is also known for her campaigns to raise awareness of human rights situations in Tibet, environmental impacts, Bangladeshi sex workers and minority groups. == Early life == Nazreen was born in Dhaka with the birth name Wasfia Nazreen Chowdhury. She is the youngest child and only daughter of Mahmuda Nahar (Ruby), a singer and school teacher, and Nazmee Jahan Chowdhury, an employee at James Finlay Bangladesh. Nazreen lived in Khulna, where she studied in Sunflower Nursery school and then Coronation Girls’ High School. When she was still a child, the family moved to their previous home in Chittagong. There she studied in Bangladesh Mahila Samiti Girls' High School (BWA). In early 1996, when Nazreen was thirteen, her parents divorced and she went to live with her aunt, Chobi Rouf, and uncle, NAT Rouf, in Dhaka where she was enrolled in the English medium Scholastica school. At this point, she was separated from both her parents as well as her only sibling and elder brother, who stayed in Chittagong with their father. When Nazreen went to the United States for college she changed her name to Wasfia Nazreen. Nazreen often discusses accounts of dealing with depression and trauma as a child following her parents tumultuous divorce that made her homeless as a result. She credits such struggle at early life for giving her \\"abilities to bounce back after adversities and greet change and difficulties as an opportunity to welcome greater self-reflection, learning, and growth.\\" ==Education== Nazreen addressing the donors of Agnes Scott College, Atlanta, Georgia in April 2016 Because of certain tragic circumstances in her childhood, Nazreen had to take care of herself from a very young age. This also made her realize early that the only way to set herself free, and to be independent, would be to educate herself. Nazreen received a scholarship to Agnes Scott College (ASC), a private women's college in Decatur, Georgia. Nazreen left Bangladesh with the intention to pursue a double major in Theatre and Aeronautical Science. In her first semester, Nazreen played in her university's volleyball team in the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association), but she dropped volleyball in third year, when she struggled to keep up with her academic grades. By her second year, she switched to double majoring in Studio Art and Social Psychology. Outside university, Nazreen was involved with African Dance Theatre part-time. Nazreen is a distant scholar at Samye Ling College of Scotland. While still in college, Nazreen received a grant to go to India and study how women were using art as therapy. In Dharamsala of Northern India, she started working with Tibetan women who had gone through torture in their lives at Chinese prisons. She describes it as a \\"life-altering experience\\" for her where \\"forgiving your enemies and really embodying that principle in your day-to-day life\\" was something that was very new to her. She decided to quit her work in the States and moved to the Himalayas to work with refugees instead. ==Work, activism and climbing== Her work with Tibetan human rights took her to Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, the exiled-capital of the Tibetans, where she lived for several years in her early twenties. Since 2007, Nazreen has been banned by the Chinese Government from returning to Tibet after she was found with a photo of the 14th Dalai Lama. Nazreen was chosen as the first Goodwill Ambassador of BRAC (NGO), an international development organization. She is also the youth ambassador for JAAGO Foundation and its concern Volunteer for Bangladesh. In 2011, Nazreen was part of the Indigenous Peoples delegates at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII). Nazreen also worked for international humanitarian aid group CARE (relief agency). When the funding for one of CARE's projects dried up, Nazreen decided that while foreign support had its role in the developing nation, it was time for the Bangladeshi people to begin building aid organizations that were not headed by foreigners. She had begun mountaineering in 2006, while working in Tibet to stem human rights violations by the Chinese government. She decided to combine her two passions—activism and climbing. Since finishing climbing the seven summits, Nazreen has been hard at work on her forthcoming Ösel Foundation, which she describes as an “educational institute set in the outdoors, which integrates the latest scientific findings about development of the mind and combines it with mindfulness techniques and training in nature to empower adolescent girls.” ==Bangladesh on Seven Summits== On 18 November 2015, Nazreen reached the summit of Carstensz Pyramid, summit of Oceania, completing a four years long journey to the Seven Summits. She was the first Bangladeshi and first Bengali to do so. She dedicated it to the “Spirit of 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh and all those who are fighting to protect it.\\" On 26 March 2011, to celebrate 40 years of Bangladeshi independence, Nazreen launched the \\"Bangladesh on Seven Summits\\" Campaign. For the campaign she has climbed each of seven continental summits to mark 40 years of women's progress in Bangladesh. The campaign received widespread support from the mass and was run completely independent of any political support, contrary to various claims made in the media by a number of Ministers in the Bangladesh Government. Among notable civilians, cricketers from the Bangladesh national team supported by advocating in their own rights, most outspokenly Shakib Al Hasan, world's number one all-rounder and Mashrafe Mortaza, the captain of the Bangladesh national cricket team. Nazreen was the first Bangladeshi to summit Aconcagua, South America’s highest peak and the highest peak outside of the Himalayas. She is also the first Bangladeshi to summit Denali, North America’s highest peak, Mt.Elbrus, Europe’s highest mountain, Vinson Massif, Antarctica’s highest mountain and Carstensz Pyramid, Oceania's highest mountain. Patrick Morrow, the first person in the world to have climbed the highest peaks of all seven continents (in accordance with the Messner list) has overseen her training. Nazreen dedicated her successful Everest climb to the women of Bangladesh, saying \\"We have achieved freedom 41 years ago, but our women are yet to enjoy freedom\\". Nazreen started trekking to base-camp of Everest on 26 March 2012 to mark Bangladesh's Independence day. ==Personal== Nazreen is vegetarian. A long-time supporter of Tibet, Nazreen is close friends with the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje and the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso. She often credits them in interviews as the two most important teachers in life who has shown her the way when she was derailed in life. ==Wasfia== Nazreen is the subject of the 2016 documentary Wasfia made by Apple Inc. and produced by Academy Awards nominated RYOT Films. The documentary was shot on the iPhone 6s and premiered at the Telluride Mountainfilm festival same year. The documentary is currently on tour around the world and is being shown as part of the National Geographic Shortfilm Showcase. It received critical acclaim internationally, including a nomination for the prestigious Tribeca-X award at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival and The New York Times calling it a bait for the Academy Awards. ==Awards== * Anannya Top Ten Awards (2015) ==ReferencesCategory:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Summiters of the Seven Summits Category:People from Chittagong Category:Female explorers Category:Agnes Scott College alumni Category:Bangladeshi mountain climbers Category:Female travelers Category:Tibetologists Category:Bangladeshi social workers Category:Female climbers Category:Bangladeshi women's rights activists Category:Bengali people ","title":"Wasfia Nazreen"},{"id":"35941680","text":" Liberdade class blended wing bodies are autonomous underwater gliders developed by the US Navy Office of Naval Research which use a blended wing body hullform to achieve hydrodynamic efficiency. It is an experimental class whose models were originally intended to track quiet diesel electric submarines in littoral waters, move at 1–3 knots and remain on station for up to six months. The \\"Liberdade\\" (Portuguese for \\"Liberty\\") was the name of a ship cobbled together by Joshua Slocum prior to the one he single-handedly piloted around the world. Members of the Liberdade class are the world's largest known underwater gliders and were developed as part of the US Navy's Persistent Littoral Undersea Surveillance Network (PlusNet) system of unmanned surveillance vehicles. The gliders can be deployed covertly with the capability of monitoring over 1000 km of ocean. The glider is designed to be difficult to detect using passive acoustic sensing. The Marine Physical Lab at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and the Applied Physics Lab at the University of Washington are the primary developers of the Liberdade class. The hull of the latest model was constructed by Legnos Boat, and consists of an ABS outer shell over a titanium frame. First major field tests of the Liberdade XRay took place in 2006 in Monterey Bay, California. Also participating in the development of the Liberdade class wings were: *University of Texas at Austin’s Applied Research Lab *Applied Research Lab at Penn State University *Massachusetts Institute of Technology *Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution *SAIC *Bluefin Robotics In 2007, XRay 2 was completed and demonstrated a 20 to 1 lift-to-drag ratio. In 2008, 55 field tests were conducted. In 2010, the latest generation \\"ZRay\\" model was completed and includes a 27 channel hydrophone array. Its goal is to track and automatically identify marine mammals. ZRay has a 35 to 1 lift-to-drag ratio, and has water jets for fine attitude control, as well as propulsion on the surface. ==References== Category:Underwater gliders Category:Anti-submarine warfare ","title":"Liberdade class underwater glider"},{"id":"35941686","text":"Cha Jong-bok (born 29 January 1980) is a South Korean field hockey player who competed in the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean male field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of South Korea Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Asian Games medalists in field hockey Category:Field hockey players at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Asian Games gold medalists for South Korea Category:Medalists at the 2006 Asian Games ","title":"Cha Jong-bok"},{"id":"35941689","text":"Sir Archibald Michie , (1813 – 21 June 1899) was an English-born Australian lawyer, journalist, Agent-General, Attorney-General of Victoria and politician.

Isabel was born at St James's Palace in London.Biography of Isabel Stuart She was the second daughter of James and Mary, after her sister Catherine Laura who died eleven months before Isabel's birth. Isabel had two older half-sisters from her father's first marriage to Anne Hyde: Mary and Anne; both would become reigning Queens of England. Isabel's paternal grandparents were Charles I of England and his wife Henrietta Maria of France, her maternal grandparents were Alfonso IV d'Este and Laura Martinozzi. ==Life== For the majority of her lifetime, Isabel was the royal couple's only child and thus fourth in line to the throne (behind her father, Mary and Anne). She was moved down a place upon the birth of her brother Charles Stuart, Duke of Cambridge; however, he died of smallpox after living only for a month, so Isabel was promoted back up to fourth in line. In 1678, Isabel was joined by another sister, Elizabeth, who was also short- lived. Her family had a portrait painted of her by Sir Peter Lely.Sir Peter Lely – Portrait of Princess Isabel In 1678 when Isabel was two years old, the Popish Plot led to her parents' being exiled to Brussels to stay with Mary. The royal couple were accompanied by Isabel and Anne. A report that her uncle King Charles was very sick sent the family hurrying back to England. They feared that the King's eldest illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth and commander of England's armed forces, might usurp the crown if Charles died in their absence.Oman, p 63.Fea, p 85. Monmouth enjoyed the support of the Exclusionists, who held a majority in the House of Commons of England. Charles survived but, feeling the family returned to court too soon, sent James and Mary to Edinburgh, where for the next three years they stayed on-and-off in the dilapidated Holyrood Palace,Haile, p 92.Turner, p 171. while Anne and Isabel stayed in London on Charles's orders.Oman, p 67. The couple were recalled to London in February 1680, only to return again to Edinburgh that autumn; this time they went on a more honourable footing: James was created King's Commissioner to Scotland.Fea, p 96. Separation from Isabel caused her mother to sink into a state of sadness, exacerbated by the passing of the Exclusion bill in the Commons.Waller, p 35Haile, pp. 99–100 Lady Isabel, thus far the only one of Mary's children to survive infancy, died of natural causes in March 1681, five months before her fifth birthday, at St James's Palace, the place of her birth.Oman, p 71. She was buried at Westminster Abbey on 4 March (Old Style) as \\"The Lady Isabella, daughter to the Duke of York. Isabel's death plunged Mary into a religious mania, worrying her physician. At the same time as news reached Holyrood of Isabel's death, her maternal grandmother, Laura Martinozzi, was falsely accused of offering £10,000 for the murder of the King.
