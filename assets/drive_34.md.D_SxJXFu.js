The mill is open to the public on most Sundays from Easter until October. ==History== Windmill Hill Mill was built c. 1814 by William Medhurst, the Lewes millwright. It was working by wind until 1893, when it was stopped owing to a weak weatherbeam. It is the largest post mill in Sussex, and is unique in that it is fitted with Hammond's Patent Sweep Governor, a feature previously fitted to Jack Mill, Clayton. After work by wind had ceased, milling was continued by means of a steam-powered mill set up in the roundhouse. Neve, the Warbleton millwright was responsible for the fitting-out of the roundhouse as a power mill. The mill stood derelict for many years with major structural faults, including both side girts being broken. ==Restoration== In 1994, a supporting steel framework was placed around the mill, and the remaining iron sheeting that clad the breast and sides of the mill removed. The tail of the mill was clad in plywood to keep the weather out. A trust was set up in 1995, aiming to prevent further deterioration in the condition of the mill, and to assess options for restoration. The Heritage Lottery Fund agreed in principle to support the restoration work. English Heritage funded the study to produce an application for lottery funds to restore the mill. A detailed study of the mill was made in the summer of 2000. IJP Millwrights of Binfield Heath were contracted to restore the mill. A grant of ¬£570,000 towards a total restoration cost of ¬£770,000 was made in December 2001, this being the biggest single Lottery grant to an individual windmill. The mill was dismantled during November and December 2003, and taken in sections to IJP's workshops. Modern millwrighting techniques, including CAD were used in the assessment of the structure of the mill in preparation for the rebuild. It was found that one of the quarterbars in the trestle would need to be replaced due to damage done by Death Watch Beetles. The rebuilt frame of the mill was lifted back onto the main post on 7 September 2004. The sails were fitted to the mill between 24 November and 3 December 2005. On 19 November 2014 the Heritage Lottery Fund announced the grant of ¬£80,800 for restoration of machinery and sweeps to grind flour. On 5 November 2015, the full patent sweeps turned again for the first time in 120 years. ==Description== Hammond's Sweep Governor Windmill Hill Mill is a post mill on a two-storey roundhouse. She has four patent sails carried on a cast-iron windshaft and was winded by a tailpole. Winding is now computer-controlled, with an automatic turning device installed that receives information about the wind direction from sensors mounted on the mill. The wooden brake-wheel is of clasp-arm construction, with oak arms and an elm rim. It has 104 cogs and drives a stone nut with twelve cogs. The tail wheel is of cast iron, with 130 cogs. The mill drove two pairs of millstones, arranged head and tail. The headstones are Peak stones and the tailstones are French Burrs. The body of the mill is long and wide, the largest surviving post mill by floor plan in the United Kingdom. It is high to the roof, the second tallest post mill in England.The Windmill at Windmill Hill - The Guide (Booklet published by Windmill Hill Windmill Trust). The roundhouse is in diameter and has a single-storey lean-to extension of part of its circumference. When originally built, the mill had a single-storey roundhouse which was raised in the 1850s. The Hammond's Sweep Governor was fitted in the 1870s. ==Millers== *Beeney 1845 - 1877 *Charles Edwin Hammond 1878 - 1887 *Henry Harmer 1887 - 1913 References for above:- ==See also== * ==References== ==Further reading== Online version ==External links== *Windmill World Page on Windmill Hill Mill. *Windmill Hill Windmill Trust website. *Hammond's Patent Sweep Governor Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1814 Category:Windmills in East Sussex Category:Post mills in the United Kingdom Category:Grade II* listed buildings in East Sussex Category:Mill museums in England Category:Museums in East Sussex ","title":"Windmill Hill Mill, Herstmonceux"},{"id":"17313697","text":"Viktor Alekseyevich Popkov (; June 17, 1946 ‚Äì June 2, 2001) was a Russian dissident, Christian, humanitarian, human rights activist and journalist. A deeply religious Old Believer and pacifist, Popkov taught non-violence, and spent the last 15 years of his life in conflict areas of the collapsing Soviet Union, including the Abkhaz‚ÄìGeorgian conflict, the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and the Chechen Wars. Popkov died on June 2, 2001, after being shot during a drive-by shooting while working as an aid worker in Chechnya days earlier. ==Early life and activism== Viktor Alekseyevich Popkov was born on 17 June 1946, in Krasnodar, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. Popkov spent much of his childhood in the Azerbaijan SSR, as his parents worked in the Zagatala State Reserve. Popkov studied physics in Moscow but left without graduating, instead becoming a journalist and a seismologist in Kamchatka. In 1979 he married Tatyana Lebedeva. == Caucasus activity == In 1992, Popkov founded and then led the interdenominational and inter-ethnic human rights group Omega, set up to promote dialogue between different ethnicities and religious denominations in the Nagorno-Karabakh War. He also joined the Memorial Human Rights Center, a leading Russian human rights group, and worked as a freelance journalist for the oppositionist newspaper Novaya Gazeta. Popkov later led a peace march in Abkhazia, delivered food to the starving town of Tkvarcheli besieged by the Georgian forces, and helped save many people from summary execution after the fall of Sukhum. Popkov began working in Chechnya in 1995 during the First Chechen War, where he helped negotiate the release of dozens of civilian hostages and prisoners of war (including a Russian Army general), and was a frequent visitor to Grozny during the heavy fighting, where he helped release some of the Russian prisoners of war held in the Presidential Palace in Grozny just before the Russian bombing in 1995. In the aftermath of the war, he delivered humanitarian aid to refugees and documented atrocities, and during the Second Chechen War he filmed the aftermath of the Novye Aldi massacre in 2000. In 1999 he conducted a 40-day hunger strike in protest at the renewed war in Chechnya. Afterwards, he became involved in attempts to restore contacts between Chechen Republic President Aslan Maskhadov and the Russian federal authorities. During the Second Chechen War, Popkov often was arbitrarily detained by the security forces and his humanitarian activities were severely hindered by the Russian military. He was also frequently detained and threatened by some of the Chechen field commanders. ==Death== On 18 April 2001, Popkov was assassinated near the village of Alkhan-Kala, Chechnya, while delivering medical supplies to civilians after a battle had recently taken place there. His ambulance was ambushed in the vicinity of a Russian Army checkpoint by masked gunmen in a Lada car, who opened fire with an automatic weapon and then drove away. The attackers were said to be Chechen Islamic fundamentalists in collusion with the Russian forces, and in 2002 Memorial pinpointed them to be members of an armed group led by the notorious warlord Arbi Barayev. Popkov's condition was irreversibly aggravated when the troops at the checkpoint held him, his driver, and a Chechen doctor Rosa Muzarova (all of whom suffered serious injuries in the attack and were heavily bleeding) for reportedly one to three hours following the shooting. By the time the wounded were taken to Hospital No. 9 in Grozny, their condition was critical and Popkov was already in coma. Viktor Popkov died in the Vishnevsky 3rd Central Military Clinical Hospital in Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast, without regaining consciousness, leaving behind a seriously ill widow Tatyana and a disabled daughter Ulyana. ==References== ==External links== * Soviet Abkhazia 1989: Facts and Thoughts by Viktor Popkov * Appeal to the journalists and public figures who recognize the need to stop the war in Chechnya and to start political peace negotiations * Viktor Popkov 1952-2001 Russian human rights campaigner, peacemaker and negotiator in Chechnya Religious Society of Friends * Human rights activist shot in Chechnya, BBC News, 21 April 2001 * * Face to faith.

It was their second, and final, album for Capitol and their last before their nearly seven- year hiatus; their covers album The Party's Over was rejected by Capitol and the Smoking Popes disbanded in December 1998, reuniting in November 2005 to record At Metro. Destination Failure was not as successful as the band's previous album Born to Quit; it failed to chart despite the release a single and music video for \\"I Know You Love Me\\". The album was recorded at the Chicago Recording Company and at Conway Studios in Hollywood with producer Jerry Finn and recording engineer Phil Bonnet. Bonnet had worked with the band since early in their career, engineering and producing their EPs Break Up and 2 as well as Born to Quit. The songs \\"Let's Hear It for Love\\" and \\"Can't Find It\\" are new recordings of songs from the Get Fired. The Destination Failure version of \\"Can't Find It\\" is slower than the original version. \\"I Know You Love Me\\" references singer and guitarist Josh Caterer's newfound interest in Christianity, while \\"You Spoke to Me\\" refers to Blake Schwarzenbach of Jawbreaker and Jets to Brazil, who the Smoking Popes had toured with. \\"Paul\\" is about enduring an ex-lover's affection for her new man. Destination Failure also includes a cover version of \\"Pure Imagination\\", a song from the musical film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. == Reception == Jack Rabid of Allmusic gave Destination Failure three stars out of five, saying that the band \\"humbly offer[s] a singular style that is actually power pop in the early-'70s and early-'80s tradition ‚Äî from the young Todd Rundgren to the Fabulous Poodles [...] With a singer in Josh Caterer who can make the most melancholic, fretting passage seem like a whistling, carefree, Willy Wonka- kissed day (and who still sounds like a cross between XTC's Andy Partridge and Gilbert O'Sullivan) and a band who is gleeful, but not in a churlish-youthful way, Smoking Popes are one of the most deceptively pleasant-sounding bands going.\\" Tyler Barrett of Punknews.org gave the album a perfect score of five stars, calling it \\"a masterpiece. Caterer's songwriting dives head-first into the core of humanity, and the music is as good as the best pop-punk you've ever heard.\\" Several artists covered songs from Destination Failure for the 2003 Smoking Popes Tribute album: Bad Astronaut covered \\"Megan\\", Saturday Supercade performed \\"Paul\\", Junction 18 contributed a rendition of \\"End of Your Time\\", and The Ataris covered \\"Pretty Pathetic\\" (The Ataris version had previously been released on their EP All You Can Ever Learn Is What You Already Know).

It is located near Villa Alta District in the center of the Sierra Norte Region. The town is divided into four neighborhoods (in Spanish called \\"barrios\\"). These 4 barrios are: San Juan, Santiago, Santa Catalina, and Santa Rosa. ==Culture== On August 30th and July 24th, in honor of San Juan Bautista, the townspeople of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag celebrate their annual festival, with popular dancing, processions, and offerings. ===Traditions=== Traditions include Semana Santa and Todos los Santos. ===Music=== Popular bands in Villa Hidalgo Yalalag are \\"Banda Uken ke Uken\\" and \\"Los Ratones. == Yalaltecos in Los Angeles == Lourdes Guti√©rrez N√°jera uses Zapotecs from Yal√°lag as an example of migrants who originate from Oaxaca, M√©xico and form their own spaces of belonging in the United States, specifically in Los Angeles. The community of Yalaltecos in Los Angeles comes together collectively and participates in festivals, ceremonies, tandas and other small gatherings where they can gossip in Yal√°lag Zapotec, share food, dance, financially and emotionally support one another, and engage in other customs and traditions from the small rural town which is their place of origin. The existence and practice of customs and traditions that were once thought to be exclusive to Yal√°lag, but that have now permeated American society, demonstrates the transnational character of Yalaltecos indigeneity that makes possible the process of Hayandose through the seizure and declaration of these ethnically-marked spaces. Yalaltecos living in Los Angeles have invoked their cultural identity hundreds of miles from home and have used it as a tool to resist the push for assimilation and marginalization within the United States. Therefore, the transmission and continuity of culture across national borders are essential for Yalaltecos to mark their own space and ultimately find themselves in a hostile environment far from their home country. With this new-found sense of belonging, the opportunity for ‚Äúrally[ing] for indigenous rights and the development of hometown communities in Oaxaca, as well as to organize in the United States around immigrant legislation‚Äù no longer remains out of reach.Guti√©rrez-N√°jera, Lourdes. ‚ÄúHayandose‚Äù, in Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America.

It became their only release to chart, reaching #37 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart, partly on the strength of the single \\"Need You Around\\" which reached #35 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. == Background == Johann's Face Records, an independent record label in Chicago, had released the Smoking Popes' debut album Get Fired in 1993. For their second album, Born to Quit, the band returned to Solid Sound Studios in Hoffman Estates, Illinois to record with Phil Bonnet, the same location and recording engineer used for their EPs Break Up (1992) and 2 (1993). Bonnet also mixed and produced the album. Born to Quit was released in 1994 through Johann's Face, and the song \\"Need You Around\\" soon received radio play on Chicago's Q101 and Los Angeles' KROQ. The band then signed to major label Capitol Records, who re-released Born to Quit on July 7, 1995. Singles were released for \\"Rubella\\" and \\"Need You Around\\", and the latter song was included in the soundtrack of the film Clueless. It became the only Smoking Popes song to chart, reaching #35 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks. Several other songs from the album were also used in film soundtracks: \\"Lucky Day\\" was used in Tommy Boy, \\"Mrs. You and Me\\" in Angus, and \\"Gotta Know Right Now\\" in Boys. To support the album the Smoking Popes toured with the Goo Goo Dolls, Tripping Daisy, Jawbreaker, Dinosaur Jr., and Morrissey. Born to Quit became the only Smoking Popes album ever to chart, reaching #37 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers. In 2009 Asian Man Records announced plans to reissue a remastered version of Born to Quit. == Reception == Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave Born to Quit 4¬Ω stars out of 5, saying that \\"the thing that sets [the Smoking Popes] apart from the standard four-piece alternative hard rock outfit is not only their pop sense, it's how the lead vocalist uncannily recalls the quavering, self-absorbed tone of Morrissey. Combined with their gift for hooks, it makes for a sound that is familiar, yet surprisingly distinctive.\\" Morrissey himself later called the album \\"extraordinary, the most lovable thing I'd heard in years.\\" Several artists covered songs from Born to Quit for the 2003 Smoking Popes Tribute album: Retro Morning covered \\"Need You Around\\", Blue Shade Witness performed \\"Mrs. You and Me\\", and the Red Hot Valentines provided a rendition of \\"Rubella\\". == Track listing == == Personnel == === Band === *Josh Caterer ‚Äì vocals, guitar *Eli Caterer ‚Äì guitar *Matt Caterer ‚Äì bass guitar *Mike Felumlee ‚Äì drums === Additional musicians === *Lynette White ‚Äì backing vocals on \\"Rubella\\" === Production === *Phil Bonnet ‚Äì recording engineer, mix engineer, producer *Markus Greiner ‚Äì design *David Houle ‚Äì band photos *Brekken Garner ‚Äì cover photo == References == Category:Smoking Popes albums Category:Capitol Records albums Category:1994 albums ","title":"Born to Quit"},{"id":"17313891","text":"The diplomatic post of United States Ambassador to Slovenia was created after the disbanding of Yugoslavia and the United States recognizing the new nation of Slovenia on April 7, 1992.

He only took up refereeing after an eye injury ended his playing career.Referee Titcomb dies Planet Rugby He officiated his first match in Moseley as the substitute referee when the one originally scheduled failed to show. The RFU were impressed by his performance and Titcomb quickly made it to the international ranks. He officiated five England Trials, three Barbarian fixtures and 26 county matches, including three finals. Several of the matches he refereed are well remembered including when Oxford University beat South Africa 6‚Äì3. The most famous moment of his career came in 1968 when he wrongly awarded a drop goal to Gareth Edwards of Wales. With the call it brought the score of the Wales-Ireland international to 6‚Äì6. The Irish fans acted with anger to Titcomb's call pelting him with bottles and other missiles as he left the pitch at the end of the game.Former rugby union referee Mike Titcomb dies at age 75 NBC Sports Former referee Titcomb dies at 75 24.com Titcomb later apologized for his call.

For over 25 years, he was an outspoken critic of the Marxist governments of the Pathet Lao in Laos and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam(SRV) and their human rights violations, religious freedom violations, and persecution of the Lao and Hmong people. ==Early life== Vang was born in Laos on July 12, 1957. He later moved to the United States and received his PhD in international relations from the University of Colorado Denver with a focus on world politics and Asian security, refugee and human rights issues. Vang was fluent in the languages of Hmong Daw (White Hmong), Mong Njua (Green Hmong), Laotian, English and was able to speak and read some French.Smith, Philip, Center for Public Policy Analysis, http://www.centerforpublicpolicyanlysis ==Career== Vang was responsible for the United Nations's recognition of Hmong as the proper term for the Hmong people. Additionally, he testified in the US Congress, and at the United Nations in New York City and Geneva on numerous occasions on the Hmong genocide in Laos.\\"Lao Human Rights Council letter to Ways and Means Subcommittee.\\" April 9, 2003. Vang founded and served as the first president and executive director of the non-governmental organization Lao Human Rights Council.Lao Human Rights Council, Inc., Green Bay, Wisconsin, (20 December 2014) http://www.laohumanrightscouncil-inc.org Vang also founded the Hmong American United Students Association in Eau Claire, Wisconsin in April 1981. In September 1986, he was appointed to form and chair the Hmong Council Education Committee. In the 1980s and 1990s, Dr. Vang worked with Philip Smith and The Center for Public Policy Analysis in Washington, D.C., to research and obtain additional evidence of human rights violations in Laos as well as the forced repatriation of Laotian and Hmong refugees from Thailand back to the communist regime in Laos they fled. Vang frequently traveled to Southeast Asia, including Thailand, and Washington, D.C., to conduct research and public policy advocacy‚Äîand to meet with policymakers and Members of the U.S. Congress. This important information was often shared with key Members of the U.S. Congress and policymakers in Washington, D.C. who eventually worked to try and halted, and reverse, the forced repatriation of Lao and Hmong refugees from Thailand back to Laos, including the thousands of Hmong refugees who fled to the Buddhist Temple of Wat Tham Krabok. Many of these Southeast Asian refugees, and asylum seekers, were eventually resettled in the United States as a result of the work of Vang, Philip Smith, The Centre for Public Policy Analysis, the Lao Veterans of America, the United League for Democracy in Laos and others, to reverse the forced repatriation policy directed against Laotian and Hmong refugees who had fled political persecution from communist Laos to Thailand. In a paper published in 1990, Hmong-rights activist Vang Pobzeb wrote that Laos was colonial territory of Vietnam since 2 December 1975 and was directed by Vietnam in its internal and external affairs. According to Smith and The Centre for Public Policy Analysis, in the 1990s and early 2000s, Vang and the Lao Human Rights Council helped to raise awareness and provide research and information about military attacks and human rights violations in Laos by Pathet Lao forces, the Lao People's Army and the Vietnam People's Army.

Till seraphs swing their snowy hats, And saints to windows run, To see the little tippler Leaning against the sun! } == Description == Manuscript version in the Houghton Library (72a), J214, Fr207. Emily Dickinson's manuscript version (as the poem appears today) differs significantly from the Republican version in the last two lines of the first verse and in its final line (from Manzanilla come!). The poem exhibits several typical features of Dickinson's poems. Like most of Dickinson's poems, it was written in ballad metre, iambic lines that alternate between four and three beats to the line. This is a less regular, more intimate, version of the common metre used in hymns such as Amazing Grace. The syllable count is not so strict and only the second and fourth lines are required to rhyme. As in most of her poems, dashes typically replace punctuation and there is an idiosyncratic use of capitalization. These were edited from the poem by the Republican, but Emily regarded them as an integral part of her verse.Wetzsteon in The Collected Poems of Emily Dickinson (Introduction) The poem begins with a paradox (a liquor never brewed) and finishes with a striking image (a tippler supported by the sun rather than the traditional lamppost), both common devices in Dickinson's poetry. It employs slant rhyme in the first quatrain, where pearl is made to rhyme with alcohol. Dickinson was censured for this (precisely this example by Andrew Lang) by some early critics while others celebrated it as avant-garde.Benfey p. 30 That Dickinson used the slant rhyme in her manuscript version (it is not in the Republican version) demonstrates she preferred it and indeed examples occur in most of her verse. She famously remarked, \\"Tell all the Truth, but tell it slant\\". == Temperance reform == In his essay Emily Dickinson and popular culture, David S. Reynolds considers Emily Dickinson's receptiveness to popular culture. Temperance literature was a fertile seedbed of imagery, both for her and for other writers of the period such as Thoreau she was familiar with. In the first verse, Dickinson ironically revises the popular trope of the intemperate temperance advocate, as both completely drunk and completely temperate (\\"a liquor never brewed\\"). Succeeding verses revise other popular images. For example, the third verse brings to mind Timothy Shay Arthur's Ten Nights in a Bar Room. Her use of quotation marks underscores that she is borrowing from others. Her purpose however is to transform these images, intoxicating her readers themselves with the force of her imagination. ==Notes== == References == * * * ==External links== * * Dickinson Electronic Archives Category:American poems Category:Poetry by Emily Dickinson Category:1890 poems ","title":"I taste a liquor never brewed"},{"id":"17314163","text":"Silica in a spin column with water and with DNA sample in chaotropic buffer Spin column-based nucleic acid purification is a solid phase extraction method to quickly purify nucleic acids. This method relies on the fact that nucleic acid will bind to the solid phase of silica under certain conditions. ==Procedure== The stages of the method are lyse, bind, wash and elute, i.e. lysis of cells, binding of nucleic acid to silica gel membrane, washing the nucleic acid bound to the silica gel membrane and elution of the nucleic acid. To lyse, the cells of a sample are processed with a lytic procedure, which involves breaking the cell membrane and freeing the nucleic acid. For binding, a buffer solution is then added to the sample along with ethanol or isopropanol. This forms the binding solution. The binding solution is transferred to a spin column and the column is put in a centrifuge. The centrifuge forces the binding solution through a silica gel membrane that is inside the spin column. If the pH and salt concentration of the binding solution are optimal, the nucleic acid will bind to the silica gel membrane as the solution passes through. To wash, the flow-through is removed and a wash buffer is added to the column. The column is put in a centrifuge again, forcing the wash buffer through the membrane. This removes any remaining impurities from the membrane, leaving only the nucleic acid bound to the silica gel. To elute, the wash buffer is removed and an elution buffer (or simply water) is added to the column. The column is put in a centrifuge again, forcing the elution buffer through the membrane. The elution buffer removes the nucleic acid from the membrane and the nucleic acid is collected from the bottom of the column. ==Related methods== Even prior to the nucleic acid methods employed today it was known that in the presence of chaotropic agents, such as sodium iodide or sodium perchlorate, DNA binds to silica, glass particles or to unicellular algae called diatoms which shield their cell walls with silica. This property was used to purify nucleic acid using glass powder or silica beads under alkaline conditions.Marko MA, Chipperfield R, Birnboim HC. A procedure for the large-scale isolation of highly purified plasmid DNA using alkaline extraction and binding to glass powder. Anal Biochem. 1982 Apr;121(2):382-7. This was later improved using guanidinium thiocyanate or guanidinium hydrochloride as the chaotropic agent.Boom R, Sol CJ, Salimans MM, Jansen CL, Wertheim-van Dillen PM, van der Noordaa J.

He was persecuted by the Communists and named among the 100 greatest Romanians. He was born in Va»õa de Sus, Hunedoara County, Romania, died at Sinaia Monastery and was buried at Prislop Monastery in Silva»ôu de Sus village. ==Studies and formation== Boca was born on 29 September 1910, in Va»õa de Sus, Romania, and his parents gave him the first name Zian. He studied at the ‚ÄùAvram Iancu‚Äù National High School from Brad, Hunedoara, graduating in 1929. The same year he embarked upon study at the Theological Academy in Sibiu, from which he graduated in 1933. He received a scholarship from the Archbishop of Transylvania to study at the Fine Arts Academy in Bucharest. Meanwhile, he attended the medical classes of Professor Francisc Rainer and the Christian Mysticism class of ultra-right ideologist, Professor Nichifor Crainic. Recognising his artistic talent, Professor Costin Petrescu entrusted him with the painting of a depiction of Mihai Viteazul for the Romanian Athenaeum. Sent by his bishop, he travelled to Mount Athos for documentation and spiritual experience. ==Serving the Church== Boca was made a deacon on 29 September 1935 by Metropolitan Nicolae BƒÉlan of Transylvania. In 1939 he spent three months in the Romanian Skete Prodromos on Mount Athos. On his return, he joined the Br√¢ncoveanu Monastery at S√¢mbƒÉta de Sus, Bra≈üov County, where he took his vows and was tonsured into monasticism in 1940. He was ordained priest and became the abbot of the Br√¢ncoveanu Monastery in 1942. As abbot he embellished and renovated the buildings of the monastery, while also enriching its spiritual and cultural life. He helped theologian Dumitru StƒÉniloae from Sibiu with the translation into Romanian of the first volumes of the Philokalia, a collection of early Church Fathers and monastics in the hesychast tradition. Boca was an adept of Anthroposophy, a spiritual movement initiated by the Austrian occultist Rudolf Steiner, which influenced Boca's paintings from the church at DrƒÉgƒÉnescu, wherein the spectre of Jesus Christ rises from the rock covering the grave. Boca also had aptitudes as a mentalist. ===Under Communism=== After the installation of the communist regime in Romania, Boca was persecuted by the authorities and the regime's secret police, the Securitate. He was arrested several times for allegedly helping the anti-communist resistance, removed from Br√¢ncoveanu Monastery to Prislop Monastery and thence to Sinaia Monastery. He was banned from monasticism and Church activities and was constantly under the surveillance and harassment of the Securitate. ==Works of art== Arsenie Boca had his own vision upon creating religious paintings which raised controversy among his sanctification. The paintings that are not according to the Orthodox Iconography are the representation of Papal Basilica of Saint Peter, or Francisco de Assisi and Ulfilas the Arian among Orthodox Saints. ==Sanctification== Father Arsenie has not yet been canonized as a saint. Nonetheless pilgrims from all over Romania flock to pray at his grave which is located in Prislop Monastery, Romania.

He was a significant reformer of child care, emphasising the irreplaceable role of the family. He was known for studies of the effects on children of being held in prison camps during World War II, was a co-founder and the first chairman of an association that involved animals, such as dogs and horses, in child therapy, and was the principal organizer of a meeting of the International Association for Research in Learning Disabilities, held in Prague on October 2‚Äì5, 1989. He placed 93rd on Nejvƒõt≈°√≠ ƒåech. ==Early life== Matƒõjƒçek was born in 1922 in Chlumec nad Cidlinou, East Bohemia. His father was a director of the Kladruby Stud Farm, where he lived until his adulthood with his parents and a younger brother. His parents were Czech evangelists. After graduating from Pardubice High School he was not allowed to study due to the war, and so he assisted his father at the horse farm as a regular worker, and later at Bata shoe company in Zl√≠n. After the war Matƒõjƒçek studied at the Faculty of Arts of Charles University, hoping to become a teacher. He graduated with a degree in Czech and philosophy (which at the time included psychology), and as he had already studied it, he decided to become a psychologist. From 1950‚Äì51 he worked briefly at an educational institute, before he started working at the Sociodiagnostic Institute of Prague, focusing on developmental research on children in orphanages and children's homes. The institute, focused on child care, disorder and handicap diagnostics and therapy, was ahead of its time in involving an entire team of experts in the diagnostic process, including psychologists, doctors, and social workers. Close attention was paid to the functioning of the family. At the institute Matƒõjƒçek started his cooperation with Josef Langmeier, and together they created an original and innovative approach to understanding mental deprivation, defining the mental needs of children and the consequences of unfulfilled basic needs. Based on regular and long-standing study of children in children's homes ‚Äì conditions depriving them of many of their basic psychological and social needs ‚Äì the authors proved that institutional care presents a great risk to a child's mental and social development, and its negative consequences continue their impact on these children throughout their lives. Together they coined a new psychological term, \\"mental deprivation\\", publishing their findings in the book Childhood Mental Deprivation, which attracted great attention locally, running into four editions, as well as internationally, where it was translated into English, German and Russian. ==Later life== From 1953 until 1969 he worked at a Psychiatry clinic for children in Prague. After that he accepted an invitation from Josef ≈†vejcar and joined the Institute for Further Education of Doctors and Pharmacists in the Department of Pediatrics as an assistant professor. Here, he resumed his cooperation with Langmeier. Together they finalised their pedagogy and clinical research and founded the Prague School of Clinical Psychology and Psychological Counselling. Matƒõjƒçek supervised many theses, which proved fruitful when he founded the Professor Matƒõjƒçek Foundation to reward the best theses on child developmental psychology. Gradually, he gained a reputation as an expert on psychology. He published and lectured throughout Czechoslovakia as well as abroad. He also dedicated himself to dyslexia and was a co-founder of SOS children's villages in the Czech Republic. From 1991 until the end of his life he worked at the Psychiatry Center in Prague and from 1994 in Paprsek child centre.

It was also known as the WSK SM-2. ==Design and development== From 1956, the Soviet light three-seat or four-seat helicopter Mi-1 was produced under license in the Polish WSK PZL-≈öwidnik works in ≈öwidnik, under a designation SM-1 ‚Äì and as much, as 1594 were manufactured. In 1957, works started in WSK PZL-≈öwidnik to modernize the helicopter and fit it with an enlarged, five-seat cabin. One of the design goals was to make training easier, by placing the two pilots side by side. In air ambulance role, it was easier to treat a patient inside a fuselage, than in side capsules. The helicopter's main designer was Jerzy Tyrcha.Budniak, Karol. Historia powstania ≈õmig≈Çowca, \\"Aeroplan\\" Nr. 5-6(122-123)/2013, p. 4-7 (in Polish) The most obvious difference was a larger cabin, extended towards the front, but in fact most fuselage parts were reconstructed. The cabin had two wide side doors, sliding rearwards, being an improvement over the Mi-1, in which its automobile door could not be opened in flight and had to be removed for some purposes. Unchanged were: the engine, transmission and rotor, the fuselage boom and the landing gear (only early machines had different front wheel suspension). On contrary to the Mi-1, a headlight was movable. The prototype flew first on 18 November 1959. It appeared successful and a limited production started in 1960. Its take-off characteristics and performance were slightly worse, than of Mi-1/SM-1 ‚Äì one of the reasons was an unsuitable carburetor intake, but it was improved only on some helicopters.Skowro≈Ñski (2009), p. 15 Only 86 helicopters were produced, in four series, differing in details, plus three prototypesBudniak, Karol.

They were produced almost exclusively for Poland, while the SM-1 remained main export product of ≈öwidnik at that time. The helicopter was manufactured only in one variant, and could change its role to passenger, transport, air ambulance or flying crane. SM-2 in the Polish Aviation Museum in Krak√≥w Helicopter Museum, Weston-super- Mare. Visible is a hatch in a nose. Basic variant had seats for three passengers on a rear bench and one seat next to a pilot. There were no double controls. In the air ambulance configuration, single stretchers were carried in the fuselage ‚Äì loaded through a special hatch in a fuselage front, on the right side. A physician could seat behind the pilot, other seats were removed. Additional two injured could be carried in detachable external closed capsules on either side of the fuselage, typical for Mi-1. All variants could carry additional external fuel tank 140 l on the left side, extending range to 500 km (it could not be used with side capsules). The crane variant (sometimes known as SM-2D) was used in limited numbers for search and rescue missions; it had a hydraulic winch that could lift 120 kg, in a place of a right front seat. After removal of all passenger seats, 320 kg of load could be carried. They had a durability of 600 flight hours, like contemporary SM-1 helicopters. ==Operational history== SM-2s were used mainly by Polish military aviation ‚Äì 80 were delivered, between March 1961 and 1964.Budniak, Karol. U≈ºytkownicy SM-2, \\"Aeroplan\\" Nr. 5-6(122-123)/2013, p. 22-25 (in Polish) They were operated in small numbers by several units of the Polish Air Force and Polish Navy, mostly for liaison, artillery spotting, air ambulance tasks and others. In Polish Navy they were used for search-and-rescue actions. This number included a flight assigned to Internal Security Corps, later Ministry of Internal Affairs (police aviation). Only two ex-military SM-2 (registration numbers SP-SXY and SP-SXZ) and the second prototype were used by civilian air ambulance service. One helicopter remained in PZL-≈öwidnik factory (SP-SAP), and the other was acquired by the factory from the air force (SP-SFA). Most SM-2s were withdrawn in late 1970s and replaced with Mil Mi-2. The last one was withdrawn from the air force in 1981, and flew until 1983 (it was preserved in the factory). Only five SM-2 were exported. One was sold to Czechoslovakia, used in 1963‚Äì70 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (registration OK-BYK), then by Slov-Air until 1975 for internal transport (registration changed to OK-RUV).Budniak, Karol. U≈ºytkownicy SM-2, \\"Aeroplan\\" Nr. 5-6(122-123)/2013, p. 26-27 (in Polish) Four SM-2 were sold in 1963 to Romania, used by 1975 in the military aviation (the 94th Helicopter Regiment).

Constructing integrals involves choice of what path to take, which means singularities and branch points of the equation need to be studied. Analytic continuation is used to generate new solutions and this means topological considerations such as monodromy, coverings and connectedness are to be taken into account. Existence and uniqueness theorems involve the use of majorants and minorants. Study of rational second order ODEs in the complex plane led to the discovery of new transcendental special functions, which are now known as Painlev√© transcendents. Nevanlinna theory can be used to study complex differential equations.

northerly point in County Donegal) to Mizen Head in County Cork (commonly thought to be Ireland's most southerly point, although nearby Brow Head is approximately 9 metres further south). The journey is most often attempted by cyclists and walkers as a challenge route with the goal of raising money for charities. As the crow flies, the two points are apart. The shortest road distance from Malin to Mizen is approximately . The distance of the routes commonly taken have been reported as between 644 and 715 km (400 and 444 miles). ==Cycling== A record cycling time of 19 hours 3 mins was set in 1993 by Alex Barry.

The most important of the people with this name was born between 1250 and 1260, his father also was called Cuauhtlequetzqui, a fact that has caused some confusion. In addition, this personage is projected further into the past, making him the first cuauhtlahto (Mexica leader) \\"to set out\\" from Aztlan,Chimalpain, p.159. Chimalpain places him as ruler from 1116-1153, and even says that he is the same person mentioned from 1280 AD onward. His historical participation is extensively mythologised, his first action is in the war against the Texcaltepeca- Malinalcas in 1281, when, as war-leader, he distinguished himself by capturing Copil, the enemy leader, and taking his enemy's wife, Xicomoyahualtzin, for himself. From this union Cohuatzontli was born. In the legend, Copil is said to be the son of Malinalxochitl, the sister of Huitzilopochtli. This woman was humiliated when she was dishonourably abandoned in Malinalco and swore to avenge herself, with her son Copil being the means of doing so. But with the failure at Chapoltepec in 1281, the myth came to symbolise the foundation of the site, with the legend becoming the justification for Tenochca domination over other peoples, as well as aligning them theologically with the Matalazincas. With the victory in Chapoltepec, Cuauhtlequetzqui was named lord there. He only ruled for five years, being killed in the final battle when the warriors of Teotenanco tried, unsuccessfully, to recapture the area of the forest. ==Notes== ==References== *Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuanitzin, Domingo.

He signed professionally in June 1973, and broke into the first team in the following season, making 18 appearances in the Third Division. He came to prominence in the 1976‚Äì77 season, when he made 41 league appearances, and played in the first ever England under-21 international match, thus attracting the attention of First Division club Wolverhampton Wanderers. Wolves paid a club record ¬£150,000 for Bradshaw in September 1977. He made his debut on 1 October 1977 in a 3‚Äì0 home win over Leicester City and remained the first-choice goalkeeper for the next five seasons. Bradshaw made 243 appearances for Wolves in total, winning the 1980 League Cup, playing in two FA Cup semi-finals and appearing in European competition. He was voted the club's Player of the Year in both 1981 and 1982. He lost his place to John Burridge for the 1982‚Äì83 season, as the club won promotion back to the top flight at the first attempt. Bradshaw remained to play 10 more First Division games for the side before leaving in August 1984 to join the Vancouver Whitecaps of the North American Soccer League. After the American league folded, Bradshaw returned to England. He joined West Bromwich Albion in February 1985 as a back-up player until he took up a coaching role at Walsall in June 1986. He soon returned to playing though, signing for Bristol Rovers on a non-contract basis, and later played in Newport County final season in the Football League. After a second spell at West Bromwich Albion, he played the 1990‚Äì91 season with Peterborough United and finished his career in non-league football with Kettering Town before retiring in 1992. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:People from Altrincham Category:English footballers Category:England under-21 international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Vancouver Whitecaps (1974‚Äì1984) players Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Newport County A.F.C. players Category:Peterborough United F.C. players Category:Kettering Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) players Category:English expatriate footballers Category:English expatriate sportspeople in Canada Category:Expatriate soccer players in Canada Category:Footballers from Greater Manchester ","title":"Paul Bradshaw (footballer, born 1956)"},{"id":"17314630","text":" MiG-33 was the development designation of the aircraft that was eventually delivered as the MiG-29. Certain variants of the MiG-29 were designated MiG-33. The designation MiG-33 has been associated with two different Mikoyan fighter designs. It was first employed for a single-engine, lightweight strike fighter similar in capabilities to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. More formally known as \\"Project 33\\", development work began on this design about 1980, but was cancelled in 1986 as the result of changing Soviet Air Forces requirements. However, in 1998 China purchased the design and test data from Russia to aid in expediting the development of the CAC/PAC JF-17 Thunder. More recently, the MiG-33 designation was introduced at the 1994 Farnborough Airshow as the briefly used marketing name for the MiG-29ME export model of the MiG-29M Fulcrum-E, a comprehensively upgraded, fully multirole version of the MiG-29. Although only a few MiG-29M aircraft were built (and none exported), they have served as prototypes for the development of the latest, most advanced Fulcrum variant, the MiG-35. ==Project 33== Around 1980, the Mikoyan OKB design bureau began working on a light \\"strike fighter\\" that was intended to be a direct competitor to the F-16 Fighting Falcon. This new Mikoyan design, designated Izdeliye 33 (Izd 33) (and variously translated as \\"Article 33\\", \\"Project 33\\", \\"Product 33\\", or \\"Project R-33\\"), was of conventional layout and similar in appearance to the F-16. It was powered by a single Klimov RD-33 afterburning turbofan engine ‚Äì the same engine used by the twin-engined MiG-29. While extensive wind tunnel testing was conducted on the design, no prototypes were built since the Soviet Air Force (VVS) dropped its support for concept about 1986. The program was one of several victims of the VVS‚Äô changing operational needs, financial constraints, and a growing preference for multirole designs. ==MiG-33 \\"Super Fulcrum\\"== During the early 1990s, it became briefly popular for Sukhoi and Mikoyan to assign new designations for upgraded models to make them appear \\"new and improved\\" instead of just \\"improved\\". The VVS did not accept these marketing designations and most were soon dropped. Following Sukhoi's initiative in this approach, Mikoyan's first such offering was the MiG-29ME, which first publicly appeared as the MiG-33 at the 1994 Farnborough Airshow. The MiG-29ME was the export version of the MiG-29M (Product 9.15) \\"Super Fulcrum\\", a comprehensively upgraded, fully multirole version of the MiG-29. ==See also== ==References== ==External links== MiG-033 Category:1970s Soviet fighter aircraft Category:Abandoned military aircraft projects of the Soviet Union ","title":"Mikoyan MiG-33"},{"id":"17314632","text":"Mill Island may refer to * Mill Island, Antarctica * Mill Basin, Brooklyn, United States, formerly known as \\"Mill Island\\" * Mill Island (Nunavut), Canada * Mill Island (Moorefield, West Virginia), United States * Ray Mill Island, England * Temple Mill Island, England ","title":"Mill Island (disambiguation)"},{"id":"17314639","text":"Brandon Montez Lang (born June 18, 1986 in Tucker, Georgia) is a gridiron football defensive end.

Louis Royer (1793‚Äì1868), also Lodewyk Royer, was a Flemish sculptor who worked in the Netherlands where he received many commissions from the royal family and for public statues. ==Life== ===Apprenticeship=== Statue of Rembrandt on the Rembrandtplein in Amsterdam He was born in Mechelen where he first studied at the local Academy and from 1810 in the studio of Jan Frans van Geel. After studying in Paris for a year, he went to live in Amsterdam in 1820. At the time what is now Belgium and the Netherlands were united in one kingdom under the rule of the Dutch. In 1823 he was the first sculptor to win the Dutch version of the Dutch Prix de Rome, a prize that was re-instituted by King William I in 1817.Louis Royer at HadrianusLouis Royer at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The Prix allowed Royer to study in Rome where he came under classicist influences. He worked in an area close to the Spanish Steps where he must have been in contact with Bertel Thorvaldsen and the studio of Antonio Canova, who was already deceased but whose workshop with his pupils was still operational. While in Rome, Royers experienced financial difficulties because of the problems of the commission which awarded him the Dutch Prix de Rome and the bankruptcy of his patron, the Amsterdam stockbroker A.B. Roothaan. Despite these problems, Royer remained very productive, and only found time to travel once, to Naples. In Rome he sculpted a portrait of his friend, the painter Cornelis Kruseman. He gained a lot of admiration for his portrait of Pope Leo XII, whom he portrayed from life.Portrait of Pope Leo XII at the Rijksmuseum ===Return to the Netherlands=== Statue of William the Silent in The Hague In 1827 Royer returned from Rome and settled in The Hague, an important artistic centre after the royal family had moved there from Amsterdam. He was soon appointed court sculptor and he made portraits of all members of the royal family in busts of marble. Shortly afterwards he was also appointed director of the Royal Academy of Art in Amsterdam. After moving to Amsterdam in 1837, Royer received many public commissions for statues of leading personalities from Dutch history, such as the statues of Rembrandt and Joost van den Vondel in Amsterdam, William the Silent in The Hague and Michiel de Ruyter in Vlissingen.K. Middelhoff, Louis Royer - De Vlaamse beeldhouwer die De Zwijger deed spreken, in: Neerlandia. Jaargang 98.

Muller, Dutch Art: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, 4 Jul, 2013, p. 338 Royer was in 1839 one of the founders of the artist society Arti et Amicitiae in Amsterdam. Royer's work received wide public recognition and he was given a Royal award three times. After his death in Amsterdam in 1868, Royer's widow offered the estate of her husband to the Dutch State. The refusal of the offer was communicated by politician Thorbecke whose bust Royer had previously made. The estate was subsequently auctioned and an important part of it was bought by intimates and friends of the artist.Kees Fens, Een dodenmasker als enige persoonlijke schepping, in de Volkskrant of 19 December 1994 ==Work and legacy== Royer was during his lifetime the most important sculptor in the Netherlands. He was known as the \\"Canova of the Netherlands\\" and later he was simply referred to as \\"the sculptor.\\" He had virtually no competition. In addition to monumental works, he made many salon portraits, allegorical representations and works with religious subjects including reliefs for the St. Francis Xavier Church in Amsterdam. He worked principally in marble, terracotta, earthenware and plaster. He was trained in the Flemish Baroque style and later came under the influence of Classicism while studying in Paris and Rome. His works were inspired by classical sculpture and have an idealising character. He is thus close to the French and Flemish academism that he was familiar with through his training. Many of his drawings have been preserved. After Classicism had fallen out of fashion, Royer was quickly forgotten by the general public. In an attempt to save him from oblivion the Museum Amstelkring in Amsterdam organized in 1994 a retrospective of his work, which coincided with an exhibition of contemporary photos of his statues in the Flemish cultural centre De Brakke Grond in Amsterdam. ==References== ==Further reading== * Hout, Guus van den ; Langendijk, Eug√®ne (ed.), Louis Royer 1793-1868 : een Vlaamse beeldhouwer in Amsterdam, Amsterdam : Van Soeren, 1994 * Langendijk, Eug√®ne, Louis Royer en de eerste Groote Prijs voor de Beeldhouwkunst in Nederland, In: Bulletin van het Rijksmuseum 39(1991), p. 120-131 Category:1793 births Category:1868 deaths Category:People from Mechelen Category:Flemish sculptors Category:Dutch sculptors Category:Dutch male sculptors Category:Prix de Rome (Netherlands) winners ","title":"Louis Royer"},{"id":"17314773","text":"The Hill yield criterion developed by Rodney Hill, is one of several yield criteria for describing anisotropic plastic deformations. The earliest version was a straightforward extension of the von Mises yield criterion and had a quadratic form. This model was later generalized by allowing for an exponent m. Variations of these criteria are in wide use for metals, polymers, and certain composites. == Quadratic Hill yield criterion == The quadratic Hill yield criterionR. Hill. (1948).

Here F, G, H, L, M, N are constants that have to be determined experimentally and \\\\sigma_{ij} are the stresses. The quadratic Hill yield criterion depends only on the deviatoric stresses and is pressure independent. It predicts the same yield stress in tension and in compression. === Expressions for F, G, H, L, M, N === If the axes of material anisotropy are assumed to be orthogonal, we can write : (G + H)~(\\\\sigma_1^y)^2 = 1 ~;~~ (F + H)~(\\\\sigma_2^y)^2 = 1 ~;~~ (F + G)~(\\\\sigma_3^y)^2 = 1 where \\\\sigma_1^y, \\\\sigma_2^y, \\\\sigma_3^y are the normal yield stresses with respect to the axes of anisotropy.

Recall that, : \\\\begin{align} F & = \\\\cfrac{1}{2}\\\\left[\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_2^y)^2} + \\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_3^y)^2} - \\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_1^y)^2} \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ G & = \\\\cfrac{1}{2}\\\\left[\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_3^y)^2} + \\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_1^y)^2} - \\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_2^y)^2} \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ H & = \\\\cfrac{1}{2}\\\\left[\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_1^y)^2} + \\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_2^y)^2} - \\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_3^y)^2} \\\\right] \\\\end{align} We can use these to obtain : \\\\begin{align} R_0 = \\\\cfrac{H}{G} & \\\\implies (1+R_0)\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_3^y)^2} - (1+R_0)\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_2^y)^2} = (1-R_0)\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_1^y)^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ R_{90} = \\\\cfrac{H}{F} & \\\\implies (1+R_{90})\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_3^y)^2} - (1-R_{90})\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_2^y)^2} = (1+R_{90})\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_1^y)^2} \\\\end{align} Solving for \\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_3^y)^2}, \\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_2^y)^2} gives us : \\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_3^y)^2} = \\\\cfrac{R_0+R_{90}}{(1+R_0)~R_{90}}~\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_1^y)^2} ~;~~ \\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_2^y)^2} = \\\\cfrac{R_0(1+R_{90})}{(1+R_0)~R_{90}}~\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_1^y)^2} Plugging back into the expressions for F,G leads to : F = \\\\cfrac{R_0}{(1+R_0)~R_{90}}~\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_1^y)^2} ~;~~ G = \\\\cfrac{1}{1+R_0}~\\\\cfrac{1}{(\\\\sigma_1^y)^2} which implies that : \\\\cfrac{1}{G(1+R_0)} = (\\\\sigma_1^y)^2 ~;~~ \\\\cfrac{F+R_0 G}{G(1+R_0)} = \\\\cfrac{R_0(1+R_{90})}{R_{90}(1+R_0)} ~. Therefore the plane stress form of the quadratic Hill yield criterion can be expressed as : \\\\sigma_1^2 + \\\\cfrac{R_0~(1+R_{90})}{R_{90}~(1+R_0)}~\\\\sigma_2^2 - \\\\cfrac{2~R_0}{1+R_0}~\\\\sigma_1\\\\sigma_2 = (\\\\sigma_1^y)^2 } == Generalized Hill yield criterion == The generalized Hill yield criterionR. Hill. (1979). Theoretical plasticity of textured aggregates. Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., 85(1):179‚Äì191. has the form : \\\\begin{align} F\\\\sigma_{2}-\\\\sigma_{3}^m & \\\\+ G\\\\sigma_{3}-\\\\sigma_{1}^m + H\\\\sigma_{1}-\\\\sigma_{2}^m + L2\\\\sigma_1 - \\\\sigma_2 - \\\\sigma_3^m \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\+ M2\\\\sigma_2 - \\\\sigma_3 - \\\\sigma_1^m + N2\\\\sigma_3 - \\\\sigma_1 - \\\\sigma_2^m = \\\\sigma_y^m ~. \\\\end{align} where \\\\sigma_i are the principal stresses (which are aligned with the directions of anisotropy), \\\\sigma_y is the yield stress, and F, G, H, L, M, N are constants. The value of m is determined by the degree of anisotropy of the material and must be greater than 1 to ensure convexity of the yield surface. === Generalized Hill yield criterion for anisotropic material === For transversely isotropic materials with 1-2 being the plane of symmetry, the generalized Hill yield criterion reduces to (with F=G and L=M) : \\\\begin{align} f := & F\\\\sigma_2-\\\\sigma_3^m + G\\\\sigma_3-\\\\sigma_1^m + H\\\\sigma_1-\\\\sigma_2^m + L2\\\\sigma_1 - \\\\sigma_2 - \\\\sigma_3^m \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\+ L2\\\\sigma_2-\\\\sigma_3-\\\\sigma_1^m + N2\\\\sigma_3-\\\\sigma_1-\\\\sigma_2^m - \\\\sigma_y^m \\\\le 0 \\\\end{align} The R-value or Lankford coefficient can be determined by considering the situation where \\\\sigma_1 > (\\\\sigma_2 = \\\\sigma_3 = 0). The R-value is then given by : R = \\\\cfrac{(2^{m-1}+2) L - N + H}{(2^{m-1} - 1) L + 2 N + F} ~. Under plane stress conditions and with some assumptions, the generalized Hill criterion can take several forms.Chu, E. (1995). Generalization of Hill's 1979 anisotropic yield criteria.

It combines details from all four Indiana Jones features into one continuous adventure with a humorous twist, and includes several inside-jokes for fans of both the Indiana Jones films and the Star Wars series. All four chapters, which combine to form a so-called \\"mini-epic\\", aired on Cartoon Network's Toonami block during commercial breaks on May 10, 2008 and could be seen at the Lego Indiana Jones page on the Cartoon Network website, as well as on the Lego Indiana Jones website. Pedersen had previously spoofed the Indiana Jones films in his music video for \\"Doctor Jones\\" (1997), a hit song by the Danish/Norwegian dance-pop group Aqua. Lego Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Brick was followed by Lego Star Wars: The Quest for R2-D2 in 2009, also directed by Pedersen. ==Plot== ===Chapter 1=== Raiders of the Lost Brick opens up with Indiana Jones and Satipo in a jungle. The two face several traps along the way including a pit, but Indy and Satipo continue their journey. When Indiana Jones has to get across tiles that lead to the altar with the idol, he dances on them, leaving Satipo a bit confused. Once he crossed the tiles, Indy grabs the idol and runs as the temple collapses. Satipo crosses the pit first, and gestures for the idol in exchange for giving Indy the whip. Indy throws the idol, but it hits Satipo in the head and knocks him out. Indy then builds a bridge out of Lego pieces to get across the pit, and once he crosses it he retrieves the whip and idol. The boulder trap is triggered, but Indy was able to escape. Once outside of the temple, he finds Ren√© Belloq waiting for him with two Hovitos warriors(who look like the Ugah warriors in chapter 3). Suddenly, the boulder crashes through the doorway where it was stuck and flattens Ren√© Belloq and the Hovitos, as Indy jumps away into Jock's seaplane, where Indy is seen with a check list and crosses \\"Idol\\" off the list. ===Chapter 2=== Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood are seen in a tomb with the Ark of the Covenant. As they try to fend off snakes, two German soldiers hoist the Ark out of the tomb, Indy and Marion then build a Lego elevator to escape the tomb. Indy and Marion safely get out of the tomb, and Indy goes on a horse to chase the truck that has the Ark. Indiana spots his father, Henry Jones Sr., reading a book about golf on a motorcycle. Indy jumps into the motorcycle and drives it. German soldiers on motorcycles drive toward the two and Indy grabs a flag, and knocks down both soldiers, and then uses his whip to get himself on top of the truck. The driver stops abruptly, and Indy falls onto the hood of the truck, he then accidentally pulls a piece of the hood off and falls, and goes under the truck until he reappears clinging to his whip, which was still hanging there from when he got on the truck. The grill of the truck breaks off and goes under it. Indy gets onto the grill and surfs on it, then leaps into the truck, and knocks the two German soldiers, a window frame, and a Stormtrooper out of the truck. Indy gets to the driver and pushes him out as well. Indy drives the truck, and his father then joins him to ride off into the distance. ===Chapter 3=== This chapter opens up with Indy riding an amphibious vehicle in a river in a jungle. Mutt Williams comes out of a pitched tent and is delighted to see Indy coming back, but when Indy's vehicle gets on land and accidentally runs over Mutt's motorcycle, Mutt gets angry briefly. Indy shows Mutt the checklist with \\"Idol\\" and \\"Ark\\" checked off. The only unchecked item on the list is \\"Skull\\", and the two journey into the jungle. Suddenly, a rumbling sound is heard in the distance, and cutting through the jungle is Irina Spalko on a jungle cutter. The two run from and escape the cutter by falling into a ditch. They find themselves on a mine car, which runs down a track, around a rollercoaster-style loop and out a door that literally says \\"END OF RIDE\\". They see the jungle cutter again, and they continue running from it. When they go under an archway towards the temple and the jungle cutter tries to follow, it crashes. Spalko is then thrown off the vehicle and the jungle cutter gets destroyed. It forms a new machine with a saw blade, and Indy and Mutt decide to cut some pepperoni with it. Later, Indy and Mutt arrive at the temple entrance, but two natives stop them. They point to Indy, then Mutt, and then to a sign that says a person had to be as tall as a part of their spear to enter. Mutt is too short to go in, much to Indy's laughter, but he is able to go in anyway. Inside the temple, Indiana and Mutt run from spears (which eventually hit a dart board) until they come across a mirror. Indy's reflection is Han Solo (hinting that both Indiana Jones and Han Solo were played by Harrison Ford), and Mutt's reflection is of Chewbacca, (probably because he's seen as a companion to Indy, like Chewbacca is Han Solo's companion). Later, while Irina and Mutt are in a sword duel, Indy takes the Crystal Skull from one of the skeletons. The temple collapses behind the two, probably leaving Irina to be crushed after falling in a light-filled chasm to her death, and a close-up shows the skull as the movie ends. ===Chapter 4=== On Cartoon Network and on its website, Chapter 3 replays and then Chapter 4 starts. But on the Lego Indiana Jones website, Chapter 3 does not repeat itself, as all four chapters are presented together in the order they were released. The chapter begins at a party at Indy's place. Mutt hangs the Crystal Skull on a string together with other lanterns and seems to be a good bug electrifier. The Idol is used as a candle holder and the Ark is used as a grill (producing a thunderstorm during its use). Indy uses a spatula to flip and serve a burger. And Henry Jones Sr. (using the Holy Grail as a cup) toasts glasses with Mutt's cup. It is then revealed that the film was being watched in a movie theater by Lego versions of Steven Spielberg (wearing an E.T. II hat) and George Lucas, who nod at each other as the movie ends and give each other a high-five with a whip crack. ==External links== * *Lego Indiana Jones on Cartoon Network website *Indiana Jones on Lego.com * Gimmick Vfx official site (lighting/rendering/vfx) * AnimationInvasion official site (animation) Category:2008 short films Indiana Jones and the Raiders Category:Indiana Jones Category:Danish films Category:English-language films Category:Lucasfilm animated films Category:2000s animated short films Category:2000s adventure comedy films Category:Computer-animated short films Category:2000s children's fantasy films Category:2000s parody films Category:Danish animated films Category:Danish short films Category:Parody films based on Indiana Jones films ","title":"Lego Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Brick"},{"id":"17314915","text":"Henry Basil \\"Harry\\" Turner (8 July 1905 - 19 September 1988) was an Australian politician.

To the west of the village is a hill that extends down to the villages of Claydon and Barham situated in the Gipping Valley. East of the village is the Fynn Valley where the village of Witnesham is located. The main Henley Road runs through the centre of the village and provides good transport links with Ipswich. The road also connects the outer lying villages of Debenham and Gosbeck to the county town. Just outside the village is Rede Lane which runs down the hill to Claydon and provides access to the A14. == Church == There was a church in Henley at the time William the Conqueror had the Domesday Survey prepared, there were also three manors within the village. The body of the present church dates from the 13th century, the porch having been added in the 15th century and the tower in the early 16th century (possibly 1525) when the village was known as Hendley. The vestry on the north side of the church was added in 1838 and the outer wall on the south of the churchyard is dated 1900. In the last 150 years there have been major renovations in 1846, 1895. 1904 and 2005 The church interior had been decorated in 1969 and 1993 but has just been completely redecorated in 2008. On the nave walls and ceiling old style lime wash was used rather than emulsion paint, which was removed in October 2008. Electric lighting was installed in 1946 and the whole building completely rewired in 1983. The roof required extensive repairs in 1959 and the nave was replaced and retiled in 2005, when the opportunity was taken to upgrade the lighting throughout the church. At the same time, more modern and efficient heating was also installed. The chancel roof was completely retiled in November 2007 under the 'chancel tax' legislation - http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/churchlawlegis/faq/landfaq.html It is thought that the roof would have been thatched at one time but is known to have been tiled since 1900. As one approaches the church, the perpendicular style tower can be seen. From the inscription above the west door asking for prayers for Thomas Sekeford (Seckford) and his second wife Margarete, it can be assumed that it was built at his expense. The Seckford arms, a pair of scissors or shears, appear between the letters. He died on 23 November 1505 and is buried at Great Bealings. The Seckford family gave generously to the town of Woodbridge. On the left, a symbol of a key links with St. Peter. The west window was repaired in 1872 but the original shape was retained. the decorative flintwork on the buttresses of the tower is considered to be a good example of such work. The stone and flintwork of the tower were refurbished in 1980 at a cost of ¬£9,000. This included cleaning and repointing the Elizabethan brickwork around the top of the tower. The flag pole came from HMS Ganges in 1902, a naval training establishment in Shotley for a number of years. This is surmounted by a weathervane in the form of St. Peter's Key. Also on top of the tower is a plaque recording the replacement of the lead on the tower in 1772. The \\"plummers\\" bill for the work was ¬£18 18s 9d. Recently both the flagpole and weathervane have had major repair work, resulting in removing, repairing and replacing the lead on the tower. The present electric clock was installed in 1973 and made to strike the hours in 1976. For up to 300 years there was a turret clock with a six-foot pendulum which needed to be wound up regularly. This was taken out when the electricity arrived. In June 2008 the clock was completely replaced with an up-to-date 24-hour system. Between the tower and the porch on a corner stone nine feet above ground level can be seen an old scratch dial (or sundial); a similar one can be found on the right of the porch entrance. Above the entrance to the porch, in a niche, there is a statue of St. Peter. This is believed to have been put there during the renovation of 1895 as the niche was known to be empty in 1886. The porch, built before the tower, is not of the same high standard of workmanship. There are indications that materials were re-used. The carving above the entrance to the church is Norman but the pointed top suggests to scholars that it belonged to a wider door and was re-used, making a more pointed arch on the narrower door, possibly when the porch was built. On the left of the door it is obvious that a carved piece of stone has been re-used to infill the wall. On the right there is an indication of the remains of a stoup, for worshippers to bless themselves before entering the church. On the left is a list of vicars since 1315, which was about the time of the building of the present church. One wooden plaque above the door commemorates the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977, with a second added in 2012 for the Diamond Jubilee. The latter was carved in lime wood, grown on a Suffolk estate. It was designed and carved by the church's organist and choirmaster as a gift to the church to mark 15 years of service; it includes the emblem of Henley (the Crossed Keys of St Peter), a diamond and a cameo of the church itself. There is a list showing the ladies and gentlemen, who made the kneelers used in the church. The porch was renovated about 1846 and then repaired again in 1981. A new doorstep was installed to mark the 2000 millennium. The eight-sided font was a replacement in the 1840s although it is considered that an earlier base was re-used. In 1990 four of the pews at the back of the church were reduced in width to give more room to the families around the font. The gallery at the west end was altered in 1846, and upgraded to health and safety standards in 2006. Previously it jutted further into the church. In earlier days the Sunday School children sat up there during services. The glass screen was inserted in 1973 sealing off the ringing chamber but leaving the bell ringers visible. Henley is justifiably proud of its eight bells; the two oldest are dated 1480 with another 1736 and one dated 1809. The remainder were installed in 1902. In 1972 the bell frame was renovated and the bells rehung on ball bearings. The ringers also have a hand bell team which is well known. The present handbells were purchased in 1969. The bell for the new clock to strike the hours was installed in 1976 having been transferred from a church at Ubbeston and was cast in 1520. Between the ceiling of the nave and the roof is an opening entered from the tower where it is suggested that the villagers kept smuggled goods. In 1846, when the steps up to the tower were repaired, it was observed that the steps were well worn. The funeral hatchment (wooden plaque) on the wall opposite the porch is for Miss Harriet Ibbetson who died in 1843-aged 69, daughter of Sir James Ibbetson from Yorkshire. She was a tenant of Henley Hall and gave generously to the parish including the vestry,built in 1838 as a day school, plus a legacy for a church education. The vestry was rebuilt in 1904 and in 1971 had additional facilities provided from a legacy. In 1988 the roof was retiled at a cost of ¬£6,000 and in 1993 modern heating was installed. The porch at the north end of the vestry was converted into a toilet room in 2003. The vestry was used as a school, with part of the churchyard as a playground, until the present School Board building down the road was built in 1875. In the northwest corner of the churchyard is a brick \\"shed\\" which was refurbished in 1992 for use as a general store. A seat has been placed on the south side in memory of a man from the village who died young. The building may have been there when the school was held in the vestry. The building was used at one time as a fuel store for the coal stove used to heat the church. The stove was in the base of the tower. In the vestry are pictures of earlier vicars and choirs, including Rev. H. Pearson and Rev. W.C. Pearson, father and son, who between them held office for 92 years until W.C. Pearson died on 13 January 1942 having fallen downstairs in the wartime blackout and was found by his housekeeper next morning in the vicarage which stood at the other side of Church Lane until demolished in 1976. It is said that his ghost was sometimes sensed at the head of the stairs. His tomb is between the church porch and the tower with his father's, mother's and a sister's near the priests door in the chancel and adjacent to the raised tomb erected by Miss Ibbetson's only surviving brother. The 30 chairs in the vestry were given in 1993 as a memorial to Albert Hill, Sidney Quinton and Jack Ward, all well loved inhabitants of the village. The parish council also gave a clock in memory of Jack Ward in 1991 for his services to the council and the village. To the right of the vestry is a charming memorial to Elizabeth Vere, daughter of Rev. Glanville of Offton. The de Vere family were connected to the parish for over 200 years. Anne, the wife of an earlier John de Vere, has a tombstone in the chancel recording their 16 years of marriage and the surviving children; four sons (William, John, Francis and Edward) plus five daughters (Elizabeth, Mary, Anne, Frances and Susan). She subsequently remarried George Gosnell of Ipswich. A later member of the family, Thomas, was mayor of Norwich and an MP. He gave a legacy to the parish with a request for special services on St. Thomas' day, 21 December. The family sold out and left the parish in 1840. The various war memorials record the losses suffered by the village and in recent years details of these young men have been traced and recorded. The Good News Bibles in the pews and on the lectern with the embroidered bookmark were given in memory of parishioners and their families. The modern pattern kneelers were embroidered and given to the church in 1981-1984. Moving along the north wall, the first three-light window was inserted in 1872 \\"in place of an old brick one which was out of repair\\". The next two-light window was also repaired in 1872 but the shape was not changed. This work, plus repairs to the west windows appear to have been done by Mr Haggar to whom ¬£23 16s was paid in June 1872. The two lancet windows in the chancel appear to be originals in the early English style. The Roland electronic piano in the chancel was brought into use on 4 September 1994 to replace the Hammond organ used since 1952. With the attachment of an Orla flute expander, organ sounds can be produced in addition to the variety of piano sounds that the Roland can produce. Before the renovations of 1895 the floor of the chancel was some six inches higher having been raised fifty years earlier, making a steep step up. During the renovations the floor was lowered to its original position and a dark wooden reredos across the east end of the church removed. The panelling had the creed, Ten Commandments and the Lord's Prayer painted on it. The dossal curtain at the back of the altar was renewed in 1978. The old painted altar rails were replaced in 1875. The free-standing lectern was acquired by the church in the early 1950s and holds a copy of the limited number of 'Vinegar Bibles', so called because of a printing error in Luke 20 where there is a reference to the parable of the vinegar (for vineyard). The Decorated style east window is relatively simple and was inserted \\"in Mr. Beevor's time (1840) in place of a wooden one of similar shape\\". The aumbry (stone cupboard) on the north side would be where the sacrament was reserved for the sick. The church has two sets of plate, one in use normally which includes a ciborium given by the Mothers Union in 2000 and the other, dated 1728, engraved with scenes from the passion. The second flagon and Paten are on show in the Treasury of the Cathedral at Bury St. Edmunds. Coinciding with the date on the earlier plate it is recorded that ¬£1 2s 6d was spent on the purchase of a new \\"carpet\\" (cover) for the Communion Table. The carpet, running the length of the church, was replaced in 2002 following a receipt of a legacy. The altar cross and most of the brass items were given in memory of Rev. H. Pearson towards the end of the 19th century. Two further brass vases were given in 1993 and the brass jug used baptismal services was acquired in 1996. A wooden cross made by a parishioner is in place when the brass cross is locked away. On the south (right hand) side of the church is the 13th-century piscina, in effect a sink where the communion vessels were washed. Adjacent is the Sedilia (priests' seats) inset in the wall with interesting stonework above. The first window on the south side is in memory of Rev. Beevor, vicar for 13 years, who died after a long illness at the age of 47 in 1849. In those days there was also a curate who was paid about ¬£50 per year. Lists exist of these curates most of whom stayed one or two years. In the Rev. Beevor's time the Meadows-Theobald family appear to have let Henley Hall to various tenants and after Miss Ibbetson's death Charles Steward occupied it. After the recovery of his wife's health he expressed his gratitude by paying for the next double light window. He paid for the renovation of the seating, including the carving of the poppy-head bench end replacements in the same style as the original where necessary. He also paid for the renovation of the porch. In early photographs, taken about 1900, the relatively simple pulpit appears across on the north side of the church and the hatchments were nearer the front of the church. The large window on the south side is similar to windows at Barham and Barking and in the dairy at Shrubland Hall. These are all believed to have come from the old Shrubland Hall. The carving on the outside of the window has been recognised as containing the arms of the Booth family who occupied Shrubland Hall and the Swillington family who married into the Booth family. To the left of the Shrubland window can be seen the bricked-up entrance and exit of the roodloft staircase. The outer wall is thicker here to accommodate the steps which would have given access to the beam across the church, which would have held candles and a figure of Christ on the cross. This would have been removed at the time of the Reformation but there is a story that Henley church clung to Rome for a while and that a window on the stairs was used as a lookout to obtain warning of the approach of the image-breakers. The last window dedicated to St. Peter is thought to have been put in about 1900. The tablet on the wall to Rev. John Meadows Theobald reminds us of a local family. The Meadows were at Witnesham at the time of William the Conqueror and moved to Henley in 1630 when Ralph Meadows purchased the farm of William Dameron, who have emigrated to America. The family name was changed in 1774 to Meadows Theobald. John Meadows Theobald held the manor until his death in 1830 although he lived in Claydon Hall. The only son, of the same name (referred to on the tablet), appears to have moved back to Henley Hall after the departure of Charles Steward who moved to Thurleston Hall. His son, also John, was killed at Deyrah in the East Indies in 1876 and a memorial to him is in the east of the churchyard. The hatchment above the door nearer to the gallery was for Mary, mother of John referred to on the tablet, and a tombstone near the altar lists members of the family in the 18th and 19th centuries. The other hatchment is for Mrs. Henrietta Sleorgin who has the raised tomb outside the east window. Little is known of this lady except that she is understood to have sent parcels to Margaret Catchpole, the Ipswich woman transported to Australia for taking a horse without permission. In 1836 the vicarage would have been occupied by Rev. Beevor who died of consumption when only 47. Rev. Henry Pearson MA, born 18 August 1817, died 5 May 1894, was vicar from 1849 to 1894. He had two sons: one became a naval officer, the second followed him as vicar. He also had a daughter Isobel who died 22 January 1933 aged 78, and did not marry. Henry's son William Carter Pearson was born 11 February 1859 and died 13 January 1942. He was vicar after the death of his father for 48 years. He was a keen historian and either took or arranged for a number of local photographs of which a selection are currently on display in the Community Centre. ==Amenities== The village has a large community centre located in the centre of the village off Ashbocking Road which contains many facilities including a large hall used for sport and other functions, smaller rooms including a bar and the Henley Pre-School, a large football pitch and changing rooms and a small children's play area. The football pitch is home to Henley Athletic who currently play in Division One of the SIL(as in 2012/2013 season). The main hall has recently hosted many dramatic companies to put on shows for the local people. There is also a farm shop called the 'Egg Shed' on the corner of Mill Lane and Henley Road located opposite the Fiveways Garage. This is home to the Happy Hens of Henley Free range eggs and also sells sausages and other seasonal goods. There is also a bus stop next to five ways garage. There is an intermittent bus service that runs from the village of Debenham through the centre of Henley and into Ipswich which runs every hour. ==Location grid== == References == * Henley, Suffolk ==External links== Category:Villages in Suffolk Category:Civil parishes in Suffolk Category:Mid Suffolk District ","title":"Henley, Suffolk"},{"id":"17314950","text":"Qikiqtagafaaluk formerly Admiralty IslandQikiqtagafaaluk (formerly Admiralty Island) is an uninhabited, irregularly shaped Arctic island in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut, Canada.

F. (1972). A generalized isotropic yield criterion, Journal of Applied Mechanics, v. 39, n. 2, pp. 607-609. is a generalization of the von Mises yield criterion. It has the form : \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sigma_2-\\\\sigma_3^n + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sigma_3-\\\\sigma_1^n + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sigma_1-\\\\sigma_2^n = \\\\sigma_y^n \\\\, where \\\\sigma_i, i=1,2,3 are the principal stresses, n is a material-dependent exponent and \\\\sigma_y is the yield stress in uniaxial tension/compression. Alternatively, the yield criterion may be written as : \\\\sigma_y = \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sigma_2-\\\\sigma_3^n + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sigma_3-\\\\sigma_1^n + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\sigma_1-\\\\sigma_2^n\\\\right)^{1/n} \\\\,. This expression has the form of an Lp norm which is defined as :\\\\ \\\\x\\\\_p=\\\\left(x_1^p+x_2^p+\\\\cdots+x_n^p\\\\right)^{1/p} \\\\,. When p = \\\\infty, the we get the L‚àû norm, :\\\\ \\\\x\\\\_\\\\infty=\\\\max \\\\left\\\\\\\\{x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Comparing this with the Hosford criterion indicates that if n = ‚àû, we have : (\\\\sigma_y)_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} = \\\\max \\\\left(\\\\sigma_2-\\\\sigma_3, \\\\sigma_3-\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_1-\\\\sigma_2\\\\right) \\\\,. This is identical to the Tresca yield criterion. Therefore, when n = 1 or n goes to infinity the Hosford criterion reduces to the Tresca yield criterion. When n = 2 the Hosford criterion reduces to the von Mises yield criterion. Note that the exponent n does not need to be an integer. === Hosford yield criterion for plane stress === For the practically important situation of plane stress, the Hosford yield criterion takes the form : \\\\cfrac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\sigma_1^n + \\\\sigma_2^n\\\\right) + \\\\cfrac{1}{2}\\\\sigma_1-\\\\sigma_2^n = \\\\sigma_y^n \\\\, A plot of the yield locus in plane stress for various values of the exponent n \\\\ge 1 is shown in the adjacent figure. == Logan-Hosford yield criterion for anisotropic plasticity == The plane stress, anisotropic, Hosford yield surface for four values of n and R=2.0 The Logan-Hosford yield criterion for anisotropic plasticityHosford, W.

F., (1980), Upper-Bound Anisotropic Yield Locus Calculations Assuming< 111>-Pencil Glide, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, v. 22, n. 7, pp. 419-430. is similar to Hill's generalized yield criterion and has the form : F\\\\sigma_2-\\\\sigma_3^n + G\\\\sigma_3-\\\\sigma_1^n + H\\\\sigma_1-\\\\sigma_2^n = 1 \\\\, where F,G,H are constants, \\\\sigma_i are the principal stresses, and the exponent n depends on the type of crystal (bcc, fcc, hcp, etc.) and has a value much greater than 2.Hosford, W. F., (2005), Mechanical Behavior of Materials, p. 92, Cambridge University Press. Accepted values of n are 6 for bcc materials and 8 for fcc materials. Though the form is similar to Hill's generalized yield criterion, the exponent n is independent of the R-value unlike the Hill's criterion. === Logan-Hosford criterion in plane stress === Under plane stress conditions, the Logan-Hosford criterion can be expressed as : \\\\cfrac{1}{1+R} (\\\\sigma_1^n + \\\\sigma_2^n) + \\\\cfrac{R}{1+R} \\\\sigma_1-\\\\sigma_2^n = \\\\sigma_y^n where R is the R-value and \\\\sigma_y is the yield stress in uniaxial tension/compression. For a derivation of this relation see Hill's yield criteria for plane stress. A plot of the yield locus for the anisotropic Hosford criterion is shown in the adjacent figure.

Lawrence was born in Lancashire, and read classics at the University of Cambridge. Between 1942 and 1946 he served in the Royal Navy before returning to Cambridge at the end of World War II. He conducted his first fieldwork among the Garia people in southern Madang Province, Papua New Guinea in 1949‚Äì1950. Supervised by Meyer Fortes, he received his PhD in 1951 with a thesis entitled \\"Social structure and the process of social control among the Garia, Madang District, New Guinea\\". Lawrence held teaching positions at the Australian National University (1948-1957), the Australian School of Pacific Administration (from 1957), the University of Western Australia (1960-1963), the University of Queensland (1966-1970), and the University of Sydney (1963-1965 and 1970-1986). Lawrence's early work was, in the British tradition, an examination of Garia social structure. However, Lawrence's portrayal of Garia social structure was by anthropologists of the day because the picture he painted differed so greatly from orthodox models of the time. Lawrence published ethnographic accounts of Garia life in Land Tenure Among The Garia: The Traditional System of a New Guinea People (1955) and (in roughly similar form) Studies in New Guinea Land Tenure (1967, which included work by Ian Hogbin as well). It was not until 1984 that Lawrence finally published Garia: An Ethnography of a Traditional Cosmic System in Papua New Guinea. At that point, the academic community recognized that Lawrence's account of the Garia was not just accurate, but years ahead of its time. In the end, Lawrence's careful ethnography was vindicated and the earlier models that he challenged were recognized to be inaccurate. In 1967 he published a long, satirical poem entitled \\"Don Juan in Melanesia\\" mocking the structure-functionalism that he opposed. In the course of his career, Lawrence moved beyond an interest in social structure and grew interested in religion. In 1965 he co-edited Gods, Ghosts, and Men in Melanesia with Mervyn Meggitt, and his 1967 inaugural lecture \\"Daughters of Time\\" summarized his approach. His most important work on religion, however, is doubtless his masterpiece Road Belong Cargo (1964), which most scholars consider to be his most important work. It became one of the seminal contributions in the literature on cargo cults. Lawrence's focus on religion was not abstract as his Road Belong Cargo showed, he was interested in religion as it related to politics and social change. Lawrence was one of the rare authors, with the French author Jean Guiart, they were friends, to introduce a political analytical view in the study of the so- called Cargo Cults, considered irrational by most Europeans, be they missionaries or administrators. He described the long resistance of the Garia people against the German, then the Australian, then the Japanese, then the Australian administration again, and the different traditional and modern ideas and experiments they have made use of to this end. His description of the career of the leader Yali is a model of anthropological and historical objectivity. Lawrence became a prominent academic in Australia and abroad. He was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Social Science in 1967 and an Honorary Fellow of the Association for the Social Anthropology of Oceania. He also became the editor of Oceania, the first anthropology journal in Australia, in 1980. He died of a stroke in Sydney. A portrait of him painted in 1938 by Tempe Manning is held by the National Library of Australia.NLA index to holdings ==References== Category:Australian anthropologists Category:1921 births Category:1987 deaths Category:20th-century anthropologists ","title":"Peter Lawrence (anthropologist)"},{"id":"17315008","text":"__NOTOC__ 50px The following is a complete list of school districts in the State of Wyoming. { width=100%  valign=top  ==A== * Albany County School District #1 - Laramie ==B== * Big Horn County School District #1 - Cowley * Big Horn County School District #2 - Lovell * Big Horn County School District #3 - Greybull * Big Horn County School District #4 - Basin ==C== * Campbell County School District #1 - Gillette * Carbon County School District #1 - Rawlins * Carbon County School District #2 - Saratoga * Converse County School District #1 - Douglas * Converse County School District #2 - Glenrock * Crook County School District #1 - Sundance ==F== * Fremont County School District #1 - Lander * Fremont County School District #2 - Dubois * Fremont County School District #6 - * Fremont County School District #14 - Ethete * Fremont County School District #21 - Fort Washakie * Fremont County School District #24 - Shoshoni * Fremont County School District #25 - Riverton * Fremont County School District #38 - Arapahoe ==G== * Goshen County School District #1 - Torrington ==H== * Hot Springs County School District #1 - Thermopolis ==J== * Johnson County School District #1 - Buffalo ==L== * Laramie County School District #1 - Cheyenne * Laramie County School District #2 - Pine Bluffs * Lincoln County School District #1 - Kemmerer * Lincoln County School District #2 - Afton  valign=top  ==N== * Natrona County School District #1 - Casper * Niobrara County School District #1 - Lusk ==P== * Park County School District #1 - Powell * Park County School District #6 - Cody * Park County School District #16 - Meeteetse * Platte County School District #1 - Wheatland * Platte County School District #2 - Guernsey ==S== * Sheridan County School District #1 - Ranchester * Sheridan County School District #2 - Sheridan * Sheridan County School District #3 - Clearmont * Sublette County School District #1 - Pinedale * Sublette County School District #9 - Big Piney * Sweetwater County School District #1 - Rock Springs * Sweetwater County School District #2 - Green River ==T== * Teton County School District #1 - Jackson ==U== * Uinta County School District #1 - Evanston * Uinta County School District #4 - Mountain View * Uinta County School District #6 - Lyman ==W== * Washakie County School District #1 - Worland * Washakie County School District #2 - Ten Sleep * Weston County School District #1 - Newcastle * Weston County School District #7 - Upton } ==See also== *List of high schools in Wyoming *Wyoming Department of Education ==References== * Wyoming Department of Education School Calendar 2007-2008, retrieved 2008-05-08 School districts Wyoming School districts ","title":"List of school districts in Wyoming"},{"id":"17315046","text":"Tauraroa is a locality in Northland, New Zealand.

He invented the SOS racing bike in 1926. He repaired and test-rode motorbikes and lived above one of his shops in Birmingham, England, close to his three children, six grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren. In 1999 he was awarded the MBE for being Britain's oldest worker and in 1999 he also became the oldest subject of This Is Your Life. When Len was a youngster, his six older brothers ran two garages in Birmingham and they made him a small motorbike. They used to take him to Sutton Park and taught him how to ride it. He was too young to fight the First World War, though he drove a munitions lorry at 14. He lost one brother on the Somme and another was invalided out of the forces. In the Second World War, he was pronounced unfit to serve by doctors who, as it turned out, were all to die before him. When he was 26, he designed and built a motorbike. The frame weighed 19 lb and cost 19 shillings. It was so light, that he took out a world patent on it. When World War II started, he sold the manufacturing business and he and his wife started selling motorcycles. When they had met, she was just a country girl who was staying with the parents of a friend of his. She was 16 and he was 10 years older, and when he took her to the pictures, it was to silent films. He proposed to her after they had been going out for three years. They became a formidable business team, both being workaholics and living above the shop. They had some land where they were going to build a house, but even when they eventually became millionaires, they decided not to move. They bought more property - another three shops and a showroom and two or three smaller companies. When his wife died in 1982, Len's heart was broken. For two years he simply could not think straight, and that was when the business went through tough times. But eventually he got over his problems and threw himself back into his work, labouring on his bikes even at night. Despite his commitment to motorbikes, Len was not quite so keen on the automobile age. He once said in an interview: > With the traffic and all the pollution, I keeps saying cars ought to be > abolished. With a car you can't feel the wind on your face or the sky like > you can on a bike. There was no stress in the days when cars were a luxury; > you had to walk mainly, or ride a bicycle and it was much healthier. I can't > see anything has changed for the better. He continued to ride until the age of 102. He died in 2004, shortly before his 104th birthday.Len Vale-Onslow's obituary at The Independent == References == Category:British centenarians Category:British motorcycle designers Category:1900 births Category:2004 deaths Category:People from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Motorcycle builders Category:British motorcycle pioneers ","title":"Len Vale-Onslow"},{"id":"17315094","text":"Dean and Dan Caten (n√© Catenacci; born December 19, 1964) are Canadian fashion designers, radio personalities, and businessmen.

Their father is from Casalvieri, a small town in Ciociaria, Lazio, Italy.Instagram post In 1983, they moved to New York to study fashion at Parsons School of Design, but stayed for only one semester before returning to Toronto. Finding a financial backer in 1986, they launched their first signature womenswear collection, DEanDAN. By 1988 they had signed on to label Ports International (currently Ports 1961) as creative directors. At the same time, the Catens designed for their lower-end, leisure brand, Tabi International. In 1991, the brothers moved to Milan, Italy where they worked as designers for the house of Gianni Versace, and denim brand Diesel, the latter of which funded and launched their namesake brand. They debuted their men's collection in 1994, and in 2003, they launched a women's collection and a men's underwear collection. === Growth of Dsquared¬≤ === The Dsquared¬≤ brand was launched in 1995. In 2000‚Äì01, Madonna commissioned the brothers to design over 150 pieces for her Drowned World Tour 2001 and \\"Don't Tell Me\\" music video. A runway show in 2005 ended with Christina Aguilera stripping male models of their clothes. In September 2007, the Dsquared¬≤ fashion show in Milan featured Rihanna entering the stage in an American muscle car, followed by a runway walk. In January 2010, the Dsquared¬≤ Autumn/Winter 2010 menswear show in Milan featured Bill Kaulitz descending from the ceiling in a caged elevator √† la Rocky Horror Picture Show. Bill Kaulitz opened and closed the Dsquared¬≤ Autumn/Winter 2010 menswear show in Milan. In June 2007, the first Dsquared¬≤ flagship was opened in Milan's fashion district. Stores also opened in St. Moritz, Athens, Mykonos, Capri, Istanbul, Kiev, Cannes, Singapore, Paris, Nicosia and Hong Kong. In March 2015, Dsquared¬≤ opened their first flagship store in London. This is the first stage of their major store redesign programme that will continue into the US at the end of 2015. More recent Dsquared¬≤ stores openings have included Miami, Doha, Los Angeles, New York, Baku, Rome, Istanbul and Madrid. === Other projects === The twins have worked on side projects; they have appeared on America's Next Top Model and co-hosted their own show Launch My Line. In 2006, the brothers were selected to design the new official uniforms for football team Juventus. In March 2008, the Catens signed an agreement to design sunglasses with Marcolin, an Italian sunglasses and eyeglasses manufacturer. == Activities == === Dsquared¬≤ === The brothers stage elaborate fashion shows to showcase their men's and women's apparel, footwear, fragrances, and cosmetics. The brand's slogan is \\"Born in Canada, living in London, made in Italy\\". Their designs have been worn by Britney Spears (2009 world tour The Circus Starring Britney Spears and Tokio Hotel's Welcome to Humanoid City tour), Madonna, Tokio Hotel's lead singer Bill Kaulitz, Justin Timberlake, Kendrick Lamar, Ricky Martin, Nicolas Cage, Lenny Kravitz, Fergie in the music video \\"Clumsy\\" and The Black Eyed Peas' \\"I Gotta Feeling\\". In 2013, the Dsquared¬≤ brand had a brand turnover of about ‚Ç¨200 million. The brand generates most of its revenues through licensing deals. === TV/Radio === The Caten brothers host their own radio program called Dean and Dan on Air: Style in Stereo. The show began airing on Sirius XM satellite radio's BPM channel and features a variety of music (including soundtracks from select Dsquared¬≤ runway shows), along with celebrity interviews, fashion and political discussions. == Controversy == The brothers attended the 2013 Hallowood \\"Disco Africa\\" fashion industry party in Milan in racially insensitive costumes. From the d√©colletage up they appeared as white drag queens with oversized blonde wigs, with their bodies painted brown and adorned in \\"tribal\\" costume. Following the unveiling of its \\"DSquaw\\" line at the 2015 Milan Fashion Week, critics expressed outrage at the fashion studio's use of the term \\"Squaw\\", a word which carries strongly racist connotations as a derogatory term for North American indigenous women. Critics furthermore pointed to the appropriation of Inuu and Canadian indigenous decorations and attire in the fashion line itself, calling it a \\"misappropriation\\". All instances of \\"DSquaw\\" were later taken down from official Dsquared¬≤ media and marketing channels. ==Awards and honors== * 2003 - GQ Men of the Year Breakout Design Award * 2006 - Golden Needle Award * 2009 - Attribution of a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto. * 2017 - Awarded honorary citizenship of Casalvieri and the first edition of LeColuche prize.

He spent most of his playing career with his childhood club, Petrolul Ploiesti, and also at FC Rapid Bucuresti. He played mainly as a central defender, but could also go as a center forward. Although uncapped by Romania, he has been regarded as one of the best Romanian central defenders of his generation, since he was a very determined and hard-working man. Nae Constantin retired at the end of the 2010‚Äì2011 season, last playing for second-tier club Chimia Brazi. ==Career== Nae Constantin started his playing career with Victoria Flore»ôti, a local club in his home county of Prahova. After one season he made the big step to Prahova's biggest club, Petrolul Ploiesti. Despite being a central defender, he would go often up front and score goals for his team, as he proved so while loaned at AS Ploie»ôti, where he scored 6 goals in 21 games. He continued his good goalscoring statistics at Petrolul, where he managed 7 goals in 69 matches. In 2000, he switched to Romanian giants Rapid Bucure»ôti. Despite being loaned out several times to Electromagnetica, Astra Ploiesti and his previous club Petrolul Ploiesti, he was a main figure in his later years in Bucharest. Following RƒÉzvan Lucescu's resignation at Rapid, with whom he had a great partnership, he secured a transfer to Cypriot club Digenis Akritas Morphou. He only wore Digenis' jersey 7 times, as he returned quickly to his home country to join Lucescu and many more ex-Rapid players at FC Bra»ôov, following a mass exodus from the Bucharest club. Reunited with his former coach and teammates, he enjoyed playing 3 seasons with in Brasov, before joining for the 2010‚Äì11 season what proved to be his last club, Chimia Brazi. Nae Constantin was an important figure for the club, who missed out promotion to Liga II by only two points. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Rapid Bucure»ôti * Romanian League Championship: 2002‚Äì03 * Romanian Cup: 2001‚Äì02, 2005‚Äì06, 2006‚Äì07 ;FC Bra≈üov *Romanian Second League: 2007‚Äì08 ==External links== * Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Romanian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Liga I players Category:Cypriot First Division players Category:SR Bra»ôov players Category:FC Astra Giurgiu players Category:FC Petrolul Ploie»ôti players Category:FC Rapid Bucure»ôti players Category:Digenis Akritas Morphou FC players Category:Romanian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Cyprus Category:Romanian expatriate sportspeople in Cyprus Category:Romanian football managers Category:ACSF Comuna Recea managers ","title":"Nicolae Constantin"},{"id":"17315173","text":"David Miles Connolly (born 20 July 1939) is a former Australian politician and diplomat.

It was composed of United Nations Military Observers and was part of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization peacekeeping force in the Middle East.UN Doc S/1357 26 July 1949 The MAC comprised on four sections to monitor each of the four truce agreements, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel MAC, the Israel/Syrian MAC, the Israel/Lebanon MAC and the Egypt/Israel MAC. The various MACs were located on the cease fire lines and, through close liaison with headquarters in Jerusalem, were charged with supervising the truce, investigating border incidents, and taking remedial action to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. ==Background== From the Arab Israeli conflict the United Nations inaugurated the United Nations Truce Supervision OrganizationUN Security Council Resolution 50 UN Doc S/RES/50 (1948) S/801 29 May 1948 (UNTSO), this became the premier UN peacekeeping organization in the Middle East. It was clearly given a bi-fold mission which reads as follows: \\"first, to observe and report on the truce which was established on June 18, 1948, and, secondly, to maintain the organization of the Mixed Armistice Commissions (MAC).1st Special session of the UN General Assembly ST/DPI/SER.A/47 20 April 1949 Background Paper No. 47 Included in each General Armistice AgreementEgypt Israel Armistice Agreement UN Doc S/1264/Corr.1 23 February 1949UN Doc S/1302/Rev.1 of 3 April 1949 Hashemite Jordanian Kingdom Israel Armistice Agreement was a clause which provided for the creation of Mixed Armistice Commissions (MACs). The MACs were composed of an equal amount of representatives from the participating factions to the Armistices (one MAC for Israel and each of her bordering countries). UNTSO provided the chairman which was always its ranking member. In the same accord, UNTSO provided each MAC with a number of observers to detail the nature of complaints (regardless of which country who had lodged the grievance) in order to preserve the Truce. Logistic and administrative support grew within UNTSO as the observers were placed in remote locations. This requirement laid the foundation for UNTSO's existing support structure as we know it today. UNTSO formed four separate Mixed Armistice Commissions (MACs),Functions and Powers of the Mixed Armistice Commissions UN Doc A/AC.25/W/39 7 March 1950 with five members in the case of Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel MAC and the Israel/Syrian MACThe Israeli- Syrian General Armistice Agreement Working Paper UN Doc A/AC.25/W/20 4 August 1949 with seven in the case of Egypt/Israel MAC and Lebanon/Israel MAC, of whom each Party to the Agreement designated two in the case of HKJ/I MAC and the I/S MAC with three designated from each party I/E MAC and I/L MAC and whose Chairman was to be the United Nations Chief of Staff of the Truce Supervision Organization or a senior officer from the Observer personnel of that Organization designated by him following consultation with both Parties to the Agreement, who cast the deciding vote in any violation investigation. The observers‚Äô responsibilities consisted of investigating complaints brought by one or both parties, observe the ceasefires to theoretically supervise the execution of the provisions of the GAAs and to report to the UN. The partiality mechanism inherent in MAC voting soon damaged relations with both sides. UNTSO chairmen sided with one or other of the parties during an investigation, but they had no effective mechanism to sanction the guilty. UNTSO‚Äôs role was simply to supply the UN with ‚Äúadequate and objective information of such kind as may be required, rather than to enforce agreements or make peace.‚Äù The Military Observers (MOs‚Äô) recorded tabulations and handed down judgements resulted in nothing concrete, not even shaming the parties in the court of world opinion. UNTSO‚Äôs understaffed and unarmed investigators could not supervise, let alone enforce, the armistice agreements. Moreover, when the organization refused to consistently side with the Israeli version of events, its one common member obstructed the entire operation. For this reason, most Canadian MOs came to the region pro-Israeli, and departed pro- Arab.E H Hutchison ‚ÄúViolent Truce‚Äù In spite of its questionable relevance UNTSO kept on, maintaining an international presence on the ground in Israel proper, nurturing a core group familiar with regional problems, and forming the proto-nuclei for inevitable future peacekeeping operations. The MACs were very different from one another, bringing about four unique UNTSO peacekeeping missions.

He was wounded while investigating an alleged violation of the truce provisions by Jewish forces. ===Mount Scopus Incidents=== On 24 July 1956 in the disputed armistice line of Jerusalem‚Äôs Mount Scopus demilitarized zone, Jordan‚Äôs Arab Legion occupied a house close to what was claimed as Jewish property on Mount Scopus. Israeli fire from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was soon brought to bear on the Jordanian position; a protracted fire-fight ensued. Canadian officers Major Marcel Breault and Major George Flint who were serving as observers with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), managed to arrange a local ceasefire. However, while attempting to reach the Palestinian Arab house in question and confer directly with the Jordanians, one of the officers detonated an anti-personnel mine, the explosion severely wounding both soldiers. The day after the wounding of MOs Breault and Flint, a Jordanian mob attacked Swedish observer Lt.-Col. E.H. Thalin. On 26 May 1958 at 1654 Local time Lieutenant-Colonel Flint was killed apparently by a single sniper round from Jordan UN Security Council Investigation while trying to evacuate wounded Israelis from an Israeli police patrol, After Lt.-Colonel Flint had proceeded 40 to 50 metres towards the place where the body of the previously killed Israeli officer was situated, carrying a white flag, there was a single shot and he was hit by a bullet of apparently the same origin, as the one which had hit the Israeli policeman a few minutes earlier. An unwounded Israeli lying only two metres from Lt.-Colonel Flint shouted that the latter was not moving and that he could see the entrance hole of the bullet. An UNMO who was at a short distance saw the impact of the bullet and, as Lt.-Colonel Flint had fallen immediately, concluded that he must have been killed instantly.Report of the Firing Incident of 26 May 1958 on Mount Scopus UN Doc S/4030 17 June 1958 ===Captain Jack Holly, USMC.=== Captain Jack Holly, USMC joined UNTSO in May 1973, several months before the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War. In the period just after the Yom Kippur cease fire was declared, Captain Holly and his OP partner, an Irish UNMO, were on post high on the elevated ridges of Mt. Hermon. Late one evening, an over-enthusiastic Arab soldier burst on the scene and forced them out of their racks. The Arab soldier commenced a gun-point march toward Damascus with both Holly and the Irish UNMO wearing only their skivies. Under the security of darkness, the Arab soldier marched them barefoot over very rocky terrain. They passed an Israeli strong point, went through Syrian lines, and then walked half way to Damascus. Once the Syrian Government realized the situation, both the Irish and U.S. Marine UNMO were returned to UN custody. Nevertheless, their feet were severely damaged. Captain Holly was in a convalescent status for a prolonged period and the Irish UNMO experienced a nervous breakdown in addition to tremendous physical problems.United Nations Truce Supervision Organization:History And U.S. Marine Involvement AUTHOR Major William D.

ASM, 42, 1197‚Äì1205 (1950). is a measure of the plastic anisotropy of a rolled sheet metal. This scalar quantity is used extensively as an indicator of the formability of recrystallized low-carbon steel sheets.Ken-ichiro Mori, Simulation of Materials Processing: Theory, Methods and Applications, (), p. 436 == Definition == If x and y are the coordinate directions in the plane of rolling and z is the thickness direction, then the R-value is given by : R = \\\\cfrac{\\\\epsilon^p_{\\\\mathrm{y}}}{\\\\epsilon^p_{\\\\mathrm{z}}} where \\\\epsilon^p_{\\\\mathrm{y}} is the in-plane plastic strain, transverse to the loading direction, and \\\\epsilon^p_{\\\\mathrm{z}} is the plastic strain through- the-thickness. ISO 10113:2020 More recent studies have shown that the R-value of a material can depend strongly on the strain even at small strains . In practice, the R value is usually measured at 20% elongation in a tensile test. For sheet metals, the R values are usually determined for three different directions of loading in-plane (0^{\\\\circ}, 45^{\\\\circ}, 90^{\\\\circ} to the rolling direction) and the normal R-value is taken to be the average : R = \\\\cfrac{1}{4}\\\\left(R_0 + 2~R_{45} + R_{90}\\\\right) ~. The planar anisotropy coefficient or planar R-value is a measure of the variation of R with angle from the rolling direction. This quantity is defined as : R_p = \\\\cfrac{1}{2}\\\\left(R_0 - 2~R_{45} + R_{90}\\\\right) ~. == Anisotropy of steel sheets == Generally, the Lankford value of cold rolled steel sheet acting for deep-drawability shows heavy orientation, and such deep-drawability is characterized by R. However, in the actual press-working, the deep-drawability of steel sheets cannot be determined only by the value of R and the measure of planar anisotropy, R_p is more appropriate. In an ordinary cold rolled steel, R_{90} is the highest, and R_{45} is the lowest. Experience shows that even if R_{45} is close to 1, R_0 and R_{90} can be quite high leading to a high average value of R. In such cases, any press-forming process design on the basis of R_{45} does not lead to an improvement in deep-drawability. == See also == * Yield surface ==References== Category:Plasticity (physics) Category:Solid mechanics Category:Metal forming ","title":"Lankford coefficient"},{"id":"17315208","text":"Randolph Road is a county highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The highway is the major component of a mostly four- to six-lane highway spanning southern Montgomery County and northwestern Prince George's County that also includes Montrose Road, Montrose Parkway, and Cherry Hill Road, and forms an important link between eastern Montgomery County and Rockville. Montrose Road begins at Maryland Route 189 (MD 189) in Potomac. The highway heads east through a junction with Interstate 270 (I-270) before the main course continues as Montrose Parkway in North Bethesda. Montrose Parkway continues through a junction with MD 355, east of which the highway becomes Randolph Road. Randolph Road intersects MD 586 and MD 185 in Wheaton, MD 97 in Glenmont, and MD 650 in Colesville. The highway continues southeast toward Fairland, where it meets U.S. Route 29 (US 29). The highway continues from US 29 as Cherry Hill Road through an intersection with MD 212 in Calverton before reaching its eastern end at US 1 in College Park. A significant portion of Montrose Road, Randolph Road, and Cherry Hill Road existed along or near their present alignments by the early 20th century. The major exceptions were Montrose Road west of I-270 and Randolph Road from North Bethesda to Glenmont. Much of the county highways were improved as modern roads by the mid-1940s. Randolph Road from Glenmont to Colesville was originally known as Glenmont Road and constructed as Maryland Route 183 in the late 1910s. The North Bethesda- Glenmont stretch of Randolph Road was built as a four-lane divided highway in the 1950s and early 1960s. MD 183 was expanded to a divided highway in the mid-1970s then transferred to county control in the early 1980s. Montrose Road was reconstructed as a temporary connecting route associated with the construction of I-270 in the late 1950s; the highway was extended to Potomac in the late 1980s. The first phase of Montrose Parkway was constructed in the late 2000s; the parkway will be extended east to MD 586 in the future. ==Route description== The continuous highway comprising Montrose Road, Montrose Parkway, Randolph Road, and Cherry Hill Road has a total length of from MD 189 in Potomac to US 1 in College Park. Montrose Road runs from Potomac to Montrose Parkway in North Bethesda. Montrose Road continues east from there, but is bypassed by Montrose Parkway, which has a length of to its eastern end beyond MD 355. Randolph Road spans through Wheaton, Glenmont, Colesville, and Fairland to US 29. The highway continues as Cherry Hill Road for through Calverton to College Park. The vast majority of the highway is maintained by the respective counties, but short segments are maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) as unsigned MD 927 and MD 927A in North Bethesda and MD 929 in Fairland. The entire length of the Randolph Road portion of the highway and MD 927A, the portion of Montrose Parkway through the MD 355 interchange, are part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial. ===Montrose Road and Parkway=== View east along MD 927 at I-270 in North Bethesda Montrose Road begins at an intersection with MD 189 (Falls Road) in Potomac. The highway heads east as a two-lane controlled-access highway through a forested corridor between two residential subdivisions. Those neighborhoods are accessed via the only intersection through the corridor with Whites Ford Way. The corridor ends at Seven Locks Road, where Montrose Road expands to a four-lane divided highway. The highway has a partial interchange with the access road to a residential subdivision to the north before its cloverleaf interchange with I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway). At Tower Oaks Boulevard, Montrose Road expands to six lanes, crosses Cabin John Creek, and passes between residential subdivisions between the city of Rockville to the north and North Bethesda to the south. Montrose Road is state-maintained and designated MD 927 for from the ramp from southbound I-270 to westbound Montrose Road east to the intersection with Tower Oaks Boulevard. Just west of Old Farm Creek, Montrose Road turns off east as a four-lane road with center turn lane while the through highway's name becomes Montrose Parkway. Montrose Parkway continues east with four lanes, crossing over Old Farm Creek. The highway intersects Jefferson Street before reaching an interchange with MD 355 (Rockville Pike). Access to southbound MD 355 is provided by following Hoya Street north to the interchange ramps, where the eastern end of Montrose Road can be accessed. Montrose Parkway passes under MD 355 before intersecting ramps to and from northbound MD 355 adjacent to the Montrose Schoolhouse, which is accessed from the adjacent shopping center via Chapman Avenue at the eastern end of Montrose Parkway. Montrose Road is state- maintained and designated MD 927A for its easternmost from Hoya Street to Chapman Avenue. ===Randolph Road=== Randolph Road begins at Chapman Avenue and heads east as a five-lane road with center turn lane. The highway has an at- grade crossing of CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision, which carries MARC's Brunswick Line, as the highway passes through a commercial area. Randolph Road intersects Parklawn Drive before passing through a dense suburban residential area. The highway expands to three lanes eastbound at Gaynor Road, gains a median, and gains a third lane westbound immediately after crossing Rock Creek. Randolph Road heads northeast as a six-lane divided highway into Wheaton, where the highway intersects MD 586 (Veirs Mill Road) and MD 185 (Connecticut Avenue) a short distance apart. The highway continues east through a densely populated suburban area, passing by Wheaton High School and through Denley Park before meeting MD 97 (Georgia Avenue) in Glenmont. Randolph Road continues east, passing John F. Kennedy High School and Glenallan Elementary School before reaching Kemp Mill Road. Kemp Mill Road heads south toward Brookside Gardens and Wheaton Regional Park. Randolph Road continues east across Northwest Branch and past the historic home Milimar. The highway intersects MD 650 (New Hampshire Avenue) in Colesville. After intersecting Fairland Road, Randolph Road curves to the southeast and becomes a five-lane road with center turn lane. The highway becomes four lanes with alternating median and undivided sections as it passes through a series of curves and crosses Paint Branch, then regains a center turn lane. Randolph Road expands to a divided highway just west of its intersection with Old Columbia Pike, then reaches its eastern terminus at a single-point urban interchange with US 29 (Columbia Pike) in Fairland. The highway is state- maintained and designated MD 929A for from west of Old Columbia Pike--which is itself designated MD 929C for a short distance on either side of the intersection--east to the bridge over US 29. ===Cherry Hill Road=== Cherry Hill Road begins where Randolph Road ends at the US 29 interchange in Fairland. The highway is state-maintained and designated MD 929B for from the bridge over US 29 to east of Prosperity Drive, which is itself designated MD 929D for a short distance south of Cherry Hill Road. Cherry Hill Road transitions from a four-lane divided highway to a four-lane undivided highway as it curves to the southeast through Calverton, where the highway is lined with commercial properties to the south and apartment complexes to the north. The highway passes along the eastern edge of the White Oak Food and Drug Administration campus, then enters Prince George's County shortly before reaching an intersection with MD 212 (Powder Mill Road). Cherry Hill Road is four lanes with a center turn lane from the county line to just east of its bridge across I-95, then reduces to two lanes. The highway briefly passes through the United States Department of Agriculture's Beltsville Agricultural Research Center before crossing over the Capital Beltway, which carries both I-95 and I-495, just east of the junction of the two Interstates. Cherry Hill Road crosses Little Paint Branch and passes by a shopping center before reaching its eastern terminus at US 1 (Baltimore Avenue) in College Park. ==History== Most of the county highways along the Montrose-Randolph-Cherry Hill corridor already existed by the early 20th century. Their courses remained mostly unchanged through the mid-1940s. Montrose Road began at Seven Locks Road and, after a tight curve south and back north to cross Cabin John Creek, followed the present course of Montrose Road to the junction of the old and new Rockville-Georgetown roads at Montrose. In 1910, Montrose Road ended at the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX) crossing at Randolph. By 1945, the highway was extended along the Randolph Road alignment to just west of Rock Creek, where the road turned north along Gaynor Road to cross Rock Creek and end at MD 586. After a large gap from west of Rock Creek to Glenmont, the highway resumed along the present course of Randolph Road except for a deviation at Northwest Branch. From Colesville, the highway headed east along the Beltsville Road. Near the Montgomery-Prince George's county line, the highway split southeast along Cherry Hill Road to US 1. The only major deviations were near their junction, Beltsville Road and Cherry Hill Road followed what is now Gracefield Road, and Cherry Hill Road met MD 212 at staggered intersections. Between 1916 and 1919, the highway between Glenmont and Colesville was improved as a macadam road by Montgomery County with state aid; this road later became known as Glenmont Road and was designated MD 183. The road east from Colesville and part of the Beltsville road were reconstructed as gravel roads in 1934. Montrose Road was paved from US 240 (now MD 355) west to near Cabin John Creek by 1944. By that time, the road had been extended as a gravel road from the railroad to just west of Rock Creek, where the highway became dirt for its old crossing of Rock Creek on Gaynor Road. The highway was paved from US 29 (now MD 650) at Colesville to east of Fairland Road, then gravel to MD 196 (Old Columbia Pike). The pavement resumed there until the Beltsville-Cherry Hill split, from which Cherry Hill Road continued to US 1 as a gravel road. Cherry Hill Road was moved to its present alignment, replacing Gracefield Road, in 1985. The staggered intersections at MD 212 were unified by 1999. The first segments of four-lane divided Randolph Road were in place by 1951. These segments formed the main streets of their respective subdivisions from Dewey Road just east of Rock Creek to MD 586 and from Lindell Street to the MD 97-MD 183 intersection. Randolph Road's original two-lane bridge across Rock Creek was built in 1953. By 1956, Randolph Road was built between Rockville and Glenmont except for a gap between Connecticut Avenue and Bushey Drive to the west halfway to MD 586. The gap in Randolph Road was filled by 1965. That same year, the bridge across Rock Creek was expanded to allow four lanes. By 1968, the Randolph Road name was applied from MD 355 to US 29. MD 183 was expanded to a divided highway and Randolph Road was placed on its present course at Northwest Branch in 1976. Randolph Road between Glenmont and Colesville was transferred from state to county maintenance in 1981. Randolph Road and Cherry Hill Road's interchange with US 29 was constructed in 2004 and 2005. MDSHA plans to construction an urban diamond interchange at the intersection of Randolph Road and MD 97. Four lanes of Randolph Road will pass under MD 97 while flanking two-lane roadways intersect the state highway and several streets on either side of the interchange. Construction is expected to begin in 2014 and conclude in 2016. Montrose Road was straightened out at Cabin John Creek when its bridge across the new Washington National Pike (now I-270) was built in 1956. The county highway temporarily served as US 240 between 1958 and 1960 while Washington National Pike was under construction from Montrose Road south to Rockville Pike. Montrose Road's interchange with the freeway was originally a six-ramp partial cloverleaf. Between 1988 and 1991, in conjunction with the expansion of I-270 to 12 lanes, the junction was reconstructed as a full cloverleaf interchange plus ramps with Tower Oaks Boulevard. Montrose Road was extended west from Seven Locks Road to MD 189 in 1989. Montrose Parkway was conceived as an expansion of MDSHA's plans to construct an interchange between MD 355 and Montrose Road and Randolph Road. In the original plans, which were to be implemented by MDSHA, the west side of the interchange would connect directly with Montrose Road at Hoya Street. Randolph Road would head east from the interchange, cross Nebel Street and the railroad north of Randolph Road's existing grade crossing, and merge back into Randolph Road west of Parklawn Drive. The first phase of the creation of Montrose Parkway included the reconstruction of Montrose Road from Tower Oaks Boulevard to west of Old Farm Creek and construction of Montrose Parkway from the creek area to the MD 355 interchange. The Montrose Road reconstruction and Montrose Parkway east to Jefferson Street were started in 2005 and finished in 2008. As the first segment opened, Montgomery County began to work on linking Montrose Parkway and Randolph Road and MDSHA began constructing the highways' interchange at MD 355. The parkway segment between Jefferson Street and Hoya Street opened in 2009 and the MD 355 interchange opened in 2010. For the next phase of the project, MDSHA will construct Montrose Parkway's bridge across the railroad and a single-point urban interchange at Parklawn Drive north of Randolph Road. From there, Montgomery County will extend the highway across Rock Creek to MD 586. It has not yet been decided whether the Randolph Road grade crossing will be closed or retained. ==Junction list== ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *MDRoads: MD 183 Category:Roads in Montgomery County, Maryland Category:Roads in Prince George's County, Maryland ","title":"Randolph Road"},{"id":"17315209","text":"The Art of War is the fourth album by Swedish heavy metal band Sabaton. The album is based on the ancient Chinese military treatise, The Art of War written by General Sun Tzu in the 6th Century BC. It consists of 13 chapters, each of which describe a different aspect of warfare, and is considered the definitive work on military tactics and strategies of its time. The tracks on the album correspond to each chapter of treatise. The lyrics of the songs are about famous battles or war, mostly based on the battles of the First and Second World Wars where Sun Tzu's tactics were applied. ==Production== The Swedish national anthem from Sweden Rock '09 (found on the Re-Armed edition) was the only song on which bassist P√§r Sundstr√∂m has contributed vocals until 2012, when the line-up change required Sundstr√∂m to step up to the microphone on a more permanent basis.

They were at the Hollywood Palladium watching Welk's music makers perform when they got the chance to audition for Welk. The Blenders, with Smith singing lead tenor, joined the show later that year and were a popular fixture of the Musical Family until they broke up in 1967. Smith stayed on as a featured vocalist and, in addition to solo numbers, sang both as a part of a barber shop quartet and as lead vocals in the Curt Ramsey Quintet. On October 8, 1966, in a Welk musical tour of Italy, Smith sang \\"Three Coins in the Fountain\\".

He subsequently joined Funnies Inc. Pinajian also drew 'Captain Terry Thunder' for Fiction House, 'Inspector Bancroft' for Fox Comics, 'The Wasp' for Lev Gleason Publications, and 'Jungle Terror' for Timely Comics.

He served in the U.S. Army in World War II and received the Bronze Star Medal for valor. Pinajian also painted portraits, landscapes and some abstract works. He has been cited for his work in the field of abstract expressionism. Pinajian had instructed that the works be thrown away when he died. His wishes were ignored, and $30 million worth of his art was found in the garage of the Bellport, Long Island home where Pinajian had lived from 1973 until his death in 1999.

His father, Joshua Wood, has almost never seen him and leads climbing expeditions. Because there are few places where Peak can climb, he (illegally) scales skyscrapers. During one climb, Peak attempts to scale yet another skyscraper. When Peak realizes that he has not prepared enough for this climb, he starts to rest only a few feet from the top of the skyscraper. By doing so, his face becomes injured from being frozen to the wall. He is sent to the Juvenile Detention Center. After another boy attempts to scale the Flatiron, and falls to his death from inspiration from Peak. Peak is sent to court because of this. Peak meets Josh, his long-lost and world-famous biological father. Since Peak is temporarily banned from New York, Josh agrees to take Peak in. Josh tells Peak that they will be visiting Chiang Mai. Josh and Peak fly to Bangkok, Thailand. Josh tells Peak that they are not going to Chiang Mai, where Peak was expecting to go, but will be traveling to Kathmandu, near Mount Everest. At the Summit Hotel in Kathmandu, Josh leaves Peak and tells him to wait for one of Josh's friends, a Buddhist monk by the name of Zopa. Zopa will take him to Everest Base Camp, where they will prepare for the long climb up Everest. Sun-jo, a Nepalese boy who is the same age as Peak, takes Peak to Zopa on a broken motorcycle. Sun-jo, Peak, Zopa, and two Sherpa brothers named Yogi and Yash travel to Base Camp. When they get there, Peak meets Holly Angelo, a reporter, who forced Josh to take her to the top of Mount Everest, who happens to be the same reporter that almost got Peak jailed, and he learns that she will be climbing the mountain with him. Peak realizes at this point that his father bailed him out of jail to come and climb Mount Everest. If he makes the climb, he will be the youngest person to reach the summit. ==Reception== This book was favourably reviewed in Publisher's Weekly, which described the book as \\"the perfect antidote for a kid who thinks books are boring...

In graph theory, a branch of discrete mathematics, a distance-hereditary graph (also called a completely separable graph). is a graph in which the distances in any connected induced subgraph are the same as they are in the original graph. Thus, any induced subgraph inherits the distances of the larger graph. Distance-hereditary graphs were named and first studied by , although an equivalent class of graphs was already shown to be perfect in 1970 by Olaru and Sachs.Olaru and Sachs showed the Œ±-perfection of the graphs in which every cycle of length five or more has a pair of crossing diagonals (, Theorem 5). By , Œ±-perfection is an equivalent form of definition of perfect graphs. It has been known for some time that the distance-hereditary graphs constitute an intersection class of graphs, but no intersection model was known until one was given by . ==Definition and characterization== The original definition of a distance-hereditary graph is a graph G such that, if any two vertices u and v belong to a connected induced subgraph H of G, then some shortest path connecting u and v in G must be a subgraph of H, so that the distance between u and v in H is the same as the distance in G. Distance-hereditary graphs can also be characterized in several other equivalent ways:; ; ; , Theorem 10.1.1, p. 147. *They are the graphs in which every induced path is a shortest path, or equivalently the graphs in which every non-shortest path has at least one edge connecting two non- consecutive path vertices. *They are the graphs in which every cycle of length five or more has at least two crossing diagonals. *They are the graphs in which, for every four vertices u, v, w, and x, at least two of the three sums of distances d(u,v)+d(w,x), d(u,w)+d(v,x), and d(u,x)+d(v,w) are equal to each other. *They are the graphs that do not have as isometric subgraphs any cycle of length five or more, or any of three other graphs: a 5-cycle with one chord, a 5-cycle with two non-crossing chords, and a 6-cycle with a chord connecting opposite vertices. Three operations by which any distance- hereditary graph can be constructed. *They are the graphs that can be built up from a single vertex by a sequence of the following three operations, as shown in the illustration: *#Add a new pendant vertex connected by a single edge to an existing vertex of the graph. *#Replace any vertex of the graph by a pair of vertices, each of which has the same set of neighbors as the replaced vertex. The new pair of vertices are called false twins of each other. *#Replace any vertex of the graph by a pair of vertices, each of which has as its neighbors the neighbors of the replaced vertex together with the other vertex of the pair. The new pair of vertices are called true twins of each other. *They are the graphs that can be completely decomposed into cliques and stars (complete bipartite graphs K1,q) by a split decomposition. In this decomposition, one finds a partition of the graph into two subsets, such that the edges separating the two subsets form a complete bipartite subgraph, forms two smaller graphs by replacing each of the two sides of the partition by a single vertex, and recursively partitions these two subgraphs.. A closely related decomposition was used for graph drawing by and (for bipartite distance-hereditary graphs) by . *They are the graphs that have rank-width one, where the rank-width of a graph is defined as the minimum, over all hierarchical partitions of the vertices of the graph, of the maximum rank among certain submatrices of the graph's adjacency matrix determined by the partition.. *They are the HHDG-free graphs, meaning that they have a forbidden graph characterization according to which no induced subgraph can be a house (the complement graph of a five-vertex path graph), hole (a cycle graph of five or more vertices), domino (six-vertex cycle plus a diagonal edge between two opposite vertices), or gem (five-vertex cycle plus two diagonals incident to the same vertex). ==Relation to other graph families== Every distance- hereditary graph is a perfect graph,. more specifically a perfectly orderable graph, pp. 70‚Äì71 and 82. and a Meyniel graph. Every distance-hereditary graph is also a parity graph, a graph in which every two induced paths between the same pair of vertices both have odd length or both have even length., p.45. Every even power of a distance-hereditary graph G (that is, the graph G2i formed by connecting pairs of vertices at distance at most 2i in G) is a chordal graph., Theorem 10.6.14, p.164. Every distance-hereditary graph can be represented as the intersection graph of chords on a circle, forming a circle graph. This can be seen by building up the graph by adding pendant vertices, false twins, and true twins, at each step building up a corresponding set of chords representing the graph. Adding a pendant vertex corresponds to adding a chord near the endpoints of an existing chord so that it crosses only that chord; adding false twins corresponds to replacing a chord by two parallel chords crossing the same set of other chords; and adding true twins corresponds to replacing a chord by two chords that cross each other but are nearly parallel and cross the same set of other chords. A distance-hereditary graph is bipartite if and only if it is triangle-free. Bipartite distance- hereditary graphs can be built up from a single vertex by adding only pendant vertices and false twins, since any true twin would form a triangle, but the pendant vertex and false twin operations preserve bipartiteness. Every bipartite distance-hereditary graph is chordal bipartite and modular.Bipartite distance-hereditary graphs, Information System on Graph Classes and their Inclusions, retrieved 2016-09-30. The graphs that can be built from a single vertex by pendant vertices and true twins, without any false twin operations, are special cases of the Ptolemaic graphs and include the block graphs. The graphs that can be built from a single vertex by false twin and true twin operations, without any pendant vertices, are the cographs, which are therefore distance-hereditary; the cographs are exactly the disjoint unions of diameter-2 distance-hereditary graphs. The neighborhood of any vertex in a distance-hereditary graph is a cograph. The transitive closure of the directed graph formed by choosing any set of orientations for the edges of any tree is distance-hereditary; the special case in which the tree is oriented consistently away from some vertex forms a subclass of distance-hereditary graphs known as the trivially perfect graphs, which are also called chordal cographs.. ==Algorithms== Distance-hereditary graphs can be recognized, and parsed into a sequence of pendant vertex and twin operations, in linear time.; . An earlier linear time bound was claimed by but it was discovered to be erroneous by Damiand. Because distance-hereditary graphs are perfect, some optimization problems can be solved in polynomial time for them despite being NP-hard for more general classes of graphs. Thus, it is possible in polynomial time to find the maximum clique or maximum independent set in a distance- hereditary graph, or to find an optimal graph coloring of any distance- hereditary graph. present a simple direct algorithm for maximum weighted independent sets in distance-hereditary graphs, based on parsing the graph into pendant vertices and twins, correcting a previous attempt at such an algorithm by . Because distance-hereditary graphs are perfectly orderable, they can be optimally colored in linear time by using LexBFS to find a perfect ordering and then applying a greedy coloring algorithm. Because distance- hereditary graphs are circle graphs, they inherit polynomial time algorithms for circle graphs; for instance, it is possible determine in polynomial time the treewidth of any circle graph and therefore of any distance-hereditary graph.; , p. 170. Additionally, the clique-width of any distance-hereditary graph is at most three.. As a consequence, by Courcelle's theorem, efficient dynamic programming algorithms exist for many problems on these graphs.; . Several other optimization problems can also be solved more efficiently using algorithms specifically designed for distance-hereditary graphs. As show, a minimum connected dominating set (or equivalently a spanning tree with the maximum possible number of leaves) can be found in polynomial time on a distance-hereditary graph. A Hamiltonian cycle or Hamiltonian path of any distance-hereditary graph can also be found in polynomial time.; . ==Notes== ==References== *. *. *. *, . *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. * *. *. *. ==External links== * .

Abba Poemen was quoted most often for his gift as a spiritual guide, reflected in the name \\"Poemen\\" (\\"Shepherd\\"), rather than for asceticism. He is considered a saint in Eastern Christianity. His feast day is August 27 in Julian calendar (September 9 in Gregorian calendar). ==Biography== Abba Poemen lived at a monastery in Scetis, one of the first centers of early Christian monasticism. In 407 A.D. the monastery was overrun by raiders, scattering the monks. Abba Poemen and Abba Anoub, along with a handful of monks, fled to Terenuthis, on the river Nile. After leaving Scetis, Abba Poemen and his group first lived in an abandoned pagan temple. The various raids on Scetis were a turning point in desert monasticism. The ensuing diaspora resulted in Abba Poemen and his group keeping alive the collective wisdom of the monks of Scetis by creating the bulk of the Apophthegmata Patrum (Sayings of the Desert Fathers). Abba Poemen's personality was described as that of a wise shepherd more than a desert ascetic. He was known for his tolerance of the weakness of others. One apocryphal story recounts that some of the older monks approached Abba Poemen for his advice on how to treat monks who fell asleep during their prayers. They were inclined to wake the sleeping monk, while Abba Poemen took a more compassionate approach, advising, \\"For my part, when I have seen a brother who is dozing, I put his head on my knees and let him rest.\\" Abba Poemen was typically opposed to giving harsh penances to those who slipped spiritually‚Äîwhen a monk came to him who had committed a \\"great sin\\", Abba Poemen reduced his penance from three years to three days. Another story, though also used in support of Poemen's tendency to \\"refrain from judgement\\" tells of a brother monk with a wife (Harmless cites a source claiming her to be a \\"mistress,\\" but the Systematic Collection uses the Greek word for \\"woman\\"/\\"wife\\") who had a child ‚Äîperhaps unclear who the father was. Abba Poemen sent him a bottle of wine as a gift, to celebrate, and the brother was so \\"conscious stricken...[that he] later dismissed the woman\\". Abba Poemen was also described as a charismatic speaker who still taught more by example than by lecturing others. When a visiting monk asked him if he should assume a role of authority over the brothers he was living with, Abba Poemen responded by saying, \\"No, be their example, not their legislator.\\" Judgment of others was also foreign to his nature. He once stated that, \\"A man may seem to be silent, but if his heart is condemning others, he is babbling incessantly.\\"\\"Venerable Pimen the Great\\", Orthodox Church in America Modern writers credit Abba Poemen's gift of memory for keeping alive many of the stories from the Apophthegmata Patrum. Many of those stories are recollections of Abba Poemen from his time with the monks in Scetis. A later Coptic writer, Zacharias of Sakha, believed that Abba Poemen was also a writer, leading to speculation that he might have been one of the authors of the Apophthegmata Patrum. Some scholars consider the Abba Poemen of the Apophthegmata Patrum to be merely a generic desert Abba, while others credit Poemen and his group with collecting the many sayings that became the Apophthegmata Patrum. Wilhelm Bousset and William Harmless both treat Poemen as a historical figure. ==Selected sayings of Abba Poemen== Abba Poemen is the most often quoted Abba in the Apophthegmata Patrum‚Äînearly a quarter of the sayings are by or about Poemen‚Äîwhich led some scholars to think that sayings from different Abbas were collected under the generic name \\"Abba Shepherd.\\" Abba Poemen is also featured prominently in another collection of Desert Father sayings, the Ethiopic Collectio Monastica. He was notable for his kindness and compassion toward his fellow monks, including those who had fallen from the high ideals of the Desert Fathers. He was frequently sought out by his brothers for his wise and compassionate guidance. * \\"Many of our Fathers have become very courageous in asceticism, but in fineness of perception there are very few.\\" * In response to a brother monk who chided Poemen for washing his feet, he said, \\"We have not been taught to kill our bodies, but to kill our passions.\\"\\"Abba Poemen: Brief Life and Sayings\\", Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and south East Asia * Many of Poemen's sayings included sets of three, such as a list of three \\"instruments for the work of the soul\\": \\"to throw yourself before God, not to measure your progress, to leave behind all self-will.\\" ==References== Category:Egyptian hermits Category:Saints from Roman Egypt Category:4th- century Byzantine people Category:5th-century Byzantine people Category:5th- century Christian saints Category:4th-century births Category:340s births Category:450 deaths Category:Egyptian Christian monks Category:Longevity claims ","title":"Poemen"},{"id":"17315416","text":"The Center for Middle East Policy (formerly the Saban Center for Middle East Policy) is a center for research within the Brookings Institution focused on the United States' involvement in the Middle East.

His true identity is , the eldest son of Mom and Pops Racer and the older brother of Speed and Spritle. His 'Racer X' moniker is actually a play on his own first name Rex. Years before the start of the series, when Rex was 18 years old (Speed's current age), he had a falling out with Pops after wrecking the Mach One (the first car Pops ever built) at the end of his first race as a professional driver (seen in flashbacks throughout the series). Racer X drives the number 9 car, the Shooting Star. Throughout the course of Speed Racer, Racer X's identity is constantly revealed to the audience in almost every episode in which he appears, while Speed is unaware of it. Speed starts to suspect that Racer X might, in fact, be his estranged older brother in the \\"Challenge of the Masked Racer\\" saga (episodes 3 and 4). Speed finds out that Racer X is his long lost brother near the end of the series in \\"The Trick Race\\". It was acknowledged by both Pops and Speed over the years that Racer X was the superior driver of the two, and the greatest driver that they had ever seen, but Speed always vowed to defeat Racer X as the two vigorously competed. Speed was often suspicious of Racer X's identity and motives because Racer X would repeatedly, and inexplicably, sacrifice winning races to protect Speed from drivers and others who tried to harm him. The assistance from Racer X nearly always led to Speed winning races, while Racer X came in second place. Racer X always left the scene unnoticed, receding into his secret life. Racer X, with Rex Racer's unmasked face exposed. It was not until the episode \\"Challenge of the Masked Racer Part 2\\" that fans of the show finally got to see the face of Racer X. His face was shown a second time near the end of the series in \\"The Trick Race\\". In that episode, Speed finally gets a chance to ask Racer X if he is his older brother‚Äîonly to be interrupted by a punch in the stomach. As Speed lies unconscious, Captain Terror, of the Car Acrobatic Team, soon recognizes the resemblance of Rex under the mask of Racer X. Racer X confesses that he is truly Rex. He then vows to quit automobile racing and becomes a full-time international secret agent instead. As he walks away, he takes off his mask and he tells the unconscious Speed that he will look after him wherever he might go. When Speed wakes up, he finds Racer X's mask on the ground beside him. He is finally convinced that Racer X is in fact his older brother. ==Characterization== Pops had told Rex prior to the race that Rex was not yet prepared to compete at the professional racing level. With less than one lap to go in his first major race, Rex was leading and cruising toward victory, but lost control of the car and wrecked it. Pops exploded with anger and berated Rex. In an even more enraged response, Rex fled the family and exiled himself while vowing to become the world's greatest race car driver. During his exile, Rex assumed the mysterious Racer X (a.k.a. Masked Racer) identity, to pursue his racing career. In several stories Racer X is seen as an international spy or agent and is often responsible for thwarting evil corporate schemes. In this persona, he is often portrayed wearing a white linen suit, Panama hat and wrap around sunglasses. He also seems at times to be working in cooperation with Inspector Detector, though it is not clear if he actually works for the same organization. Inspector Detector also seems to know about Racer X's identity though again it is unclear if this knowledge is mutually shared through the relationship or that the Inspector has a dossier on Racer X. ===Mach GoGoGo manga=== In Tatsuo Yoshida's original manga series that inspired the Speed Racer anime, Racer X is portrayed similarly to his role in the anime. In the first volume, it is uncertain whether the Racer X character was really Speed's older brother. However, in Yoshida's second volume, it is revealed that Racer X is Speed's brother, Rex. In the second volume, the character's origins are exactly the same in the anime, meaning that Rex also crashed Pops' Mach 1 and fled the family when Pops berated him. However, the story of Racer X in the original manga is slightly different. Racer X doesn't disguise himself as the deceased Prince Kabala like he did in the anime‚Äîfor Kabala was alive to race Speed in the Fire Race in the manga. In the end, Racer X comes back to Speed in the Mach 5 as Rex in an abrupt way, revealing his secret life as Racer X and a secret agent to him. The manga ends with Speed and Rex holding hands in a family reunion, promising each other to race together. The concept of the Mach 5 originally being Rex's car in the 2008 film was probably inspired by this scene, the closing scene of the manga. ===1999/2000 comic series=== In Tommy Yune's prequel comic to Speed Racer, Rex is portrayed as dying while driving the Falling Star (no. 9) in a race against cousin Hank Racer in the Mach 3. Several years later, Racer X appears driving the famed Shooting Star that has a similar appearance to Rex's car and brings shock and anger from the Racer family for dishonoring Rex by racing a car with his numbers and similar color schemes. Racer X is instrumental in helping Speed save Trixie from corrupt interests here and is even praised by Speed before he declares that one day he will learn his identity. A prequel series was published a year later and told Rex's story between his original crash and \\"death\\" in Yune's first prequel. The Racer X series depicted Rex racing and crashing the Mach 1 before being banished from Pops team and struggling to find a sponsor and ride. Eventually he is invited by Prince Kabala of Kapetapek to journey there and meet with the royal leader. Arriving he finds that Kabala wants to hone Rex's racing skills and have him serve him as a diplomat for the South Pacific island-nation against the Western nations (particularly the United States). Rex learns martial arts, shooting, and racing skills from Kabala before committing a crime punishable by death. Kabala saves him by challenging him to a Fire Race through the volcanoes on the island. Before the race, Rex is given his famed number 9 car (later dubbed the Shooting Star) and successfully beats Kabala as the volcano entrance collapses. He briefly adopts Kabala's identity (by wearing a mask) in order to save the nation from guerillas. At the end of the series, Rex is seen wearing his Racer X mask and loading the Falling Star with Kabala's dead body onto a ship for transport to the race at the beginning of the Speed Racer prequel. ===Speed Racer (2008 film)=== Matthew Fox as Racer X and Emile Hirsch as Speed Racer in Speed Racer. In the 2008 film adaptation of the manga and anime, Rex Racer is portrayed by Scott Porter while Racer X is portrayed by Matthew Fox. The relationship between Rex and young Speed is built considerably with Speed looking up to Rex as a role model and learning to drive from his older brother. Rex drives the Mach 5 in the film and gives it to Speed when he leaves Pops' racing team to drive for corporate interests. As a result, in this adaptation, Rex does not destroy the car he drove for Pops (the Mach 4) and is portrayed as a reckless and cheating corporate driver responsible for numerous crashes before being killed at the entrance of the Ice Caves in the Casa Cristo cross country race. When Racer X appears in the film, he has been working as a gun for hire and is feared by many drivers, sponsors, and corporate interests. Racer X works with Inspector Detector tracking the corruption that has taken over racing, and contracts Speed to work with him and Taejo Togokhan (a key witness in the case against Royalton's corruption) in the Casa Cristo that season. Speed begins to suspect that Racer X is in fact Rex, noting that the masked racer appeared exactly two years after his brother died in \\"The Crucible\\" and exhibits the same driving styles. After Taejo Togokhan reneges on the proposed takedown of Royalton Industries after Casa Cristo, Speed recklessly races the Mach 5 at the track where Rex took him to drive when he was younger. Racer X appears and Speed confronts him about his suspicions, especially due to the two's similar driving styles and the fact that Racer X found him at that particular race track. Removing his mask, Speed is depressed to learn that Racer X is not his brother, but Racer X gives the former advice to figure out his own driving and to not let the racing world change the way it is. However, as the film closes, the truth about Rex and his work before his \\"death\\" is revealed and he is shown faking his death in the caves, detonating his car, and undergoing cosmetic surgery afterward to alter his appearance in order to take on the corruption without bringing harm to his family. In the end, as in all his other versions, Racer X is Rex Racer. When Inspector Detector asks Rex whether he made a mistake by leaving his family, Rex responds to him saying that \\"If I did, it's a mistake I'll have to live with.\\", meaning Rex has to continue hiding his identity in order to keep his brother safe. ==Cultural references== Dee Dee from Dexter's Laboratory as \\"Racer D\\" in the episode \\"Mock 5\\". Racer X was a 1980s heavy metal band founded by future Mr. Big guitarist Paul Gilbert. Dallas band Slow Roosevelt recorded the song \\"Racer X\\" on their album Weightless. The band Big Black's 1984 EP is Racer-X. The title track is full of Speed Racer references. The cartoon Dexter's Laboratory has a Speed Racer parody episode, \\"Mock 5\\". In it, the main character Dexter's older sister Dee Dee portrays both Racer X and Spritle. The comic strip Liberty Meadows has a story line around a dachshund (\\"wiener dog\\") race. One of the canine competitors is named Wiener X and wears a mask like Racer X. In the animated TV show Fetch with Ruff Ruffman (Season 4, Episode 1), Scruff Ruffman was Racer X in a Luge Race. ==References== Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967 Category:Fictional racing drivers Category:Fictional secret agents and spies Category:Speed Racer Category:Anime and manga martial artists Category:Fictional vigilantes Category:Male characters in film Category:Fictional mercenaries ","title":"Racer X (character)"},{"id":"17315465","text":"The DeYoung Family Zoo is a zoo that opened to the public in 1990.

He was also instrumental in promoting the growth of surfing in the mainland United States; among his accomplishment in surfboard shaping was an early fin design. ==Early life== Woodbridge Brown was born into a wealthy family of Wall Street brokers on January 5, 1912 in New York City. By the time of the Wall Street crash of 1929 he had rejected the trappings of this life, though still benefited from its connections. At this time, he had moved out of the family home and was sleeping on hangar floors, helping with chores with early aviators such as Charles Lindbergh, whom he waved off on his historic 1927 flight to Paris. ==Aviation== Inspired by Lindbergh, he bought a glider for $25 and towed it to California with his new four-year-old stepdaughter Jenny and wife Betty Sellon, a widowed daughter of a retired army officer with a distaste for the glitz of the \\"gilded age\\", whom he'd met at a society party he'd been persuaded to attend. For the next 5 years he was an active member of a small group of pioneering gliders. He survived some spectacular crashes. He once stated, \\"I died two or three times already, you know.\\"}} Brown was the first to launch a glider off the cliffs at La Jolla and in 1939 set a new world record for altitude, distance, and time aloft by flying his glider, Thunderbird, 263 miles from Texas to Kansas. He received a telegram of congratulations from President Herbert Hoover. ==Surfing== Brown began body- surfing in California on a carved wooden plank, using it in a style now known as Boogie-boarding. Realising that if he could stand up he could catch waves before they broke, he used glider construction techniques to build his first hollow plywood surfboard in 1936, a forerunner of modern boards. For more maneuverability, he added a skeg, or small keel, a breakthrough independently developed by another legendary American surfer, Tom Blake, a year or two earlier.Lynch, Gary (2001) Tom Blake : The Uncommon Journey Of A Pioneer Waterman. Croul Family Foundation, Corona del Mar, Cal. Brown was happy to give Blake credit: ==Death, WWII, and more surfing== His wife Betty died giving birth to a son, Jeffrey, in 1940. Brown suffered a breakdown: \\"She was all I lived for. I cracked up.\\" Depressed and near-suicidal, he left the baby Jeffrey and stepdaughter Jenny with Betty's family and moved to Hawaii, not making contact again until they were grown up due to his remorse and guilt. He had intended to move to Tahiti, but World War II's intervention prevented him getting a visa so he was forced to stay in Hawaii. Brown was a conscientious objector during the war (and had been a vegetarian since his youth after looking into the eyes of a chipmunk he had wounded with a shotgun). He joined half a dozen other surfers who collectively became known as the Hot Curl surfers, named after a new type of board they carved, semi-hollow, with a V-tail to avoid what they called \\"slide-ass\\" and help them stick to the \\"hot curl\\", the breaking curve of a wave. Brown was one of Hawaii's first big wave surfers and board designers. He was nicknamed \\"Spider\\" because, as he put it, \\"I surf with my arms all out, half squatting down, and with my long legs I look like a big spider riding a board.\\" He was captured in a 1953 photograph by Thomas Tsuzuki which helped turn Hawaii into a mecca for surfers worldwide.Shikina, Robert (2008.04.20) Waterman blazed trail to waves of North Shore Star Bulletin, Vol. 13, Issue 111, Sunday April 20, 2008 It showed three men riding a 20-foot wave, the kind rarely if ever photographed close-up in those days. Brown was the only one who \\"made\\" the wave. A surfing spot in Lahaina is nicknamed after him. As recalled by Drew Kampion, surf historian of Washington state and former \\"Surfing\\" magazine editor:'Woody' Brown was the 'essential surfer', 96 (2008.04.20) Honolulu Advertiser ==Modern ocean-going catamaran== After the war, Brown served as a United States government surveyor on Christmas Island. There he was fascinated by the speed of the Polynesian natives' twin-hulled outrigger canoes. Upon his return to Hawaii he adapted the idea, using lightweight hulls and adding huge sails. In 1947 he designed the Manu Kai (\\"Sea Bird\\"), which was built by the Hawaiian Alfred Kumalai,and Rudy Choy. It was probably the fastest sailing boat in the world at the time and now seen as the first modern, ocean-going catamaran. ==Later life== Brown, having benefited from the Hawaiians' aloha spirit of generosity when he first arrived, became the epitome of that spirit in later life and was renowned for sharing \\"life's positive energy\\" with whomever he met. He met and married his second wife, Rachel, a hula dancer, in the mid-1940s, and had two children with her: William and Mary-Sue. Rachel died in 1986 and the following year, \\"feeling lonesome\\", he married Macrene Canaveral, whom he met in the Philippines on a trip specifically \\"to get me a new wife\\". Their son, Woody Jr., was born when Brown was 76. Brown never sought fame or recognition. Nevertheless, he featured in two U.S. documentaries, Surfing for Life (1999) and Of Wind and Waves: the Life of Woody Brown (2006), both made by the mainland American David L. Brown (no relation). It was during the filming of the latter that he was reunited with Jeffrey and Jenny. Brown died on April 16, 2008 at Hale Makua, Kahului. ==References== * Davison, Phil (2008.05.03) Record-breaking aviator who became a legendary surfer The Financial Times (obituary) ==External links== * Gault-Williams, Malcolm (2003) Woody 'Spider' Brown, Legendary Surfers: A Definitive History of Surfing's Culture and Heroes, Volume 1, Chapter 24 (Originally: Woody Brown: Pilot, Surfer, Sailor, originally published in The Surfer's Journal, Volume 5, Number 3, Fall 1996.) *Woody Brown Article about 90-year-old surfer.

Unsuccessful as an aero-engine, it is best known for having powered the Sunbeam 350HP racing car. ==Development== The Manitou was a further development of the V-12 Maori III. Work on it began by Louis Coatalen in 1917. It used aluminium blocks rather than cast iron, cast in blocks of three cylinders, a typical Sunbeam feature. Bore was increased to 110 mm, but stroke remained at 135 mm. The banks were at a 60¬∞ vee, with twin overhead camshafts on each bank operating four valves per cylinder. There were two Claudel-Hobson carburettors and two British Thomson-Houston (BTH) ignition magnetos. For aircraft use a reduction gear was fitted. The engine developed 300 hp at 2,000 rpm, later increased to 325 hp. Only one engine was produced before the end of the First World War, as the factory was busy with the vibration and other problems with the Arab engine, and it was very nearly cancelled. As was not unusual for a Sunbeam engine, it was only ever fitted to a single aircraft for trials, a Short 184 seaplane, and never went into production. After the war and Sunbeam's financial problems in the war-surplus glutted aero-engine market, they were offered to the less-critical powerboat market, again not an unusual move for Sunbeam. During the war 840 had been ordered, but only 13 were delivered before cancellation of the order. ===Maple Leaf=== Sunbeam saw the market in racing powerboats as a solution to the post-war glut and weak market. Four were fitted to the boat 'Maple Leaf V' . ==Specifications (Manitou)== ==Sunbeam 350HP== Malcolm Campbell's Blue Bird Sunbeam 350HP The engine's only noteworthiness came when it was fitted to Sunbeam 350HP racing car in 1920. This car was later bought by Malcolm Campbell, set land speed records and was named to become one of Campbell's Blue Birds. In typical Coatalen fashion, he redesigned the engine substantially even though this was just a one-off with no other likely sales. The twin-cam four-valve head was replaced by the single-cam three-valve head, possibly from the Arab. An increase in bore to 120 mm allowed space for these larger valves. Another change affected the stroke, also a technique from the Arab, where it had been responsible for the engine's failure. A multi-cylinder V engine offers little length for connecting rods. Coatalen's usual solution was to use articulated connecting rods, where one rod runs on the crankshaft journal, but the other acts indirectly, through a journal on the other rod. The difficulty is that this gives a slightly different piston stroke for each bank, leading to unbalance and possible vibration problems, as with the Arab. Stroke was thus 135 mm on one bank and 142 mm on the other. ==Specifications== ==References== Manitou Category:1910s aircraft piston engines ","title":"Sunbeam Manitou"},{"id":"17315703","text":"The Jerusalem Colophon is a colophon found in a number of New Testament manuscripts, including Œõ (039), 20, 153, 157, 164, 215, 262, 300, 376, 428, 565, 566, 686, 718, 728, 748, 829, 899, 901, 922, 980, 1032, 1071, 1118, 1121, 1124, 1187, 1198, 1355, 1422, 1521, 1545, 1555, 1682, 2145, and 2245.Alfred Schmidtke, Neu Fragmente und Untersuchungen zu den judenchristlichen Evangelein (TU 37/1; Leipzig, Hinrichs, 1911, p. 3 The full version of the colophon is Œµ·ΩêŒ±Œ≥Œ≥Œ≠ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ ŒúŒ±œÑŒ∏Œ±·øñŒøŒΩ ·ºêŒ≥œÅŒ¨œÜŒ∑ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·Ω∞ŒΩœÑŒµŒ≤ŒªŒÆŒ∏Œ∑ ·ºêŒ∫ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºπŒµœÅŒøœÉŒøŒªœçŒºŒøŒπœÇ œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±Œπ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒπŒ≥œÅŒ¨œÜœâŒΩ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ œÑ·ø∑ ·ºâŒ≥ŒØ·ø≥ ·ΩãœÅŒµŒπ ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∫ŒµŒπŒºŒ≠ŒΩœâŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ œÉœÑŒØœáŒøŒπœÇ .

The mayor is elected to a four-year term by the citizens of Seoul and is responsible for the administration of the city government. The Seoul Metropolitan Government deals with administrative affairs as the capital city of South Korea. Hence, it is more centralized than that of most other cities, with the city government being responsible for correctional institutions, public education, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. In the city government, there are 5 offices, 32 bureaus, and 107 divisions. The headquarters is located in the Seoul City Hall building which is in Taepyeongno, Jung-gu, Seoul. The Government started on September 28, 1946 as the Seoul City Government which became Seoul Metropolitan Government on August 15, 1949. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has one mayor and three vice mayors, with one in charge of political affairs and the other two in charge of administrative affairs. Seoul is subdivided into 25 autonomous gu and 522 administrative dong. The Seoul Institute (SI), the think tank for the city, was established in 1992 by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. It was formerly known as The Seoul Development Institute (SDI). The SI supports the policy-making processes of the municipal administration by conducting intensive research and cooperating with domestic and foreign research institutes. The SI seeks to collaborate and communicate with the citizens of Seoul \\"to secure the validity of its various policy researches\\". == Information disclosure == In 2011, when Government 2.0 was still a new concept to many, the fifth elected mayor of the City of Seoul, Mr. Wonsoon Park, introduced many policies to promote democracy based on civil participation after his inauguration. As one of his key agenda, he suggested the Governance 2.0, based on the concepts of ‚ÄòCommunication, Cooperation, and Participation,‚Äô as he established the foundation for promoting citizen participation in the governance of the city and sought to provide all administrative information of the city through the Information Communication Plaza. === Direction of the Information Disclosure Policies === The City of Seoul discloses all of its administrative information except for that information designated as classified in accordance with the law. Through this policy, the city upholds the rights to information of the citizens, enhances transparency in the administration, and promotes accountability. Also, through the Information Communication Plaza of the city, the metropolitan government gathers up and returns various administrative information to its citizens. === Seoul Information Communication Plaza === In order to implement our Nude Project successfully, the City of Seoul established the document disclosure system and the Information Communication Plaza in an innovative manner to disclose the administrative information automatically, while allowing the citizens to access the administrative information more easily through smartphones and other devices. As a result, the administrative information of the city is being provided more effectively and substantively. === Internal approval request documents service === The Information Communication Plaza provides various internal approval request documents of different fields created by the City of Seoul. Especially, in addition to the main office of the City Hall and Business Entities of the city, the users may access the information from the 25 autonomous districts and other organizations funded by the city, allowing access to detailed information the citizens require. Also, the ‚ÄòCouncil Information‚Äô section provides the information on the meetings organized by the City of Seoul from the schedule of the meetings to the minutes. Also, the ‚ÄòPolicies of Seoul‚Äô section provides the information on the key projects of the city administration and large projects which involve investments more than 10 billion won.

The U.S. post office was established there in 1858. The settlers there ran a church, a school, a merchandise store and the post office, which were all located on the bayou. In the 1920s it had approximately 500 residents, most of whom had lived there for generations after settling there from other communities both within and outside of Louisiana. They were swampers, lumberjacks, trappers, farmers, fishermen and moss pickers. Despite occasional flooding, Bayou Chene thrived until the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 destroyed much of the community. The community rebuilt but declined after construction of the Atchafalaya Spillway levees and dredging of river channels caused repeated flooding of the community.

He and his musician sister Vera were raised in Hollywood, California, in a Salvation Army family. Roy began playing cornet when he was 11 years old, and by age 13 was performing in the Los Angeles Examiner's newsboys' band. Soon after he played bugle for a studio owned by Cecil B. DeMille. His first major association came at the age of 16, when he joined Abe Lyman's orchestra at the Sunset Inn in Santa Monica, where he played alongside Miff Mole, Gussie Mueller, Henry Halstead, and Gus Arnheim. He developed a soft style of playing there which earned him the nickname, \\"The Whispering Cornetist\\". ==The 1920s/30s== In 1920, he put together his own band, with whom he recorded in 1925. That same year he also scored a gig on radio broadcasting with Art Hickman's orchestra; this ensemble toured the U.S., then did an extended residency in Florida. After some time in New York City, Fox and Arnheim reconvened in Hollywood, working at the Ambassador Hotel, and Fox continued to broadcast with his own bands. During this time he also did a number of film soundtracks.Roy Fox Biographywww.mgthomas.co.uk In 1930, Fox was invited to perform in London, which he first did on September 29, 1930. He recorded on the BBC that year, and when his band returned to the U.S. the following spring, Fox remained behind, recording with a new group for Decca Records and accepting an engagement at the Monseigneur restaurant in Piccadilly. In 1932, he fell ill with pleurisy and travelled to Switzerland for a stay at a sanatorium. During his convalescence the band was led by its pianist, Lew Stone. Upon Fox's return he resumed control of the band but when the Monseigneur contract came up for renewal in the autumn of 1932 was unable to agree terms. The restaurant's owner then offered the residency to Stone and all the band with the exception of trumpeter Sid Buckman decided to remain with Stone. Fox took out an injunction on the grounds of breach of contract against his singer Al Bowlly which prevented Bowlly performing with Stone's band on the first night, but Fox lost his action. Fox formed a new band with Buckman as trumpeter and vocalist, secured a residency at the Cafe Anglais in Leicester Square, London, and performed in Belgium as well as the UK. Art Christmas played a variety of instruments in this band. He made the films On the Air and Big Ben Calling in 1933-34, recorded for HMV in 1936, and toured Europe until 1938, when he fell ill again. ==Later years== Fox moved to Australia, where he led the Jay Whidden Orchestra, and visited the U.S. for a few tours with small groups. He led a band in England in 1946-47, with appearances at the Isle of Man and London's Potomac Club. He went into semi- retirement after 1952, when he opened his own booking agency. He died in Twickenham, Middlesex in 1982, aged 80. His descendants include American LGBT organizer/activist, Toni Armstrong Jr..

The column has developed a cult following among Claridad readers, with fans in the United States, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico and Chile. ==Early history== During close to twenty years in its 51-year run, Claridad featured a comedy column named \\"Entrando Por La Salida\\" (\\"In Through The Out Door\\"), initially inspired by Eddie L√≥pez's comedic style. The column's author was a fictional character named Fernando Clemente, whose identity had been closely guarded by Claridad's Editorial Board through the character's run. The name was actually a pseudonym for Roberto Fern√°ndez, a lawyer who wanted to honor Roberto Clemente but didn't want to use his own name as part of the pseudonym. Speculation about Clemente's identity lasted until his death in 2011. A reorganization at the newspaper left it without comedy writers. Since Claridad tends to have a rather serious tone, many readers demanded that Clemente return. When it became evident that this was not possible (the last author of the column rejected the idea, hinting that he had left Claridad in less than favorable terms), Claridad went on a search for a replacement. This search ended with the publication of an interview that preempted the first \\"Me Mudo\\" column: a conversation between Jos√© El√≠as Torres (head of the news department for WPAB-AM in Ponce, Puerto Rico and a Claridad editorial board member) and Yunqu√©. This interview was featured on the February 7, 2007 edition of Claridad. ==The Character== Fiquito (a nickname which is the diminutive of \\"Federico\\", or \\"little Fico\\") is a pseudonym, as that of his predecessor. However, an entire life history of the character has been revealed through bits and pieces published in various \\"Me Mudo A La Esquizofrenia\\" columns. Fiquito was born in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico, approximately in 1977. He is an Industrial Engineer, married, and has no children. The column's by-line claims that Fiquito is a \\"musician, writer and mental patient\\" who claims responsibility for his words, \\"or so he says\\".Yunqu√©, Carlos F.,Fastidio Contributivo Sin Precedentes , Claridad Online Edition, 8 May 2008 Fiquito's family embodies all political factions in Puerto Rico. His paternal grandfather was a die-hard supporter of Puerto Rican independence; his maternal grandfather was a supporter of statehood for Puerto Rico. His father is a reluctant follower of the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (PPD in Spanish), while his mother is a passionate supporter of the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico (NPP). Since the Yunqu√©s and the Gonz√°lezes cover all the political spectrum in Puerto Rico, Fiquito grew up politically confused. He claims to be Melina Le√≥n's second cousin. He claimed to have developed a conscience as nationalistic as he could possibly develop while growing up in Puerto Rico. His high school hobby was playing electric guitar in a grunge garage band. Fiquito joined the University of Puerto Rico at R√≠o Piedras in 1995, attempting to pursue a humanities degree. He loved Puerto Rican and Caribbean history, but realized he could not make a living in the humanities in an academic setting, something he detested. At the same time, he met the American-born daughter of an English literature professor, with whom he had an enduring affair that had him almost lose a semester of school (\\"a full semester of sex and Shakespeare\\", he claims). She had been raised in Puerto Rico and was a member of the Federaci√≥n Universitaria Pro Independencia; her extreme political activism stunned Fiquito. Fiquito opted for a transfer and moved to the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez, from which he got an Industrial Engineering degree in 2001. Eventually he met his wife, Diana (nicknamed \\"La Color√°\\", or \\"The Red One\\", because of both her fair complexion and fiery character) and moved back to the metro area of San Juan. He has recently moved back to Mayag√ºez, at least temporarily. ==Me Mudo a la Esquizofrenia== ===Name=== The name \\"Me Mudo a la Esquizofrenia\\" is the last line in a poem by Ingrid Rodriguez, a writer and psychology professor at the Inter American University of Puerto Rico. Fiquito found the poem in a personal web page for the author, and requested her permission to use it as a column title. The title, according to Fiquito, is a threat: the speaker threatens to move to a chaotic place (which the author hints is the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, but according to Fiquito could better be suited to describe Puerto Ricans in Orlando, Florida. The column's logo pictures a brain preserved in a jar, with sunglasses in the outside as to resemble the brain as being ready for a sunny day. ===Writing style=== Fiquito's writing style has been compared to that of writers Nemesio Canales, Juan Goytisolo and \\"Miguel √Ångel Rodr√≠guez, \\"El Sevilla\\", lead singer and lyricist of the Spanish heavy metal band \\"Mojinos Escoz√≠os\\", who is a regular writer on comedy magazines in Spain. Fiquito tends to start every column with a humorous Latin quote, be them humorous sayings or popular Puerto Rican phrases. This parodies the serious style of a political scholar, the now deceased Antonio Fern√≥s L√≥pez- Cepero, who was a regular writer in El Nuevo Dia, the largest newspaper in Puerto Rico (and the son of Antonio Fern√≥s-Isern). Fiquito's topics gravitate around subjects in Puerto Rican sociology, although he often covers political subject matter. He makes constant references to Puerto Rican and Latin American historical events (some rather obscure to his readers) as to parody current events by contrast. He later asked Claridad readers to nominate him as a write-in candidate for the governorship of Puerto Rico for the 2008 general elections, merely as a protest vote. He claimed he spent US$63.00 in his entire campaign, and used Roy Brown Ram√≠rez's song \\"Se√±or Inversionista\\" as a campaign song. There is no evidence of the number of write-in votes Fiquito obtained in the election. Song lyrics of popular Puerto Rican artists and other Puerto Rican pop culture elements are often quoted. However, Fiquito is particularly fond of Calle 13, and particularly, of its lyricist Ren√© P√©rez's irreverent and sarcastic style. Various of Fiquito's columns have Calle 13 lines as column titles. In a rare public appearance, Fiquito introduced the band for an abbreviated set when it appeared at the 2008 Support for Claridad festival in San Juan on April 24, 2008. ====Fiquito's musical influences==== Besides being a hardcore fan of Calle 13, Fiquito is also a fan of Tego Calder√≥n, Simian Mobile Disco and Bob Marley. ===Political philosophy=== Fiquito is an extreme supporter of Puerto Rican independence, but at the same time, he claims to hold a pragmatic, Puerto Rican-centric view on how the movement, perceived as having a waning popularity in current times, should regain mass appeal to Puerto Ricans. At the same time, he rejects what he perceives as the orthodoxy of the traditional pro-independence movements, particularly the Puerto Rican Independence Party, whose leadership he abhors. He reserves his strongest words for the political leadership of the NPP (a constant target), although he can be equally harsh to political leaders of all the other Puerto Rican parties. Fiquito also considers himself a \\"recovering Roman Catholic\\" (he spent a year playing guitar on Sunday masses)Yunqu√©, Carlos F., \\"Su Santidad, Fiquito Primero\\" , Claridad Online Edition, 8 May 2008 and an acknowledged product of colonialism in Puerto Rico, adopting local and foreign cultural references equally. He is somewhat abashed of both circumstances. ====Criticism==== Some Claridad readers have criticized the character's irreverent political views. A very vocal opponent of Fiquito is Yeyo Rodr√≠guez, another Mayag√ºez native, a pro-independence icon in Puerto Rico (and a contemporary of Juan Mari Br√°s) who wrote a criticism of the character in Claridad once.Rodr√≠guez, Jos√© N., ¬øQui√©n ser√° Fiquito Yunqu√©? , Claridad Online Edition, 8 May 2008 ==Recent Work== Yet another reorganization at Claridad left Yunqu√© off the weekly. He has since turned to Blogger to publish his column, at roughly weekly intervals. A fan page in Facebook lists over 2,000 followers (as of January 2012), including a fan in Indonesia. Fiquito has also published several articles in the Puerto Rican sex blog, Desexo, edited by graphical artist Victoria Cano. He has been featured in various airings of \\"El Show de Castor\\", a Friday night broadcast by the UPR- R√≠o Piedras student internet collective Radio Huelga, and in news analyst In√©s Quiles' radio program, \\"Si no lo digo, reviento\\", aired on WSKN-AM in San Juan. Journalist Wilda Rodr√≠guez occasionally quoted Fiquito in her radio program, La Bola de Pegao, which aired on Boricua 740, a news radio station based in San Juan, until January 2012. He is also a columnist for Argentinean web portal medioslentos.com since November 2012.

The book is a satirical allegory. Considered a jewel of Baroque literature, it is one of the author's most important works. Comenius finished the first version in 1623, but he rewrote the book several times, changing its concept and form. The book remains the most widely read work of older Czech literature. The world is portrayed as a city which resembles a labyrinth, entered by a pilgrim (the narrator and author himself). The city has The Gate of Entering, and The Gate of Separation; six main streets which represent the six classes of the world; The Castle of Fortune in its middle; and The Common Square. In Part One of the book, Labyrinth of the World (Chapters 1‚Äì36), the pilgrim is joined by two guides, Searchall Ubiquitous (allegory of human curiosity and longing for knowledge), and Delusion (allegory of indolent adopting of conventional and shallow thoughts). He seeks a job for himself that would best suit both his body and soul. The guides, however, prevent the pilgrim from seeing reality by making him watch the world through glasses. He captures glimpses of the reality only seldom. That is why he cannot find the right choice; even in the Castle of Wisdom he sees Vanity. He sees human life as meaningless, and is terrified by death; yet he finds salvation in Part Two of the book, Paradise of the Heart (Chapters 37‚Äì54), where he returns to his heart, being called there by God. There he is visited by Christ who tells him what the real meaning of the world is, so the pilgrim, now transformed, can join the Invisible Church and see it through new glasses which are the word or sound of God and the Holy Spirit. He finally beholds the Glory of God and is received among God's own. For this, he thanks with a prayer and a hymn that celebrates the Glory, Beauty and Love of God. The book is written in an artistic language. It is a poetical vision, and Comenius doesn't just criticize society; he also tries to capture the progress of Man in general (and show the dualism of material and spiritual ways of life). He points at the vanity of human endeavour that focuses on the material world and tells the reader that one must follow the will of God, as it is revealed in the Bible. As mentioned above, the book remains very popular and is still in print (so far the last two editions in the Czech Republic appeared in 2001, which was sold out very soon,Labyrint svƒõta a r√°j srdce, 2001 and 2005.

Roehrig was born in LeRoy, New York, the son of the noted \\"orientalist and philoligist,\\" Frederick L.O. Roehrig He graduated from Cornell University in 1883 and also studied architecture in England and France. His architectural styles evolved over time, covering the Victorian, American Craftsman, and Neo-Classical styles. Roehrig is particularly known for his many landmark buildings in Pasadena, California, including the Hotel Green, and Pasadena Heritage has occasionally conducted tours of Roehrig's buildings. ==Notable works== Roehrig's notable works include the following: *Hotel Green -- The landmark Hotel Green, located at 99 South Raymond Avenue in Pasadena, was built in the late 19th century and helped build Roehrig's reputation. The Hotel Green was home to both the Tournament of Roses and the Valley Hunt Club. It was built by George Gill Green and was supplemented by two later buildings, including Castle Green. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ** Castle Green -- Another of Roehrig's landmark structures is Castle Green, built in 1898 as an annex to the Hotel Green. In 2003, the Los Angeles Times described Roehrig's concept for Castle Green as follows: \\"And there is Castle Green, which is not really a castle either, but a fantastic folly created from the imagination of a Victorian architect with a penchant for Arabesque opulence. ... The imposing Moorish- style structure is redolent with atmosphere, from its cylindrical turrets to its ornate cornices. You have to stop and remind yourself that this is no longer a grand turn-of-the-century hotel, but condominiums.\\" Hotel Green *Frederick Hastings Rindge House -- In 1902, Roehrig designed a 25-room mansion for Frederick H. Rindge (the owner of Malibu, California) in the West Adams district of Los Angeles. Rindge House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. * Ramsay-Durfee Estate -- The Ramsay-Durfee Estate is a 42-room, Tudor mansion with a Craftsman interior, designed by Roehrig and built in 1908.

In preparation for a concert in their hometown of Northampton, Massachusetts, they spend two months learning new material ranging from James Brown to the Pointer Sisters to The Clash and Sonic Youth, a task that's daunting for them and frequently frustrating for Cilman. At one point they take a break to visit a nearby low-security prison and entertain the inmates, who literally and figuratively embrace them after they perform.

Serving as the main connecting hub for rail traffic between Aarhus and the rest of Denmark, the station is used by an average of 6.3 million people per year, making it the busiest station in Denmark outside the Copenhagen area. It is located in the city centre between the districts of Midtbyen and Frederiksbjerg with entrances from Baneg√•rdspladsen and the shopping centre Bruun's Galleri, and with access to platforms from M.P. Bruuns Gade. It is a through station with 4 platforms. The station is located on the East Jutland railway, and is the terminus of the Grenaa Line and Odder Line. It offers international connections to Hamburg and Berlin, InterCity connections to Aalborg/Frederikshavn and Copenhagen, regional connections to the rest of Jutland as well as light rail services to Gren√• and Odder. The train services are operated by DSB, Arriva and Deutsche Bahn. ==History== The first railway station in Aarhus was built in 1862 near Ryesgade and served the Aarhus-Randers railway line. It was constructed by the civil engineering company Peto, Brassey and Betts, and encompassed administration buildings and railway works. In 1884, a new and larger station building was constructed. The second station was built in Neo-Renaissance style by Thomas Arboe and William August Thulstrup and was possibly inspired by Bonn Central Station. However, also this building turned out to be to small for the quickly developing city. The third and current Aarhus Central Station was built in 1927 by the Danish State Railway's architect K.T. Seest as a part of a plan of the whole area around the station. ==Station facilities== The station itself houses a large ticket kiosk, public toilets, a McDonald's restaurant, two 7-Eleven's, and a couple of other shops, but the station building is also combined with a three- storey shopping centre (Bruun's Galleri) housing 93 stores, restaurants and caf√©s and a large underground car park. The upper deck of the groundfloor train station holds a shopping arcade (Bruuns Arkade) with more restaurants, and a two-storey bike parking facility. The square outside the station (Baneg√•rdsplads) has a taxi hub, a bike-share facility, a pharmacy, a money transfer and exchange store, and more shops, kiosks, caf√©s and eateries. The railway terminal has a flow of 13 million people per year. ==Operations== Aarhus Central Station serves the whole of Denmark with inter-city rail and Jutland with regional rail. The regional connections include Herning/Skjern in the west and Struer in the northwest. Aarhus Light Rail with electric trams opened its first line from Aarhus Central Station in December 2017. It connects with Aarhus University Hospital (DNU) in Skejby. In 2018, a southward suburban rail line to Odder opened, and a northbound section to Grenaa is scheduled for 2019. More local expansions of the system are planned for the near future. ==Services== The following services currently call at the station: *Intercity services Frederikshavn‚ÄìHjoerring‚ÄìAalborg‚ÄìAarhus‚ÄìFredericia‚ÄìOdense‚ÄìCopenhagen‚ÄìCopenhagen Airport *Regional services Aarhus‚ÄìHorsens‚ÄìFredericia‚ÄìKolding‚ÄìEsbjerg *Regional services Herning‚ÄìSilkeborg‚ÄìAarhus *Local services Struer‚ÄìSkive‚ÄìViborg‚ÄìAarhus *Local services Skjern‚ÄìHerning‚ÄìSilkeborg‚ÄìAarhus *Light rail/tramway Odder‚ÄìAarhus‚ÄìLisbjergskolen/Lystrup *Future Light rail/tramway line (2019) Odder‚ÄìAarhus‚ÄìSk√∏dstrup‚ÄìRyomg√•rd‚ÄìGrenaa == Gallery == 1905 baneg√•rd.jpgThe second station in Aarhus in 1905 Aarhus Hovedbaneg√•rd (april).jpgEntry facade of the present station AarhusH forhallen.jpgEntrance Hall AarhusHafgangshallen.jpgDeparture Hall Aarhus station 2016 8.jpgGroundfloor train station Aarhus station 2016 10.jpgOutside stairways connecting the street level (upper deck) and the railway yard Aarhus - panoramio (3).jpgBike parking corridor (upper deck) Banegraven (√∏st).jpgRailway Yard, arrival Banegraven (Bruuns Bro).jpgRailway Yard, departure ==References== ==External links== Category:Buildings and structures in Aarhus Category:Railway stations in Denmark Category:Railway stations opened in 1927 Category:Transport in Aarhus Category:1862 establishments in Denmark ","title":"Aarhus Central Station"},{"id":"17316406","text":"Woyda's grave in Warsaw Witold Woyda (10 May 1939 ‚Äì 5 May 2008) was a Polish fencer who won four Olympic medals in the foil between 1964 and 1972, including two gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics.

G. Ballard, first published, under the title \\"Build-Up\\", in New Worlds volume 19 number 55 in January 1957. It was reprinted in the collections Billennium and Chronopolis and later, under its revised title, in The Disaster Area and The Complete Short Stories of J. G. Ballard: Volume 1. == Setting and plot == \\"The Concentration City\\" is set in a \\"city\\" encompassing everything in known existence to its inhabitants. The districts comprise endless streets and buildings and seemingly infinitely high and low levels, or floors, with few trees and little wildlife. Cubic space is in shortage and expensive. High speed transportation is in use, but it is implied that many people do not find the need to leave their particular area. The people do not know what lies beyond the endless urban expansion, but seem to care little, and generally assume that there are just endless levels and districts that have existed forever. The short story follows a physics student named Franz, who devotes his time to the concept of \\"free space\\"‚Äîthe idea that somewhere there must be just infinite amounts of space, a concept labelled as nonsensical by most of the other inhabitants of the city. He also wishes to develop a machine for flight‚Äîa relatively unknown theory due to the complete lack of partially open spaces. Eventually Franz decides to travel on one of the high-speed rail coaches for as long as possible in one direction in order to discover what lies beyond the urban zoning and trying to find free space. The story ends when Franz, after ten days of travelling, realizes that the coach is travelling back in the opposite direction. When he is finally stopped by the authorities he notices the date of a calendar is unchanged from when he set forth travelling. Franz discovers that if one keeps travelling forward, one finally ends back in the same place at the same time. ==Relationship with other works== Similar conceptions litter speculative fiction, but two distinct types of 'infinite cities' are noteworthy: *\\"Diaspar\\", from Arthur C. Clarke's The City and the Stars, said to contain all wonders and marvels: a possible influence on this city *The City from the Tsutomo Nihei's Blame! manga - a near infinite structure larger than the solar system, finite, but unbounded.

The World Bank supported the process of private sector participation in the urban water sector from the beginning. After many tribulations a 5-year management contract was awarded in 2006. When the contract expired in 2011, the government decided not to extend it, saying that the private operator had not lived up to expectations. ==Preparation (1995-2005)== Water privatization in Ghana has been discussed since the early 1990s as a reaction to poor service quality and low efficiency of the existing urban water utility Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC), renamed Ghana Water Company Ltd. (GWCL) in 1999. The World Bank supported the process of private sector participation in the urban water sector from the beginning. Following preparatory studies and a national consultation workshop in 1995, the government opted for two 10-year lease contracts among 8 options, including the option to continue public sector operation. Critics argue that the workshop participants had been arbitrarily chosen, that the majority of participants were foreigners, that no local NGOs participated and that the public sector option had not been given due consideration. Furthermore, they argue that a single workshop was not sufficient to prepare such an important decision, that no major public debate had taken place and that the final decision should have been taken by Parliament. According to the decision made by the government, each of the two leases was to cover about half the cities and towns of Ghana. The private operators were expected to invest US$132 million from their own resources, corresponding to about one fourth of the total expected investments over the lease period. The contracts were expected to increase water production by 85%, connections by 50% and reduce non-revenue water from 52% to 25%. These expectations proved to be clearly unrealistic in retrospect. In March 2000, the government of Ghana awarded a 30-year Build- Operate-Transfer (BOT) contract for one half of the country, including the capital Accra, to the US company Azurix, a subsidiary of Enron. However, the World Bank did not support the contract. The contract failed before operations began due to accusations of corruption and public opposition which led to the formation of the Coalition against Water Privatization., p. 648-651Unicorn:Enron Subsidiary Azurix In Corruption Scandal in Ghana, ca. 2002 In 2004, the World Bank's Board approved a credit of US$103 million for an \\"Urban Water Project\\", which was later turned into a grant. The Nordic Development Fund contributes another US$5 million, while the Government of Ghana provides the remaining US$12 million of the US$120 million project. The main objectives of the program, which was supposed to end in 2010 and has been extended until December 2015, are to significantly increase access to water supply in urban areas with an emphasis on improving the service for the urban poor; and restoring the long-term financial stability, viability, and sustainability of the GWCL. The World Bank also financed technical assistance and training. The project explicitly supported private sector participation. ==The management contract (2006-2011)== Between June 2006 and June 2011 the private operator Aqua Vitens Rand Ltd. (AVRL), a joint venture of the public Dutch company Vitens and the public South African company Rand Water, supports GWCL under a five-year management contract to improve its performance and rehabilitate and extend the infrastructure., p. 19 The main objectives of the 5-year management contract were: * Improving the reliability (pressure and flow rate) and quality of potable water, * Ensuring the company‚Äôs financial sustainability, * Improving customer service, and * Providing access to potable water at affordable prices to low income consumers. The reduction of non-revenue water and was an important means to achieve these objectives. In March 2008, severe water shortages in Accra were reported, leading the Minister for Water Resources, Works and Housing to review whether AVRL was working in compliance with the management contract. However, he explained that the reason for the shortages were unforeseen power outages at two water treatment plants in Weija and Kpong. According to the Minister, the overall situation would improve notably by the end of 2008 due to several new boreholes and a more stable power supply.. In March 2008 the National Coalition Against Privatisation of Water (NCAP) called for the abrogation of the management contract for alleged \\"lack of performance\\", especially related to the lack of achievement of ‚ÄúService Standards‚Äù for pressure and flow as determined in Schedule 4 of the contract. The Minister responded by pointing to an upcoming mid-term review. In early 2011, the Minister of Water Resources, Works and Housing, Alban Bagbin, criticised Aqua Vitens Rand for failing to live up to expectations. Residents complained that they did not receive water and workers protested against \\"the management style\\" of the company. The government did not renew the management contract when it expired in June 2011. The Government is evaluating options for the next steps in the reform of the water sector. ==Impact== The management contract achieved some of its objectives, but failed to reach others. Improving the reliability (pressure and flow rate) and quality of potable water: This objective was not reached in terms of pressure and flow rate, but was reached in terms of quality. Water pressure had originally been a contractual target, but the target was removed in common agreement with the government, because constant power cuts beyond the control of the private operator would not allow this target to be reached. It is unclear if a target for the flow rate was defined. Increasing the continuity of supply proved to be a challenge, since water production was insufficient to meet demand and could not be increased with the investment funds available. Water quality was not systematically monitored at the beginning of the contract. Water from wells was often not chlorinated or only in a very rudimentary manner. Water produced by treatment plants was not properly treated, with some of the treatment steps simplified or simply avoided. The operator introduced a systematic monitoring for five parameters - pH, colour, turbidity, residual chlorine and e-coli - and, in the last contract year, complied with the target for all these parameters despite pollution of raw water sources. Ensuring the company‚Äôs financial sustainability: Improvements were made. The annual revenue increased from GHC 57 million to GHC 143 million, with the operating surplus growing from GHC 9 million to GHC 36 million per annum. The increase in revenue was to a large extent due to an 80% increase in tariffs. However, without efficiency increases the increase in tariffs would have had to be even higher to achieve the same financial results. Examples of improved efficiency are a decrease in specific electricity consumption from more than 0.8 to less than 0.7 kWh per cubic meter of water and the fact that the number of staff increased by less than the increase in customers. Over the five-year period, the prices of chemicals and energy almost trebled and the average salary increased by 225%. Collection efficiency increased from an estimated level of less than 80% before the management contract to 97% in 2009. However, after a tariff increase collection efficiency declined again to 90% in 2010. Improving customer service: A call centre was established and - according to the operator - training \\"improved the staff attitude towards the consumers\\". Providing access to potable water at affordable prices to low income consumers: The number of connections increased from 364,000 to 438,000. However, water tariffs increased by 80%. There was no specific target concerning access of the poor to water included in the management contract. Nevertheless, with the help of the Dutch foundation \\"Water for Life\\" the operator improved the water supply for around 75,000 people in 15 peri-urban areas throughout Ghana. Furthermore, the private operator provided 25,000 training days. Customer data were entered into a Geographical Information System (GIS), 70,000 meters were installed and meter workshops were established to repair faulty meters. Non-revenue water was only reduced marginally from an estimated 53% in 2006 to 50% in 2010, compared to a target of 26%. An accurate measurement of non-revenue water was not possible, because the installation of bulk water meters started only in 2008 and the separation of the network into district metered areas - a prerequisite to accurately locate leaks - was undertaken only during the period of the management contract. Intermittent supply also made it more difficult to locate leaks. == See also == *Water supply and sanitation in Ghana == References == Ghana Category:Water supply and sanitation in Ghana Category:Privatization in Ghana Category:Economy of Ghana ","title":"Water privatisation in Ghana"},{"id":"17316600","text":"name glyph.

Fang guitarist Tom Flynn and bass player Brian Beattie, his former bandmate from the bands Tapeworm and Safety Patrol, put out \\"Yukon Fang\\" as a duo, and Fang was formed. The original incarnation of Fang toured the country once, only to break up shortly thereafter with Beattie moving on to Texas where he later formed the band Glass Eye. In the early fall of 1981, Flynn began playing with drummer Chris Ritter. They soon added bass player Chris Wilson and began playing shows in the Bay Area as a three piece, with Flynn on vocals. While this was happening, Sam McBride, the band's soon-to-be vocalist, was singing with future Fang drummer Greg Langston in the band Shut Up. In early 1982, Ritter was replaced with drummer Joel Fox, and at Fox's audition he brought along his friend McBride, who volunteered to be the band's singer. The line-up solidified as McBride (vocals), Chris Wilson (bass), Tom Flynn (guitar), and Joel Fox (drums). Together they contributed the song \\"Fun with Acid\\" to the Not So Quiet on the Western Front compilation album. Shortly thereafter, guitarist Tom Flynn founded the label Boner Records and released Fang's debut album Landshark and their EP Where the Wild Things Are. Tim Stiletto drummed on the latter. These two releases are now considered classic East Bay punk. The original line-up of Fang dissolved in 1985 after the departure of founder Tom Flynn. Sammytown carried on the band, recruiting a new line-up of Bill Collins (guitar), Joe Miller (bass), and Steve Chinn (drums). Flynn and Boner Records remained affiliated with the band, putting out the first tracks by the new line-up on a Boner Records compilation, Then Boners Be Poppin in 1985. In January 1986, the \\"Spun Helga\\" LP was recorded in West Germany with McBride singing vocals, and two Germans named Joe (guitar) and Ollie (drums) playing instruments. We Bite Records released the LP in Germany, and in the US it was handled by National Trust Records. Fang next release was 1987's A Mi Ga Sfafas? (literally, \\"Give Me Head?\\"). In 1988/89, drummer Mike Branum replaced Chinn. Fang then recorded the album Pissed Off Buddah, which remained unreleased until 2008, when it was released with Fang's other albums Spun Helga and A Mi Ga Sfafas? In 1989, Sam McBride ‚Äì while running an acid-dealing business ‚Äì murdered his girlfriend, a crime for which he was convicted but only served six years. Acccording to an L.A. Weekly article dated February 8, 2017: \\"In 1989, Sammytown killed his girlfriend, Dixie Lee Carney, suspecting that she was working with a different acid dealer to take all of his business. In a drug-addled rage, he crushed Carney‚Äôs neck with his bare hands. She was 24. Sammytown went on the run for six months before eventually, inevitably getting caught. He was sentenced to 11 years for voluntary manslaughter and served six before being released.\\" ==Reformation== In 1989, Boner Records released Fang's first compilation album, Landshark/Where the Wild Thing Are. The album included Fang's debut album and debut EP. After a long break, Fang regrouped in 1995 and put out the \\"Electric Chair\\" single on Man's Ruin Records. The line-up at this time included Sam McBride (vocals), Greg Langston (drums), Bill Burnett (guitar) and Josh Levine (bass). This incarnation of the band recorded the American Nightmare LP on Wingnut Records. In 1999, Jim Martin, formerly of Faith No More, joined on guitar and recorded four songs for the Hello Records CD Fish and Vegetables, which was released as a split LP by fellow punk rock groups Dr. Know and Hellions. In May 2000, Sammytown and Jim Martin, along with Casey Orr (Gwar, Rigor Mortis) on bass, and Dallas drummer Clint Phillips (The American Fuse) performed two shows in Texas, one at Trees Dallas, and a sold-out show at Emo's in Austin. By 2001, the band was composed of Sammytown, Brian Schopflin (bass), Jonny Manak (guitar), Alby Wasted (guitar), and Ike Eichensehr (drums). Sammytown, Brian, Jonny, Alby and Ike also started the Resistoleros, an Oakland-based rock 'n' roll band. Steel Cage Records released the Resistoleros CD Rock 'N Roll Napalm in 2003. In 2004, the Live Cheap CD came out on Malt Soda Recordings, featuring Sammytown (vocals), Brian Schopflin (bass), Ike Eichensehr (drums), Alby Wasted (guitar) and Jimmy Crucifix (guitarist for 1980s hardcore band Crucifix and hard rock band Proudflesh) also on guitar. This is the only Fang recording with two guitarists. In 2004, the band toured the United States. Sammytown, Jimmy Crucifix (guitar), Brian Schopflin (bass), Bubba Dennis (bass) and Ike Eichensehr (drums) toured as Fang in the spring of 2004 and as the Resistoleros and Fang in November 2004 with Greg Elliott on rhythm guitar. In January 2005, Sammy, Jimmy, Brian and Ike recorded a cover of 's (1980s hardcore‚ÄìNardcore band) song \\"Salty Leather\\" for a tribute to members Mark Hickey and Henry Knowles, who had died. Dave Haro and JellyRoll came up with the idea for the tribute. The CD, Taking Out a Little Agression, was released on Dr. Strange Records in 2007 and featured bands including JFA, McRad, DI, Ill Repute, Dr. Know, Verbal Abuse, MDC, Oppressed Logic, Shattered Faith, and Dave Haro & JellyRoll's band KatKiller. From 2005‚Äì2008, Fang performed with the steady line-up of Sammytown, Jimmy Crucifix, Brian Schopflin, and Greg Langsten (returning to the drums). 2008 also marked the year Sammytown formed the Disciples, a raw mix of hard rock, which recorded the album Redemption in 2009. The Disciples consisted of Sammytown (vocals), Jamey Dangerous (drums), Scary Larry Tamez (bass), J-Stain Werthless (lead guitar; originally from punk outfit Diesel Boy), and Mat \\"The Kid\\" McCoy (guitar), the line-up which also emerged in 2010 as the current line-up for Fang. After countless live shows and touring, the band wrote and recorded \\"Here Come the Cops\\", which included contributions from original member Tom Flynn, who has re-emerged and played live with the band on at least one occasion in 2012. In 2011, Malt Soda released the double disc CD Pissed Off Buddha, comprising three Fang albums: Spun Helga, A Mi Ga Sfafas?, and Pissed Off Buddha, the latter being a previously unreleased album recorded in 1988. A live DVD of the band was also included with the release. A new album, Here Come the Cops, was released by Malt Soda in 2012. In summer of 2013, the band released a split 7\\" with Whidbey Island, WA's Potbelly, on PB Records. 2014 saw the band appearing on a limited edition split 12\\" alongside Symbol Six with two exclusive new songs, including a cover of \\"Riot in Cell Block #9\\". The EP was released as an exclusive Record Store Day release via Jailhouse Records. In 2017 Die Laughing Records teamed with Fang to release the Sylvia Massy mixed record \\"Rise Up!\\" which was released August 2017 and followed up with a vinyl pressing in 2019. ==Legacy== Fang has gone on to influence an array of West Coast bands, and has been instrumental in the hardcore punk movement. Guitarist Tom Flynn's distinct guitar playing has also influenced many followers, including those in the grunge genre. In Kurt Cobain's list of his top 50 albums, Landshark was at number 6. Fang has been covered by many high-profile bands. The most enduring composition by the group, \\"The Money Will Roll Right In\\", has been covered by Mudhoney, Butthole Surfers, Metallica, and Nirvana. Another of the band's popular tracks, \\"I Wanna Be On TV\\", was covered by Green Day. ==Members== ===Timeline=== ==Discography== ===LPs=== *Landshark (Boner Records, 1982) *Where The Wild Things Are (Boner Records, 1983) *Spun Helga (National Trust Records, 1985) *A Mi Ga Sfafas?

Misuse case is a business process modeling tool used in the software development industry. The term Misuse Case or mis- use case is derived from and is the inverse of use case.Sindre and Opdahl (2001). \\"Capturing Security Requirements through Misuse Cases\\" The term was first used in the 1990s by Guttorm Sindre of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and Andreas L. Opdahl of the University of Bergen, Norway. It describes the process of executing a malicious act against a system, while use case can be used to describe any action taken by the system.Sindre and Opdahl (2004).\\"Eliciting security requirements with misuse cases \\" == Overview == Use cases specify required behaviour of software and other products under development, and are essentially structured stories or scenarios detailing the normal behavior and usage of the software. A Misuse Case on the other hand highlights something that should not happen (i.e. a Negative Scenario) and the threats hence identified, help in defining new requirements, which are expressed as new Use Cases. This modeling tool has several strengths: * It allows provision of equal weightage to functional and non-functional requirements (e.g. security requirements, platform requirements, etc.), which may not be possible with other tools. * It emphasises security from the beginning of the design process and helps to avoid premature design decisions. * It is a tool for improving communication between developers and stakeholders and is valuable in ensuring that both agree on critical system solutions and Trade-off analysis.Initial Industrial Experience of Misuse Cases in Trade-Off Analysis (2002, by Ian Alexander) * Creating misuse cases often trigger a chain reaction which eases the identification of functional and non-functional requirements. The discovery of a misuse case will often leads to the creation of a new use case which acts as a counter measure. This in turn might be the subject of a new misuse case.Ian Alexander, Misuse Cases: Use Cases with Hostile Intent. IEEE Software, Vol 20, No 1, Jan-Feb 2003, 58-66. DOI: 10.1109/MS.2003.1159030 * As compared to other tools, It relates better to use cases and UML and eases the seamless employment of the model. Its biggest weakness is its simplicity. It needs to be combined with more powerful tools to establish an adequate plan for the execution of a project. One other weakness is its lack of structure and semantics. ===From use to misuse case=== In an industry it is important to describe a system's behavior when it responds to a request that originates from outside : the use cases Jacobson, \\"Object-oriented software engineering: a use case driven approach\\", 1992 Addison-Wesley, Boston have become popular for requirements between the engineers thanks to its features like the visual modeling technique, they describe a system from an actor's viewpoint and its format explicitly conveys each actor's goals and the flows the system must implement to accomplish them.Gunnar Peterson, John Steven \\"Defining Misuse within the Development Process\\", IEEE SECURITY & PRIVACY, NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2006 The level of abstraction of a use case model makes it an appropriate starting point for design activities, thanks to the use of UML use case diagrams and the end user's or domain expert's language. But for software security analyses, the developers should pay attention to negative scenarios and understand them. That is why, in the 1990s, the concept of \\"inverse of an use case\\" was born in Norway. The contrast between the misuse case and the use case is the goal: the misuse case describes potential system behaviors that a system's stakeholders consider unacceptable or, as Guttorm Sindre and Andreas L. Opdahl said, \\"a function that the system should not allow\\". This difference is also in the scenarios: a \\"positive\\" scenario is a sequence of actions leading to a Goal desired by a person or organization, while a \\"negative\\" one is a scenario whose goal is desired not to occur by the organization in question or desired by a hostile agent (not necessarily human).Ian Alexander \\"Misuse case : use cases with hostile intent\\", presentation Another description of the difference is by Guttorm Sindre, Andreas L. Opdahl, \\"Templates for Misuse Case Description\\" that defines a use case as a completed sequence of actions which gives increased value to the user, one could define a misuse case as a completed sequence of actions which results in loss for the organization or some specific stakeholder. Between the \\"good\\" and the \\"bad\\" case the language to represent the scenario is common: the use case diagrams are formally included in two modeling languages defined by the OMG: the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), and this use of drawing the agents and misuse cases of the scenario explicitly helps focus attention on it.Ian Alexander \\"Misuse case : use cases with hostile intent\\" ===Area of use=== Misuse case are most commonly used in the field of security. With the ever-growing importance of IT system, it has become vital for every company to develop capability to protect its data. Hence, for example a misuse case might be used to define what a hacker would want to do with the system and define his or her requirements. A developer or designer can then define the requirements of the user and the hacker in the same UML diagram which in turn helps identify the security risks of the system. ==Basic concepts== A misuse case diagram is created together with a corresponding use case diagram. The model introduces 2 new important entities (in addition to those from the traditional use case model, use case and actor: * Misuse case : A sequence of actions that can be performed by any person or entity in order to harm the system. * Misuser : The actor that initiates the misuse case. This can either be done intentionally or inadvertently. ===Diagrams=== The misuse case model makes use of those relation types found in the use case model; include, extend, generalize and association. In addition, it introduces two new relations to be used in the diagram: ;mitigates: A use case can mitigate the chance that a misuse case will complete successfully. ;threatens: A misuse case can threaten a use case, e.g. by exploiting it or hinder it from achieving its goals. These new concepts together with the existing ones from use case give the following meta model, which is also found as fig. 2 in Sindre and Opdahl (2004). ===Descriptions=== There are two different ways of describing a misuse case textual; one is embedded in a use case description template - where an extra description field called Threats can be added. This is the field where misuse case steps (and alternate steps) can be filled in. This is referred to as the lightweight mode of describing a misuse case. The other way of describing a misuse case, is by using a separate template for this purpose only. It is suggested to inherit some of the field from use case description (Name, Summary, Author and Date). It also adapts the fields Basic path and Alternative path, where they now describe the paths of the misuse cases instead of the use cases. In addition to there, it is proposed to use several other fields too: * Misuse case name * Summary * Author * Date * Basic path * Alternative paths * Mitigation points * Extension points * Triggers * Preconditions * Assumptions * Mitigation guarantee * Related business rules * Potential misuser profile * Stakeholders and threats * Terminology and explanations * Scope * Abstraction level * Precision level As one might understand, the list above is too comprehensive to be completely filled out every time. Not all the fields are required to be filled in at the beginning, and it should thus be viewed as a living document. There has also been some debating whether to start with diagrams or to start with descriptions. The recommendation given by Sindre and Opdahl on that matter is that it should be done as with use cases. Sindre and Opdahl proposes the following 5 steps for using misuse cases to identify security requirements: # Identify critical assets in the system # Define security goals for each assets # Identify threats to each of these security goals, by identifying the stakeholders that may want to cause harm to the system # Identify and analyze risks for the threats, using techniques like Risk Assessment # Define security requirements for the risks. It is suggested to use a repository of reusable misuse cases as a support in this 5-step process. ==Research== ===Current field of research=== Current research on misuse cases are primarily focused on the security improvements they can bring to a project, software projects in particular. Ways to increase the widespread adoption of the practice of misuse case development during earlier phases of application development are being considered: the sooner a flaw is found, the easier it is to find a patch and the lower the impact is on the final cost of the project. Other research focuses on improving the misuse case to achieve its final goal: for Raimundas Matuleviƒçius, Nicolas Mayer, Patrick Heymans, \\"Alignment of Misuse Cases with Security Risk Management\\" \\"there is a lack on the application process, and the results are too general and can cause a under-definition or misinterpretation of their concepts\\". They suggest furthermore \\"to see the misuse case in the light of a reference model for information system security risk management (ISSRM)\\" to obtain a security risk management process. ===Future improvement=== The misuse cases are well known by the population of researchers. The body of research on the subject demonstrate the knowledge, but beyond the academic world, the misuse case has not been broadly adopted. As Sindre and Opdahl (the parents of the misuse case concept) suggest: \\"Another important goal for further work is to facilitate broader industrial adoption of misuse cases\\". They propose, in the same article, to embed the misuse case in a usecase modeling tool and to create a \\"database\\" of standard misuse cases to assist software architects. System stakeholders should create their own misuse case charts for requirements that are specific to their own problem domains. Once developed, a knowledge database can reduce the amount of standard security flaws used by lambda hackers. Other research focused on possible missing concrete solutions of the misuse case: as Fabricio A. Braz, Eduardo B. Fernandez, Michael VanHilst, \\"Eliciting Security Requirements through Misuse Activities\\" wrote \\"While this approach can help in a high level elicitation of security requirements, it does not show how to associate the misuse cases to legitimate behavior and concrete assets; therefore, it is not clear what misuse case should be considered, nor in what context\\". These criticisms might be addressed with the suggestions and improvements presented in the precedent section. Standardization of the misuse case as part of the UML notation might allow it to become a mandatory part of project development. \\"It might be useful to create a specific notation for security functionality, or countermeasures that have been added to mitigate vulnerabilities and threats.\\"Lillian R√∏stad, \\"An extended misuse case notation: Including vulnerabilities and the insider threat\\" == See also == * Use case diagram * Steps for Business Analyst To Gather Security Requirements from Misuse Cases * Exception handling * Threat model (software) == References== Category:Business process Category:Software project management Category:Software requirements ","title":"Misuse case"},{"id":"17316679","text":"The proposed Ngarrabullgin Indigenous Protected Area An Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) is a class of protected area used in Australia; each is formed by agreement with Indigenous Australians, and declared by Indigenous Australians. Each is formally recognised by the Australian Government as being part of its National Reserve System, with 75 IPAs comprising more than 44% of the national reserve land, occupying about . By agreeing to establish Indigenous Protected Areas, Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders contributed two- thirds of all new additions to Australia's National Reserve System over the decade 1997‚Äì2007. Indigenous rangers are employed to work in IPAs as well as in other remote areas of Australia, on land management and related projects. ==History== During the 1990s the Australian Government was working in cooperation with State and Territory Governments to build a National Reserve System aimed at protecting, for future generations, a representative sample of Australia's diverse range of flora, fauna and eco-systems. As part of this effort, Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander owners of lands and seas were asked, and many who were interested in re-establishing effective indigenous land management agreed to participate in this endeavour. At a national conference of Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders held in 1997, it was agreed and resolved by the delegates present that a new class of 'indigenous' protected area should be formed as follows: > \\"An Indigenous Protected Area is [to be] governed by the continuing > responsibilities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to care > for and protect lands and waters for present and future generations.\\" > \\"Indigenous Protected Areas may include areas of land and waters over which > Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are custodians, and which shall be > managed for cultural biodiversity and conservation, permitting customary > sustainable resource use and sharing of benefit.\\" The first trialing of this new environmental partnership aimed at adding the new class of Protected Areas to Australia's National Reserve System, was with the Adnyamathanha people of Nepabunna Aboriginal community volunteering 580 square kilometres of rugged limestone hills, siltstone flats, springs and waterholes between the Flinders Ranges and Gammon Ranges National Parks to be managed as an Indigenous Protected Area. The land selected for the first proposed Indigenous Protected area was held by the South Australian Aboriginal Lands Trust, and, by 26 August 1998, an agreement had been reached to see the Adnyamathanha people of Nepabunna Aboriginal community engaged and some employed in restoring the landscape to its former natural and cultural value, and Australia's first Indigenous Protected Area, the Nantawarrina Indigenous Protected Area was declared. By 2007 the kind of partnership agreed and started with the Nantawarrina Indigenous Protected Area had grown to include 23 declared Indigenous Protected Areas covering close to 170,000 square kilometres or 23 per cent of the National Reserve System. In July 2012, The Nature Conservancy, alongside IPA alongside the Central Land Council and government representatives from Australia‚Äôs National Reserve System, helped announce the launch of the Southern Tanami Indigenous Protected Area.This Indigenous Protected Area is Australia‚Äôs largest land reserve, spanning 10.15 million hectares. It protects important pieces of the Northern Territory‚Äôs natural legacy. Included in the Southern Tanami reserve are much of Lake Mackay‚ÄîAustralia‚Äôs second-largest lake‚Äîand an enormous swath of the Tanami Desert. This IPA links a variety of habitats that includes deserts and savannas, giving plant and animal species the space they need to maneuver around threats like wildfires and climate change. ==Criteria== Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander land and sea owners (including native title holders) may be encouraged, or themselves apply to the Australian Government to establish an Indigenous Protected Area on their lands/seas. However, an Indigenous Protected Area can only come into existence where: * land and/or seas are owned by Aboriginal Australians or Torres Strait Islanders; and * significant biodiversity occurs within such Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander owned lands or seas; and * the Aboriginal Australians or Torres Strait Islanders concerned enter into a formal conservation agreement with the Australian Government to manage some of their lands or seas as an IUCN standard \\"protected area\\". ==IPA data== IPA data is available online from several sources. * Department of Environment IPA Database. AT 3 February 2017, latest data file was 20 September 2016. Data is not well maintained ‚Äì for example the gazetted area value for several IPAs is zero. * Department of Environment Collaborative Australian Protected Area Database (CAPAD). CAPAD data is not updated in real time, but is infrequently updated on a two year schedule. At February 2017, the last available update was in 2014. Data values may be incorrect/out of date.

After ensuring that she doesn't secretly write novels or short stories, he confesses his love to her and she reciprocates. Love, however, makes Evangeline write a romantic novel 'Parted Ways' which ends up becoming a best seller. A literary agent arrives, Egbert finds himself cut off from his love, and the couple 'part ways'. A change comes over Egbert and, whenever a female novelist has to be interviewed, Egbert boldly goes. Thus, he finds himself interviewing Evangeline for an article for his paper. Evangeline breaks down, confesses that she has committed to writing three novels and several short stories but cannot write another word, and Egbert steps into the breach with novels that he had written when but a struggling young man. ==Publication history== \\"Best Seller\\" was illustrated by James Montgomery Flagg in Cosmopolitan.McIlvaine (1990), p. 148, D17.49.

His remains are at Zuiry≈´-ji in the city of Gifu. == Rise to power == When Mochimasu's eldest son, Toki Mochikane (ÂúüÂ≤êÊåÅÂÖº) died, Mochikane's son was selected to be the next shugo (governor) of Mino Province. However, Sait≈ç Toshinaga, a shugodai (vice-governor), pushed Shigeyori to be the next shugo. At the time, Shigeyori was a member of the related Isshiki clan, but was adopted by Mochimasu and succeeded him in 1467. This is one of the many examples during the middle part of the Muromachi period in which the shugodai usurped the power of the shugo; the Sait≈ç clan even had its own power usurped later on. In 1467, Shigeyori fought for the western armies in the ≈ånin War.

He spent his youth in Barcelona, where he began his artistic training in the well-regarded Escola de la Llotja. He later moved to Madrid, where he received more training under Joaqu√≠n Sorolla. He married Irene Narezo Dragon√©, a painter as well, of a distinguished family and good economic position. They moved to Paris in 1916 to further Masses' career and settled there until 1946, after which he moved to Barcelona in 1946 and later died in 1949. == Life and Art == Beltran Masses was renowned as a master of colour and the psychological portrait, as well as a painter of seductive images of women. Born in Cuba, where his mother‚Äôs family had lived for nearly two centuries, his family returned to Spain to live in Barcelona, when he was seven years old - the painter‚Äôs Spanish heritage would influence his oeuvre deeply while he sometimes referenced the tropical exoticism of Cuba in the settings for some of his subjects. His paintings are rich with musical and poetic references influenced by ‚ÄòGreek mythology, orphic mysteries and fantasies of Asia, where we are led by Gustave Moreau‚Äô remarked Louis Vauxcelles.Sur l'oeuvre de Beltran Mass√©s, F. Paillart, Paris, 1924, p. 49. === Beltran Masses' connection to the world of music and dance === A guitar featured recurrently in many of his subject paintings, while his interest in contemporary danceOne of Beltr√°n‚Äôs early masterpieces portrayed Carmen T√≥rtola Valencia; he also painted Florence Walton, the great Vaslav Nijinsky, Antonia Merc√© and Alicia Nikitina. led to his design of the scenery and gypsy costume for a 1929 performance by then celebrated dancer Antonia Merc√© ‚ÄúLa Argentina‚ÄùFor her dance, Sonatina. There is a photo of him on the set in Antonia Merc√©, ‚ÄúLa Argentina‚Äù: Flamenco and the Spanish Avant Garde, by Ninotchka Bernahum, Wesleyan \`University Press, 2000, pp. 166 and 201, and intro note X. (whose portrait he painted). The Ballets Russes dancer Alicia Nikitina painted by Federico Beltran Masses, circa 1929 An early fascination with Symbolism and ‚Äòthe Ancients‚Äô manifest in paintings such as Lackmy and Canci√≥n de Bilitis, while his dark paintings of eroticised women, languorously posed in fantastical nocturnal settings set him apart from contemporary artistic trends. His 1915 portrait of a Spanish countess, naked but for a white mantilla, seated between two fully clothed companions (La Maja Marquesa), was publicly denounced and had to be retitled. This decided Beltr√°n‚Äôs move to Paris, where he spent most of the next thirty years. Before his departure a solo exhibition of his work in Madrid in 1916 received the accolade of a visit from the Spanish King, Alfonso XIII;Who later acquired a work for the royal collection (Noche Galant, Patrimonio Nacional, Madrid). this was followed by further successes at the XII Venice Biennale of 1920, where an entire pavilion was dedicated to his work, and several large-scale exhibitions in Paris, New York, Palm Beach and London received enthusiastic reviews. Such was his fame that in 1926 Martha GrahamThe music was specially composed by Manuel de Falla thumbleft(1976-1946). The review in Dance magazine described Martha as ‚Äúclad in a heavy gold kimon[o], making patterns with her body against a screen of brilliant lacquer‚Äîa romantic twelfth century tapestry in bold colorings, a gold crown on her head‚Äîa modern portrait after Beltran Masses, lithe and tigerish in her crisp silk gown of black and orange strips, and red poppies in her sleek black hair‚ÄîMartha Graham presents a series of pictures that fire the imagination and make a hundred stories for every gesture.‚Äù Martha later renamed this ballet Gypsy Dance. titled a dance at her first public performance in New York Portrait ‚Äì Beltran Masses; in 1929 the temporary removal from a London exhibition of two particularly explicit paintings led to denunciations of censorship but insured an attendance of over 17,000 paying visitors in just three weeks. Beltran Masses' portrait subjects included kings and princes, Hollywood stars, and leaders of high society on both sides of the Atlantic, while he was particularly sought out by women who had unashamedly rejected convention and whose lives had sometimes scandalised the public. === Spanish royal support and his move to Paris === His 1915 portrait of a Spanish countess, naked but for a white mantilla, seated between two fully clothed companions (La Maja Marquesa), was refused by the Comit√© of the Exposici√≥n Nacional de Bellas Artes (the Spanish equivalent of the jury of the Paris salon). This decided Beltran Masses‚Äô move to Paris, where he spent most of the next thirty years. Before his departure a solo exhibition of his work in Madrid in 1916 received the accolade of a visit from the Spanish King; Alfonso XIII‚Äôs support and a personal introduction by the Spanish Dowager Queen, Maria Christina of Austria to the Spanish Ambassador, gave Beltr√°n immediate access to Parisian society. He leased a splendid residence near the Porte de Passy in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, where he established his studio. Here, the coarse Catalan peasants of his youthful canvases gave way to dark eyed gitanas and recumbent majas, wearing costumes that emphasised their feminine and seductive qualities. His paintings of women earned him comparisons with the poetry of Baudelaire and, indeed, he later provided the images for an illustrated edition of Les Fleurs du Mal. The contemporary viewer was struck by his use of colour and the mysterious, nocturnal world in which he set so many of his subjects, while sharply illuminating principal figures. He often painted in a darkened room, using artificial light to emphasize the contrast between bodies and their setting. He places figures against rich fabrics or, following his sojourn in Venice in 1920, in imaginary Venetian settings. His work as a portraitist became an important source of revenue; European royalty, members of the Spanish, French, Italian and British aristocracy, the wives and lovers of newly rich entrepreneurs and leading actors and dancers all vied for his attention. Despite the artistic revolution led by Beltran Masses‚Äô Spanish contemporaries Pablo Picasso and Juan Gris, Beltr√°n never embraced abstract cubism and futurism held no appeal for him. The realist legacy of his teacher Joaqu√≠n Sorolla (1863-1923), was subsumed instead by a mystical symbolism distinctly Beltr√°n-Masses‚Äôs. In his use of colour and at times exaggerated drawing, Beltr√°n forged an individual and radical identity which concentrated on the psychological. His work bears superficial comparison with that of his friend Kees van Dongen, who, like Beltr√°n, captured the escapism that characterised post-First World War society. === Venice, a backdrop to some of his portraits and subject paintings === Venice, where Beltran Masses had first met with international fame, became for him the city of his dreams. It provided a dramatic and fantastical background for portraits and subject paintings throughout the 1920s and early 1930s. His famous ‚ÄòBeltran blue‚Äô casts the city in a romantic perpetual evening in many paintings, their mysterious figures often only party lit while dark shadows exaggerate their features or costumes. The Venice exhibition included several of his best known works, notably his nude Salom√© which was later to cause a scandal in London. Beltran Masses' huge success at the 1920 Venice Biennale was consecrated by the inclusion of his Portrait of the Painter in the gallery of famous painters in the Uffizi leading to a major solo exhibition at the Cercle Interalli√©e in Paris. Other exhibitions in the French capital were held in succeeding years at the Georges Petit, Bernheim, Charpentier and Jacques Seligman galleries, and at the Galerie Borghese on the Champs-√âlys√©es. === Beltr√°n Masses enjoyed widespread support among contemporary French critics === Beltran Masses benefited from the enthusiastic support of the critics Ars√®ne Alexandre (1859-1937), an early admirer of Rodin and Seurat (Alexandre invented the term pointillism), and Louis Vauxcelles (1870-1945) who had first used the word Fauvism and invented the adjective Cubism. The poet, novelist and critic Camille Mauclair (1872-1945), an advocate for the symbolist movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also praised Beltran Masses. The latter two wrote lengthy introductions to a 1921 illustrated monograph on the artist in which five of the paintings included in this exhibition were reproduced. Ars√®ne Alexandre later wrote the introduction to Beltr√°n‚Äôs illustrations for a 1929 edition of Il Trionfo della Morte (1894) by the renowned Italian poet Gabriele d‚ÄôAnnunzio1863-1938, created Prince of Montenevoso by the king of Italy, long- time lover of Marchesa Luisa Casati, also painted by Beltran Masses at the Galerie Javal and Bourdeaux. Critics in Paris and London noted the psychology of Beltran Masses' artistic vision; indeed in 1931 the Paris Revue de Psychoth√©rapie et de Psychologie Appliqu√©e published a lengthy article entitled ‚ÄúL‚ÄôOeuvre Psychologique de Beltran-Masses‚Äù by Dr Pierre Vachet, reporting the conclusions of a special conference organised by the French Society of Psychotherapists. The article concentrated particularly on the artist‚Äôs use of colour to define the mysterious symbolism of the settings for many of his paintings, while emphasising the sensuality and voluptuous femininity of his subjects. === Success in the United States === Reports of his fame reached the United States by 1921; a paragraph in American Art NewsPublished 3 December 1921 mentions the success of Beltran Masses' first Paris exhibition. The early twentieth century had seen an explosion of interest in Spanish art, exemplified by John Singer Sargent‚Äôs El Jaleo, Isabella Stewart Gardner‚Äôs Spanish Cloister gallery (now part of her eponymous museum) to house it. In , and the foundation in 1908 of the Hispanic Society of America, which Sorolla had decorated with a series of large canvases (Beltr√°n-Masses was later elected a member.) In 1924 Beltr√°n was invited to exhibit at the Wildenstein galleries in New York; more commercially successful exhibitions followed in Palm Beach and the Los Angeles show, both in 1925. Los Angeles was yet to establish a major art museumThe Museum of History, Science and Art, the notional predecessor of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, founded in 1910 had only a modest collection. and such was the excitement generated by the paintings of Federico Beltran Masses that it was opened with a lengthy musical programme of Spanish and Mexican music and a reception for hundreds of black-tie attired guests. The favourable reviews Beltr√°n received in America and the praise for the ‚Äúpsychological‚Äù insights that he captured brought him a succession of commissions from American East and West Coast society. === Beltran Masses and Hollywood === Beltran Masses‚Äô success in Hollywood and the acquaintances he made through friendship with the actress Marion Davies and her lover of William Randolph Hearst (who purchased four paintings by the artist and whose portrait he painted), helped his career greatly. An astute self-promoter, Beltran Masses made much of this connection to Hearst, with whom he travelled in Europe. Surviving photographic archive shows Beltran Masses with Charlie Chaplin,Who bought at least one painting by him, still with the Chaplin heirs the Hearst newspaper columnist Louella Parsons, the actress Merle Oberon, screen legend Douglas Fairbanks Senior and his son Douglas Fairbanks Junior, Sylvia Ashley, Pola Negri(1897-1987) Star of the silent movies with less success in the talkies, sometime lover of Charlie Chaplin, she made no more films in the US between 1932 and 1948 (Moon Spinners, with Hayley Mills) aside from one 1943 production, although she made several films in Germany between 1934 and 1938. She tried to get the part of Norma Desmond in the 1948 film, Sunset Boulevard but Gloria Swanson was cast instead. Beltr√°n-Masses at her request painted a portrait of her with Rudolf Valentino (whom she described as the love of her life) playing the guitar behind her, but she then failed to pay and he sued her for $5000 cost. Negri was at the time married to the Georgian Prince Serge Mdivani, whom she was suing for divorce ‚Äì the couple were temporarily reconciled and Negri offered Beltr√°n $1000, which he refused, although the case was eventually settled. Negri and Mdivani were divorced in 1931 and later that decade Negri set up home with an oil heiress and sometime Vaudeville actress, Margaret West, with whom she lived for the rest of her life. and Gloria Swanson, whom he also painted, among other Hollywood personalities. Beltran Masses' later connections with French Cinema were cemented by the inclusion of twelve paintings and three drawings in the 1934 film, Le Rosaire, staged by Gaston Ravel and Tony Lekain. Years after Beltr√°n‚Äôs brief time in Hollywood, friends such as Davies, Hearst, Fairbanks and Joan Crawford still visited Beltran Masses in Paris in the 1930s. === Debut in London === Portrait of King George VI by Federico Beltran Masses. Circa 1938 The immediate success of Beltran Masses' 1929 exhibition in London at the New Burlington Galleries owed much to the art historian and critic for The Observer and Daily Mail, Paul George Konody (1872-1933), who wrote the introduction to the exhibition catalogue, and reviewed it for the Daily Mail in a one-page article. This exhibition ‚Äì from which two paintings the Salom√© and The Nights of Eve were initially removed, - was a triumph for the artist: eighteen paintings in the show stayed in England after the exhibition.There were over 17,000 paying visitors in the first three weeks, although according to The Daily Chronicle newspaper, in a report on 26 May 1934 of the RWS show of that year, there were twenty-five thousand in total before it closed, and more than 11,000 catalogues were sold. Despite his evident admiration for the artist, Konody avoided being slavish in his praise. While he complimented the artist on his romantic sensibility and his brilliant use of colour, he was critical of the occasional contradictions in his drawing. Beltran Masses had a second large scale exhibition in London in the galleries of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1934, but his last public exhibition in London at the New Burlington Galleries in 1938, did not have the same success. Federico Beltr√°n Masses was a member of the jury for Miss France 1938. Fabricio Cardenas, Vieux papiers des Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, Miss Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales √©lue Miss France en 1938, 7 decembre 2014 === The Spanish Civil War and the artist's failing health === The horrors of the Spanish Civil War caused the artist a great distress. Beltran Masses was instinctively unsympathetic to the republic, believing it had destroyed much that he treasured; the support of the exiled King Alfonso XIII had also been an important factor in Beltr√°n‚Äôs early success. Beltran Masses was a practising Catholic and a knight of both the Order of Malta and the Order of the Holy Sepulchre who instinctively supported the Nationalists but was equally deeply upset by the tragic consequences of the conflict, having friends on both sides. The artist remained in Paris after the outbreak of the Second World War - as a citizen of a neutral power he was able to live relatively undisturbed by the German occupation. The art market suffered, however, and he had to move to a smaller home, and give painting lessons in his studio there to make ends meet. When ill-health and failing eyesight, which began deteriorating in the mid-1930s, required urgent attention Beltr√°n and another followed in Madrid, but the painter returned to Paris the following year hoping to resume his career. This proved impossible. Liver disease now compounded his earlier heart problems and on 4 October 1949 Beltran Masses died, aged just sixty-four. A small posthumous exhibition of his portraits was staged by the Lyceum, Havana, Cuba in 1950, his first monographic exhibition in the country of his birth. === His success, obscurity and then rediscovery === Beltran Masses was showered with public honours and was a member of the Academies of San Fernando in Madrid, San Jorge in Barcelona and San Lu√≠s in Zaragoza, as well as those of Lisbon, Cord√≥ba and M√°laga, and also a member of the French Institut and Acad√©mie des Beaux Arts in Paris. That his name was almost forgotten until recently is in part the consequence of changes in taste, figurative painting abandoned by all but a handful of successful contemporary painters from the late 1940s through 1970s. Furthermore, many of the artist‚Äôs more important works remained the property of the heirs of his widow, and only when the enthusiastic support of a Barcelona collector resulted in three public exhibitions in Spain (in Salamanca, Barcelona and, in June‚ÄìJuly 2012, at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid) was Beltr√°n‚Äôs art once again brought to the attention of the Spanish public. Two important paintings in the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne at the Centre Pompidou and others in the collection of the Reina Sofia, the Civic Museum in Ciudad Real, and the Casa Lis in Salamanca have offered few opportunities to see paintings on public exhibition. When the Cuban Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana, reopened in 2000 two large scale works were revealed to a public which had no previous acquaintance with the Cuban-born artist. The recent revival of interest and our knowledge of Beltran Masses owes much to the care with which his heirs retained not only the paintings they had inherited but an extensive archive, which includes many photographs from the 1920s and 1930s as well as exhibition catalogues, reviews and mementoes.

It was published in 1839. ==Plot summary== The story opens with Alfred Melton attempting to persuade his cousin and her fianc√©, Augusta Elmore and Edward Howard, to sign a temperance pledge and swear off alcohol. They at first refuse noting their already temperate lifestyle and their basic philosophy of \\"let every man mind his own business\\". However, Alfred eventually convinces Augusta to sign on behalf of her husband, agreeing to watch over him. Very soon Augusta and Edward are happily married, mostly keeping to themselves and engaging in intellectual pursuits such as singing and reading in their home. After some time the Howards begin to socialize more outside the home and engage in more \\"excitement\\". Eventually, the two have children and Augusta is unable to leave the house as frequently. During this time Edward succumbs to temptation and begins drinking more and more heavily, having to be carried home one evening by friends. Unfortunately, even Augusta‚Äôs pleas cannot save him at this point and he begins to travel extensively, involving himself in risky business ventures which eventually leave him bankrupt. Once all has been lost the Howard family moves to a new city where they are unknown so that they may fade into the background. For some time they live in poverty until one day Augusta‚Äôs brother Henry arrives in an attempt to save her. She resists at first, but eventually leaves, an act which does cause a slight moral upturn in Edward. One day, on an errand, Augusta visits the home of Mr. L, who is also being visited by Mr. Dallas. Mr. Dallas finds out that Augusta is married to Edward, whom he is familiar with, and he hatches a scheme to save the Howard family. When he first approaches Edward to offer help, Edward resists, feeling that he is already too lost. However, he eventually breaks down and agrees to move to the home of Mr. Dallas and attempt a reformation. At first his stay is characterized as imprisonment by Mr. Dallas, but this is necessary since Edward is suffering from terrible fevers and delirium.

It is one of a category of studies that attempt to determine \\"safe withdrawal rates\\" from retirement portfolios that contain stocks and thus grow (or shrink) irregularly over time. It states that a person has sufficient savings in assets if 4% of his/her assets are sufficient to cover a year's expenses. In the original study success was primarily judged by whether portfolio lasted for the desired payout period, i.e., the investor did not run out of money during their retirement years before passing away; capital preservation was not a primary goal, but the \\"terminal value\\" of portfolios was considered for those investors who may wish to leave bequests. ==Study and conclusions== The rule refers to one of the scenarios examined by the authors. The context is one of annual withdrawals from a retirement portfolio containing a mix of stocks and bonds. The 4% refers to the portion of the portfolio withdrawn during the first year; it is assumed that the portion withdrawn in subsequent years will increase with the consumer price index (CPI) to keep pace with the cost of living. The withdrawals may exceed the income earned by the portfolio, and the total value of the portfolio may well shrink during periods when the stock market performs poorly. It is assumed that the portfolio needs to last thirty years. The withdrawal regime is deemed to have failed if the portfolio is exhausted in less than thirty years and to have succeeded if there are unspent assets at the end of the period. The authors backtested a number of stock/bond mixes and withdrawal rates against market data compiled by Ibbotson Associates covering the period from 1925 to 1995. They examined payout periods from 15 to 30 years, and withdrawals that stayed level or increased with inflation. For level payouts, they stated that \\"If history is any guide for the future, then withdrawal rates of 3% and 4% are extremely unlikely to exhaust any portfolio of stocks and bonds during any of the payout periods shown in Table 1. In those cases, portfolio success seems close to being assured.\\" For payouts increasing to keep pace with inflation, they stated that \\"withdrawal rates of 3% to 4% continue to produce high portfolio success rates for stock-dominated portfolios.\\" The authors make this qualification: Its conclusions are often encapsulated in a \\"4% safe withdrawal rate rule-of- thumb,\\" which had previously been published in , based on the same data and similar analysis. Note that the 4% is calculated against the balance of the account only in the first year: withdrawal amounts in subsequent years are calculated by adding inflation to the previous year's amount, and not 4% of account balance in later years. Attempts have been made to and to study the effects of asset valuations on safe withdrawal rates and update the 4% rule and Trinity Study for longer retirements and for worse-than-historical markets ==Other studies, impact and criticisms== Other authors have made similar studies using backtested and simulated market data, and other withdrawal systems and strategies. The Trinity study and others of its kind have been sharply criticized, e.g. by Scott et al. (2008), not on their data or conclusions, but on what they see as an irrational and economically inefficient withdrawal strategy: \\"This rule and its variants finance a constant, non-volatile spending plan using a risky, volatile investment strategy. As a result, retirees accumulate unspent surpluses when markets outperform and face spending shortfalls when markets underperform.\\" Laurence Kotlikoff, advocate of the consumption smoothing theory of retirement planning, is even less kind to the 4% rule, saying that it \\"has no connection to economics.... economic theory says you need to adjust your spending based on the portfolio of assets you're holding. If you invest aggressively, you need to spend defensively. Notice that the 4 percent rule has no connection to the other rule‚Äîto target 85 percent of your preretirement income. The whole thing is made up out of the blue.\\"Fonda, Daren (2008), \\"The Savings Sweet Spot,\\" SmartMoney, April, 2008, pp. 62-3 (interview with Ben Stein and Laurence Kotlikoff) The original Trinity study was based on data through 1995. An update of their results using data through 2009 is provided in Pfau (2010). Shortly afterwards, the original authors of the Trinity Study published an updated study, also using data through 2009. The procedure for determining a safe withdrawal rate from a retirement portfolio in these studies considers only the uncertainty arising from the future returns to be earned on the investment. Another major uncertainty is the amount of spending that will be required each period to provide a given standard of living. For instance, there is a small chance each period of an emergency arising that will require a large extra withdrawal that may be comparable in size to the loss from a financial bear market. An example is major repairs to a home not covered by insurance caused by water incursion or an earthquake. The effects of such possible emergencies in addition to uncertain investment returns are considered in Pye (2010). Under conditions where a 4 percent withdrawal might otherwise be reasonably sustainable, reasonable assumptions about the chances for an emergency each year and its cost reduce the withdrawal from 4 to about 3 percent. This latter analysis also differs by using the Retrenchment Rule to determine the value of the withdrawal each period. This rule is discussed in Pye (2010) and also Pye (2012).Pye, Gordon B. 2012. \\"Retrenchment Rule\\" When using the Retrenchment Rule the default withdrawal each period is the prior withdrawal adjusted for inflation as in the earlier studies. There are conditions, however, when this default withdrawal is not applicable. In particular, the initial withdrawal is related to the prior standard of living of the retiree, not just the withdrawal that is reasonably sustainable. Also, the withdrawal for a period is reduced when a test indicates that such retrenchment is necessary. This occurs when the risk of running out of funds before the end of a plan has become too high given the size of the then current withdrawal and the funds that remain. ==See also== * Retirement spend- down ==References== ==External links== * Category:Retirement Category:Pensions Category:Individual retirement accounts ","title":"Trinity study"},{"id":"17317131","text":"1257 M√≥ra, provisional designation , is an asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 15 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 8 August 1932, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after Hungarian astronomer . == Orbit and classification == M√≥ra orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.3‚Äì2.7 AU once every 3 years and 11 months (1,434 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Identified as , it was first observed at Heidelberg and Algiers Observatory in 1928, extending the body's observation arc by 4 years prior to its official discovery observation. == Physical characteristics == === Rotation period === American astronomer Richard Binzel and French amateur astronomer Ren√© Roy obtained three rotational light curves of M√≥ra from photometric observation taken in 1983 and 2009/11, respectively. Light curve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period between 2.28 and 2.30 hours with a change in brightness of 0.23 to 0.43 magnitude (). The short period is just above the threshold of 2.2 hours for the so-called fast rotators. === Diameter, albedo and spectral type === According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, M√≥ra measures between 14.72 and 21.47 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.051 and 0.10. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony S-type asteroids of 0.20 and derives a shorter diameter of 10.79 kilometers, while Richard Binzel classified it as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid during his photometric observations in the 1980s. == Naming == This minor planet was named in honour of Hungarian astronomer K√°roly M√≥ra (1899‚Äì1938). The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

It was described by Jorge Calvo and colleagues in 2007, with M. gondwanicus as the type and only species. ==Discovery and naming== Satellite image of the terrain of the Neuqu√©n Group, the geologic unit Macrogryphosaurus is from In May 1999, during field work at Mari Menuco Lake, Argentina (sixty kilometres northwest of Neuqu√©n) conducted by the National University of Comahue, an articulated, nearly complete dinosaur skeleton was discovered and excavated. It was brought to the attention of the palaeontologists by young boy Rafael Moyano, who had discovered it.Poropat, S. F. The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. Originally reported to hail from the Portezuelo Formation of the Neuqu√©n Group, its locality was later revised to be in the Sierra Barrosa Formation of the same geologic group. These unit is dated to the Coniacian age of the Late Cretaceous. Noted for bony plates on its thorax, it was identified as a large species of ornithopod. The species would be described and named Macrogryphosaurus gondwanicus in 2007, in a study authored by Jorge O. Calvo, Juan D. Porfiri, and Fernando E. Novas. Its generic name was derived from the Greek macro, meaning large, grypho, meaning enigmatic, and saurus, meaning lizard. The specific epiphet gondwanicus refers to the ancient continent of Gondwana. The holotype specimen, MUCPv-32, consists of an essentially complete set of vertebra, a number of ribs, four mineralized thoracic plates, both sides of the pectoral girdle, and a sternum. The individual is considered to have been an adult. The preservation of the fossil was described by Dr. Stephen F. Poropat as \\"amazing\\" in nature. Subsequent research has not referred any other specimens to the species. However, in 2016, a study was published on MAU-Pv-PH-458, a fragmentary dorsal neural arch from the Plottier Formation of northern Argentina. The bone is the northernmost record of an ornithopod in South America. It was not determined to belong to a Macrogryphosaurus, but noted to be from an animal of similar size and anatomy, and from approximately the same geographic and stratigraphic location, though it lived at a slightly earlier time. Other indeterminate ornithopod specimens from Argentina similarly indicate animals of similar size to the taxon. M. gondwanicus received a complete osteology in 2020, a study published in Cretaceous Research by Sebasti√°n Rozadilla, Pen√©lope Cruzado-Caballero, Jorge O. Calvo. This described the anatomy of the species in much more thoroughly and investigating its classification and biomechanics under a more modern lens. They considered the genus to be of importance, due to being the largest known elasmarian species, and for the completeness of its known remains, informing on the anatomy of the group. ==Description== Macrogryphosaurus has been noted for its large size compared to other South American ornithopods. It has been estimated to have been around in length, though the only known individual may not have been fully grown. As such, it is the largest species of South American ornithopod outside of Hadrosauridae, and the largest species of elasmarian. Approaching the size of many more derived iguanodontian ornithopods, it is, compared to these derived taxa, much more graceful and lightly built in form. One of the most remarked upon features of the taxon is its mineralized thoracic plates, also referred to as intercostal plates. These are a series of plates along the side of the torso, shared with a handful of other ornithischians such as Talenkauen, Thescelosaurus, and Hypsilophodon. Along with a fused, birdlike sternum, its short torso would have been rather stiff in nature. This, alongside its relatively elongate neck and coelurosaur- like tail, gave it a rather unique form compared to that documented in other ornithischian dinosaurs. ==Classification== Phylogenetic analysis indicates that it is related to Talenkauen, and Calvo and colleagues proposed a new clade, Elasmaria, for the two genera. ==References== == External links == * * Category:Ornithopods Category:Coniacian life Category:Turonian life Category:Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of South America Category:Cretaceous Argentina Category:Fossils of Argentina Category:Portezuelo Formation Category:Fossil taxa described in 2007 Category:Taxa named by Fernando Novas ","title":"Macrogryphosaurus"},{"id":"17317209","text":"WPDS may refer to: * WPDS-LD, a low-power television station in Largo, Florida, United States * WGHR (FM), a radio station in Spring Hill, Florida, which held the call sign WPDS from January 1990 to August 1992 * WFLZ-FM, a radio station in Tampa, Florida, which held the call sign WPDS from September 1985 to October 1987 * WXIN (TV), a television station in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, which held the call sign WPDS-TV from July 1983 to August 1985 * Woodworth Personal Data Sheet, a personality test ","title":"WPDS"},{"id":"17317238","text":"Mount Strickland is a mountain in the Saint Elias Mountains of Yukon, Canada. __TOC__ ==See also== *List of mountain peaks of North America **List of mountain peaks of Canada ==References== ==External links== Category:Mountains of Yukon Category:Saint Elias Mountains Mount Strickland ","title":"Mount Strickland"},{"id":"17317247","text":"The Central Falls Mill Historic District is located between Roosevelt Avenue and the Blackstone River in Central Falls, Rhode Island.

Although considered old- fashioned, it is still occasionally used. A simple and effective sterilizing method commonly used today is autoclaving: heating the substance being sterilized to 121 ¬∞C for 15 minutes in a pressured system. If autoclaving is not possible because of lack of equipment, or the need to sterilize something that will not withstand the higher temperature, unpressurized heating for a prolonged period at a temperature of up to 100 ¬∞C, the boiling point of water, may be used. The heat will kill the bacterial cells; however, bacterial spores capable of later germinating into bacterial cells may survive. Tyndallization can be used to destroy the spores.Tyndallization briefly explained in a short tutorial about techniques and troubleshooting for dealing with microbes in a science lab. Tyndallization essentially consists of heating the substance to boiling point (or just a little below boiling point) and holding it there for 15 minutes, three days in succession. After each heating, the resting period will allow spores that have survived to germinate into bacterial cells; these cells will be killed by the next day's heating. During the resting periods the substance being sterilized is kept in a moist environment at a warm room temperature, conducive to germination of the spores.

The museum hosts an annual festival in late August that highlights music, food, and entertainment that reflects the Finnish-American experience. ==History== In 1900, a Finnish family by the name of Siifert and Wilhelmiina Tapio purchased the present Finn Creek acreage from Herman Arola and the St. Paul Railway Co. The price per acre was about $3. and they purchased . Construction of the Tapios' house began immediately, and the family moved into their new home in 1901. The Tapio family lived and farmed the land in the late 19th century. They had nine children, five of whom lived to be adults (Sylvester, Maimie, Hilma, Hilda, Helga, Tecia, Ida, Sadie, Kalle). Kalle Tapio died at age 3, leaving Sylvester Tapio as the only son. In 1975, the State Finnish American Historical Society purchased one acre of land at Finn Creek. Another were purchased since that time through grants, local funding and promotions. The land was purchased from an individual land owner in 1975. Only the Tapios had lived on the land. The buildings on the site were restored reminiscent of the late 19th century to the early 20th century. ==Mission and purpose== Currently volunteers work to maintain the buildings, and create an environment for preserving the Finnish- American history. The museum is also keenly interested in staying current with Finland today and looking into the future. ==Festival== Demonstrations at the festival include: Sawmilling, threshing, rug weaving.

In 1820, his family immigrated to Otonabee Township in Peterborough County, Upper Canada, and took up farming. Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online == Development of Red Fife == In the early 1840s, the farmers in the Midlands area of Canada West‚Äîthe new name for Upper Canada after the 1840 Act of Union‚Äîgrew a winter wheat variety known as Siberian. It had been introduced to Canada in the hope that it would survive the severe Canadian winters. But the Siberian wheat variety was susceptible to rust and its yields were low. Early History of Wheat Growing in Canada David Fife wrote to a friend in Glasgow asking for samples of good seed wheat. His friend obtained a sample of wheat off a ship from Danzig, Prussia, (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland) and sent it to Fife. As it came to Fife's hand just before spring seeding time, and, not knowing whether it was a fall or spring variety, Mr. Fife concluded to sow a part of it that spring, and wait for the result. It proved to be fall wheat as most of it never ripened. Three ears, however, which grew from a single grain did reach maturity. Two possibilities exist, that the single grain from which the three heads grew was an accidental hybrid, or that the single seed kernel was a spring wheat variety mixed in with a winter wheat strain. In any case, Fife preserved the seeds from the stool that had matured, sowed them the following year where they grew to be entirely free of rust. Fife continued to carefully husband the seeds harvested and by 1848 had accumulated 240 bushels of the new variety which he distributed to his neighbors for seed. By 1860, Red Fife had supplanted all other varieties in use in Canada. Red Fife soon became the standard variety of \\"hard spring\\" wheat in North America and by the end of the 19th century was widely considered as the world's best spring wheat because of its resistance to rust, early maturing, high productivity and excellent milling and baking qualities. == Legacy == A stone cairn honouring David Fife was erected in 1964 of out of ordinary field stone, with a brass plate inscribed with a brief history of Red Fife on Ontario Highway #7 eight miles to the east of Peterborough. The official unveiling was carried out by Donald Fife, a descendant. This plaque was later moved to Lang Pioneer Village Museum at Keene, Ontario. From a single seed Tracing the Marquis wheat success story in Canada to its roots in the Ukraine Red Fife wheat would later be developed by Dominion Agriculturalist Charles Saunders into Marquis wheat, a cultivar that for a time in the early 20th century was grown on 90% of prairie farms. == References == == External links == * Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online * McNicholl, Martin K.

Based on established customs and laws and now littered with later interpolations, the Book is an essential document in the economic history of Byzantium and the Mediterranean. The book was lost until 1891, when it was discovered in Geneva by the Swiss Jules Nicole, who referred to it as the Livre de l'√âparque. ==Dating== The book is traditionally dated to the reign of Leo VI the Wise (886‚Äì912). However, whilst the first chapter concerning the entrance requirements to the college of notaries does probably date from Leo's reign (Leo was renowned for recodifying and tidying up Roman law), it seems that the work itself (like so many texts from this period) was the product of gradual accumulation. References in four places to tetartera coins show the work in its final form to be no earlier than the reign of Nikephoros II Phokas (963‚Äì69), who instigated this particular form of lightweight gold coinage. The absence of any mention of Rus‚Äô merchants from the document, whilst other nationalities such as Bulgars and Syrians are mentioned, also indicates a late date‚Äîpresumably after the breakdown of Byzantine‚ÄìRus' relations in 968.M.F. Hendy, \\"Light Weight Solidi, Tetartera and the Book of the Prefect\\", Byzantinische Zeitschrift 65 (1972), pp. 57-80 ==Contents== The Book of the Prefect is essentially a list of regulations concerning the collegia or private guilds that had existed in the Greek world since Roman times. As all trades were theoretically under governmental control, the Book of the Prefect is not exhaustive of all crafts. Instead, the book appears to highlight a cross-section of the areas where public interest and private went together, showing how a good city should be run to keep its black market under wraps.G.C. Maniatis, \\"The Domain of the Private Guilds in the Byzantine Economy, Tenth to Fifteenth Centuries\\", DOP 55 (2001), pp. 339-69 The text is divided into twenty-two chapters, the first nineteen of which refer to specific guilds: *Chapter 1 ‚Äì the college of notaries (contract lawyers). This is the longest chapter in the work and, as it can probably be associated with the reign of Leo VI, predates the other chapters. The chapter sets strict regulations for entry into the college of notaries (for example stipulating that a candidate must have perfect knowledge of the law and know, amongst other things, the 40 titles of Manuel by heart. The remaining chapters are much smaller than the first chapter and discuss eighteen other guilds, often with similar clauses indicating imposition of the regulations from above: *Chapter 2 ‚Äì dealers in bullion *Chapter 3 ‚Äì bankers *Chapter 4 ‚Äì silk stuff merchants *Chapter 5 ‚Äì merchants who import silk from Syria and Baghdad *Chapter 6 ‚Äì raw silk merchants *Chapter 7 ‚Äì raw silk dressers *Chapter 8 ‚Äì silk dyers *Chapter 9 ‚Äì linen merchants *Chapter 10 ‚Äì perfume merchants *Chapter 11 ‚Äì wax and taper merchants *Chapter 12 ‚Äì soap merchants *Chapter 13 ‚Äì grocers *Chapter 14 ‚Äì saddlers *Chapter 15 ‚Äì butchers *Chapter 16 ‚Äì pork merchants *Chapter 17 ‚Äì fishmongers *Chapter 18 ‚Äì bakers *Chapter 19 ‚Äì inn- holders Some similar points from these clauses include regulations controlling the elections to guilds and their entrance fees, clauses advocating working together including rhetoric on not cheating others and having good quality produce, the setting of prices and profit margins, and the setting of the spheres of work and areas of the city in which they can operate to avoid competition between guilds. The last three chapters concern the regulation of agents and contractors, as well as the administration of the Eparch's office and his use of deputies in customs inspections.The Book of the Eparch, trans. E. H. Freshfield in Roman Law in the Later Roman Empire (1938) ==Aims and effects== It is not known exactly why the Book of the Prefect was compiled, however use of the guilds may have been a way for the Eparch to police the market, seeking order, a decrease in crime, and the guarantee of cheap supplies. The demarcation of guilds and control they got over their members shows there was a marrying of interests between the guilds and the state. However, it is important to stress that not all members of each profession were a member of their guild. Instead evidence from the text suggests that guilds were exclusive and privileged, and intended for the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer. At one point the text mentions raw silk dressers who were not a member of their guild and had to buy silk at a higher price.The Book of the Eparch, trans. E. H. Freshfield in Roman Law in the Later Roman Empire (1938), ch. 7 clause 2 Another important reason for such imperial concern over commerce was for the efficient raising of a maximum of revenue through taxation. ==Enforcement== Many of the Book of the Prefect‚Äôs regulations must have been very hard to police (e.g. regulations stipulating that the merchants produce items of good quality), and it is likely that the laws were probably rarely enforced, and where they were it would depend more on co-operation from the guilds rather than on any action by the Eparch. ==Historiographic utility== The Book of the Prefect has an important place in medieval economic historiography, and is a unique source for the Byzantine economy in the Age of Constantine Porphyrogenitus. Some of its many uses include its ability to help us recreate a commercial map of Constantinople, the light it throws on the Constantinopolitan economy and governmental controls over it, and questions concerning the regulation of trade between the Byzantine capital and its provinces.Mango, Marlia Mundell (2000). \\"The Commercial Map of Constantinople.\\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 54, pp. 189‚Äì207 ==Translations and editions== The Book has been translated into English twice.A. E. R. Boak, \\"The Book of the Prefect,\\" Journal of Economic and Business History, I (1929), 597-619, and E. H. Freshfield, Roman Law in the Later Roman Empire (Cambridge: Bowes & Bowes, 1932). Earlier, in 1893, a trilingual edition--in the original Greek, Latin, and French--was made by Jules Nicole, who discovered the only surviving manuscript in a Genevan library.In \\"Le Livre du pr√©fet ou L'Edit de l'empereur L√©on le Sage sur les corporations de Constantinople,\\" M√©moires d l'Institut National Genevois, XVIII, 1-100. New English translations of sections vi.31-33 and xx.56-57 have since been made by Lopez and Raymond (1951) using Nicole's Greek, but the translators call for completely updated English editions using the most recent Byzantine scholarship.Lopez and Raymond, 19 n1. In 1970 Variorum Reprints gathered Nicole's editions and Freshfield's English translation along with a photographic reproduction of the manuscript (Genevensis 23) appended to a new introduction by I.

One afternoon at home with visiting magician and friend David Mark, during the course of a conversation about effects associated with specific performers, Caldwell realized for the first time he had done the flip for well over 50 years with a long pair of sharp scissors for the handkerchief routine in his inside pocket!

Verso: London (1999) ===Marie- Louise=== Although Wendo had already established himself among the first generation of Congolese musicians, Bowane's first hit with Wendo was also the more established musician's first huge hit. The song, the first truly international hit of Congolese Rhumba, was \\"Marie-Louise\\", co-written in 1948 by Wendo Kolosoy and Henri Bowane. Through the publicity of Radio Congolia, along with the controversy which followed the song (a back-and-forth between Wendo and Henri over Wendo's pursuit of a girl, thwarted by Henri's wealth, with salacious undertones),The Lingala lyrics are transcribed in detail at ANALYSE MUSICALE \\"Marie Louisa\\". Norbert Mbu Mputu, Congo Vision (2005) and in brief in Bob W. White (2002) The song is also analysed in Jesse Samba Wheeler. Rumba Lingala as Colonial Resistance , Image & Narrative, No. 10, March 2005 the song became a success throughout West Africa. With its success came trouble: the song had \\"satanic\\" powers attributed to it by Catholic religious leaders. Stories from the time even claimed that the song, if played at midnight, could raise the dead. The furor drove Wendo out of Kinshasa, and resulted in a brief imprisonment by the Belgian authorities in Stanleyville and his excommunication from the Catholic Church.'Father' of Congolese rumba dies \\"Evolution de la musique congolaise moderne de 1930 √† 1950\\" (2005) Wendo est mort. A.Vungbo, Le Phare Quotidien (Kinshasa), 2008-07-30 The combination of African lyrics and vocals with Afro-Cuban son rhythms and instrumentation spawned one of the most successful African musical genres: soukous. Wendo's time on the ferries also contributed to his success as one of the first \\"national\\" artists of the DRC: he learned the music of the ethnic groups up and down the river, and later sang not only in his native tongue of Kikongo, but also in fluent Lingala and Swahili.\\"Wendo Kolosoy, 62 ans de carri√®re musicale\\" (2005) ==Soukous in the 1950s== The success of this new music rested upon the burgeoning radio stations and record industry of late colonial Leopoldville, which often piped music over loudspeakers into the African quarters, called the \\"Cite\\". A handful of African clubs (closing early with a 9:30PM curfew for non-Europeans) like \\"Congo Bar\\" provided venues, along with occasional gigs at the upscale white clubs of the European quarter, \\"La ville\\". The importation of European and American 78 rpm records into Africa in the 1930s and 1940s (called G.V. Series records) featured much Cuban music, a style that was enjoyed by cosmopolitan Europeans and Africans alike. One writer has argued that this music, sophisticated, based on Africa music, and not produced by white colonialists especially appealed to Africans in general, and newly urban Congolese in particular.Bob W. White, Congolese Rumba and Other Cosmopolitanisms (2002) Greek and Lebanese merchants, a fixture in colonial Francophone Africa were amongst the first to bring recording and record pressing equipment to tropical Africa.

J√©ronimidis and the musicians, barnstormed around Belgian Congo in a brightly painted Ngoma van, performing and selling records. The music culture this created not only propelled Congolese Rumba to fame, but began to develop a national culture for the first time.Bob W. White, Congolese Rumba and Other Cosmopolitanisms, Cahiers d'√©tudes africaines, 168, 2002 details this process, and Gary Stewart's Rumba on the River (1999) is the definitive English language work on these years, which made Kinshasa the musical capital of the continent. See also the review of the 1996 compilation \\"Ngoma: the Early Years\\" at Ntama: Journal of African Music and Popular Culture . African Music Archive at Mainz University (1996) At the beginning of the 1950s, while Wendo remained with Ngoma, Bowane moved on the J√©ronimidis' new label, Loningisa. Bowane became the dominant musical influence on the label as he moved out of centre stage and into the role of producer, writer, and owner-impresario of the premier nightclub of Leopoldville, Quint. Bowane is remembered as the most successful African musician of his time: he reputed to have been the first black man in Belgian Congo to own a Cadillac. ==Later career== In 1976 he founded the record label Ryco Jazz, and also recorded his only solo album, Double Take - Tala Kaka. ==Discography== ;Albums * Double Take, Tala Kaka (1976, Ryco Jazz) ;Contributing artist * The Rough Guide to Congo Gold (2008, World Music Network) == References == *Henri Bowane.

In 1964 she became the first woman to run a marathon in under 3 hours 30 minutes. Her time of 3:27:45 at the Isle of Wight Marathon was recognized by the International Association of Athletics Federations as a world best. She was also the first woman to run two ultramarathons: the Isle of Man 40 in 1971 and the 55-mile London-to-Brighton race in 1972 ‚Äì seven years before female competitors were officially allowed. In 1974, at the age of 37, she won the first International Masters Marathon for women, at the World Veterans' Championships in Paris. ==Biography== Greig was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire and lived there all her life. She and her twin sister, Cynthia, attended the John Neilson Institution in Paisley. After leaving school, Greig ran for the Glasgow-based Bellahouston Harriers for a short time before setting up her own women's club, Tannahill Harriers in 1959. At the time, the furthest women were permitted to run in competition was one mile on the track and up to three miles in cross country, occasionally extended to longer distances. Greig competed at track events, winning several medals at the Scottish Championships: Silver in the 880yds in 1956 and Bronze in the mile in 1958,1959, 1960 and 1966. She was Scottish National Cross Country Champion in 1960, 1962, 1964 and 1968. ==Isle of Wight Marathon== Greig worked for the publisher and printer Walter Ross (1918-1993) at his business in Glasgow. Ross was a keen runner who encouraged Greig in many of her endeavours. Ross's older brother, Bill, lived on the Isle of Wight and was a member of Ryde Harriers, the organisers of the Isle of Wight Marathon. Greig had visited the island in May 1963 and run part of the marathon course. When she returned in 1964, the organisers were persuaded to allow her to take part. The race took place on 23 May. Greig was made to start four minutes ahead of the men. This meant that her run could be called a time trial, rather than a race against the men. Greig was followed round the course by an ambulance. Her time of 3:27:45 was recorded and published and later recognised as a world best performance by the IAAF. Greig held the world's best title until New Zealander Mildred Sampson set a new mark nearly three months later. ==Other races== Greig was the first woman to run two ultramarathons. In 1971 she ran the Isle of Man 40 mile race, finishing in 6:48:00. The race did not officially admit women until 1982. In 1972, she became the first woman to run the 55-mile London-to-Brighton race, finishing in 8:30:04. Women were not officially admitted to the race until 1979. In 1971, Greig ran the Ben Nevis fell race, again unofficially. She finished in 3:02:02. In 1974, at the age of 37, she won the first International Masters Marathon for women, at the World Veterans' Championships in Paris, with a time of 3:45:21. In 1976, she competed in the World Veterans' Marathon in Coventry finishing 10th woman in 3:39:44. Greig's competitive running career came to an end in 1982, following an accident in a swimming pool in which she injured both her feet. ==Athletics administration== Greig's life was dedicated to athletics, particularly to women's running and later, veterans' running. In 1960, she was one of the founders of the Scottish Women's Cross County Union. Over the next decade, she served as its Secretary, then Treasurer and later as President. Along with Walter Ross, Greig was a member of the Organising Executive when the IGAL Veterans World Championships came to Glasgow in 1980. The event was supported by the city council and was a huge success with hundreds of runners from 26 countries running in the 10k and marathon races. Greig served as IGAL Assistant Secretary from 1982-87.

He is a former post-Chief of Staff to former U.S. President Richard Nixon, and served as the Executive Director of the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace Foundation. Taylor had served as director of the privately owned and funded Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace prior to it joining the federal presidential libraries system, and becoming the Richard Nixon Presidential Library. Taylor was ordained as an Episcopal priest, and served as the Vicar of St. John's Episcopal Church and School, located in Rancho Santa Margarita, Orange County, California. Until being elected Bishop Coadjutor. In December 2016, he was elected to serve as Bishop Coadjutor of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. In 2017 he succeeded J. Jon Bruno as bishop upon his retirement. ==Early life and career== Born in Detroit, Michigan, Taylor held a position as a newspaper reporter. He later moved to California and worked for former President Richard Nixon in 1979. He became the former president's post-Chief of Staff in 1984, and served in that role until 1990. Taylor married Kathy O'Connor in 2002. O'Conner had served as Nixon's post-Chief of Staff from 1990 until the former president's death in 1994. ==Director of the Nixon Library== Taylor was appointed Director of the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace while still working for the former president. His tenure consisted of the growth and expansion of the library, as well as the fostering and preservation of Richard Nixon's presidential legacy. In 1999, Taylor sought to enhance the former's president's image when he authorized the release of 124 Nixon-era White House tapes regarding the Watergate scandal and Nixon's involvement in it. Taylor acknowledged, \\"The entire record of Watergate needs to be viewed through the prism of [the] Vietnam [War]... Richard Nixon was a war-time president. He will still be criticized for his actions but the criticism will be fairer when viewed in that light.\\" A controversy erupted in 1996, however, between Taylor and President Nixon's daughters Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower. Taylor had requested that control of the library be taken from the Nixon family and placed with a 24-member board of directors. Both sisters were opposed, although Julie Nixon Eisenhower changed her position and supported Taylor's notion; control was eventually granted to Taylor after a legal battle. During that period, a plan to reunite the president's scattered records was undertaken, but largely fell apart due to a court case regarding a $14 million donation from a close friend of President and Mrs. Nixon, Bebe Rebozo. This issue would be resolved, however, beginning in 2003, when the United States Congress voted to repeal a law that prevented President Nixon and his family from controlling presidential records dating from 1969 to 1974. Taylor labeled it as \\"a first step in abolishing the anomaly\\" of Richard Nixon being the only president between Herbert Hoover and Bill Clinton without a government-operated library. During his time as director, Taylor was paid $145,500 in 2000, the highest of any director of a presidential library. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's grandson, and son-in-law to President Nixon David Eisenhower said of Taylor's job performance, \\"It's a very well-run library, and John Taylor is a phenomenal director.\\" ===Nixon Library Foundation=== Taylor served as director of the library until July 11, 2007, when the National Archives and Records Administration took full control of the Richard Nixon Library; this included replacing Taylor as director with Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian. As Executive Director of the Foundation, Taylor's position remained similar to that of which he previously held, although the foundation is only responsible for Nixon's pre- and post- presidential papers, library grounds, and event space; the National Archives controls the exhibits themselves. Taylor announced his resignation in February 2009.http://www.nixonlibraryfoundation.org/index.php?src=news&srctype;=detail&category;=News%2C%20Reviews%20%26%20Commentary&refno;=208 ==Pastoral work== Taylor was ordained as an Episcopal priest in January 2004, after studying at the Episcopal Theological School at Claremont. He was subsequently named Vicar of St. John's Episcopal Church and School of Rancho Santa Margarita, California, in 2004 by the Right Reverend J. Jon Bruno.

Green was the favourite to win the 1912 Polytechnic Marathon, a race that also served as \\"England's tryouts for the Olympic games\\", but finished third behind James Corkery of Canada and Christian Gitsham of South Africa. During the 1912 Summer Olympics, he finished fourteenth in the marathon.http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1912/1912.pdf In May 1913 Green broke the world marathon record at a track in Shepherds Bush, with a time of 2h, 38m, 16.2s. Green's record lasted nineteen days. On 31 May 1913, Alexis Ahlgren of Sweden eclipsed Green's mark with a 2:36:06 performance at the Polytechnic Marathon.http://www.ianridpath.com/polymarathon/1913Timesreport.jpg Green worked at Harrods until he signed up as a private during World War I. He was decorated with the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the French M√©daille militaire for his service in the Gallipoli Campaign. Commissioned on the battlefield, he left the army with the rank of Captain. After the war he ran a newsagents shop in Knights Hill, West Norwood and did not actively participate in major competitions. Green died of pneumonia in 1934. He was cremated at West Norwood Cemetery. ==External links== *Profile at www.sports-reference.com ==References== Category:1886 births Category:1934 deaths Category:Burials at West Norwood Cemetery Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1912 Summer Olympics Category:World record setters in athletics (track and field) Category:Olympic athletes of Great Britain Category:British male marathon runners Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:British Army officers Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Conduct Medal Category:British Army soldiers ","title":"Harry Green (athlete)"},{"id":"17317796","text":"\\"The Smile That Wins\\" is a short story by the British comic writer P. G. Wodehouse. A part of the Mr. Mulliner series, the story was first published in the United States, in the October 1931 issue of The American Magazine. It was subsequently published in the United Kingdom in the February 1932 issue of The Strand Magazine.PG Wodehouse Society (UK) information sheet It was collected in Mulliner Nights (1933).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 63‚Äì64, A48. The story features Adrian Mulliner, who also appears in a short story that is not narrated by Mr Mulliner, \\"From a Detective's Notebook\\" (1959). ==Plot== Adrian Mulliner, a private detective, falls in love with Lady Millicent Shipton-Bellinger, the daughter of the fifth Earl of Brangbolton who has a horror of detectives ever since Millicent's Uncle Joe's troubles in 1928. The father insists that Millicent must marry Sir Jasper Addleton, the financier. Heartbroken, Adrian has a bad attack of dyspepsia (he suffers from the disease and it was the melancholic dyspeptic look that first attracted Millicent) and a doctor advises him that the best cure for dyspepsia is to smile. Adrian, who hasn't smiled since he was twelve (\\"I saw the butler trip on a spaniel and upset the melted butter all over Aunt Elizabeth\\"), has a sinister-looking smile that seems to say 'I know all' and causes a great deal of nervousness amongst people with something to hide. A kleptomaniac Baronet helping himself to a fish slice at a wedding is his first victim and Adrian finds himself invited to the Baronet's country home where he finds the Fifth Earl of Brangbolton in residence. After he solves the case of the missing soap (it had shot out of the Earl's hands while he was singing \\"Sonny Boy\\") he unleashes his smile on Sir Jasper Addleton who, guilty like all financiers, hands him a cheque for a hundred thousand pounds. With this hundred thousand pounds in hand, and the unfortunate effect of the smile on the Earl just as the Earl was cheating at cards, Adrian gets the Earl's blessing to marry Millicent. ==Publication history== In The American Magazine, the story was illustrated by Roy F.

He holds the dubious distinction of having played in the most teams to be relegated and then subsequently disbanded from the top tier of Chinese football. ==Club career== ===Bayi Football Team=== Li Kun started his professional football career in 2001 at top tier military club Bayi Football Team after graduating from their youth team. He initially started out as a striker and would go on to make eight league appearances within his debut season. The following season would see Li progress to become a squad regular within the team while the club experienced a disappointing season and finished thirteenth within the league. By the 2003 league season Bayi were struggling to adopt to the financial requirements required for full professionalism within Chinese football and when the team experienced relegation at the end of the season the club was disbanded. ===Xiamen Lanshi=== Li Kun transferred to second tier football club Xiamen Lanshi at the beginning of the 2004 football league season and under the club's Head coach Gao Hongbo, Li was moved into the team's defense. The move would turn out to be a big success and during his first season with Xiamen he would help guide the club to a third-place finish, while in his second season with the club he would play a significant role in the club's division title win and promotion to the Chinese Super League at the end of the 2005 league campaign. In his return into the top tier Li would go on to play a vital part within Xiamen's mid-table eighth-place finish at the end of the 2006 Chinese Super League campaign. At the beginning of the 2007 Chinese Super League season the club's influential manager Gao Hongbo would leave the team to join Changchun Yatai F.C. and Xiamen were unable to recover from this, which then lead to the club's relegation and subsequent disbanding at the end of the season after the club's backers were unable to recoup their losses from the relegation. ===Wuhan Guanggu=== He would transfer to Wuhan Guanggu the following season where he was unable to establish himself within the squad. He would see Wuhan get relegated and was allowed to leave at the end of the season. Second tier club Anhui Jiufang took Li Kun on at the beginning of the 2009 league season, however he would suffer an ankle injury during the season and would miss a significant part of the league season. When he returned the following season the club finished the league ninth, however the club would be taken over at the end of the season by Tianjin Runyulong F.C. and when the club had the chance to merge him into their team they declined that option. ==Honours== Xiamen Lanshi *China League One: 2005 == References == == External links == * Player profile at Sina.com Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese footballers Category:Footballers from Beijing Category:Bayi Football Team players Category:Xiamen Blue Lions players Category:Wuhan Guanggu players Category:Anhui Jiufang players Category:Chinese Super League players Category:China League One players Category:Association football defenders Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Li Kun"},{"id":"17317817","text":"Task allocation and partitioning is the way that tasks are chosen, assigned, subdivided, and coordinated within a colony of social insects. Task allocation and partitioning gives rise to the division of labor often observed in social insect colonies, whereby individuals specialize on different tasks within the colony (e.g., \\"foragers\\", \\"nurses\\"). Communication is closely related to the ability to allocate tasks among individuals within a group. This entry focuses exclusively on social insects. For information on human task allocation and partitioning, see division of labour, task analysis, and workflow. ==Definitions== * Task allocation \\"... is the process that results in specific workers being engaged in specific tasks, in numbers appropriate to the current situation. [It] operates without any central or hierarchical control...\\" The concept of task allocation is individual-centric. It focuses on decisions by individuals about what task to perform. However, different biomathematical models give different weights to inter-individual interactions vs. environmental stimuli. * Task partitioning is the division of one task into sequential actions done by more than one individual. The focus here is on the task, and its division, rather than on the individuals performing it. For example, \\"hygienic behavior\\" is a task in which worker bees uncap and remove diseased brood cells that may be affected by American foulbrood (Paenibacillus larvae) or the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. In this case, individual bees often focus on either uncapping or removing diseased brood. Therefore, the task is partitioned, and performed by multiple individuals. ==Introduction== Social living provides a multitude of advantages to its practitioners, including predation risk reduction, environmental buffering, food procurement, and possible mating advantages. The most advanced form of sociality is eusociality, characterized by overlapping generations, cooperative care of the young, and reproductive division of labor, which includes sterility or near- sterility of the overwhelming majority of colony members. With few exceptions, all the practitioners of eusociality are insects of the orders Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps), Isoptera (termites), Thysanoptera (thrips), and Hemiptera (aphids). Social insects have been extraordinarily successful ecologically and evolutionarily. This success has at its most pronounced produced colonies 1) having a persistence many times the lifespan of most individuals of the colony, and 2) numbering thousands or even millions of individuals. Social insects can exhibit division of labor with respect to non- reproductive tasks, in addition to the aforementioned reproductive one. In some cases this takes the form of markedly different, alternative morphological development (polymorphism), as in the case of soldier castes in ants, termites, thrips, and aphids, while in other cases it is age-based (temporal polyethism), as with honey bee foragers, who are the oldest members of the colony (with the exception of the queen). Evolutionary biologists are still debating the fitness-advantage gained by social insects due to their advanced division of labor and task allocation, but hypotheses include: increased resilience against a fluctuating environment, reduced energy costs of continuously switching tasks, increased longevity of the colony as a whole, or reduced rate of pathogen transmission. Division of labor, large colony sizes, temporally-changing colony needs, and the value of adaptability and efficiency under Darwinian competition, all form a theoretical basis favoring the existence of evolved communication in social insects. Beyond the rationale, there is well-documented empirical evidence of communication related to tasks; examples include the waggle dance of honey bee foragers, trail marking by ant foragers such as the red harvester ants, and the propagation via pheromones of an alarm state in Africanized honey bees. ==Worker Polymorphism== One of the most well known mechanisms of task allocation is worker polymorphism, where workers within a colony have morphological differences. This difference in size is determined by the amount of food workers are fed as larvae, and is set once workers emerge from their pupae. Workers may vary just in size (monomorphism) or size and bodily proportions (allometry). An excellent example of the monomorphism is in bumblebees (Bombus spp.). Bumblebee workers display a large amount of body size variation which is normally distributed. The largest workers may be ten times the mass of the smallest workers. Worker size is correlated with several tasks: larger workers tend to forage, while smaller workers tend to perform brood care and nest thermoregulation. Size also affects task efficiency. Larger workers are better at learning, have better vision, carry more weight, and fly at a greater range of temperatures. However, smaller workers are more resistant to starvation. In other eusocial insects as well, worker size can determine what polymorphic role they become. For instance, larger workers in Myrmecocystus mexicanus (a North America species of honeypot ant) tend to become repletes, or workers so engorged with food that they become immobile and act a living food storage for the rest of the colonies. In many ants and termites, on the other hand, workers vary in both size and bodily proportions, which have a bimodal distribution. This is present in approximately one in six ant genera. In most of these there are two developmentally distinct pathways, or castes, into which workers can develop. Typically members of the smaller caste are called minors and members of the larger caste are called majors or soldiers. There is often variation in size within each caste. The term soldiers may be apt, as in Cephalotes, but in many species members of the larger caste act primarily as foragers or food processors. In a few ant species, such as certain Pheidole species, there is a third caste, called supersoldiers. ==Temporal polyethism== Temporal polyethism is a mechanism of task allocation, and is ubiquitous among eusocial insect colonies. Tasks in a colony are allocated among workers based on their age. Newly emerged workers perform tasks within the nest, such as brood care and nest maintenance, and progress to tasks outside the nest, such as foraging, nest defense, and corpse removal as they age. In honeybees, the youngest workers exclusively clean cells, which is then followed by tasks related to brood care and nest maintenance from about 2‚Äì11 days of age. From 11‚Äì 20 days, they transition to receiving and storing food from foragers, and at about 20 days workers begin to forage. Similar temporal polyethism patterns can be seen in primitive species of wasps, such as Ropalidia marginata as well as the eusocial wasp Vespula germanica. Young workers feed larvae, and then transition to nest building tasks, followed by foraging. Many species of ants also display this pattern. This pattern is not rigid, though. Workers of certain ages have strong tendencies to perform certain tasks, but may perform other tasks if there is enough need. For instance, removing young workers from the nest will cause foragers, especially younger foragers, to revert to tasks such as caring for brood. These changes in task preference are caused by epigenetic changes over the life of the individual. Honeybee workers of different ages show substantial differences in DNA methylation, which causes differences in gene expression. Reverting foragers to nurses by removing younger workers causes changes in DNA methylation similar to younger workers. Temporal polyethism is not adaptive because of maximized efficiency; indeed older workers are actually more efficient at brood care than younger workers in some ant species. Rather it allows workers with the lowest remaining life expectancy to perform the most dangerous tasks. Older workers tend to perform riskier tasks, such as foraging, which has high risks of predation and parasitism, while younger workers perform less dangerous tasks, such as brood care. If workers experience injuries, which shortens their life expectancies, they will start foraging sooner than healthy workers of the same age. ==Response-Threshold Model== A dominant theory of explaining the self-organized division of labor in social insect societies such as honey bee colonies is the Response- Threshold Model. It predicts that individual worker bees have inherent thresholds to stimuli associated with different tasks. Individuals with the lowest thresholds will preferentially perform that task. Stimuli could include the ‚Äúsearch time‚Äù that elapses while a foraging bee waits to unload her nectar and pollen to a receiver bee at the hive, the smell of diseased brood cells, or any other combination of environmental inputs that an individual worker bee encounters. The Response-Threshold Model only provides for effective task allocation in the honey bee colony if thresholds are varied among individual workers. This variation originates from the considerable genetic diversity among worker daughters of a colony due to the queen‚Äôs multiple matings. ==Network representation of information flow and task allocation== To explain how colony-level complexity arises from the interactions of several autonomous individuals, a network-based approach has emerged as a promising area of social insect research. Social insect colonies can be viewed as a self- organized network, in which interacting elements (i.e. nodes) communicate with each other. As decentralized networks, colonies are capable of distributing information rapidly which facilitates robust responsiveness to their dynamic environments. The efficiency of information flow is critical for colony-level flexibility because worker behavior is not controlled by a centralized leader but rather is based on local information. Social insect networks are often non-randomly distributed, wherein a few individuals act as ‚Äòhubs,‚Äô having disproportionately more connections to other nestmates than other workers in the colony. In harvester ants, the total interactions per ant during recruitment for outside work is right-skewed, meaning that some ants are more highly connected than others. Computer simulations of this particular interaction network demonstrated that inter-individual variation in connectivity patterns expedites information flow among nestmates. Task allocation within a social insect colony can be modeled using a network-based approach, in which workers are represented by nodes, which are connected by edges that signify inter-node interactions. Workers performing a common task form highly connected clusters, with weaker links across tasks. These weaker, cross-task connections are important for allowing task-switching to occur between clusters. This approach is potentially problematic because connections between workers are not permanent, and some information is broadcast globally, e.g. through pheromones, and therefore does not rely on interaction networks. One alternative approach to avoid this pitfall is to treat tasks as nodes and workers as fluid connections. To demonstrate how time and space constraints of individual-level interactions affect colony function, social insect network approaches can also incorporate spatiotemporal dynamics. These effects can impose upper bounds to information flow rate in the network. For example, the rate of information flow through Temnothorax rugatulus ant colonies is slower than would be predicted if time spent traveling and location within the nest were not considered. In Formica fusca L. ant colonies, a network analysis of spatial effects on feeding and the regulation of food storage revealed that food is distributed heterogeneously within colony, wherein heavily loaded workers are located centrally within the nest and those storing less food were located at the periphery. Studies of inter-nest pheromone trail networks maintained by super-colonies of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) have shown that different colonies establish networks with very similar topologies. Insights from these analyses revealed that these networks ‚Äì which are used to guide workers transporting brood, workers and food between nests ‚Äì are formed through a pruning process, in which individual ants initially create a complex network of trails, which are then refined to eliminate extraneous edges, resulting in a shorter, more efficient inter-nest network. Long-term stability of interaction networks has been demonstrated in Odontomachus hastatus ants, in which initially highly connected ants remain highly connected over an extended time period. Conversely, Temnothorax rugatulus ant workers are not persistent in their interactive role, which might suggest that social organization is regulated differently among different eusocial species. A network is pictorially represented as a graph, but can equivalently be represented as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix. Traditionally, workers are the nodes of the graph, but Fewell prefers to make the tasks the nodes, with workers as the links. O'Donnell has coined the term \\"worker connectivity\\" to stand for \\"communicative interactions that link a colony's workers in a social network and affect task performance\\". He has pointed out that connectivity provides three adaptive advantages compared to individual direct perception of needs: # It increases both the physical and temporal reach of information. With connectivity, information can travel farther and faster, and additionally can persist longer, including both direct persistence (i.e. through pheromones), memory effects, and by initiating a sequence of events. # It can help overcome task inertia and burnout, and push workers into performing hazardous tasks. For reasons of indirect fitness, this latter stimulus should not be necessary if all workers in the colony are highly related genetically, but that is not always the case. # Key individuals may possess superior knowledge, or have catalytic roles. Examples, respectively, are a sentry who has detected an intruder, or the colony queen. O'Donnell provides a comprehensive survey, with examples, of factors that have a large bearing on worker connectivity. They include: * graph degree * size of the interacting group, especially if the network has a modular structure * sender distribution (i.e. a small number of controllers vs. numerous senders) * strength of the interaction effect, which includes strength of the signal sent, recipient sensitivity, and signal persistence (i.e. pheromone signal vs. sound waves) * recipient memory, and its decay function * socially-transmitted inhibitory signals, as not all interactions provide positive stimulus * specificity of both the signal and recipient response * signal and sensory modalities, and activity and interaction rates ==Task taxonomy and complexity== Anderson, Franks, and McShea have broken down insect tasks (and subtasks) into a hierarchical taxonomy; their focus is on task partitioning and its complexity implications. They classify tasks as individual, group, team, or partitioned; classification of a task depends on whether there are multiple vs. individual workers, whether there is division of labor, and whether subtasks are done concurrently or sequentially. Note that in their classification, in order for an action to be considered a task, it must contribute positively to inclusive fitness; if it must be combined with other actions to achieve that goal, it is considered to be a subtask. In their simple model, they award 1, 2, or 3 points to the different tasks and subtasks, depending on its above classification. Summing all tasks and subtasks point values down through all levels of nesting allows any task to be given a score that roughly ranks relative complexity of actions. See also the review of task partitioning by Ratnieks and Anderson. ==Note: model-building== All models are simplified abstractions of the real-life situation. There exists a basic tradeoff between model precision and parameter precision. A fixed amount of information collected, will, if split amongst the many parameters of an overly precise model, result in at least some of the parameters being represented by inadequate sample sizes. Because of the often limited quantities and limited precision of data from which to calculate parameters values in non-human behavior studies, such models should generally be kept simple. Therefore, we generally should not expect models for social insect task allocation or task partitioning to be as elaborate as human workflow ones, for example. ==Metrics for division of labor== With increased data, more elaborate metrics for division of labor within the colony become possible. Gorelick and Bertram survey the applicability of metrics taken from a wide range of other fields. They argue that a single output statistic is desirable, to permit comparisons across different population sizes and different numbers of tasks. But they also argue that the input to the function should be a matrix representation (of time spent by each individual on each task), in order to provide the function with better data. They conclude that \\"... normalized matrix-input generalizations of Shannon's and Simpson's index ... should be the indices of choice when one wants to simultaneously examine division of labor amongst all individuals in a population\\". Note that these indexes, used as metrics of biodiversity, now find a place measuring division of labor. ==See also== * Patterns of self-organization in ants * Network theory ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:Behavioral ecology Category:Superorganisms Category:Insect behavior ","title":"Task allocation and partitioning of social insects"},{"id":"17317886","text":"Samuel Eldred Greenlee, Jr. (July 13, 1930 ‚Äì May 19, 2014)Margaret Busby, \\"Sam Greenlee obituary\\", The Guardian, June 2, 2014. was an American writer.

Track and Field News's Pathe Highlights of Norton's 200 world record at the Penn Relays In 1960, Norton carried on his impressive form of the previous year by tying four world records: he equalled the 220 y record of 20.6 s in Berkeley on March 19; equalled again the 100 y record of 9.3 s in San Jose on April 2; equalled the 200 m record of 20.6 s in Philadelphia on April 30; and equalled the newly set record for the 200 m of 20.5 s in Stanford on July 2. He qualified for the 100 and 200 at the 1960 Olympics by coming first in both events at the United States Olympic Trials, equalling the world record in the process in the 200 m. However, his form at the Olympics itself deserted him, most probably because of nerves, and he finished a disappointing last in both the 100 and 200 m finals. Norton's failure on Thursday September 1 in the 100 m was one of such disasters that befell American favorites that day and the day was to become known as 'Black Thursday'. He tried to make amends for his failures in the individual events in the 4 √ó 100 m relay. The team of Frank Budd, Norton, Stone Johnson and Dave Sime finished first in a world record time of 39.4 s but were disqualified because at the first exchange from Budd to Norton, Norton started too early and the exchange happened outside the changeover box.

Due to the methods of existentialism, prescriptive or declarative statements about meaning are unjustified. The root of the word \\"meaning\\" is \\"mean\\", which is the way someone or something is conveyed, interpreted, or represented. Each individual has his or her own form of unique perspective; meaning is, therefore, purely subjective. Meaning is the way something is understood by an individual; in turn, this subjective meaning is also how the individual may identify it. Meaning is the personal significance of something physical or abstract. This would include the assigning of value(s) to such significance. ==Kierkegaard== For Kierkegaard, meaning does not equal knowledge, although both are important. Meaning, for Kierkegaard, is a lived experience, a quest to find one's values, beliefs, and purpose in a meaningless world. As a Christian, Kierkegaard finds his meaning in the Word of God, but for those who are not Christian, Kierkegaard wishes them well in their search.Kierkegaard, S. The Essential Kierkegaard, Eds. Howard and Edna Hong. Princeton, 2000. P. 10. ==Sartre== \\"Existence precedes essence\\" means that humans exist first before they have meaning in life. Meaning is not given, and must be achieved. With objects‚Äîsay, a knife, for example‚Äîthere is some creator who conceives of an idea or purpose of an object, and then creates it with the essence of the object already present. The essence of what the knife will be exists before the actual knife itself. Sartre, who was an atheist, believed that if there is no God to have conceived of our essence or nature, then we must come into existence first, and then create our own essence out of interaction with our surroundings and ourselves. With this come serious implications of self- responsibility over who we are and what our lives mean. For this reason, meaning is something without representation or bearing in anything or anyone else.

(XHHC-FM would later restore the 92.1 frequency to use in Ensenada.) By 2005, XHBCE was broadcasting a Spanish-language talk format known as La Pantera, embroiled in an interference dispute with KXRS in Hemet, California that threatened to cut off the station's access to programming delivered from the United States under FCC authorization.

LoveLikeFire has received significant media and critical coverage in San Francisco Bay Area publications (San Francisco magazine, East Bay Express, SFist, SF Weekly, Palo Alto Daily News, San Francisco Chronicle) as well as in the national and out-of-town media (Spin, The A.V. Club, LimeWire Music Blog, WOXY.com, LA Weekly), and has stylistically been identified as exhibiting Britpop, dream pop, indie pop, and shoegazing influences. == Career == The group considers itself to have officially formed in January 2006, when its first lineup came together. Vocalist Ann Yu and drummer/keyboardist David Farrell, who had previously played together in several bands, were preparing to relocate to Los Angeles, California because, according to Yu, \\"it's a lot easier to find other musicians that are serious about making a career out of [music]\\" there. The move was abruptly canceled as the band began to form. Bassist and friend Jesse Hayes became available when his punk rock band Time in Malta split up; then, in January, Yu and Farrell met guitarist Ted Parker through a Craigslist classified advertisement. A few weeks later, the band played its first gig in Los Angeles. The group released its first recording on August 15, 2006, only seven months after having formed. According to Yu, the six-track EP Bed of Gold was recorded before LoveLikeFire had \\"fully developed its identity as a band.\\" Nevertheless, the album received critical praise from The A.V. Club San Francisco, LA Weekly, and the East Bay Express. The group continued touring, performing alongside bands such as Morningwood, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, and Favourite Sons. LoveLikeFire live in Portland, Oregon, March 27, 2008. The band followed its debut album with the seven-track sophomore effort An Ocean in the Air, which was released on August 28, 2007. The record brought further critical praise from publications such as Spin and SF Weekly, and made several best-of-2007 album or single lists, including associate producer Andrew Ross Rowe at MTV News and Muhammad Asranur at Ground Control Mag. The band recorded music videos for three of the album's tracks, \\"Wish You Dead,\\" \\"From a Tower,\\" and \\"I Will\\". The latter, a carnival-themed music video shot on 16 mm film and produced by Thomas Barndt and Samara St. Croix (Tom and Samara), was chosen as an Official Selection of SXSW 2008 Film Festival. Robert Kissinger replaced original bassist Jesse Hayes in mid-2007. The group followed up the release of An Ocean in the Air with a self-organized and self-financed national tour. In October 2008, Kissinger and guitarist Ted Parker were replaced by Eric Amerman and Marty Mattern, respectively. The band released a full-length album Tear Ourselves Away on August 10, 2009 on Heist Or Hit Records (The Answering Machine, Pomegranates) in the UK to some good press Two rough demos, \\"Signs\\" and \\"William\\", were released in May 2008 on the band's MySpace profile as an indication of \\"songs we'll be working on for the full length\\". A single for the song \\"William\\" was released on April 6, 2009 in the UK. Following this the tracks Stand In Your Shoes and Boredom were released in the UK. The band have toured twice in the UK playing all over the country. The latest album was promoted on another nationwide tour. The album was released in America in early 2010 LoveLikeFire New Album Launch Show March 10, 2010 and promoted with a full tour. == Style and influences == The band's style has been described as indie rock as well as shoegazing, Britpop, power pop, alternative rock, indie pop, and dream pop. Ann Yu's singing style has invited comparisons to Bianca Leilani Casady (CocoRosie), Beth Gibbons (Portishead), Shirley Manson (Garbage), Karen O (Yeah Yeah Yeahs), Emily Haines (Metric), Dolores O'Riordan (The Cranberries), and PJ Harvey. The band members' stated influences include Curve, Radiohead, Ride, Blonde Redhead, The Beatles, Siouxsie and the Banshees, U2, Echo & the Bunnymen, New Order, My Bloody Valentine, and Arcade Fire. Other suggestions of stylistic similarity have included Pixies (Bossanova and Trompe le Monde), The Cure, Rilo Kiley, Lush, Echobelly, Giant Drag, Land of Talk, Muse, The Stills, The National, Pink Floyd, The Dandy Warhols, and Dinosaur Jr.. ==Discography== * Bed of Gold (2006) * An Ocean in the Air (2007) * Tear Ourselves Away (August 10, 2009) * Dust (2011) ==Side projects== Ann Yu is in a band called Silver Swans with Jon Waters which released an album called Realize The Ghost in 2010 on San Francisco Independent Label, Tricycle Records. ==References== == External links == * LoveLikeFire.com * LoveLikeFire MySpace * Category:Indie rock musical groups from California Category:Musical groups established in 2006 Category:Musical groups from San Francisco ","title":"LoveLikeFire"},{"id":"17318331","text":"1984-85 Hong Kong FA Cup was the 11th staging of the Hong Kong FA Cup.

It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964. ==Description== The Walker Gilmore Site is a deeply stratified archaeological site on a terrace above Sterns Creek in eastern Cass County. The area consists of repeated habitation layers, interspersed with materials washed down from the hillside above. Finds at the site include evidence of dwelling lodges using poles as support and finished in wattle and daub or bark, as well as a diversity of tools, tool-making artifacts, pottery, and remnants of dietary plants and animals. Radiocarbon dating has yielded occupation dates as late as 1100 CE. One particular set of post-holes are unusually small, and have been interpreted as possibly supporting a rack-like structure for drying meat. The Walker Gilmore Site was found in 1915 by Walker Gilmore, the son of a local physician, who then informed archaeologist Frederick Sterns, then doing graduate field research in Nebraska. It was the first site in the state where evidence of a pre-village culture was identified. Sterns also made key observations about the nature of the terrain, leading to the conclusion that the streambed above which the site lies was probably wider at the time of the site's occupation. In the 1930s, William Duncan Strong investigated the site further, and connected its inhabitants to Woodland cultures of the northeastern United States. ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in Nebraska ==References== Category:National Historic Landmarks in Nebraska Category:Buildings and structures in Cass County, Nebraska Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Nebraska Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cass County, Nebraska ","title":"Walker Gilmore Site"},{"id":"17318362","text":"Harold French (23 April 1897 - 19 October 1997) was an English film director, screenwriter and actor. ==Biography== After training at the Italia Conti School, he made his acting debut age 12, in a production of The Winter's Tale.

It was the location of a village of the Kitkehahki band of the Pawnee people, in a region of the Republican River valley that they occupied intermittently from the 1770s to the 1820s. In 1806, the village was visited by a Spanish expedition led by Lieutenant Facundo Melgares and, soon after, by an American expedition led by Lieutenant Zebulon Pike. At the village, Pike persuaded the Pawnee leaders to haul down a Spanish flag that they had received from Melgares, and to raise the flag of the United States in its stead. The location of the village visited by Pike was not known for many years. In the early 20th century, two sites were proposed: this one in Nebraska, and one in Republic County in northern Kansas. A dispute between the historical societies of the two states ensued, titled \\"The War Between Nebraska and Kansas\\". The dispute was eventually resolved in favor of the Nebraska site. Investigations conducted at the site by William Duncan Strong, Waldo Wedel, and A. T. Hill were instrumental in the development of Great Plains archaeology, and of Pawnee archaeology in particular. The site is a National Historic Landmark, and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. ==Description== Pa-hur in 2010 The site lies on a terrace on the Republican River's south side, near the village of Guide Rock. At the terrace's north edge is a near-vertical bank; the floodplain of the river extends about one-fourth mile (about one-half kilometer) from the bank's base to the present channel. The remains of over 100 earth lodges lie on the terrace between the bank and hills to the south, which rise above the site. On the hills are five cemeteries. The village complex also includes a council site and two open courts where a hoop game was played. The village extended for at least from east to west. On its east and west sides were creeks, now dry, that ran northward into the Republican. At the time of the village's occupation, springs in the western creek flowed year-round; these would have provided a more convenient source of water than the river, since access to the latter was hampered by the steep bank. The springs ceased to flow at some time after the land came under cultivation in the 1870s. Not far downstream from the site is a hill known to the Pawnees as Pa-hur, or \\"hill that points the way\\". In the traditional Pawnee religion, this was one of five lodges of the nahurac, spirit animals with supernatural healing powers. ==History 1770‚Äì1806== ===The Southern Pawnees move north=== The ancestors of the modern Pawnee people were not a single unified tribe. At the middle of the 18th century, they consisted of two major groups. The Skidis, or Wolf Pawnees, had migrated northward with the Arikaras, and had probably been in Nebraska since 1600 or earlier. By the beginning of the 18th century, they were established on the Loup River, which flows through central Nebraska into the Platte River from the north. Alejandro O'Reilly The second major division of the ancestral Pawnees was the Southern, or Black Pawnees. Their migration history is not well documented; but by 1750 they, with the related and allied Wichitas, had established what seemed to be a secure territory on the Arkansas River. The security of the southern bands depended on French trade in arms, and this was disrupted by the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì63). In 1763, France surrendered the Louisiana Territory under the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau. Great Britain obtained the portion of the territory east of the Mississippi River. Spain received the territory west of the Mississippi, including New Orleans, although they did not make their claim to that city effective until Governor Alejandro O'Reilly suppressed the Rebellion of 1768. Once in control of New Orleans, the Spanish imposed severe restrictions on trade up the Mississippi, cutting off the supply of arms to the Southern Pawnees and Wichitas. The neighboring Osages were not so affected, as they had access to arms smuggled by French traders from British territory in present-day Illinois. With superior weaponry, they drove between the Southern Pawnees and the Wichitas, pushing the latter group southward to the Red River. The Pawnees moved northward into Nebraska, possibly because of news that modern weapons were available from traders on the Platte. The dates of the moves are not known exactly. The Wichita move from the Arkansas to the Red occurred at some time between 1768 and 1772. The Osages occupied the former Pawnee-Wichita hunting grounds on the Arkansas in 1774, indicating that the Pawnees had left by then; in 1777, a Spanish report indicated that they were in Nebraska. The Southern Pawnees were divided into three bands: the Chauis, or Grand Pawnees; the Pitahawiratas, or Tappage Pawnees; and the Kitkehahkis, or Republican Pawnees. The Chauis were regarded as the nominal leaders, and in the traditional account they led the migration to Nebraska, followed by the Pitahawiratas. However, the Kitkehahkis declined to follow the Chaui chiefs to their new settlements on the Platte; instead, they established themselves on the Republican River, near what is now the Nebraska-Kansas border. ===Occupation history=== There is much debate among historians and archaeologists concerning the dates of occupation of the Webster County village. Four Kitkehahki village sites on the Republican are known, two of them quite large: this one, and the Pawnee Indian Village Site near Republic, Kansas, downstream. The band inhabited the Republican valley intermittently from the 1770s to the 1820s. Unfortunately, there is little information on which villages were occupied at what times, although there is a strong consensus that this village is the one visited by Pike in 1806. The following account, therefore, can only describe what is known about Kitkehahki occupation and abandonment of the Republican valley, and not the history of this particular village. Pawnee earth lodge in Nebraska, 1873 The Pawnees did not live in their villages year-round. In the spring, they planted and hoed crops near their villages. In mid-June, they left on their summer buffalo hunt. In September, they returned to harvest the crops and to hold their harvest festival; they then cached a portion of their food in their villages and left on the winter buffalo hunt, from which they did not return until planting time in the spring. Thus the villages were deserted for at least eight months of the year. The Kitkehahkis also moved, both in small groups and en masse, between the Republican and the Platte. The Pitahawiratas and the Chauis seem to have lived together amicably from the time of their arrival in Nebraska. However, the Kitkehahkis were divided between those who wanted to live independently on the Republican, and those who wanted to live near the Chauis on the Platte. The three bands frequently moved together on the summer and winter buffalo hunts, so there was regular contact between them. It was common for people to move from one household to another, especially upon returning from a buffalo hunt; this would have facilitated moves from village to village. At times, the entire Kitkehahki band abandoned the Republican and moved to the Platte. Generally, this took place in times of war, when the bands sought protection in numbers. Movement between the Republican and the Platte probably occurred continually until about 1825. ===War with the Skidis=== When the Southern Pawnees arrived in Nebraska, the Skidis were not pleased to see them on lands that they regarded as their own. Nevertheless, they were willing to accept them as neighbors, so long as they kept to the south side of the Platte. However, the Chaui leaders demanded that they be recognized as the heads of the entire Pawnee people, above the Skidi chiefs. They defied the Skidis by sending a large hunting party to Prairie Creek, on the north side of the Platte within sight of the Skidi villages on the Loup. The Skidis responded by attacking the Chaui hunters and driving them back across the Platte. The Chauis and Pitahawiratas resolved on war, and summoned the Kitkehahki fighters to join them against the Skidis; the Kitkehahkis, unwilling to leave their people unprotected against Skidi raids, left the Republican and moved to the Platte near the other bands. The conflict with the Skidis probably took place sometime between 1770 and 1775. It concluded with the defeat of the Skidis, who, although nominally conquered, remained on the Loup and continued to hunt separately from the other three bands. By 1777, the Kitkehahkis had moved back to the Republican. At some time between 1777 and 1785, the Kitkehahkis again abandoned and then re-occupied the Republican valley. A Spanish account of 1785 describes a village on the south side of the Platte in Butler County, not far from the modern town of Linwood, Nebraska; this village was occupied by the Kitkehahkis until about 1785, when they returned to the Republican. ===War with the Omahas=== War came to the Kitkehahkis on the Republican in 1798. The Omahas, under the leadership of Chief Blackbird, had become perhaps the most powerful group in Nebraska. They were located at the junction of the French trade route up the Missouri River and an overland route across northern Iowa whereby the Sac and Fox brought British arms and goods westward. This allowed them to levy tribute and exercise control over trade on the Missouri. During the height of their power in the late 1790s, bands of Omaha warriors frequently visited the Kitkehahkis to perform the calumet ceremony. This traditional peacemaking ritual had degenerated into what the Omahas called \\"smoking for horses\\": the Kitkehahkis were obliged to give feasts and presents of horses to their uninvited guests. In 1798, a group of Omahas under Little Grizzly Bear went for this purpose to the Republican. The Kitkehahkis, feeling imposed upon by the frequency of these visits, stripped and beat the Omahas and drove them out of the village. When Blackbird learned of this, he ordered an attack on the Kitkehahkis. The Omahas descended upon the band's village, burned and plundered many of the lodges, and killed about one hundred Pawnees at the cost of about fifteen of their own men. The remaining Kitkehahkis had withdrawn into four lodges, occupying a position too strong for the Omahas to reach them and massacre them without unacceptable losses. Whether the Republican valley was abandoned after the Omaha attack is not recorded. The invading Omahas had camped on the Platte, undisturbed by the Chauis, on their way to the Kitkehahkis; this might indicate that the two Pawnee bands were on bad terms at the time. The power of the Omahas was broken soon thereafter: in about 1801, a smallpox epidemic spread from the Skidis to the Omahas, killing half of the tribe, Blackbird among them. When the Lewis and Clark Expedition reached the Platte in 1804, they found the Kitkehahkis (whom they mistakenly called Arapahos) living there. They were told that the band had returned to the Republican about ten years before (that is, before the conflict with the Omahas), but had recently moved to the Platte under pressure from the Kanzas. By 1806, however, the Kitkehahkis were at peace with the Kanzas, and were once again living on the Republican. ==1806: Melgares and Pike== Under the 1800 Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain returned the Louisiana Territory to France. In connection with this transfer, France agreed not to sell the territory to a third party; French foreign minister Talleyrand had indicated that a strong French Louisiana would halt the expansion of Britain and the United States in the New World. Zebulon Pike Napoleon quickly reneged on this agreement. In the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, France sold the territory to the United States. This led to conflict between the latter nation and Spain. The Spanish contended that the sale of Louisiana to the United States was invalid, and that the territory had reverted to them. Although they were unable to prevent American occupation of New Orleans, they sought to check American activity west of the Mississippi River. Spain and the United States both sought allies among the Native Americans of the disputed territory. In June 1806, Lieutenant Facundo Melgares and 600 men were dispatched from the Spanish provincial capital of Santa Fe down the Red River and then northward into present-day Nebraska. Although no Spanish records of the Melgares expedition are known to exist, it is believed that its purpose was to find and arrest the Lewis and Clark party, and to establish alliances with the Native Americans of the region, including the Pawnees. About a month later, Lieutenant Zebulon Pike left St. Louis with an American party of 23 men, and orders to negotiate peace between the Kanzas and Osages, to contact the Comanches of the high plains, and to explore the headwaters of the Red and Arkansas Rivers. For guides and interpreters to the Comanches, Pike turned to the Pawnees; his Osage and Pawnee guides led him northwest through present-day Kansas toward the Kitkehahki village on the Republican. Melgares was the first to arrive at the village. His journey north had not been easy. Mutiny had broken out and been suppressed among his New Mexican militia; and many of his horses had gone lame, or had been stolen by Pawnee raiders. He had left 240 of his men on the Arkansas in southern Kansas before turning northward with the other half of his force. In the Republican village, he met with Kitkehahki and Chaui leaders, to whom he presented gifts, including Spanish flags. The Pawnees agreed to expel Americans from their territory, but also opposed the Melgares expedition's continuing to the Missouri River. In the face of this opposition, and with no supply lines and a force too large to live off the country, Melgares returned to the Arkansas and thence to Santa Fe. ===Pike at the village=== Pike's party reached the Kitkehahki village on September 25, 1806, shortly after Melgares's departure. Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the ranking chief, Sharitarish, who invited him to eat in his lodge and told him of Melgares's recent visit. The Pawnees presented eight horses to the Osages accompanying Pike, and members of the two tribes smoked pipes together. Pike's party established a camp fortified with rifle pits on a hill on the north bank of the Republican opposite the village. On the following day, a delegation of 12 Kanzas arrived at the village; on September 28, they held a council with the Osages. Pipes were smoked in token of peace between the tribes. On September 29, Pike held a \\"grand council\\" with the Pawnees. At this council, one of Melgares's Spanish flags was displayed at the chief's lodge. Pike urged the Pawnees to haul it down and replace it with that of the United States. When the Pawnee chiefs demurred, > ... I again reiterated the demand for the flag, adding \\"that it was > impossible for the nation to have two fathers; that they must either be the > children of the Spaniards, or acknowledge their American father\\". After a > silence of some time an old man rose, went to the door, took down the > Spanish flag, brought it and laid it at my feet; he then received the > American flag, and elevated it on the staff which had lately borne the > standard of his Catholic Majesty. This was favorably received by the Osages and Kanzas, but apparently caused distress to the Pawnees. Perceiving this, Pike returned the Spanish flag to them, asking only that they not fly it during his party's stay in the village. \\"At this, there was a general shout of applause ...\\" Pike had planned for the Pawnees to guide him to the Comanches. However, upon his arrival at the village, he was informed that the two tribes were at war. When Pike expressed his intention of continuing inland toward the headwaters of the Arkansas, Sharitarish urged him to turn back: he had prevented the Spanish from going further into American territory, and would likewise resist an American movement toward Spanish land. Pike refused to be intimidated. He told the chief > ... that the young warriors of his great American father were not women, to > be turned back by words; that I should therefore proceed, and if he thought > proper to stop me, he could attempt it; but that we were men, well armed, > and would sell our lives at a dear rate to his nation; that we knew our > great father would send his young warriors there to gather our bones and > revenge our deaths on his people ... The Pawnees relented, though unwillingly and with much dissent. Pike obtained horses from them, and set out on October 7. He ordered his party to stay in a compact body, with guns and bayonets and sabers at the ready; he estimated that \\"it would have cost them at least 100 men to have exterminated us\\". With no guides to the Comanches, he was forced to abandon that part of the mission; instead, he returned south into Kansas, where he attempted to follow Melgares's trail toward the Arkansas. ==1806‚Äì1833== Sharitarish was a Chaui who, at some time before 1805, had been involved in a struggle over the leadership of that band. In the course of this struggle, he had brought his clan to the Kitkehahki village on the Republican, where he had deposed Iskatappe, the hereditary chief of the Kitkehahki. Although the exact situation is not known, it is thought that Sharitarish was trying to bring the Kitkehahkis back to the Platte, to support his faction in the Chaui village. After 1806, the Spanish continued their efforts to win the friendship of the Pawnees. Messages were dispatched to the Pawnee chiefs, urging them to come to Santa Fe; and most of these messages went to Sharitarish. The fact that he received them while Long Hair, the Chaui head chief, was ignored, fed his self-importance. In 1809, in an ill-judged attempt to impress the Pawnees, he led the Kitkehahki to war with the Kanzas. By 1811 he had been defeated, and the Kitkehahkis had been forced to abandon the Republican and move to the Platte. There is no firm documentary evidence of occupation of the Webster County village after 1809. However, analysis of pottery and glass beads suggests that the site was re-occupied during the second decade of the 19th century; and three letters from 1823 and 1825 suggest that the Kitkehahki were living on the Republican. By 1833, however, the village had been abandoned and the band was living on the Loup River. In that year, the four Pawnee bands, treated as a single tribe by the U.S. government, signed a treaty in which they gave up their lands south of the Platte. ==Rediscovering the village== 1901 monument at Republic County site. The monument was damaged by a tornado in 2004 and has been restored, though not to its original size and appearance. Webster County was opened to homesteaders in 1870. In 1872, the village site was homesteaded and placed under cultivation. In 1875, Elizabeth Johnson discovered the remains of a Pawnee village in Republic County, Kansas. She thought that it might be the site of Pike's flag incident; but hearing of another village in Webster County, Nebraska, she dispatched her husband and another man to investigate this site. Because the surface had been altered by cultivation, they found little evidence of habitation, and Johnson was persuaded that the Republic County site was Pike's village. She prevented its being plowed on several occasions, and eventually purchased the land. Johnson's claim was supported by Elliott Coues, who had edited Pike's journal; with his endorsement, it was accepted by the Kansas State Historical Society. In 1901, Johnson donated the land to the state of Kansas, which built a granite monument commemorating Pike's symbolic triumph over Spain. At the dedication of the monument, several of the speakers drew parallels between the Pike episode and the recent American victory in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1906, a four-day festival was held to celebrate the centennial of the flag incident. ===A. T. Hill=== One of those attending the 1906 ceremonies at the Kansas monument was A. T. Hill, a resident of Logan, Kansas. Hill had no formal training as an archaeologist‚Äîindeed, his formal education had ended in the fourth grade. However, he had developed a strong interest in the history and archaeology of the Great Plains. Upon reading Pike's journal, Hill became convinced that the Kansas site could not be the correct one. To him, the local topography did not appear to match that described by Pike; and when he attempted to retrace Pike's route, he concluded that the actual village site must be some distance northwest of the Kansas monument. In 1912, Hill moved to Hastings, Nebraska, where he went to work for an automobile dealership. In his job, he traveled throughout central Nebraska; in the course of this, he spoke with many collectors and investigated possible Pike sites. When he reached a managerial position at the dealership, he recruited his salesmen to bring him reports on archaeological sites and collections. In 1923, Hill learned of the remains of a Spanish saddle obtained from the George DeWitt farm in Webster County. He visited the farm, and learned from DeWitt, the son of the original homesteader, that when the land was first plowed, it was covered with Native American relics. Hill opened a grave and found a Spanish bridle bit and spur; across the river, on land that had never been plowed, he found traces of a camp, including rifle pits. The topography of the site closely matched Pike's description; and when Hill attempted to follow Pike's route from the site to the Arkansas River, he recognized a number of landmarks from Pike's account. Hill called the attention of the Nebraska State Historical Society (NSHS) to the site and, in 1924, joined representatives of the Society in conducting further excavations, showing that a village of considerable size had existed there. In 1925, to ensure archaeological access to the site and to protect it from relic-hunting, he bought the two farms on whose land it lay. Between 1924 and 1930, he excavated two lodges and over fifty graves. ===Nebraska versus Kansas=== By 1927, Hill and the NSHS were persuaded that the Webster County site was the scene of the Pike flag incident. In that year, they challenged Kansas's claim. A full issue of the Society's journal, Nebraska History, was devoted to the matter. The issue, provocatively titled \\"The War Between Nebraska and Kansas\\", included articles by representatives of the Nebraska society and of the Kansas Historical Society, each claiming the Pike site for his own state. More than historical accuracy was at stake. In a 1901 address delivered at the Republic County site, Katherine S. Lewis of the Kansas Daughters of the American Revolution had declared that \\"we have been seeking out antiquity for Kansas; we felt that our state was too new to be interesting\\". In 1927, Kansans still regarded their Pike site as a focus of state pride, and were unwilling to give it up: in the Nebraska History issue, George Morehouse of the KHS wrote, \\"It is now very strange that ... our Nebraska friends should become so enthusiastic in trying to take from our Pike's Pawnee Republic Village its halo of glory.\\" In their articles, the champions of each state argued that Pike's account of his route supported their site, and entirely ruled out the other. Both sides also argued that Pike's description of the local topography matched their site and differed significantly from the other. The proponents of the Nebraska site cited the artifacts that had been recovered from their village. These included a Spanish peace medal dated 1797 and bearing the image of Charles IV, an American peace medal of the type issued after 1801, and soldier's buttons and brass medallions bearing 15 stars, one of which bore the number \\"1\\", that of Pike's infantry regiment. Pawnee Indian Museum and restored 1901 monument at Republic County site The Kansans had no such artifacts to show. However, they argued that the Nebraska village postdated the Pike episode. The Kansas village, they stated, had been the one visited by Pike, and was occupied by the Pawnees until they were driven north by the Delawares in the early 1830s; the fleeing Pawnees had then established the village on the Republican, where they had been devastated by smallpox. In this account the epidemic, and not long habitation, explained the number of graves found by Hill; the medals had not been buried with their original owners, but had been treasured by the band for decades, until the time that the pestilence was blamed on \\"evil gifts from the whites\\" and they were cast away. Further work at both sites strengthened the case for Nebraska. Kansas supporters gave ground reluctantly: a major celebration was held at the Republic County site in 1933, and as late as 1947, an article in the Kansas Historical Quarterly spoke of the issue as \\"debatable ground\\". Today, however, the Webster County site is generally acknowledged as the true one: an exhibit at the Republic County site states as much, and a Kansas historical marker near the 1901 monument states that \\"the village was long believed ... to be that visited by Zebulon M. Pike\\". Although Elizabeth Johnson was mistaken about the Pike village site, her mistake is held to be a fortunate one. The Webster County site had been subjected to decades of cultivation and relic hunting. The Republic County site was not entirely pristine, due to surface collecting and possibly to amateur excavation; but it was far better preserved. Today, the Kansas Historical Society operates a museum on the site, built in 1967 over one of the excavated earth lodges. ==Investigation history== Hill continued work at the site through 1930. In that year, he was joined by William Duncan Strong, who the previous year had been named a professor of anthropology at the University of Nebraska, and by Strong's research assistant Waldo Wedel. The collaboration of these three was crucial to the new science of Central Plains archaeology, and to Pawnee studies in particular: up to this time, the conventional wisdom among anthropologists was that there was no useful archaeological work to be done on the Plains. In 1936, Wedel published his 1930 master's thesis as the seminal An Introduction to Pawnee Archaeology. In the summer of 1941, a WPA crew excavated a number of lodges, cache pits, and graves at the site. Some testing and surface collecting were conducted in 1943. More recently, a magnetic survey was conducted over a portion of the village in 1982, and some testing was carried out in 1987. Hill plotted the remains of 102 lodges. Pike reported finding 44 lodges at the village; the difference is probably due to the abandonment or destruction of lodges and the building of new ones on different sites. At least 90 graves have been investigated by archaeologists; an estimated 75‚Äì100 additional graves are thought to have been opened by relic hunters. ==Preservation== In 1964, the site was listed as a National Historic Landmark. In 1966, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The boundaries of the historic site were expanded to nearly at some time in 1977 or later. The site is owned and preserved by the Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation. There is no museum or visitor center there, and the site is not open to the public. ==Notes== ==References== *Asher, Brendon Patrick (2009). \\"Kitkehahki Chipped Stone Technologies: A Comparative Study\\".

The hospital was developed by Dr. Susan LaFlesche Picotte (1865‚Äì1915), the first female Native American medical doctor. Built with money raised by Picotte from various sources, it was the first hospital for any Indian reservation not funded by government money. It served the community as a hospital until the 1940s, and has had a variety of other uses since. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. ==Description and history== The Picotte Hospital building is located on the western fringe of Walthill, on the north side of Matthewson Street near its junction with Sawyer Street. The building was designed by architect William L. Steele in 1912 and built in 1912‚Äì1913. Set on a concrete foundation on a hill overlooking Walthill, the one-and-one-half- story hospital was built in the American Craftsman style of architecture. Typical of Craftsman style, it features a low-pitched, shingled (originally wood-shingled) roof, wide eaves with large braces beneath, exposed roof rafter tails, and a centered gabled dormer. A prominent screened porch runs the entire length of the front (east side) of the structure, bounded by columns that support the roof. Susan LaFlesche Picotte was born into the Omaha tribe in 1865. Her father, Joseph LaFlesche, was the tribe's last recognized chief, and saw to it that his children were well educated and could integrate into white society. Trained in medicine at the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania, she returned to the reservation, where she eventually became its primary medical provider. The hospital was built through her fundraising efforts, which yielded the $8,000 needed from a variety of private philanthropic sources. The building was a working hospital until the late 1940s, after which it served a variety of functions since, including a museum. As of 2013, it housed Mi'Jhu'Wi Ministries, a nonprofit providing services to the people of the Omaha Reservation. ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in Nebraska *National Register of Historic Places listings in Thurston County, Nebraska ==References== ==External links== *Picotte Memorial Hospital, from a National American Indian Heritage Month feature at the National Park Service Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1912 Category:National Historic Landmarks in Nebraska Category:Buildings and structures in Thurston County, Nebraska Category:Hospital buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Nebraska Category:William L.

It may refer to an angle or a distance. The deflection distance of a member under a load can be calculated by integrating the function that mathematically describes the slope of the deflected shape of the member under that load. Standard formulas exist for the deflection of common beam configurations and load cases at discrete locations. Otherwise methods such as virtual work, direct integration, Castigliano's method, Macaulay's method or the direct stiffness method are used. The deflection of beam elements is usually calculated on the basis of the Euler‚ÄìBernoulli beam equation while that of a plate or shell element is calculated using plate or shell theory. An example of the use of deflection in this context is in building construction. Architects and engineers select materials for various applications. == Beam deflection for various loads and supports == Beams can vary greatly in their geometry and composition. For instance, a beam may be straight or curved. It may be of constant cross section, or it may taper. It may be made entirely of the same material (homogeneous), or it may be composed of different materials (composite). Some of these things make analysis difficult, but many engineering applications involve cases that are not so complicated. Analysis is simplified if: :-The beam is originally straight, and any taper is slight :-The beam experiences only linear elastic deformation :-The beam is slender (its length to height ratio is greater than 10) :-Only small deflections are considered (max deflection less than 1/10 the span). In this case, the equation governing the beam's deflection (w) can be approximated as: :\\\\cfrac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2 w(x)}{\\\\mathrm{d} x^2}=\\\\frac{M(x)}{E(x) I(x)} where the second derivative of its deflected shape with respect to x is interpreted as its curvature, E is the Young's modulus, I is the area moment of inertia of the cross-section, and M is the internal bending moment in the beam. If, in addition, the beam is not tapered and is homogeneous, and is acted upon by a distributed load q, the above expression can be written as: : EI~\\\\cfrac{\\\\mathrm{d}^4 w(x)}{\\\\mathrm{d} x^4} = q(x) This equation can be solved for a variety of loading and boundary conditions. A number of simple examples are shown below. The formulas expressed are approximations developed for long, slender, homogeneous, prismatic beams with small deflections, and linear elastic properties. Under these restrictions, the approximations should give results within 5% of the actual deflection. === Cantilever beams === Cantilever beams have one end fixed, so that the slope and deflection at that end must be zero. Schematic of the deflection of a cantilever beam. ==== End- loaded cantilever beams ==== Cantilever beam with a force on the free end The elastic deflection \\\\delta and angle of deflection \\\\phi (in radians) at the free end in the example image: A (weightless) cantilever beam, with an end load, can be calculated (at the free end B) using: : \\\\delta_B = \\\\frac {F L^3} {3 E I} : \\\\phi_B = \\\\frac {F L^2} {2 E I} where : F = Force acting on the tip of the beam : L = Length of the beam (span) : E = Modulus of elasticity : I = Area moment of inertia of the beam's cross section Note that if the span doubles, the deflection increases eightfold. The deflection at any point, x, along the span of an end loaded cantilevered beam can be calculated using: : \\\\delta_x = \\\\frac {F x^2} {6 E I} (3L - x) : \\\\phi_x = \\\\frac {F x} {2 E I} (2L - x) Note: At x = L (the end of the beam), the \\\\delta_x and \\\\phi_x equations are identical to the \\\\delta_B and \\\\phi_B equations above. ==== Uniformly-loaded cantilever beams ==== Cantilever beam with a uniform distributed load The deflection, at the free end B, of a cantilevered beam under a uniform load is given by: : \\\\delta_B = \\\\frac {q L^4} {8 E I} : \\\\phi_B = \\\\frac {q L^3} {6 E I} where : q = Uniform load on the beam (force per unit length) : L = Length of the beam : E = Modulus of elasticity : I = Area moment of inertia of cross section The deflection at any point, x, along the span of a uniformly loaded cantilevered beam can be calculated using: : \\\\delta_x = \\\\frac {q x^2} {24 E I}(6L^2 - 4L x + x^2) : \\\\phi_x = \\\\frac {q x} {6 E I}(3L^2 - 3L x + x^2) === Simply-supported beams === Simply-supported beams have supports under their ends which allow rotation, but not deflection. Schematic of the deflection of a simply-supported beam. ==== Center-loaded simple beams ==== Simply-supported beam with a force in the center The elastic deflection (at the midpoint C) of a beam, loaded at its center, supported by two simple supports is given by: : \\\\delta_C = \\\\frac {F L^3} {48 E I} where : F = Force acting on the center of the beam : L = Length of the beam between the supports : E = Modulus of Elasticity : I = Area moment of inertia of cross section The deflection at any point, x, along the span of a center loaded simply supported beam can be calculated using: : \\\\delta_x = \\\\frac {F x} {48 E I}(3L^2 - 4x^2) for : 0 \\\\leq x \\\\leq \\\\frac{L}{2} ==== Off-center-loaded simple beams ==== Simply-supported beam with a force off center The maximum elastic deflection on a beam supported by two simple supports, loaded at a distance a from the closest support, is given by: : \\\\delta_{max} = \\\\frac {F a (L^2 - a^2)^{3/2}} {9\\\\sqrt{3} L E I} where : F = Force acting on the beam : L = Length of the beam between the supports : E = Modulus of Elasticity : I = Area moment of Inertia of cross-section : a = Distance from the load to the closest support (i.e. a \\\\leq L/2) This maximum deflection occurs at a distance x_1 from the closest support and is given by: : x_1 = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{L^2 - a^2}{3}} ==== Uniformly-loaded simple beams ==== Simply-supported beam with a uniform distributed load The elastic deflection (at the midpoint C) on a beam supported by two simple supports, under a uniform load (as pictured) is given by: : \\\\delta_C = \\\\frac{5 q L^4} {384 E I} Where : q = Uniform load on the beam (force per unit length) : L = Length of the beam : E = Modulus of elasticity : I = Area moment of inertia of cross section The deflection at any point, x, along the span of a uniformly loaded simply supported beam can be calculated using: : \\\\delta_x = \\\\frac{q x} {24 E I} (L^3 - 2L x^2 + x^3) === Change in Length === The change in length \\\\Delta L of the beam is generally negligible in structures, but can be calculated by integrating the slope \\\\theta_x function, if the deflection function \\\\delta_x is known for all x. Where: : \\\\Delta L = change in length (always negative) : \\\\theta_x = slope function (first derivative of \\\\delta_x) : \\\\Delta L = -\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int^L_0(\\\\theta(x))^2dx Roark's Formulas for Stress and Strain, 8th Edition Eq 8.1-14 If the beam is uniform and the deflection at any point is known, this can be calculated without knowing other properties of the beam. == Units == The formulas supplied above require the use of a consistent set of units. Most calculations will be made in the International System of Units (SI) or US customary units, although there are many other systems of units. === International system (SI) === :Force: Newton (N) Length: meters (m) :Modulus of Elasticity: \\\\frac{N}{m^2} (Pa) :Moment of Inertia: m^4 === US customary units (US) === :Force: Pounds force (lb_f) :Length: Inches (in) :Modulus of Elasticity: \\\\frac{lb_f}{in^2} :Moment of Inertia: in^4 === Others === Other units may be used as well, as long as they are self-consistent. For example, sometimes the kilogram force (kg_f) unit is used to measure loads. In such a case, the modulus of elasticity must be converted to \\\\frac{kg_f}{m^2}. == Structural deflection == Building codes determine the maximum deflection, usually as a fraction of the span e.g. 1/400 or 1/600. Either the strength limit state (allowable stress) or the serviceability limit state (deflection considerations among others) may govern the minimum dimensions of the member required. The deflection must be considered for the purpose of the structure. When designing a steel frame to hold a glazed panel, one allows only minimal deflection to prevent fracture of the glass. The deflected shape of a beam can be represented by the moment diagram, integrated (twice, rotated and translated to enforce support conditions). == See also == * Bending * Bending moment * Slope deflection method ==References== ==External links== *Deflection of beams *Beam Deflections Category:Engineering mechanics ","title":"Deflection (engineering)"},{"id":"17318580","text":"Kelland's house at 20 Clarendon Crescent, Edinburgh (centre) Rev Prof Philip Kelland PRSE FRS (17 October 1808 ‚Äì 8 May 1879) was an English mathematician. He was known mainly for his great influence on the development of education in Scotland. ==Life== Kelland was born in 1808 the son of Philip Kelland (d.1847), curate in Dunster, Somerset, England. He was educated at Sherborne, and an undergraduate at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he was tutored privately by English mathematician William Hopkins and graduated in 1834 as senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman. He was ordained in the Church of England. From 1834 to 1838, he was a fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge. Kelland was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1838 and Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1839. He served as Secretary of the RSE 1843-4, Vice-President 1857‚Äì77 and President 1878-9. He won their Keith Medal for the period 1849‚Äì51. He lived his final years at 20 Clarendon Crescent in western Edinburgh.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1875-6 Kelland is buried in Warriston Cemetery in the north of the city. ==Academic career== Kelland was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh in 1838. He was a successor to Scottish mathematician William Wallace. He became the first English-born and wholly English-educated mathematician to hold that chair. Kelland joined with Scottish physicist James David Forbes in supporting reforms of the Scottish university system. He was an efficient education reformer. He won the respect of his colleagues, and was regarded highly as a mathematics instructor. He wrote on the reform of the Scottish universities. ==Research== Kelland's early research work, undertaken at the University of Cambridge, was influenced by mathematicians Joseph Fourier and Augustin Louis Cauchy. This research is described in his Theory of Heat (1837, 1842) and in some papers. However, this proved not to be based on sound principles. In all, 28 papers published by Kelland, mainly on heat, light and water waves, are listed in the Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Papers. His theoretical work on water waves (1840, 1844), published in Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, tried to explain aspects of the important experiments of John Scott Russell, then being carried out near Edinburgh. Although this work was flawed in some respects, it anticipated some of the results later obtained by George Biddell Airy and George Gabriel Stokes. Kelland wrote analytical papers on General Differentiation in 1839, and Differential Equations in 1853. He gave a geometrical Theory of Parallels outlining a version of non-Euclidean geometry. He wrote mathematics books and edited works of mathematician John Playfair and polymath Thomas Young. ==Family== He married twice: firstly to \\"Miss Pilkington\\" secondly to Miss Boswall of Wardie. ==References== * Category:1808 births Category:1879 deaths Category:19th-century English mathematicians Category:19th-century English people Category:People educated at Sherborne School Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh Category:Alumni of Queens' College, Cambridge Category:Presidents of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Category:Senior Wranglers Category:Burials at Warriston Cemetery Category:Fellows of Queens' College, Cambridge ","title":"Philip Kelland"},{"id":"17318609","text":"1996-97 Hong Kong FA Cup was the 23rd staging of the Hong Kong FA Cup.

Contrary to many MCMC algorithms, coupling from the past gives in principle a perfect sample from the stationary distribution. It was invented by James Propp and David Wilson in 1996. ==The basic idea== Consider a finite state irreducible aperiodic Markov chain M with state space S and (unique) stationary distribution \\\\pi (\\\\pi is a probability vector). Suppose that we come up with a probability distribution \\\\mu on the set of maps f:S\\\\to S with the property that for every fixed s\\\\in S, its image f(s) is distributed according to the transition probability of M from state s. An example of such a probability distribution is the one where f(s) is independent from f(s') whenever s e s', but it is often worthwhile to consider other distributions. Now let f_j for j\\\\in\\\\mathbb Z be independent samples from \\\\mu. Suppose that x is chosen randomly according to \\\\pi and is independent from the sequence f_j. (We do not worry for now where this x is coming from.) Then f_{-1}(x) is also distributed according to \\\\pi, because \\\\pi is M-stationary and our assumption on the law of f. Define :F_j:= f_{-1}\\\\circ f_{-2}\\\\circ\\\\cdots\\\\circ f_{-j}. Then it follows by induction that F_j(x) is also distributed according to \\\\pi for every j\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}. Now here is the main point. It may happen that for some n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} the image of the map F_n is a single element of S. In other words, F_n(x)=F_n(y) for each y\\\\in S. Therefore, we do not need to have access to x in order to compute F_n(x). The algorithm then involves finding some n\\\\in \\\\mathbb N such that F_n(S) is a singleton, and outputting the element of that singleton. The design of a good distribution \\\\mu for which the task of finding such an n and computing F_n is not too costly is not always obvious, but has been accomplished successfully in several important instances.http://www.dbwilson.com/exact/ ==The monotone case== There is a special class of Markov chains in which there are particularly good choices for \\\\mu and a tool for determining if F_n(S)=1. (Here \\\\cdot denotes cardinality.) Suppose that S is a partially ordered set with order \\\\le, which has a unique minimal element s_0 and a unique maximal element s_1; that is, every s\\\\in S satisfies s_0\\\\le s\\\\le s_1. Also, suppose that \\\\mu may be chosen to be supported on the set of monotone maps f:S\\\\to S. Then it is easy to see that F_n(S)=1 if and only if F_n(s_0)=F_n(s_1), since F_n is monotone. Thus, checking this becomes rather easy. The algorithm can proceed by choosing n:=n_0 for some constant n_0, sampling the maps f_{-1},\\\\dots,f_{-n}, and outputting F_n(s_0) if F_n(s_0)=F_n(s_1). If F_n(s_0) e F_n(s_1) the algorithm proceeds by doubling n and repeating as necessary until an output is obtained. (But the algorithm does not resample the maps f_{-j} which were already sampled; it uses the previously sampled maps when needed.) == References == * * Category:Monte Carlo methods Category:Markov chain Monte Carlo ","title":"Coupling from the past"},{"id":"17318642","text":"Mico de Noche is a stoner sludge metal band from Seattle, Washington, USA. Mico de Noche began as a duo in 2001 with Donovan Stewart (formerly of Helltrout, Migas) on drums and vocals, and Michael Crum (also of Helltrout, and formerly AMQA) on guitar and vocals. In 2003, Mico de Noche was named one of the top 10 metal bands by the Seattle Weekly. Mico de Noche performed at SXSW in 2004 and 2005 and Wantage Records' TotalFest four times from 2003-2006. The band recorded Cherries throughout 2006 as a collaborative project featuring several guest musicians. The songs on Cherries utilize a non-standard BADGBE tuning. In March 2007, Mico de Noche added Chad Baker (formerly of Swelter, nomovingparts) on bass in order to recreate the album's ensemble sound in live performances. Cherries was released on November 6, 2007 on the Australian Cattle God label out of Austin, TX. Don Stewart moved from drums to guitar in Spring of 2008 and was replaced on drums by Reno Dave. Stewart also works as a recording engineer and has recorded projects by Big Business, Black Elk and Lozen. Stewart was also the touring bass player during ...And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead's Summer 2007 festival tour. In July 2009, Stonerrock.com announced plans by Mico de Noche to release a split 10\\" vinyl record featuring songs by Mico de Noche and Brothers of the Sonic Cloth (aka BOTSC) featuring grunge rock pioneer Tad Doyle. On August 8, 2009, Mico de Noche was featured on the KEXP radio show Audioasis and performed several songs live in the studio. The Mico de Noche/BOTSC split 10\\" vinyl record was released in October 2009 as an edition of 500 copies and featured two songs by Mico de Noche, \\"Ganges\\" and \\"Misanthrope\\" and one song by Brothers of the Sonic Cloth. The record received several positive reviews and appeared on multiple \\"Best of 2009\\" lists. After playing Tad's wedding reception in 2010, Mico de Noche took a nearly year-long hiatus. During this time, Reno Dave became more heavily involved in his side project, Cody Foster Army (CFA). In mid-2011, Mico de Noche resumed rehearsal and began booking live shows again. Dave Foster (formerly of Nirvana, Helltrout, and contributor on Mico de Noche's \\"Cherries\\") became the permanent drummer, and several live shows were played throughout 2011 and 2012.

His unique History of Bukhara (Tarikh-i Bukhara) was written in Arabic and presented to the Samanid emperor Nuh I either in 943 or 944. The book provides important information on Bukhara that cannot be found in other contemporary sources. Nothing is known about Narshakhi except his authorship of this one book. ==Background== The book was composed for a patron who supported Sunni Islam against Isma'ilism. Through Da'i missionaries engaged in the da'wah the Isma'ili sect of Shi'ism had spread and was regarded as a threat by the Sunni. It was written in a time of upheaval for the Samanids. Nasr II had converted to Isma'ili Shi'ism, and his son, Nuh ibn Nasr was confronted with a political turmoil that saw his vizier and other members of his court killed. Nuh purged the da'is and killed Isma'ili converts in an attempt to undo their encroaching influence, but the situation in the court remained tense. The Samanids, whose roots lay in Sogdia, had assumed the role of guardians of Sunni law, in opposition to the Saffarids in Sistan and the Samanids. They commissioned the translation of Arabic works like the History of Prophets and Kings into Persian. These texts were altered in translation; Tarikh-i Bukhara, translated by Abu Nasr Ahmad al-Qubavi, expanded the text to cover a longer period of time, but this Persian translation was later abridged by Muhammad ibn Zufar ibn 'Umar in the 12th century. ==Other translations of The History of Bukhara== In 1128 or 1129, Abu Nasr Ahmad al-Qubavi translated Narshakhi's original Arabic text into Persian, with abridgments and additional content to extend the history to 975. Charles-Henri-Auguste Schefer published an abridged French translation in 1892. In 1954, historian Richard N. Frye translated the Persian abridgment of the book into English. ==References== ==External links== * Mukhammad Narshakhi Category:Historians of Central Asia Category:History of Bukhara Category:People from Bukhara Category:10th-century Iranian people Category:10th-century historians Category:Samanid historians ","title":"Narshakhi"},{"id":"17318749","text":"An object hitting a surface is an example of deflection.

Versions of the game appeared for several of the home computers of the early 1980s. ==Reception== The Commodore 64 Home Companion advised \\"forget the plot; fast action is the name of this game\\". ==Legacy== In 1983, Minter released Matrix: Gridrunner 2, which retained much of the original's gameplay, but introduced new enemy types and a scrolling background. It was first published on the Commodore 64, and ported to other platforms. This title was released in the US as Attack of the Mutant Camels, a title taken from an unrelated Llamasoft title released in the UK. A second sequel, Voidrunner, followed in 1987, which abandons the grid backgrounds, and features more colorful and elaborate graphics. In 1991, Llamasoft released Super Gridrunner for the Atari ST. The first 32-bit title in the series, it added power-ups to the series for the first time, while retaining the basic elements of a single- screen shooter. This would be the last entry in the series for over a decade, during which time Jeff partnered with Atari on updates to the Tempest and Defender series. Gridrunner was revived in 2002 with Gridrunner++, a shareware downloadable title released on Llamasoft's website. Featuring retro sprite- based visuals and faster-paced gameplay on a scrolling field, it proved popular with fans. A sequel followed in 2009. Originally developed under the working title Gridrunner+++ it was released on Windows PCs as Gridrunner Revolution, after a newly introduced rotation mechanic. This version also made heavy use of Minter's \\"light synth\\" tech, with colorful, psychedelic visuals. It's also the only title in the series with a full musical soundtrack. ===Later versions=== In 2011, Llamasoft released a reimagined version for iOS, simply titled Gridrunner. This version pared the game back to a style reminiscent of early 1980s arcade games. Eurogamer called it \\"the best shooter on iOS,\\" and Touch Arcade described it as \\"a retro remake done right\\". It was later ported to Android as shareware. In 2018, Llamasoft released Minotaur Arcade Vol. 1 on PC and PS4. This compilation release features a new iteration of Gridrunner and GoatUp, using 3D voxel-based graphics. Like the iOS version before it, this version is simply titled Gridrunner, and features a retro- arcade aesthetic, but unlike its predecessor, it features changing 3D perspectives, new enemy types, and new power-ups. ==References== ==External links== * *Gridrunner for the Atari 8-bit family at Atari Mania *Gridrunner for the Atari ST at Atari Mania *Gridrunner at Amiga Hall of Light Category:1982 video games Category:Fixed shooters Category:Llamasoft games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Commodore VIC-20 games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Amiga games Category:IOS games Category:Quicksilva games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Gridrunner"},{"id":"17318776","text":"1997-98 Hong Kong FA Cup was the 24th staging of the Hong Kong FA Cup.

The indenyl ligand is formally the anion derived from deprotonation of indene. The Œ∑5-indenyl ligand is related to the Œ∑5cyclopentadienyl anion (Cp), thus indenyl analogues of many cyclopentadienyl complexes are known. Indenyl ligands lack the 5-fold symmetry of Cp, so they exhibit more complicated geometries. Furthermore, some indenyl complexes also exist with only Œ∑3-bonding mode. The Œ∑5\\\\- and Œ∑3-bonding modes sometimes interconvert. ==Preparation and structure== Indene is deprotonated by butyl lithium and related reagents to give the equivalent of the indenyl anion: :C9H8 \\\\+ BuLi ‚Üí LiC9H7 \\\\+ BuH The resulting lithium indenide can be used to prepare indenyl complexes by salt metathesis reactions of metal halides. When the metal halide is easily reduced, the trimethylstannylindenyl can be used as a source of indenyl anion: :Me3SnC9H7 \\\\+ TiCl4 ‚Üí Me3SnCl + C9H7TiCl3 Metallocene dichloride 1, containing two Cp ligands (C2v symmetry), a related complex bis(indenyl) complex 2 (C2 symmetry), and a mixed Cp-fluorenyl complex 3 (Cs symmetry). Such compounds are precursors to Ziegler‚ÄìNatta catalysts. The M-C distances in indenyl complexes are comparable to those in cyclopentadienyl complexes. For the metallocenes M(Ind)2, ring slipping is evident for the case of M = Co and especially Ni, but not for M = Fe. A number of chelating or ansa-bis(indenyl complexes are known, such as those derived from 2,2'-bis(2-indenyl) biphenyl INDMZRside.pngside view of (indenyl)2ZrMe2 INDMZRtop.pngTop view of (indenyl)2ZrMe2 INDMZRdownC2.pngView of (indenyl)2ZrMe2 down C2 symmetry axis. ==Indenyl effect== The indenyl effect refers to an explanation for the enhanced rates of substitution exhibited by Œ∑5-indenyl complexes vs the related Œ∑5-cyclopentadienyl complexes. Associative substitution occurs by the addition of a ligand to a metal complex followed by dissociation of an original ligand. Associative pathways are not typically seen in 18-electron complexes due to the requisite intermediates having more than 18 electrons associated with the metal atom. 18 electron indenyl complexes; however, have been shown to undergo substitution via associative pathways quite readily. This is attributed to the relative ease of Œ∑5 to Œ∑3 rearrangement due to stabilization by the arene. This stabilization is responsible for substitution rate enhancements of about 108 for the substitution of indenyl complexes compared to the corresponding cyclopentadienyl complex. Kinetic data support two proposed mechanisms for associative ligand substitution. The first mechanism, proposed by Hart-Davis and Mawby, is a concerted attack by the nucleophile and Œ∑5 to Œ∑3 transition followed by loss of a ligand and a Œ∑3 to Œ∑5 transition. One mechanism proposed for substitution of (indenyl)M(CO)2 by triphenylphosphine. In a mechanism proposed by Basolo, Œ∑5 and Œ∑3 isomers exist in rapid chemical equilibrium. The rate-limiting step occurs with the attack of the nucleophile on a Œ∑3 isomer. The nature of the substituents of the allyl group can strongly effect the kinetics and regiochemistry of the nucleophilic attack. ===Œ∑5 to Œ∑3 rearrangement in other ligands=== Indenyl like effects are also observed in a number of non indenyl substituted metal complexes. In fluorenyl complexes, associative substitution is enhanced even further than indenyl compounds. The substitution rate of Mn(Œ∑5-C13H9)(CO)3 is about 60 times faster than that of Mn(Œ∑5-C9H7)(CO)3Mechanism for ligand substitution in Fluorenyl substituted metals. Veiros conducted a study comparing the rate of substitution on [(Œ∑5-X)Mn(CO)3] where X is cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, fluorenyl, cyclohexadienyl, and 1-hydronaphthalene. Unsurprisingly, it was found that the ease of Œ∑5 to Œ∑3 haptotropic shift correlated to the strength of the Mn-X bond. General trend for haptotropic rearrangement assisted ligand substitution. ==History== The indenyl analogues of ferrocene, which is orange, and cobaltocenium cation were first reported by Pauson and Wilkinson. The cobalt derivative is a poorer reductant than cobaltocene. The indenyl effect was discovered by Hart-Davis and Mawby in 1969 through studies on the conversion of (Œ∑5-C9H7)Mo(CO)3CH3 to the phosphine-substituted acetyl complex, which follows bimolecular kinetics. This rate law was attributed to the haptotropic rearrangement of the indenyl ligand from Œ∑5 to Œ∑3. The corresponding reaction of tributylphosphine with (Œ∑5-C5H5)Mo(CO)3CH3 was 10 x slower. The term indenyl effect was coined by Fred Basolo. Subsequent work by Hart-Davis, Mawby, and White compared CO substitution by phosphines in Mo(Œ∑5-C9H7)(CO)3X and Mo(Œ∑5-C5H5)(CO)3X (X = Cl, Br, I) and found the cyclopentadienyl compounds to substitute by an SN1 pathway and the indenyl compounds to substitute by both SN1 and SN2 pathways. Mawby and Jones later studied the rate of CO substitution with P(OEt)3 with Fe(Œ∑5-C9H7)(CO)2I and Fe(Œ∑5-C5H5)(CO)2I and found that both occur by an SN1 pathway with the indenyl substitution occurring about 575 times faster. Hydrogenation of the arene ring in the indenyl ligand resulted in CO substitution at about half the rate of the cyclopentadienyl compound. Work in the early 1980s by Basolo found the SN2 replacement of CO in Rh(Œ∑5-C9H7)(CO)2 to be 108 times faster than in Rh(Œ∑5-C5H5)(CO)2. Shortly afterwards, Basolo tested the effect of the indene ligand on Mn(Œ∑5-C9H7)(CO)3, the cyclopentadienyl analogue of which having been shown to be inert to CO substitution. Mn(Œ∑5-C9H7)(CO)3 did undergo CO loss and was found to substitute via an SN2 mechanism. ==References== Category:Organometallic chemistry Category:Reaction mechanisms ","title":"Transition metal indenyl complex"},{"id":"17318868","text":"Keckiella breviflora (formerly Penstemon breviflorus) is a species of flowering shrub in the plantain family known by the common name bush beardtongue.

In 1894 she was transferred to the Spanish Navy's Asiatic Squadron to deter any aggressive moves the German Empire might take against the Spanish-owned Caroline Islands in the Pacific. She became flagship of the squadron. When Spain faced the \\"Tagalog Revolt\\" (1896‚Äì1897) ‚Äì the Spanish name for the first two years of the Philippine Revolution ‚Äì in the Philippine Islands, Reina Cristina was actively involved in the Spanish campaign to put down the revolt. In addition to patrolling Philippine waters to prevent the smuggling of contraband to the insurgents, she also supported Spanish Army actions against them at Cavite, Novaleta, and Binacayan, including the provision of naval gunfire support to Spanish troops ashore. Reina Cristina was the flagship of Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo de Pasaron's Pacific Squadron at Manila in the Philippine Islands when the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in April 1898. At 1100 hours on 25 April 1898, Reina Cristina and the rest of the squadron departed Manila Bay en route Subic Bay, where Montojo thought he could take advantage of a minefield and coastal defense guns in the face of the American naval attack he believed his squadron soon would face. However, when Montojo arrived at Subic Bay, he found that few of the mines had been laid and the coastal battery had not yet been mounted. A view aboard the wreck of Castilla. Reina Cristina (foreground) in action against Dewey's squadron (right) in a painting by W. G. Wood. and at left. On 28 April 1898 Montojo decided that the Spanish squadron would be better off if it returned to Manila Bay and offered battle at Cavite, where coastal guns could support him and where the shallow water would reduce the loss of life if his ships were sunk. At 1030 on 29 April 1898, Reina Cristina and the rest of the squadron departed Subic Bay. Her squadron mate, the wooden cruiser , was unable to get underway due to engine trouble, so Reina Cristina took her under tow for the voyage. The squadron arrived at Cavite later that day and anchored in Ca√±acao Bay under the lee of the Cavite Peninsula east of Sangley Point, Luzon, eight miles southwest of Manila. At 0400 hours on 1 May 1898, Montojo's squadron was still anchored there when he signalled all ships to prepare for action, and Reina Cristina readied herself to meet an imminent American attack. Just before 0500 hours, the United States Navy's Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey was sighted, approaching to attack the Spanish ships in their anchorage. In a few minutes, the first shots of the Battle of Manila Bay, the first major engagement of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, were fired. The wreck of Reina Cristina. Reina Cristina slipped her mooring cables and prepared to maneuver. At 0520 hours, she opened fire along with the rest of her squadron and the Spanish coastal batteries, although Dewey's ships were out of range. Finally, at 0540 hours, the U.S. squadron returned fire, with the protected cruisers , , and concentrating their fire on Reina Cristina. Soon thereafter, Reina Cristina was hit twice in rapid succession as Dewey's squadron steamed past; the hits knocked out several of her light guns and started fires, although her crew quickly put the fires out. The American squadron then reversed course and made a second pass. This time, Reina Cristinas casualties began to mount as she took numerous hits, including to her forecastle and hull; new fires broke out, and Montojo ordered her after magazine flooded to prevent a catastrophic magazine explosion. Dewey's ships then again reversed course and made a third firing pass. View aboard the wreck of Reina Cristina looking aft. The direction of the leaning funnel suggests the image may be reversed. As the American squadron again reversed course to make a fourth pass, Montojo ordered Reina Cristina to get underway. She steamed slowly toward Dewey's flagship, Olympia, with an intention of ramming Olympia. This prompted Dewey to order his squadron to close with and concentrate fire on Reina Cristina, and the range of the one-sided fight quickly closed to . Reina Cristina was soon afire in several places, with most of her guns knocked out, her steering gear shot away, many holes blown in her hull, funnel, and mast, and half of her crew, including seven officers, killed or wounded. Viewing Reina Cristina as beyond saving and fearing her magazines would explode, Montojo ordered her scuttled and abandoned. The gunboats and came alongside to take off the wounded as American gunfire continued to pummel Reina Cristina and inflict casualties; among them was Reina Cristinas commanding officer, Captain Luis Cadarso y Rey, who refused to abandon ship until all his men were off before him and who was killed by an American shell while overseeing the abandonment of his cruiser. Reina Cristina, a burning wreck, soon sank. ==Commemoration== In honor of her performance during the Battle of Manila Bay, Dewey presented the United States Revenue Cutter Service cutter USRC McCulloch with four of the six 3-pounder Hotchkiss revolving guns taken from the wreck of Reina Cristina., spanamwar.com Dewey's recognition of McCulloch‚Ä≤s efficient service.

This technique is only necessary when the target will have moved a sufficient distance to displace its position during the time the projectile would take to reach the target's range. This can become the case over long distances (e.g. a distant target for a skilled sniper), due to fast moving targets (e.g. an opposing aircraft in an aerial dogfight), or while using relatively slow projectiles (e.g. a crossbow bolt or a basketball thrown to a running teammate). Modern fighter aircraft have automated deflection sights, where a computer calculates lead and projects the solution onto a head-up display (HUD). The visual assistance with targeting the gun is offset by the speed and agility of modern aircraft, compared to the days when targeting was less advanced. In artillery, deflection is also used against fixed targets to compensate for windage and range. Due to the Earth's rotation, surface points have different velocities and curved motion, leading to apparent Coriolis drift of a long-range target. ==Computer games== Modern computer games of the first-person shooter genre typically feature a number of relatively low- velocity projectile weapons such as unguided shoulder-fired missiles, or fictional projectile weapons such as \\"plasma guns\\" or \\"nail guns\\", which necessitates an attacker to lead his aim ahead of moving targets. Computer games that accurately model the ballistic trajectories (including velocity) of firearms also require leading of fire, much as in real life. This applies equally to combat aircraft (or even combat spacecraft) simulators, where the velocity of the craft involved are significant enough to require leading with projectile weapons. Additionally, in older multiplayer video games that calculate behavior on a remote server, even for high-velocity or hitscan weapons, there are issues of latency that may require leading. Essentially, even if the shooter has the target exactly in their sights, by the time the information relating weapon fire from the shooter's computer has reached the server, the target may have moved enough to avoid the shot. However, modern game-engines use a lag compensation system which moves all players back to a point in time based on the shooter's client interpolation time and ping (or, alternatively, by trusting the result calculated entirely on the client side) to evaluate if there was a hit or not. Such systems eliminate the need to lead hitscan weapons, but introduce the risk of players being hit by enemy fire shortly after taking cover behind objects, due to the latency causing a delay before the victim's computer receives the message that he has been shot. ==See also== * Direct fire * Artillery * Auxiliary predictor Category:Targeting (warfare) Category:Military tactics Category:Ballistics ","title":"Deflection (ballistics)"},{"id":"17318951","text":"Tangara may refer to: * Tangara (genus), a genus of birds of the tanager family * Aerotec A-132 Tangar√°, a Brazilian military trainer aircraft * Tangar√° da Serra, a town in Mato Grosso, Brazil * Tangar√°, Rio Grande do Norte, a town in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil * Tangar√°, Santa Catarina, a town in Santa Catarina, Brazil * Sydney Trains T or G sets or Tangara, a class of electric train in Sydney, Australia * Tangara (novel), a 1960 children's novel by Australian author Nan Chauncy ==People with the surname== * Fousseiny Tangara (born 1978), soccer goalkeeper from Mali ==See also== * Tangra (disambiguation) ","title":"Tangara"},{"id":"17318959","text":"1998-99 Hong Kong FA Cup was the 24th staging of the Hong Kong FA Cup.

She was laid down in August 1881, but shortages of materials delayed her construction and she was not launched until 21 September 1887. She had two funnels. Her main armament was built by Hontoria and sponson-mounted. Her five torpedo tubes all were fixed; two were forward, one was on each beam, and one was aft. Although unprotected and therefore lacking armor, she had 12 watertight compartments built in a French- style cellular system to help her resist flooding. She was designed for colonial service, with an emphasis on speed and moderate armament, but in practice machinery problems made her a much slower steamer than her designers had hoped. ==Operational history== Alfonso XII commissioned in 1891. By 1897 she was anchored in Havana harbor in Cuba, serving as flagship for Admiral Vincente Manterola, but she was unable to put to sea because her boilers required a major refit, and some of her guns had been put ashore to aid in the harbor's shore-based defenses. Amid growing tensions between the United States and Spain, the U.S. battleship arrived in Havana harbor unexpectedly on 25 January 1898. Her commanding officer, Captain Charles Sigsbee, fearing Spanish mines, requested that Maine be allowed to anchor in the berth occupied by Alfonso XII, where he presumed there could be no mines, but the cruiser's immobility forced him to accept an anchorage about away. Maine was still there when she exploded and sank on 15 February 1898. The crew of Alfonso XII was heavily involved in rescuing the battleship's survivors, treating them in the cruiser's sick bay, and guarding the battleship's wreck, and marched in the funeral cortege during services ashore in Havana for the men who had died aboard Maine. With war approaching, Alfonso XII put more of her guns ashore to reinforce the coastal batteries of the Torre√≥n de la Chorrera, and these guns did fire on American ships occasionally after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in April 1898. But Alfonso XII herself, immobilized in a harbor that played little part in the war, could contribute nothing else to the Spanish war effort. After the war ended in August 1898, Alfonso XII returned to Spain, where she was decommissioned in 1900. She was sold in 1907. ==Notes== ==References== *Chesneau, Roger, and Eugene M. Kolesnik, Eds.

It was proposed by the staff of the Central Finance and Economics Leading Group (CFELG) and pursued by Zhu Rongji with the support of Jiang Zemin and Li Peng. The CFCW had political supervision and personnel authority over the People's Bank of China and state financial regulatory bodies, as well as over China's most important national firms. The Central Financial Work Commission consisted of several core departments: the Organization Department, the Financial Discipline Inspection Work Commission and the Department of Supervisory Board Work. It had about 200 officials and was ranked above ministerial level. Its operations were supervised by Executive Deputy Secretary Yan Haiwang, and it regularly reported directly to its head, CFCW Secretary Wen Jiabao, who concurrently served as a member of the Politburo and as vice-premier in charge of work on finance. Wen was CFCW Secretary from 1998 until the organization's demise in 2002.Yang, Dali. (2004). Remaking the Chinese Leviathan: Market Transition and the Politics of Governance in China.

The CFWC was abolished at the 16th Party Congress in late 2002, and most of its functions were transferred to state regulatory bodies.China Brief, December 6, 2006. Available at . Sebastian Heilmann argues that the CFCW was created as part of a strategy to stop the breakdown of the hierarchies in the Chinese financial industry and to restore central policy decisiveness in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis.Heilmann, Sebastian.(2005). Regulatory Innovation by Leninist Means: Communist Party Supervision in China‚Äôs Financial Industry. China Quarterly 181, 1-21. While this strategy was successful in establishing centralized supervision and homogenizing financial regulation, it failed to produce market-driven incentive structures for financial executives and clashed with nascent forms of corporate governance emerging in China. According to Heilmann, the dissolution of the CFCW constituted a major redefinition of Party control in economic regulation. == See also == *Economy of China == References == Category:Government of China Category:1998 establishments in China Category:2002 disestablishments in China Category:Government finances in China ","title":"Central Financial Work Commission"},{"id":"17319205","text":"Keckiella corymbosa (formerly Penstemon corymbosus) is a species of flowering shrub in the plantain family known by the common names redwood keckiella, red beardtongue,Keckiella corymbosa.

During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Reina Mercedes was captured by the United States and later salvaged and commissioned into the U.S. Navy. For information about her characteristics and operational history in U.S. Navy service, see . ==Technical characteristics== Reina Mercedes was built by the naval shipyard at Cartagena and launched on 9 September 1887. She had two funnels. Her main armament was built by Hontoria and sponson-mounted. Her five torpedo tubes all were fixed; two were forward, one was on each beam, and one was aft. Although unprotected and therefore lacking armor, she had 12 watertight compartments built in a French-style cellular system to help her resist flooding.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, page 384 She was designed for colonial service, with high speed and moderate armament, but in practice chronic machinery problems made her a relatively slow steamer.The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Reina Mercedes ==Operational history== Reina Mercedes Reina Mercedes spent her early years in Spanish waters as part of the Spanish Navy's Instructional Squadron. In 1893 she was transferred to the Caribbean, where she became flagship of Spanish naval forces operating in Cuban waters. On 29 May 1897, Reina Mercedes fired two shots at the American passenger liner off Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba; she ceased fire after Valencia displayed her colors, and it was later discovered that the crew of Reina Mercedes was well aware of Valencias identity, and fired the shots merely to make her display her colors. When the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in April 1898, Reina Mercedes was in the harbor at Santiago de Cuba, on Cuba's southeastern coast, awaiting repair, with seven of her ten boilers out of commission. Little of military significance happened at Santiago de Cuba until Vice Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete's squadron arrived there from Spain on 19 May 1898 to reinforce Spanish forces in the Caribbean. U.S. Navy forces hunting Cervera found his squadron there on the evening of 27 May 1898, and a 37-day blockade of the harbor ensued. During the blockade, Reina Mercedes traded blows with the American blockaders. On 3 June 1898, the U.S. Navy attempted to trap the Spanish ships in the harbor by sinking the collier in the entrance channel. Spanish shore batteries disabled Merrimac, and she drifted up the channel toward the anchored Spanish warships; Reina Mercedes, the armored cruiser , and the destroyer opened fire on Merrimac as well, and the collier soon sank in a position which did not block the channel. Reina Mercedes took aboard as prisoners of war the eight Americans who had been aboard Merrimac. On 6 June 1898, the blockading U.S. warships bombarded the harbor, hitting Reina Mercedes 35 times, starting two fires aboard her, and killing her second-in-command, Commander Emilio Acosta y Eyermann,Nofi, p. 163, claims that armored cruiser took this damage and suffered the loss of her executive officer, but Cervera's papers, p. 101, and The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Reina Mercedes both confirm it to have been Reina Mercedes the first Spanish naval officer to die in the war. The sunken Reina Mercedes in the channel at Santiago de Cuba. By the beginning of July 1898, U.S. Army forces advancing overland seemed to be on the verge of capturing Santiago de Cuba, prompting Cervera to order his squadron to attempt an escape by running the blockade. Reina Mercedes could not follow because of her boiler problems. It was decided that most of her guns would be placed ashore to aid in the defense of Santiago de Cuba and that she would be sunk in the entrance channel to prevent her capture and to improve the harbor's defenses by preventing American ships from entering it. On 3 July 1898, Cervera's squadron attempted its escape, and was completely destroyed in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. At about 2000 hours on 4 July 1898, Reina Mercedes, by now without most of her guns, slipped her moorings and proceeded into the channel. Just before midnight, the battleship spotted her and, together with the battleship opened fire. Although Reina Mercedes took many hits, her scuttling crew stayed on course, dropped anchor, and detonated their scuttling charges, but Reina Mercedes drifted to the eastern edge of the channel before sinking, going down in a location that failed to block the channel. Between 2 January 1899 and 1 March 1899, the U.S. Navy raised her and later put her into service as the disarmed receiving ship . ==See also== * ==Notes== ==References== * Cevera y Topete, Pascual, Ed.

At the time it was built in 1774 by Oswald Eve, it was the only such mill in the American colonies. Other powder mills operated in the 17th and 18th centuries but stopped production after the French and Indian war. Eve built his mill next to Frankford Creek, from which it drew its power. The building still stands but has long since been devoted to other uses. ==Revolution== When in the following year King George III banned shipments of gunpowder to the colonies, Eve was left with a monopoly on the commodity. The mill was the first American powder mill to supply the American Revolutionary War. In November 1775 Paul Revere visited the mill to observe Eve's production methods. Before and during the early American Revolution, the mill was operated by Eve, then by his son Oswald Eve, Jr. On January 11, 1776, the Continental Congress contracted the elder Eve to manufacture gunpowder for the Colonies at $8.00 per hundredweight.Barbara M. Auwarter and Joyce Halley, Workshop of the World‚ÄîPhiladelphia, Oliver Evans Press, 1990. In the meantime, to secure gunpowder for its war efforts, Congress approved on February 16, 1776 a committee led by Clement Biddle and Captain Joseph Cowperthwaite to build the Continental Powder Mill. The Continental Mill was built on French Creek, four miles from Phoenixville, and eight miles from Valley Forge. With the uncertainty of Eve's alliances, eight additional mills, operated by private businessmen, were contracted by the Committee of Safety or the Continental Congress, to supplement the Continental Powder Mill and Frankford Mills. These mills had trouble securing raw materials, and the Continental Mill was destroyed by accidental explosion on March 10, 1777. The Frankford Mill continued production. By April 1777, Eve had delivered 25,000 pounds of powder to the state.Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society. Vol. 1: 1743-1768. By Whitfield J. Bell, Jr., American Philosophical Society (Philadelphia: 1997). ==British capture== The British seized the mill in September 1777 when they entered Philadelphia. In 1778, the elder Eve was accused of clandestine dealings with the British and was convicted of treason by the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, who confiscated all his property, including the mill. It later passed into the hands of John Decatur, father of Revolutionary War naval hero Stephen Decatur, Sr., then in 1806 to local war hero General Isaac Worrell.James J. Farley, Making Arms in the Machine Age: Philadelphia's Frankford Arsenal, 1816-1870, Penn State Press, 1994. , ==Technology== Sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter was sifted and granulated. The raw ingredients required processing to obtain the necessary purity. A water-powered stamping mill helped bland the powder into rounded particles, which were then dried in a dry house.

In 1939 it was incorporated by the Third Reich. It is estimated that during World War II German soldiers killed from 1200 to 3000 people, mainly Poles and Jews, in the Death Valley of Fordon (Valley of Death (Bydgoszcz)). The exact number stays unknown as historians have not found appropriate documents that would state the final number of deaths. Finally in 1945 Fordon was liberated from Nazi occupation. In 1950 Fordon was still a separate town from Bydgoszcz. At that time it was described as \\"seven miles east\\" of the latter city. It had a population of 3,514 people and manufactured such things as cement and paper.Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer, p. 626 In 1973 Fordon became a part of the city of Bydgoszcz.

The crew were able to regain control and landed the aircraft successfully. One person aboard was injured. Flight 517 was instrumental in resolving the cause of Boeing 737 rudder issues that had previously caused two fatal crashes. Flight 517 was the first flight to experience such rudder issues and land safely, allowing investigators to interview the pilots about their experience and to study the aircraft. ==Background== On March 3, 1991, United Airlines Flight 585, a Boeing 737-200, rolled to the right and went into a vertical dive while attempting to land in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The resulting crash killed all 25 people on board. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) conducted a thorough investigation. Although a rudder problem was suspected, the aircraft's rudder components could not be tested or fully evaluated because they were severely damaged in the crash. As a result, the NTSB was unable to conclusively identify the cause of the crash. On September 8, 1994, USAir Flight 427, a Boeing 737-300, abruptly rolled to the left while on approach to Pittsburgh International Airport in an accident very similar to Flight 585. The resulting crash killed all 132 people on board. The NTSB commenced an investigation into Flight 427, which was ongoing throughout the late 1990s. ==Flight information== Flight 517 was a scheduled Eastwind Airlines passenger flight from Trenton-Mercer Airport in Trenton, New Jersey, to Richmond International Airport in Richmond, Virginia. The flight was operated using a Boeing 737-200 (registration number N221US). On June 9, 1996, Flight 517 was operated by Captain Brian Bishop and First Officer Spencer Griffin. A total of 53 people were on board. ==Incident== Flight 517 departed Trenton without incident and encountered no turbulence or unusual weather en route to Richmond. While on approach to Richmond International Airport, at an altitude of about MSL, the captain felt a brief \\"kick\\" or \\"bump\\" on the right rudder pedal. Around the same time, a flight attendant at the rear of the plane heard a thumping noise underneath her. As the plane continued to descend through , the captain suddenly experienced a loss of rudder control and the plane rolled sharply to the right. Attempting to regain control, the captain tried to apply full left rudder, but the rudder controls were stiff and did not respond to his commands. The captain applied left aileron and increased power to the right engine to try to stop the roll. The airplane temporarily stabilized, and then rolled to the right again. The crew performed their emergency checklist and attempted to regain control of the aircraft, and after several seconds they abruptly regained control. The airplane operated normally for the remaining duration of the flight. No damage occurred to the aircraft as a result of the incident. One flight attendant suffered minor injuries. No other passengers or crew aboard Flight 517 were injured. ==Investigation and aftermath== The NTSB investigated the incident, with a particular focus on determining whether the events of Flight 517 were related to previous Boeing 737 crashes. During the investigation, the NTSB found that prior to the June 9 incident, flight crews had reported a series of rudder-related events on the incident aircraft, including abnormal \\"bumps\\" on the rudder pedals and uncommanded movement of the rudder. Investigators conducted interviews with the pilots of Flight 517, and removed rudder components from the aircraft for examination, which helped to establish the cause of the previous crashes of United Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427. The NTSB determined that all three incidents could only be explained by pilot error or a malfunction of the rudder system, and based partly on post-accident interviews with the Flight 517 pilots, concluded that rudder malfunctions were likely to have caused all three incidents. The NTSB also determined that, unlike the United or USAir accidents, the rudder problem on Flight 517 occurred earlier in the landing process and at a higher speed, which increased airflow over the other control surfaces of the aircraft, allowing the pilots to overcome the rudder-induced roll. N221US was repaired and returned to service with Eastwind Airlines and continued to operate with them until the airline ceased operations in 1999. The aircraft was placed into storage at Indy South Greenwood Airport the same year and was scrapped in 2000. ==References== Eastwind Airlines 517 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by design or manufacturing errors Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1996 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in Virginia Category:Eastwind Airlines accidents and incidents Category:1996 in Virginia Category:June 1996 events in the United States ","title":"Eastwind Airlines Flight 517"},{"id":"17319554","text":"is a railway station in the city of Hirakata, Osaka, Japan, operated by the private railway operator, Keihan Electric Railway. ==Lines== Hirakatashi Station is served by the Keihan Main Line and the Keihan Katano Line.

The two manors were given to Henry de Ferrers after the Norman Conquest. By 1348 Sir Ralf Rochfort had inherited Sturston, with Grendon and Shenstone. He died childless, and in 1386 the estates passed to Sir William Chetwynd, 1st Lord Grendon of Ingestre in Staffordshire. Chetwynd sold the manor of Sturston to John Kniveton of Bradley, son of Sir John Kniveton and the hall stayed in the ownership of the Kniveton family for several hundred years. By 1630 Sir Gilbert Kniveton, 2nd Baronet High Sheriff of Derbyshire had inherited the Bradley and Sturston estates which were sold by 1655 to Francis Meynell a citizen and goldsmith of London. The estates passed to Hugh Charles Meynell who sold Sturston to a Stoddart in about 1847. Mrs Elizabeth Stoddart was Lady of the Manor in 1857 with around .

This disparate treatment of a person on the housing market can be based on group characteristics or on the place where a person lives. The most straightforward form of housing discrimination involves a landlord who rejects offers from potential tenants based on factors such as race, age, gender, marital status, source of funding, and others. The landlord may perform the discrimination explicitly or implicitly. Housing discrimination can also occur among existing tenants, who may face detrimental treatment in comparison to others for the same reasons. Housing discrimination can lead to spatial inequality and racial segregation, which, in turn, can exacerbate wealth disparities between certain groups. ==Types== Sociologists Vincent J. Roscigno, Diana L. Karafin, and Griff Tester have determined that the variety of actions that constitute housing discrimination can be classified as either exclusionary or nonexclusionary.Roscigno, Vincent J., Diana L. Karafin, and Griff Tester, 2009 ‚ÄúThe Complexities and Processes of Racial Housing Discrimination,‚Äù Social Problems, Vol. 56, No. 1. University of California Press. pp.49-69. ===Exclusionary=== Exclusionary discrimination practices refer to practices that seek to prevent certain individuals or families from obtaining housing, based on factors of discrimination. This includes explicit refusals (which may also include harassment and verbal abuse), proactive requests for or against specific minorities in advertising, as well as implicit tactics such as like lying about standards for rental qualification to disqualify certain individuals, unfair financing or loan qualifications or terms, steering or restricting the choices of people seeking homes, and refusing to provide insurance, which would prevent the individual or family from acquiring a home. Consumer advocate groups conducted studies and found that many minority borrowers who were eligible for affordable, traditional loans were often steered toward incredibly high-priced subprime loans that they would never be able to repay.\\"Fair Lending and Accountability\\" New York Times, September 7, 2011. The majority of discriminatory actors in exclusionary discrimination are landlords and landowners, as they have the positional power and direct access to the individual or family and the housing being sought. Other discriminatory actors or institutions responsible for exclusion include real estate, insurance, and banking and lending agents and institutions.South, S. J., & Crowder, K. D. (1998). Housing discrimination and residential mobility: Impacts for blacks and whites. Population Research and Policy Review, 17(4), 369-369-387. ===Nonexclusionary=== Nonexclusionary discrimination practices refer to \\"actions and practices that occur within an already established housing arrangement, most often entailing racial harassment, differential treatment of tenants, or disparate application of contractual terms and conditions of residency.\\" Individuals and families already housed experience ongoing intimidation, differential treatment, and harassment, and nonexclusionary discrimination often results in distress for victims since the victim is often legally bound to the home and usually has direct contact with the perpetrator on a regular basis. Landlords and owners are still responsible for the majority of this type of housing discrimination, but neighbors and banking and lending institutions participate more. For instance, even without institutionalized exclusionary power, residential neighbors can harass and intimidate tenants. Most nonexclusionary discrimination cases involve applying discriminatory terms and conditions within the victim's current residential setting. The majority of these cases involve terms, conditions, and privileges relating to a current rental arrangement. These cases are often seen as unfairly raising the rent of a select group or allowing certain tenants privileges, like using a facility after hours or being lenient on pet policies. Many nonexclusionary discrimination cases involve the failure to provide equal access to services and facilities, such as purposely delaying or completely forgoing fixing a broken pipe. More terms and conditions cases involve discriminatory financing, loans, and appraisals of the individual or family's property, which is when the discriminatory actor takes advantage of the victim financially. Other forms of nonexclusionary discrimination include the use of harassment, intimidation, and coercion toward victims. This includes racial slurs and threats of violence, both of which create an uneasy environment in which the victims live.http://www.lawhelp.org/documents/871H-06%20Housing%20Discrimination.pdf These forms can cause excessive anxiety and stress for the individual or family affected. If an individual holding a position of an authority, such as the landlord, is responsible for the nonexclusionary discrimination, the victim is left with a feeling of powerlessness and lack of ability to get help. == Gender discrimination == In many countries, structural discrimination in housing disadvantages men and favors women. This is typically studied by correspondence studies, where fictitious applications are sent to landlords and real-estate agents. The experimenter can then manipulate the name of the applicant to change gender or ethnicity while keeping everything else identical. In 2018, a meta-analysis of 25 correspondence studies in 15 OECD countries (totalizing over 110,000 letters) found that women are 30% more likely than men to be chosen, everything else being equal. There is an interaction between sexism and racism, so that sexist discrimination in stronger against men of ethnic minorities. However, men from the dominant majority also suffer from discrimination compared to women. Consistently, men make up the vast majority of homeless people and a 2019 French study found that 90% of homeless people who die in the street are men. == By country == === Canada === In Ontario, housing discrimination is addressed under the Ontario Human Rights Code. ===United States=== In the United States, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is charged with enforcing fair housing laws, based on the Fair Housing Act of 1968. A study conducted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) found that \\"the greatest share of discrimination for Hispanic and African American home seekers can still be attributed to being told units are unavailable when they are available to non-Hispanic whites and being shown and told about less units than a comparable non-minority.\\" ==See also== *Right to housing *Ownership equity *Real estate economics *Redlining *Subprime *Subsidized housing ==References== ==Further reading== * Richard R.W.

Crude grinding and mixing operations like the Frankford Powder-Mill of Philadelphia were a cottage industry until the industrial revolution brought improved product quality through the following procedures: ==Milling steps== * Charcoal was often manufactured nearby from locally available trees, but the heating retorts were typically separated from the other buildings to minimize fire danger. Trees with low value as sources of lumber were debarked, dried, and cut to uniform length to fit into iron retorts with cast iron doors. The retorts were carefully packed to leave as little air space as possible, and the retort doors were closed and sealed with clay to prevent entry of air as the retorts were heated by external fires. Volatile gas generated by the heating process was vented through a small flue at the top of each retort. After the external fires were extinguished, the retorts were allowed to cool before the doors were opened to remove the charcoal. * High purity sulfur usually required little preparation other than grinding to a powder. Separate grinding mills reduced cool charcoal and sulfur to fine powders. * Crude saltpeter was dissolved in a pot of boiling water. After boiling, a small amount of floating glue might be added to the hot water to aid skimming off floating impurities. The hot solution was then carefully decanted to avoid suspending insoluble solid impurities settled to the bottom of the pot. The hot decanted liquid was distributed into shallow wooden vats where evaporative cooling would remove excess water. Purified potassium nitrate recrystallized while the cooling solution was gently agitated with broad hoes to prevent formation of large crystals. * Powdered sulfur and charcoal were combined in appropriate ratios with moist saltpeter crystals, and the moist paste was mixed and compacted by kneading beneath heavy rotating wheels in a press mill.Braddock, John. A memoir on gunpowder: in which are discussed, the principles both of its manufacture and proof.. Madras: Printed at the Church Mission Press, 1829. Print. * The compressed cake was transferred to a corning mill or kernelling mill to be cut into pieces of approximately correct size by bronze- or zinc-toothed wheels. * Kernelling mill products were sorted by size using leather sieves. Oversize product was returned to the kernelling mill, while undersize product was returned to the press mill. * Sorted kernels of desired size were dried and mixed with graphite to be tumbled in glazing mill barrels. Graphite coating reduced the tendency of grains to stick together in storage. * Glazed product was typically packaged in wooden kegs. Filled kegs were transported away from the mill as soon as possible to a powder magazine for wholesale distribution. The potential for destructive energy release from powder magazine accidents required the magazines to be distant from both the powder mill and other places of business or habitation. ==Explosions== Gunpowder is very easily ignited by static electricity or lightning strikes, and most powder mills experienced occasional accidental explosions. Powder mill explosions typically destroyed an entire building and killed those working in the vicinity of the building. Explosions might throw flaming debris which could ignite other buildings. Successful mills were typically built as an arrangement of separate buildings to minimize the loss from any single building explosion. Buildings were separated by enough distance to minimize the risk of being damaged by an explosion in an adjacent building. Buildings were usually built of stone with one weak wooden wall and roof to direct the force and debris from an accidental explosion toward a river or an open field. ==Power supply== Powder mills were originally powered by windmills, water mills or horse mills. Despite later availability of steam engines, the older power sources did not require a fire to generate steam, and avoided the possibility of sparks which might ignite the gunpowder. Some 20th-century powder mills used electric power. Before the availability of safe electrical power, some of the most successful mills were built along rivers where water could be distributed through a power canal to individual buildings and intermediate products could be floated from one building to the next. The power canal offered a supply of firefighting water, and the adjacent river was a relatively safe direction to focus explosion debris. Where water transport was impractical, intermediate products were often transported in wagons pulled by draft animals. The wagons were often built entirely of wood held together with wooden pegs, and draft animals were usually unshod to avoid sparks from steel shoes or nails. ==In the United States== The 1810 census reported 208 powder mills in the United States. In 1802, the DuPont family started their industrial enterprises in the United States by building the Eleutherian Mills on the Brandywine Creek in Delaware.Rideal, Charles Frederick, and Freeman Morris. A century of success: the history of a great industry ; what it has accomplished ; a record of progress and sustained work : the E.I. du Pont de Nemours Powder Co., from its foundation to the present time. New York, N.Y.: Business America, 19111912. Print. Four mills were manufacturing 69 percent of United States gunpowder when gunpowder production peaked during the American Civil War. They were the DuPont mill, the Hazard Powder Company of Hazardville, Connecticut, the Oriental Powder Company of Windham, Maine, and the Laflin Powder Company of Newburgh, New York.Wilson, Mark R. The business of civil war: military mobilization and the state, 1861-1865 (2006) JHU Press p.118 The Confederate Powderworks of Augusta, Georgia produced 6,000 tonnes of gunpowder from 1862 to 1865, but was dismantled after the war. The Laflin company merged into the Laflin & Rand Powder Company after the war, and with the other three large northern mills formed the United States Gunpowder Trade Association in 1872 including the American Powder Mills of Maynard, Massachusetts, the Austin Powder Company of Glenwillow, Ohio, and the Miami Powder Company of Goes Station, Ohio. Most smaller mills were unable to compete with this trade association, popularly known as the powder trust; although regionally important mills including the California Powder Works of Santa Cruz, California, the Equitable Powder Company of East Alton, Illinois, and the Great Western Powder Works of Kings Mills, Ohio successfully transitioned to manufacture of smokeless powder cartridges. As smokeless powder and high explosives replaced gunpowder for most purposes, DuPont became the major manufacturer of United States gunpowder until discontinuing production in 1971. Subsequent production for use in pyrotechnics and antique firearms has been undertaken by smaller firms whose operations are often ended by the persistent hazard of accidental explosions. ==Europe== Notable European mills include: * Grenelle Mill - France * Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills, Cork, Ireland * Faversham explosives industry, Faversham, England * Poudrerie nationale de Vonges, Vonges, C√¥te-d'Or, France * Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills, Waltham Abbey, Essex, England * Poudrerie d'Aubonne, Kanton Vaud, Switzerland ==References== Category:Firearm industry Category:Grinding mills ","title":"Powder mill"},{"id":"17319745","text":"Samantha Rowley (born 30 January 1988) is a British actress and model.

Durham, North Carolina: Baseball America, 2007. The Bears succeeded the Newark Indians, originally the Sailors, who played in the same circuit (known as the Eastern League prior to 1912) from 1902. During the Bears' lifetime, the International League was graded one step below the Major League Baseball level, Class AA through 1945 and Triple-A starting in 1946. The franchise played its home games at Ruppert Stadium in what is now known as the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey; the stadium was demolished in 1967. The 1932, 1937, 1938, and 1941 Bears were recognized as being among the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. Players in the Bears' early years who had Major League careers include Eddie Rommel, who pitched for the International League Newark Bears in 1918 and 1919. Harry Baldwin played three seasons for the Newark Bears (1921‚Äì1923) before playing for the New York Giants. Fred Brainard, who also played for the New York Giants 1914‚Äì1916, later played for the Newark Bears between 1922‚Äì1924 and was the Bears' player-manager in 1923 and 1924. Other former Major League players who managed the Newark Bears include Hall of Fame members Walter Johnson in 1928 and player-manager Tris Speaker in 1929‚Äì1930. Newark was a hotbed of minor league baseball from the time of the formation of the Sailors, and the addition of the Newark Eagles of the Negro National Leagues in 1936. A Federal League team, the Newark Peppers, played in 1915. The Bears, however, temporarily relocated twice, in 1920 as the Akron Buckeyes and from May 16 through September 27, 1925 as the Providence Grays. in 1931, Jacob Ruppert, owner of the New York Yankees, bought the Bears and made them the top club in the Yankees' growing farm system; they would remain one of the Bombers' top-level minor-league clubs for the rest of their existence. In 1937, the Bears featured one of the most potent lineups in baseball, including Charlie Keller, Joe Gordon, Spud Chandler and George McQuinn, among others. They won the pennant by 25¬Ω games to become known as one of the greatest minor league teams of all time.Suehsdorf, A. D. (1978). The Great American Baseball Scrapbook, p. 100. Random House. . Their legacy was ensured when, after trailing 3 games to 0, they won the last four games against the Columbus Red Birds of the American Association to capture the Junior World Series. Following the 1949 season, the Bears moved to Springfield, Massachusetts. Their departure, and the departure of the Eagles a year before, left Newark without professional baseball for nearly 50 years, until the formation of the Atlantic League Bears (see above). One of the Bears' players, veteran pitcher George Earl Toolson, was reassigned by the Yankees to the AA Binghamton Triplets for the 1950 season. He refused to report and sued, challenging baseball's reserve clause in Toolson v. New York Yankees, which went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices upheld the clause and baseball's antitrust exemption, 7‚Äì2. ==Season-by-season records== { class= +Newark Bears ‚Äì 1926 to 1949 - !Season !Affiliation !Manager !Record - 1926NoneFred Burchell99‚Äì66, 3rd place - 1927NoneJohn Egan90‚Äì77, 3rd place - 1928NoneWalter Johnson81‚Äì84, 7th place - 1929NoneTris Speaker81‚Äì85, 7th place - 1930NoneTris Speaker/Al Mamaux80‚Äì88, 5th place - 1931NoneAl Mamaux99‚Äì69, 2nd place - 1932YankeesAl Mamaux109‚Äì59, 1st place - 1933YankeesAl Mamaux102‚Äì62, 1st place South - 1934YankeesBob Shawkey93‚Äì60, 1st place - 1935YankeesBob Shawkey81‚Äì71, 4th place - 1936YankeesOssie Vitt88‚Äì67, 3rd place - 1937YankeesOssie Vitt109‚Äì43, 1st place - 1938YankeesJohnny Neun104‚Äì48, 1st place - 1939YankeesJohnny Neun82‚Äì73, 4th place - 1940YankeesJohnny Neun95‚Äì65, 2nd place - 1941YankeesJohnny Neun100‚Äì54, 1st place - 1942YankeesBilly Meyer92‚Äì61, 1st place - 1943YankeesBilly Meyer85‚Äì68, 2nd place - 1944YankeesBilly Meyer85‚Äì69, 2nd place - 1945YankeesBilly Meyer89‚Äì64, 2nd place - 1946YankeesGeorge Selkirk80‚Äì74, 4th place - 1947YankeesGeorge Selkirk65‚Äì89, 6th place - 1948YankeesBill Skiff80‚Äì72, 2nd place - 1949YankeesBuddy Hassett55‚Äì98, 8th place } { align=left border=4 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4 - !align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"1\\"Totals !align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"1\\"Overall record !align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"1\\"Winning percentage - !(1926‚Äì1949)  2,039‚Äì1,586  .562 } ===Post-season results=== *1932: Defeated Minneapolis Millers (American Association), 4 games to 2, in Junior World Series *1933: Lost to Rochester Red Wings, 3 games to 1, in opening round *1934: Lost to Toronto Maple Leafs, 4 games to 3, in opening round *1935: Lost to Syracuse Chiefs, 4 games to 0, in opening round *1936: Lost to Buffalo Bisons, 4 games to 1, in opening round *1937: Defeated Syracuse Chiefs, 4 games to 0; defeated Baltimore Orioles, 4 games to 0, for league championship; defeated Columbus Red Birds, 4 games to 3, in Junior World Series *1938: Defeated Rochester Red Wings, 4 games to 3; defeated Buffalo Bisons, 4 games to 1, for league championship; lost to Kansas City Blues, 4 games to 3, in Junior World Series *1939: Defeated Jersey City Giants, 4 games to 2; lost to Rochester Red Wings, 4 games to 3, in championship round *1940: Defeated Jersey City Giants, 4 games to 0; defeated Baltimore Orioles, 4 games to 3, for league championship; defeated Louisville Colonels, 4 games to 2, in Junior World Series *1941: Defeated Rochester Red Wings, 4 games to 1; lost to Montreal Royals, 4 games to 3, in championship round *1942: Lost to Jersey City Giants, 4 games to 2, in opening round *1943: Lost to Syracuse Chiefs, 4 games to 2, in opening round *1944: Defeated Toronto Maple Leafs, 4 games to 0; lost to Baltimore Orioles, 4 games to 3, in championship round *1945: Defeated Toronto Maple Leafs, 4 games to 2; defeated Montreal Royals, 4 games to 3, for league championship; lost to Louisville Colonels, 4 games to 2, in Junior World Series *1946: Lost to Montr√©al Royals, 4 games to 2, in opening round *1948: Lost to Syracuse Chiefs, 4 games to 3, in opening round ===Titles=== The Bears won the Governors' Cup, the championship of the IL, 4 times, and played in the championship series 7 times. *1937 ‚Äì Defeated Baltimore *1938 ‚Äì Defeated Buffalo *1939 ‚Äì Lost to Rochester *1940 ‚Äì Defeated Baltimore *1941 ‚Äì Lost to Montreal *1944 ‚Äì Lost to Baltimore *1945 ‚Äì Defeated Montreal ===Other historical Newark teams=== Other teams hailing from Newark include: * Newark Domestics, played in the Eastern League from 1884 to 1885. * Newark Little Giants, played in the Eastern League in 1886, and the International League in 1887. * Newark, played in the Central League in 1888, and the Atlantic Association from 1889 to 1890. * Newark, played in the Atlantic League in 1896, and from 1899 to 1900. * Newark Indians, played in the Eastern League from 1902 to 1911, and the International League from 1912 to the middle of the 1915 season.

Her maternal grandfather was Anselmo, Marquess of Bosco. She was a sister of William VI, Marquess of Montferrat and Beatrice of Montferrat, wife of Henry II del Carretto, Marquess of Savona. She was also an older, paternal half-sister of Demetrius of Montferrat, King of Thessalonica. == Empress consort == According to Geoffrey of Villehardouin, Agnes was residing in Lombardy until her father summoned her to Thessaloniki in 1206. Boniface proceeded to send Otto de la Roche, or grand seignior of Athens, as his envoy to Henry, proposing a marriage between her and the emperor. Henry agreed to the offer.Geoffrey de Villehardouin, \\"Memoirs or Chronicle of The Fourth Crusade and The Conquest of Constantinople \\" Boniface sent Agnes to Abydos, Hellespont, Mysia through a galley. His messengers then reached Henry with information to her location. Geoffrey Villehardouin himself and Miles of Brabant were assigned to escort her. Villehardouin describes Agnes as \\"very good and fair\\". Agnes was escorted to Constantinople with no mentioned incident. On 4 February 1207, Agness married Henry of Flanders. According to Villehardouin, the marriage took place in Hagia Sophia, Constantinople on the Sunday following Candemass. The wedding feast took place in Boukoleon Palace. According to the Dictionnaire historique et G√©n√©alogique des grandes familles de Gr√®ce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople (1983) by Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza, the marriage was part of a new alliance between Boniface and Henry against Kaloyan of Bulgaria. Villehardouin records that in about September, 1207, Henry informed his father-in-law of Agnes being pregnant. A source or rejoicing for both allies. The chronicle ends with the death of Boniface on 4 September 1207 and thus does not report of the conclusion of the pregnancy. As there seems to be no further mention of Agnes, the empress is considered to have died in childbirth, probably along with her child. In 1208, there is mention by Henri de Valenciennes of a daughter of Henry marrying Alexander, a nephew of Peter IV of Bulgaria, Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria and Kaloyan of Bulgaria. However, as a daughter of Agnes, said daughter would be a newborn, an unlikely age for marriage. She is therefore considered to have been an illegitimate child of Henry by a mistress. == References == == External links == * *A genealogical profile of her Category:1180s births Category:1200s deaths Category:Deaths in childbirth Category:Latin Empresses of Constantinople Category:Aleramici Category:House of Hainaut Category:12th-century Italian women Category:13th-century Italian women ","title":"Agnes of Montferrat"},{"id":"17319910","text":"Thumpoly is coastal town in the Alappuzha District of Kerala.

Samuel Gompers, the organization's leader, characterized it as a monument to the power of labor, and its dedication include a speech by President Woodrow Wilson. The AFL continued to occupy the building until 1955, when its merger with the CIO prompted a need for additional office space. The building was then purchased by the Pipefitters Union, which used it as its headquarters. During its ownership the interior was modernized. The union sold the building in 2005 to the developers of the Washington Marriott Marquis, which serves as the main hotel for the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, which is located across the street. The interior spaces of the AFL building now house a lounge space, the hotel's fitness center, and four high-end suites. ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C. *National Register of Historic Places listings in central Washington, D.C. ==References== Category:National Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C.

There was also a Forces Aviation (2.3% of aircraft) flying liaison aircraft as part of the Corps and Armies' independent flights and squadrons.Svischev From 1942 the aviation divisions were combined into the Air Armies of the Red Army ground forces, assigned one to each Front, Air Defence Forces (PVO) Armies (including the 1st Fighter Army of the PVO), Soviet Naval Aviation and Aviation of the Reserve of the Supreme Command. In organisational terms the aviation divisions were often combined into the aviation corps or an Air Army. In terms of combat assignment the aviation divisions were divided into the bombardment aviation divisions (BAD), assault aviation divisions (ShAD), fighter aviation divisions (IAD), mixed aviation divisions (usually one to a Combined Arms Army; SmAD) and transport aviation divisions (TAD).pp. 15‚Äì16, Wagner Postwar, fighter bomber aviation divisions (IBAD or ADIB since 1976) and heavy bomber aviation divisions (TBAD) were formed. In 1956, the assault aviation divisions were converted into other units. The composition of the aviation divisions during wartime was not uniform or constant. Although many divisions begun the war with 3 ‚Äì 5 aviation regiments, due to the heavy losses suffered in the initial period of the Summer-Autumn Campaign of 1941 (22 June ‚Äì 4 December), during Operation Barbarossa, from August this was reduced to two with consequent reduction in aircraft from 150‚Äì180 to 40‚Äì50. However, commencing with Autumn 1942 the size of the aviation divisions began to increase again, and some had four aviation regiments, or five in the PVO and mixed divisions. However the number of mixed divisions, and expediency of 1942, was gradually reduced and from 1944 the Frontal Aviation divisions adopted a 3‚Äì4 regiment structure, with the 3 regiments being the more common occurrence in the bombing divisions with some 100 aircraft while the fighter and assault divisions were issued 124 aircraft. The mission profile was flexible depending on the target, with the aviation division deploying as part of the aviation corps, Air Army or independently, utilising the entire aircraft complement, or by regiments, squadrons, flights and even individual aircraft. Bonn et al. wrote in 2005 that the Soviet Air Forces included 10 basic air divisions at the start of the war, 37 basic air divisions were formed during it, of which only three survived to the end. Seven mixed air divisions existed at the start of the war, and 44 were generated during it. Thirteen were destroyed and disbanded, and the rest converted into other types of divisions. Not a single mixed air division was active at the end of the war. Only one was raised to Guards status, and that, the 1st Guards Mixed Air Division, was converted to the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Division after November 1944. Seven bombardment air divisions were active at the beginning of the war, with 66 created during its course. Twenty-seven of the 66 were destroyed, disbanded, or otherwise converted. Eighteen became Guards divisions. Twenty-two specialist long-range air divisions were created during the war, though all were converted to bomber divisions. Forty-eight ground-attack divisions were formed during the war, of which two were destroyed or disbanded and eighteen which became Guards. Eleven fighter divisions existed at the beginning of the war. A hundred and nine in total were formed, of which eleven were destroyed or disbanded, fifteen converted, and 18 became Guards. ==Soviet aviation divisions during the Second World War== The list below includes divisions of the Long Range Air Force. * 1st Mixed Aviation Division * 1st Ferry Red Banner Aviation Division GVF (Civilian Air Fleet) * 1st Aviation Transport Division GVF * 1st Transport Aviation Division * 1st Stalingrad Long-Range Aviation Division- became 1st Stalingrad Red Banner Bomber Aviation Division * 1st Night Heavy Bomber Aviation Division * 1st School Bomber Aviation Division * 2nd Mixed Aviation Division * 2nd Special Purpose Aviation Division * 3rd Bombardment Aviation Division * 3rd Long-Range Aviation Division * 3rd Special Red Banner Communications Aviation Division GVF * 4th Mixed Aviation Division ‚Äì became 4th Shock Army aviation 22 February 1942 * 5th Mixed Aviation Division ‚Äì disbanded 18 February 1942 * 6th Mixed Aviation Division ‚Äì at outbreak of war in Baltic Special Military District, suffered heavy losses in initial German attack, became 48th Army aviation 11 August 1941; reformed immediately and disbanded 11 February 1942 * 7th Mixed Aviation Division ‚Äì at outbreak of war in Baltic Special Military District, suffered heavy losses in initial German attack, became 3rd Shock Army aviation 22 February 1942 * 8th Mixed Aviation Division * 8th Bombardment Aviation Division * 9th Mixed Aviation Division ‚Äì Served with the Western Special Military District at the outbreak of war, comprising the 13th, 14th, 124th, 126th, 128th, and 129th Fighter Aviation Regiments.

Its authorship was traditionally attributed to William Rowley, though modern scholarship has questioned Rowley's sole authorship; Thomas Heywood and George Wilkins have been proposed as possible contributors. The story is based on the life of Sir Stephen Foster, who was imprisoned in Ludgate for debt and in 1454 became Lord Mayor of London. He later married Agnes Forster in the play, who renovated and enlarged the prison. A New Wonder was entered into the Stationers' Register on 24 November 1631, and was first printed in quarto in 1632 by the bookseller Francis Constable. The 1632 quarto was the only edition in the seventeenth century. The play's date of authorship is uncertain; it is often assigned to the 1610-14 period. Rowley may have revised an earlier play by Heywood called The Wonder of a Woman (1595).Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 474. The play was adapted and revived by James Robinson Planch√© in 1824. ==Synopsis== The play opens with two London merchants and partners, Old Foster and the Alderman Bruin, anticipating major profits from their successful trading voyages. Their conversation quickly turns to personal matters: Old Foster's reprobate brother Stephen is in Ludgate prison for his debts, and Old Foster has fallen out with his son Robert over the son's efforts to alleviate the prisoner's condition. The Foster family situation is complicated by Old Foster's recent marriage to a wealthy widow; the new Mistress Foster is no friend of her brother-in-law and son-in-law. Alderman Bruin tries vainly to patch up the Foster quarrel; he is the play's consistent voice of forbearance and Christian charity. But Old Foster is unyielding, and soon disowns his son for the young man's consistent efforts in favor of the uncle. The play's second scene introduces the title character, the woman, otherwise unnamed, known as the Widow, or \\"the rich widow of Cornhill.\\" The Widow is the friend and \\"gossip\\" of Mistress Foster; her servant Roger is the play's Clown, who provides much of its comic material. (In the play's final two acts, the Widow and Mistress Foster are not merely friends but sisters. This plot inconsistency may be one indication of multiple authorship.) In conversation with a clergyman, the Widow expresses her strange predicament: she has lived the first 37 years of her life with no significant troubles -- she a woman who has never been \\"vexed.\\" She confesses to a bit of unhappiness when her husband died...which ended when she thought of him as \\"stellified in heaven.\\" Her good fortune is illustrated by a folklore motif: her wedding ring slips off her finger while she is crossing the Thames -- but the ring turns up in the salmon served for her dinner. The Widow is dissatisfied with the sheer magnitude of her happiness; her life is too good. Robert Foster manages to free his uncle from Ludgate; but Stephen Foster quickly returns to dicing and brawling in a gambling house. Mistress Foster, accompanied by the Widow, follows son-in-law Robert to the gaming house; while there, the Widow strikes up an odd conversation with Stephen Foster. She presents him with a plan to repair his decayed fortunes: he should marry a rich widow. The rich widow she has in mind is herself: she hopes that marrying the ne'er-do-well Stephen will provide the vexation missing from her life. Alderman Bruin looks forward to devoting his mercantile profits to charitable purposes; he plans to build a hostel for poor travellers. When their ships reach Dover on their way to London, Old Foster offers to buy out Bruin's share in their venture. This will give Bruin immediate cash for his charity, and maximize Foster's profits. Bruin agrees, and sells his share in the venture for ¬£25,000. When the ships reach the mouth of the Thames, however, they are sunk by a sudden storm, and Old Foster meets abrupt financial ruin. He seeks refuge from his creditors in Ludgate prison; the brothers' fortunes at the start of the play are now completely reversed. The Widow is surprised to find that Stephen gives up his wastrel ways once married. He studies her accounts, and learns that she is owed funds by various debtors; he sets out in pursuit of the moneys. Old Foster remains hostile to both his brother and son, and the son now tries to relieve his father's sufferings as he previously did his uncle's. Stephen Foster pretends a persistent hostility to his brother, though it is feigned as a way of testing and reforming his difficult relative. Stephen's reversal of fortune carries him to a new height when he is selected as the next sheriff of London. The play's subplot involves Alderman Bruin's daughter Jane; she is a sensible virgin pestered by foolish suitors, a type that recurs in plays of the period. (For other examples of the type, see Moll Bloodhound in A Match at Midnight, and Aemilia Littlegood in A Fine Companion.) In her case, the foolish suitors are Innocent Lambskin, a silly young man, and Sir Godfrey Speedwell, a quarrelsome old knight. Jane has a preference for Robert Foster; and his uncle Stephen is able to scare off Speedwell and Lambskin to his son's advantage, since both are among the Widow's debtors. Stephen offers to two hapless suitors a chance to redeem their debts for only 10% of what they owe; and Robert uses the money to support his father in prison. This act of generosity wins over Old Foster at last. In the play's final scene, King Henry III and his courtiers come to celebrate the establishment of Alderman Bruin's charity. Stephen Foster uses the occasion to work a general reconciliation among his family and achieve a happy ending. ==Notes== ==References== *Chambers, E. K.

As a moderate liberal politician, he was one of the major opponents of State Chancellor Prince Klemens von Metternich during the Vorm√§rz era. In the March Revolution of 1848, Kolowrat became the first constitutional Minister- President of Austria; however, he resigned after one month in office. ==Life== He was born and raised in the Bohemian capital Prague, a scion of the Bohemian family of high nobility (the House of Kolowrat), whose ancestors had already served under the Luxembourg emperor Charles IV. Having finished his studies at Charles University, Franz Anton entered the Austrian civil service at the Beroun district administration in January 1799. During the Napoleonic Wars he achieved the office of a stadtholder of the Habsburg emperor Francis I of Austria at PragueK.u.K. office, head of country administration and in 1810 became Oberstburggraf of the Bohemian kingdom.Highest office of the Bohemian kingdom, held by a Lord (baron), member of the higher of the two ranks of nobility. After 1627 largely ceremonial, nevertheless prestigious, as the holder acted at ceremonial occasions as the prime representative of Bohemian nobility towards the king. Before 1627, in king's absence held his place at the land Diet and High Court, when king was present, was seated at his feet (i.e. at the central place). Contrary to Chancellor Metternich, he encouraged Czech cultural and civic-national movements, exemplified by the founding of the Prague National Museum in 1818. Kolowrat's rivalry with Metternich intensified when in 1826 the emperor called him to Vienna, where he was elevated to lead the Austrian State Council responsible for the Interior and Finances. The tensions between him and the chancellor continued: while Metternich favored a strong army, Kolowrat reduced the military budget.Rothenburg, G. The Army of Francis Joseph. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 10. After the accession of Francis' incapable son Ferdinand I to the throne in 1835, Kolowrat together with Metternich led the Secret State Conference, the de facto government of the Empire from 1836 to 1848. However, the continuous disagreement between the two leaders palsied the Austrian politics and ultimately contributed to collapse of the \\"Metternich system\\". Upon the outbreak of the Revolutions of 1848, Metternich had to resign. A ministers' conference was established and Kolowrat assumed the newly created office of an Austrian minister-president, which he nevertheless laid down after only one month between 3‚Äì5 April, officially for health reasons. Kolowrat retired to private life; he died in Vienna aged 83. With his death, the Liebsteinsky branch of the Kolowrat dynasty became extinct. ==Decorations== * Order of the Golden Fleece * Order of Leopold * Order of St. Andrew * Order of St. Anna * Order of St. Vladimir * Order of the White Eagle * Order of Alexander Nevsky * Venerable Order of Saint John ==References== ==External links== Category:1778 births Category:1861 deaths Category:19th- century Ministers-President of Austria Category:Politicians from Prague Category:Bohemian nobility Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Austria ","title":"Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky"},{"id":"17320028","text":"Queren√ßa, T√¥r e Benafim is a civil parish in the municipality of Loul√©, Portugal.

She dreamt of being a star at an early age, having been inspired by the theatrical personality of Rev. Ralph Washington Sockman, the minister of Christ Church Methodist, the church she attended in Manhattan.http://www.DarkShadows.Online As a teenager, she appeared in an Off-Broadway production, and also did modelling. With her dark red hair, green eyes, classic features, and tall, slender figure, she was popular on the runway, and often did print work. In 1959, Marie performed on Broadway as a showgirl in Gypsy starring Ethel Merman.Marie Wallace at IBDB Marie continued to perform in Broadway shows in the 1960s and early 1970s including the 1966 production of Sweet Charity in the role of \\"Ursula\\". ==Dark Shadows== In 1968, Marie received national attention when she landed the first of three roles in the Gothic soap opera Dark Shadows produced by Dan Curtis. Her first appearance was on October 4, and she played the part of the diabolical Frankenstein-like monster \\"Eve\\". She would go on to play the demented wife of Quentin, \\"Jenny Collins\\", Marie's personal favorite character, who was notable for her unkempt mane of red hair, black lace dress, and hysterical, cackling laughter. Her last part in the series was \\"Megan Todd\\", an antique shop owner in the \\"Leviathan\\" storyline. Her final episode on the program was aired March 16, 1970. In 2009, she returned to the world of Dark Shadows in the series of audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions.

She continued to perform on Broadway, in soap operas, the theatre, and did many television commercials. In 1993, she played the part of Eleanor of Aquitaine in a stage production of The Lion In Winter which was directed by her former Dark Shadows co-star Jonathan Frid.

Katovice is located to the west of the town of Strakonice in the center of the former Pr√°che≈àsko region on the Otava River. ==Population== Statue of Jan Hus in Katovice The population of Katovice has been slightly over 1,000 inhabitants for more than 40 years. On December 31, 1974 there lived 1,752 people, which is the highest number of inhabitants in modern history. ==History== According to a book Soln√© stezky na ≈†umavƒõ (1994) by Ji≈ô√≠ Andreska, the area where Katovice are located these days, there used to lead the salt trail in 1st century BC. First people who settled in Knƒõ≈æ√≠ hora were the Celts in 8th century AD. At Knƒõ≈æ√≠ hora they founded a great Slavic settlement which is recognizable to today. The 10th and 11th century was fairly important for its history as gold-washing started being popular in Otava river in Katovice and many gold hunters settled at the banks of Otava river. The first written record of Katovice is dated back to 1045, when Duke B≈ôetislav I donated the settlement to the B≈ôevnov Monastery. Since then Katovice were mainly an agricultural village. In 1867, emperor Franz Joseph I built the first railroad which serves till today. Since 1902 until 1922, graphite was extracted from the steep hills of Knƒõ≈æ√≠ hora. Before the end of World War II, on April 20, 1945, American fighting jets attacked a train carrying concentration camp prisoners that stopped at local railway station. More than 200 prisoners managed to run away. However, few of them were consequently tracked down by the SS men and killed instantly. ==Sport== Local football team SK Otava Katovice participates in South Bohemian Regional Championship (4th tier of Czech football system).

The series, which began in 2008 and aired on The Sundance Channel, is conceived, written, and directed by its star, Isabella Rossellini. In the eight films that comprise the first season, Rossellini enacts the mating rituals of various insects and other animals (including the dragonfly, spider, bee, praying mantis, earthworm, snail and housefly) with cardboard cut-outs and foam-rubber sculptures. Season two is devoted to marine life. Season three deals with ocean life threatened by commercial fishing. ==Origins== According to Rossellini, the idea for Green Porno stemmed from her relationships with both Robert Redford and his Sundance Channel. Rossellini had previously worked with Sundance on a previous short film My Dad Is 100 Years Old. Redford believed that the internet and the burgeoning mobile internet, allowed for the \\"re- launch of the short film format.\\" The Sundance Channel set aside an experimental budget and proposed that Rossellini's project should fall into the purview of Sundance's program The Green. Rossellini's love of animals and desire to balance out the current projects focusing on home and food with the animals that ‚Äúsurround us every day‚Äù yet have an ‚Äúincredible variety of mating, which is very scandalous.‚Äù ==Concept and growth== Isabella Rossellini (left) with Jody Shapiro (center) and Andy Byers (right) at the Sundance Kabuki Rossellini says that she does a great deal of research before each episode, then spends a while determining how to translate that research into \\"something visual and how to make it comical.\\" The goal, according to Rossellini, is to be both entertaining and educational. Jody Shapiro and Rick Gilbert are responsible for translating the research and concepts that Rossellini has into the paper and paste costumes which directly contribute to the series' unique visual style. After the costumes are designed, approximately one animal is filmed per day, for a total production time of about ten months per season. Over the course of Green Porno's three seasons, the focus of the show has shifted. Season one dealt exclusively with invertebrates that humans can realistically encounter on a daily basis. The second season focused on sea creatures, but also included an episode on the sexual organs. For the third and shortest season, Green Porno adopted an overt environmental theme, specifically one which focused on the issue of over- fishing as contrasted with the mating habits of animals commonly used as food. In season three, Rossellini is joined by biologist Claudio Campagna. ==Multimedia expansion== With the third season, Sundance Channel embarked on a Green Porno multimedia push. All four episodes of the season premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on Friday, September 11, 2009. On September 14, 2009 the series premiered on the Sundance Channel's website, and September 21, 2009 saw the broadcast television premier. Green Porno: A Book and Short Films (HarperStudio ‚Äì 2009) was released in September 2009, eight days after the internet premier of web series' third season. The book served as a supplement to the series and included full color photos, backstage footage shot by her nephew Tommaso Rossellini, and a DVD with all three seasons worth of Green Porno short films. ===Sequel series=== Bon Appetit was the theme of the third season of Green Porno, looking into the reproductive behavior of sea creatures that are part of the food industry, and the environmentally unsound practices involved in the fisheries. Seduce Me was called the \\"spawn\\" of Green Porno, and featured several short films on the various courtship displays and mating behavior of a wider range of animals. Rossellini also worked with Burt's Bees in a short series called \\"Burt Talks to the Bees\\" discussing the biology and behavior of honey bees as well as colony collapse disorder. In 2013, a third series titled Mammas looks at the various levels of parental investment mother animals give to their offspring, appropriately released on Mother's Day. Rossellini also filmed a special for the Discovery Channel titled Animals Distract Me in the style of her Green Porno and other videos, describing the nature of the various animals in everyday life. ==Supporting cast== The Male Bees are played by Roberto Rossellini, Dallas Giorgi, and Louis Giacobetti. The part of the Baby Bee Larva is played by Ona Grandey. ==Awards and Media references== *2009 Webby ‚Äì Online Film and Video ‚Äì Best Individual Performance ‚Äì Isabella Rossellini *2009 Webby ‚Äì Online Film and Video ‚Äì Experimental ‚Äì Green Porno The series was mentioned by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report on 12 May 2008.

In 1807, he returned to Vienna as assistant to the court councillor Baron von Baldacci. This put him in the centre of the action when the war with Napoleon broke out. In the disadvantageous peace according to the 1809 Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn that followed, the Austrian foreign minister Johann Philipp von Stadion had to resign and a new ministry was formed, with Prince Metternich at its head. Baldacci moved to the periphery of power, but Pillersdorff advanced to court secretary and then became a court councillor. Here, Pillersdorff had ample opportunity to acquaint himself with the great disarray in the operation of the Austrian state, and how necessary reform was, but uncommonly difficult to implement. The events of 1812-1815 increased the oppressive political climate still more. Baldacci became minister of the army and headed the administration of the occupied zones in France, and Pillersdorf was put at his side. Pillersdorf's stay in France and travels to the United Kingdom gave him the opportunity to make comparative studies and think about how the people could start participating in lawmaking and government in Austria as well. But the time had not come for such changes in Austria, since Emperor Francis I kept the reins of power tightly to himself. After the Napoleonic Wars, Austrian finances urgently required attention. The paper money issued amounted to 700 million fl., but at least a portion of this disappeared from circulation and was replaced by specie. By 1830, there was even the prospect of a surplus in the treasury. This situation brought to the fore the question of whether or not government should be representative, for to maintain the partially achieved financial order, the participation of the public in financial management was needed, as well as confidence that the ministries would not overstep their budgets. The future of Austria lay in the solution of this question, for the financial element comprised much more important affairs. But those near the throne did not want to see the solution of the financial question turn into a question of a constitution ‚Äî yet that was its essence. The French July Revolution of 1830 heightened the tension in the various classes of the population. In 1832, Pillersdorf, who thought that concerns about conflict with the new government in France should not frustrate attempts to bring more order to Austria's finances, was taken away from finances and moved to the chancellery, where he became a privy councillor (Geheimrat) on the inner track of the government. A new field opened itself to him where no skilled hand had been on the plough since the reign of Emperor Joseph II. All kinds of weeds needed to be pulled, and obstacles removed, in order to create a foundation for public welfare which until now had not been allowed to develop. As stubbornly as the current order was maintained, so public discontent with it became greater. Even patriotic men faced with a sort of longing the storm that rose up from the French July Monarchy and unleashed itself on Austria. In the Revolutions of 1848, the brittle government collapsed. On 13 March, Prince Metternich resigned. Pillersdorf became Minister of the Interior under Count Kolowrat on 20 March, and submitted the Pillersdorf Constitution on 25 April. He was appointed Minister-President on 4 May. If he had hoped for a moment to be able to calmly and gradually reorganise the government, everything conspired against his honest intention ‚Äî the turmoil in Lombardy and Hungary, the unrest in Vienna, and relations with the states of the German Confederation. The unexpected flight of Emperor Ferdinand I made it an affair of honour for the prime minister not to resign, and Pillersdorf remained true to his post. He held fast to the concessions made by the crown, but the resistance he offered to constantly emerging new demands was too weak. He avoided the summoning of the government's sources of influence. In the meantime, public affairs came into such confusion and disarray, and Pillersdorf showed himself so little suited to manage them and create order, that finally on 8 July he resigned. Pillersdorf then was elected as a deputy of the Vienna Reichstag assembly constituted on 22 July. Here, he took his place centre-right with the men who earnestly wanted to support the new government. Never was there a vote in which he did not take the government's side. When the Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ Reichstag was dissolved in 1849, Pillersdorf's ministerial activity as well as his behavior during the days of September leading to the Vienna Uprising became the subject of a disciplinary investigation. These proceedings must have been uncommonly painful for Pillersdorf, whose efforts during his career were directed, as he himself said, toward \\"reinforcing the power and prestige of the government and instilling confidence in it by avoiding motives for dissatisfaction through suggestions for peaceful reforms.\\" Pillersdorf went into deep seclusion. His lot was to stand, \\"not amongst those who had been judged, but among those who had been shamed.\\" But his fellow citizens sought to heal these wounds: when constitutional government returned to Austria in 1861, they confidently called him to the newly established Reichsrat house of representatives. The old man, who had reached the end of his days, took up the mandate with joyful readiness and uprightly performed the duties of his office as head of the finance committee until his death in the following year. == Honours == * Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary == References == * Hanns Schlitter, ‚ÄúPillersdorf, Franz Freiherr von‚Äù in Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, Band 26 (Leipzig, 1888), S. 135-137. * Carl Schurz, Lebenserinnerungen biz zum Jahre 1852, Berlin: Georg Reimer, 1906 and 1911.

Aviation regiments were constituent units of the aviation divisions and aviation corps, and, the separate aviation regiment, as part of the Air Armies. Aviation regiments were homogeneously equipped with aircraft designed for specific operations, usually bomber, assault, fighter or reconnaissance types. Strength of aviation regiments varied significantly during Great Patriotic War. Initially Fighter and assault air regiments consisted of four aviation squadrons of 15 aircraft each, for a total of 63 aircraft on their flight log. In the fighter regiment there were 78 pilots, in assault regiments, 82. But heavy losses during initial stage of war and difficulties in operating such unit lead to formation of new type of regiment in the fall of 1941 - with two 10-aircraft squadrons and one aircraft for commander - 21 aircraft total. Increasing aircraft production and tendency of concentrating forces in one's hand led to increasing size of regiment in the middle of 1942 - three 10-aircraft squadrons and pair for commander - 32 aircraft total. Next year saw final reorganisation - polks consists of three 12-aircraft squadrons and command flights (and additional training and liaison aircraft) - 40-42 aircraft total, all at one airfield, similar to luftwaffe gruppe.

Reconnaissance regiments had an establishment of 74 crews. For some specialised long-term operations, mixed aviation regiments were created with two bomber or assault aviation squadrons and one or two fighter aviation squadrons. Light night bomber squadrons, such as the Night Witches were also formed, from the summer of 1941, using Polikarpov Po-2 trainer aircraft and night reconnaissance squadrons using the Polikarpov R-5 aircraft. The Rifle and Tank Corps air squadron had 12 reconnaissance aircraft with 18 crews. The squadrons of Front aviation consisted of flights, while those of the long-range bombers from detachments of 3 aircraft each. The number of crews in the air regiments and the Corps squadrons take into account reserve aircraft, which exceeded the number of aircraft in them by 25-50%, which made it possible in the course of combat to produce with the same number of aircraft more aircraft sorties on combat missions and to compensate the loss of crews because of the combat losses. ==References== ==Sources== *Pan'kin V.E.

During 1881‚Äì1895, Belcredi was President of the Cisleithanian Administrative Court. ==Life== Richard Graf von Belcredi was born on 12 February 1823, in Jimramov (Ingrowitz), in the Margraviate of Moravia, the youngest son of Count Eduard von Belcredi (1786‚Äì1838) and his wife Countess Maria von F√ºnfkirchen (1790‚Äì1860). The Belcredi noble family originally descended from Lombardy, where they had been vested with the estates of Montalto Pavese by the Sforza dukes of Milan. Count Richard's ancestors settled in Moravia from 1769 onwards. He studied law at the universities of Prague and Vienna; in 1854, he was appointed district captain (Bezirkshauptmann) in Znojmo (Znaim). In 1861, he was elected member of the Landtag diet of Austrian Silesia and MP of the Imperial Council. He became head of the Austrian Silesian regional government one year later. In 1864, he was promoted to the official rank of Geheimrat (Secret Councillor) and appointed Imperial-Royal governor of Bohemia in Prague. ==Three Count Ministry== In February 1865, Count Richard Belcredi, as the Austrian minister of state, convened a meeting of Viennese bankers to find ways to finance projects. In June 1865, Emperor Franz Josef I chose Belcredi, a declared Conservative, to become Prime Minister and Minister of State, replacing the government of Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria and Anton von Schmerling, who had resigned after failure in his Liberal centralizing policies. Belcredi accepted his nomination, by his own accounts only from a sense of duty. His cabinet was called the \\"Three Count Ministry\\" although, actually, four counts were in charge: Minister President Belcredi himself, Alexander von Mensdorff-Pouilly as foreign minister, Johann Larisch von Moennich as finance minister, and Moritz Esterh√°zy de Galantha as a minister without portfolio. The Austrian government had to face the rising \\"Hungarian question\\", that eventually led to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. On 20 September 1865, Belcredi had the 1861 February Patent suspended. \\"Belcredi, Richard Graf\\" (bio), aeiou Encyclopedia, 2008 (see below: References). Against delaying actions by Belcredi, the Compromise was achieved after the Austrian defeat in the Austro-Prussian War and the 1866 Peace of Prague, ending the monarchy's membership in the German Confederation. On October 30, Foreign Minister Mensdorff-Pouilly was succeeded by Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust who conducted the negotiations with Hungary and prepared a draft for the Cisleithanian December Constitution. Beust's concept of a Dual Monarchy finally prevailed against Belcredi's plans to implement a federation of the Austrian crown lands, similar to later proposals of United States of Greater Austria. On 7 February 1867, Belcredi handed in his resignation. In 1881 he was appointed president of the Imperial-Royal Administrative Court and life member of the Austrian House of Lords. ==Notes== ==References== * \\"Belcredi, Richard Graf\\" (bio), aeiou Encyclopedia, 2008, webpage: AEIOU-Belcredi. * Ludwig Graf Belcredi, \\"Fragmente aus dem Nachlasse des ehemaligen Staatsministers Grafen Richard Belcredi\\" (\\"Fragments from the Literary Legacy of Former Minister Count Richard Belcredi\\"), in: Die Kultur.

This trenchant policy study arguably represents Brian Sherratt at his most influential in shaping the views of policy makers. He argued that, whereas the grant-maintained schools policy offered schools the chance of freedom from LEA control, the government's own hesitations over the policy were being exploited by members of the interest groups ‚Äì heads, bureaucrats, and officials ‚Äì whose present careers and future ambitions depended on the LEA system. The procedure for becoming grant- maintained had been allowed to develop into an obstacle course, while imposed central restrictions (such as the National Curriculum) meant that grant- maintained status in fact offered limited independence. Sherratt argued that government should aim to make all schools grant-maintained (i.e. independent of LEA control) as a matter of general policy, and that it should loosen the constraints placed on grant-maintained schools so as to make diversity and choice in education a reality. Grant-Maintained Status: considering the options, Longman, 1994. In this book Sherratt examines the nature of the grant-maintained policy and its implementation; the implications of self- government and the benefits of grant-maintained status; the role of the Funding Agency for Schools and the Common Funding Formula. The book also looks at the obstacles that there had been to implementing the policy and suggests some necessary changes to overcome them. A Structured Approach to School and Staff Development: from theory to practice (1996) ‚Äì with John Wyatt. This book considers the relationships between school aims and values, whole school review, appraisal, school development planning, value for money in school planning and school evaluation. Headteacher Appraisal (contrib, Arena, in association with the NAHT, 1997). In this book, Brian Sherratt writes about his experience of being appraised as the head of a large secondary school. He comments on the effect it had on his view of his job, and the impact it made on the school as a whole. Radical Educational Policies and Secretaries of State (with Peter Ribbins, Cassell 1997). In this book Sherratt and Ribbins argue that the post-war consensus on the purpose of education, and the role played by the Secretary of State in defining it, had all but collapsed. In a series of conversations with Secretaries of State, the nature of the unfolding agenda for educational reform which the Conservative Party had developed since 1979 is explored. The authors present a series of portraits of seven very different people: Mark Carlisle, Keith Joseph, Kenneth Baker, Kenneth Clarke, John MacGregor, John Patten and Gillian Shephard, revealing the ways in which they sought to define and deliver educational change against a backdrop of conflicting messages from within their own party, and in the face of determined opposition from much of the educational establishment. These illuminating, entertaining and provocative conversations suggest that what was once regarded as radical in the Conservative agenda for education is now increasingly taken for granted by allies and opponents alike. Including a thorough analysis of the seven interviews, this book provides a mine of information for all those interested in contemporary politics, the future of education and the workings of government. Policy, Leadership and Professional Knowledge in Education (contrib, Chapman, BEMAS, 1999). Journal of Education Policy, The role of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the making of educational policy: Kenneth Baker and the Lawson factor? Volume 19, No 6, November 2004 (with Peter Ribbins). Until this paper, the role of Chancellors of the Exchequer in the making of policy in education has attracted the attention of few researchers, and little has been published that seeks systematically and comprehensively to examine this issue. This is remarkable given that, for most of the last 25 years, this office has been filled by four unusually powerful and long-serving figures. In this paper, Sherratt and Ribbins, drawing on their interview-based studies of the Secretaries of State and of the Permanent Secretaries who have held office at the Department of Education since 1979, consider the influence of Prime Ministers and Chancellors on educational policy over these years. In this context, the bulk of this paper focuses on the role of Nigel Lawson in the making of the 1988 Education Reform Act. In doing so, it draws on face-to-face interviews with Lawson along with other key participants such as Kenneth Baker and David Hancock. It concludes that, although Lawson may not have been, as he had hoped to be, the architect of the Act, he did exercise an important influence in shaping many of its central characteristics. As such, his claim that he was the catalyst of reform may well be justified.

Housing policy in the United States has influenced housing segregation trends throughout history. Key legislation include the National Housing Act of 1934, the GI Bill, and the Fair Housing Act. Factors such as socioeconomic status, spatial assimilation, and immigration contribute to perpetuating housing segregation. The effects of housing segregation include relocation, unequal living standards, and poverty. However, there have been initiatives to combat housing segregation, such as the Section 8 housing program. Racial residential segregation doubled from 1880 to 1940. Southern urban areas were the most segregated. Segregation was highly correlated with lynchings of African-Americans. Segregation adversely affected both black and white homeownership rates, as well as caused higher crime rates. Areas with housing segregation had worse health outcomes for both whites and blacks. Residential segregation accounts for a substantial share of the black-white gap in birth weight. Segregation reduced upward economic mobility. White communities are more likely to have strict land use regulations (and whites are more likely to support those regulations). Strict land use regulations are an important driver of housing segregation along racial lines in the United States. ==Home ownership== Home ownership is a crucial means by which families can accumulate wealth. Over a period of time, homeowners accumulate home equity in their homes. In turn, this equity can contribute substantially to the wealth of homeowners. In summary, homeownership allows for the accumulation of home equity, a means of storing wealth, and provides families with insurance against poverty. Ibarra and Rodriguez state that home equity is 61% of the net worth of Hispanic homeowners, 38.5% of the net worth of White homeowners, and 63% of the net worth of African-American homeowners. Conley remarks that differences in rates of home ownership and housing value accrual may lead to lower net worth in the parental generation, which disadvantages the next. There are large disparities in homeownership rates by race. In 2017, the homeownership rate was 72.5% for non-Hispanic Whites, 46.1% for Hispanics, and 42.0% for Blacks. The value of property has stifled during the history of the United States. Initially, when African Americans were still enslaved, they were forbidden from owning land and those that could were white Americans. As times passed, so did the access to property, allowing African Americans to purchase property within their financial needs. A prime example of how banks and organizations manipulate home ownership, is by offering predatory loans. These loans target lower income individuals, who are normally turned away from the Banks, and given lump sums on a ridiculous interest fee. These fees only provide two outcomes for individuals, either they default on their payments and lose their property or live the rest of their lives in debt . This ranges to everyday items, such as automobiles and homes which are restricted to the individuals that need it the most. ==Home equity== There is a discrepancy in relation to race in terms of housing value. On average, the economic value of Black-owned units is 35% less than similar White-owned units. Thus, on average, Black-owned units sell for 35% less than similar White-owned units. Krivo and Kaufman state that while median home value of White Americans is at least $20,000 more than that of African Americans and Hispanics, these differences are not a result of group differences in length of residences because Asians have the most equity on their homes but have lived in them for the shortest average period. African American and Hispanic mortgage holders are 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely to pay 9% or more on interest. Krivo and Kaufman calculate that the African-American/White gap in mortgage interest rates is 0.39%, which translates to a difference of $5,749 on the median home loan payment of a 30-year mortgage of a $53,882 home. The Hispanic/White gap (0.17%) translates to Hispanics paying $3,441 more on a 30-year mortgage on the median valued Hispanic home loan of $80,000. The authors conclude that the extra money could have been reinvested into wealth accumulation. Krivo and Kaufman also postulate that the types of mortgage loans minorities obtain contributes to the differences in home equity. FHA and VA loans make up one- third or more of primary loans for African Americans and Hispanics, while only 18% for White Americans and 16% for Asians. These loans require lower down payments and cost more than conventional mortgages, which contributes to a slower accumulation of equity. Asians and Hispanics have lower net equity on houses partly because they are youngest on average, but age has only a small effect on the Black-White gap in home equity. Previously owning a home can allow the homeowner to use money from selling the previous home to invest and increase the equity of later housing. Only 30% of African Americans in comparison to 60% of White Americas had previously owned a home. African- Americans, Asians, and Hispanics gain lower home equity returns in comparison to White Americans with increases in income and education. ==Residential segregation== Residential segregation can be defined as, \\"physical separation of the residential locations between two groups. There are large discrepancies between races involving geographic location of residence. In the United States, poverty and affluence have become very geographically concentrated. Much residential segregation has been a result of the discriminatory lending practice of redlining, which delineated certain, primarily minority race neighborhoods, as risky for investment or lendingHallahan, Kirk. \\"THE MORTGAGE REDLINING CONTROVERSY, 1972-1975\\". Qualitative Studies Division, Association in Journalism and Mass Communication, Montreal August 1992. Retrieved 12 November 2012. The result has been neighborhoods with concentrated investment, and others neighborhoods where banks are less inclined to invest. Most notably, this geographic concentration of affluence and poverty can be seen in the comparison between suburban and urban populations. The suburbs have traditionally been primarily White populations, while the majority of urban inner city populations have traditionally been composed of racial minorities. Results from the last few censuses suggest that more and more inner-ring suburbs around cities also are becoming home to racial minorities as their populations grow. As of 2017, most residents of the United States live in \\"radicalized and economically segregated neighborhoods\\". ==History of housing discrimination== === Legislation === ====The National Housing Act of 1934==== In 1934 the practice of redlining neighborhoods came into existence through the National Housing Act of 1934.see: redlining This practice, also known as mortgage discrimination, began when the federal government and the newly formed Federal Housing Administration allowed the Home Owners' Loan Corporation to create \\"residential security maps\\", outlining the level of security for real-estate investments in 239 cities around the United States. On these maps, high-risk areas were outlined in red, high risk areas being considered highly populated areas of African Americans or other minority groups. Many minority neighborhoods were redlined in these maps, meaning that banks would deny all mortgage capital to people living within them. This contributed to the decay of many of these neighborhoods because the lack of loans for buying or making repairs on the homes made it difficult for these neighborhoods to attract and keep families. Many urban historians point to redlining as one of the main factors for urban disinvestment and the decline of central cities in the middle decades of the 20th century.Redlining in Philadelphia Hiller, Amy. http://cml.upenn.edu/redlining/ ====The Housing Act of 1937==== This piece of legislation occurred during the New Deal era and provided the basis for future public housing programs. This act allowed for the creation of around 160,000 units of public housing. Most of these units were made to alleviate the housing difficulties of the poor and working class suffering from the Great Depression. Additionally, this public housing program allowed for the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) to provide various monetary funds to local housing authorities to aid with the building and development of these units. Despite providing low budget housing options, this act created greater racial segregation in housing because the majority of the poor population at the time consisted of minorities. ====The GI Bill (1944)==== At the end of World War II, the GI Bill furthered segregation practices by keeping African Americans out of European American neighborhoods, showing another side to African American housing discrimination. When millions of GIs returned home from overseas, they took advantage of the \\"Servicemen's Readjustment Act,\\" or the GI Bill.see: GI Bill This important document was signed in 1944 by Franklin D. Roosevelt, and gave veterans education and training opportunities, guaranteed loans for home, farm, or business, job finding assistance, and unemployment pay of $20 a week for up to 52 weeks if a veteran could not find a job.The GI Bill http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe40s/life_20.html This law allowed millions of U.S. soldiers to purchase their first homes with inexpensive mortgages, which meant the huge growth of suburbs and the birth of the ideal of a suburban lifestyle. African Americans were met with discrimination when trying to purchase a home in the overwhelmingly European American neighborhoods. The realtors would not show these houses to African Americans, and when they did, they would try and talk them out of buying the home. This discrimination was based on the fact that realtors believed they would be losing future business by dealing or listing with African Americans, and that it would be unethical to sell a house in a European American neighborhood to African Americans because it would drive the property values of the surrounding houses down. Both redlining and discrimination through the GI Bill relegated most African Americans to a concentrated area within the city, so the declining property values and the higher crime rates could be kept in a contained area. The relegation of African Americans to the neighborhoods that were receiving no support due to redlining practices was a self-fulfilling prophecy that created the high crime slums that the city was afraid of.\\"The Continuing Causes of Segregation\\". Massey, Douglas, and Nancy Denton. American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993, . ====The Fair Housing Act (1968)==== The overt discriminatory practices of refusal of sale and loans continued unabated until at least 1968, when the Fair Housing Act was passed. After this act was passed, outright refusal to sell property to African Americans became rare, given that that behavior could lead to prosecution under the Fair Housing Law. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is charged with administering and enforcing fair housing laws. Any person who believes that they have faced housing discrimination based on their race can file a fair housing complaint. The most comprehensive federal fair housing act of its time, this piece of legislation mandated fair housing as a national policy and restricted discriminatory practices. Specifically, discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was prohibited in the rental, sale, financing, and brokerage of housing or housing services. However, this act did not give the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) a lot of enforcing power. HUD was only allowed to mediate housing discrimination disputes between parties. It did not have the power to file lawsuits or take definitive legal action. President Nixon and HUD secretary George Romney talk ====Nixon's Fair Housing Policy (1971)==== During his presidential term, Nixon's federal housing policy undermined the Fair Housing Act. His policy acknowledged that federal law requires nondiscriminatory practices in federal housing matters but did not provide presidential support. Nixon declared that government could not force suburban desegregation or economic/racial integration. In doing so, he secured many suburban votes but further exacerbated the issue of housing inequality by not supporting subsidized housing programs to help desegregation. ====The Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974==== The Equal Credit Opportunity Act provided protection against discrimination from creditors. It stated that creditors could not discriminate against applicants based on race, sex, marital status, religion, ethnicity or age. Designed to supplement the Fair Housing Act in specific forms of housing discrimination, this piece of legislation offered more protection against discrimination in lending practices. ====The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975==== Like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974, this piece of legislation was also designed to supplement the Fair Housing Act in specific areas of housing discrimination. This act protected applicants from discrimination through lending institutions by requiring that any financial institution providing federally related mortgage loan disclose data annually. This included reports of the amount and location of loans related to federal housing (by census tract or ZIP code). The purpose of this was to prevent lending discrimination in certain localities. ====The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977==== The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 required banks to apply the same anti-discriminatory guidelines to their lending criteria in all circumstances. These acts did not completely stop discriminatory practices, however. The discrimination moved into more subtle techniques, including racial steering and misinformation given to African American prospective buyers. Although these laws exist in theory, they have not accomplished their goal of eradicating discrimination based on race in the housing market. Audits of the housing market in Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, and many other major metropolitan areas have shown discrimination toward African Americans continuing into the 80s, long after the anti-discrimination laws were passed.

A riot was caused by white neighbors' attempts to prevent African American tenants from moving in. === Trends by minority group === Residential segregation is typically measured by evenness and exposure. Evenness is defined as the relative dispersion of a certain racial group in a metropolitan area whereas exposure is defined as how much a member of a certain racial group is exposed to a member of another racial group. In general, the number of integrated neighborhoods have continued to increase since the passing of the Fair Housing Act in 1968. In addition, the number of exclusively white neighborhoods have been decreasing. Although there has been an increase of a minority population presence in suburbs, residential segregation continues to persist. On average, it is more likely for minority groups to be exposed to mixed neighborhoods than white populations. Residential segregation is not limited to the private housing market. Discriminatory practices also take place within the federal public housing system. ====African American==== Overall, in the period from 1980‚Äì2000, residential segregation between the black and white population has decreased at a greater rate than other minority groups. However, the African American population, currently the second largest minority group in the United States, still experiences the greatest residential segregation compared to other minority groups. The older industrial cities of the Midwest and Northeast, experience the highest levels of black-white residential segregation, while the newer metropolitan areas of the South are experiences lesser levels of black-white residential segregation. The presence of a black population in the suburbs continues to increase with 40% of African Americans currently living in the suburbs. ====Latino==== Due to Immigration to the United States over the past decades, the Latino population has grown exponentially, making Latinos the largest minority group in the United States. After African Americans, Latinos experience the second highest level of residential segregation. From 1980‚Äì2000, the level of neighborhood dissimilarity and isolation increased between the Latino population and the white population. Although around 50% of Latinos live in the suburban area, it is projected that with increasing immigration, the divide between Latino and white populations will continue to persist in residential areas. ====Asian==== Asians in the United States are a diverse group with a complex historical background. Chinese Americans first came to the United States in the mid-1800s during the California Gold Rush, and Japanese Americans emigrated to the United States in the late 1800s as indentured servants. These populations faced systemic discrimination forcing them to live close together, particularly segregating in national origin-specific groups in major cities. Asian immigration to the US then increased in the 1960s after reform and passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Due to immigration to the United States over the past decades, the Asian population has grown considerably, making Asians the third largest minority group in the United States. Similar to the Latino and Black minority groups, the Asian minority group experiences high levels of isolation and dissimilarity to their white counterparts. From 1980‚Äì2000, these levels have only increased. Currently 55% of Asians live in the suburban area, but their levels of isolation from their White counterparts have increased over time despite residential mobility. Several factors can contribute to residential isolation including recent immigration status, level of English language proficiency, and level of acculturation to American society. Socioeconomic status can also contribute to residential segregation, and Chinatowns in the United States continue to represent a large concentration of Asian poverty. ====Senior==== The Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995 allow residential communities to restrict residency to the senior. These communities are set up to accommodate older individuals who dislike having young residents as neighbors. == Causes== === Neighborhood disinvestment === Neighborhood disinvestment is a systematic withdrawal of capital and neglect of public services by the city. Public services may include schools; building, street, and park maintenance; garbage collection and transportation. Absentee landlordism and mortgage redlining also characterize disinvestment. As redlining prevents households from owning, they have no choice but to rent from landlords that neglect property and charge high rent. These factors allow the devalorization cycle to occur in a neighborhood, eventually leading to the reclamation and transformation of the neighborhood, uprooting the poor residents who have no equity to use for relocation. A deeper look into disinvestment in the community can be termed devalorization. This is when neighborhood decline is analyzed by emphasizing the profit taking of realtors, bankers, and speculators which systematically reduces the worth or value of housing. The devalorization of a neighborhood begins to occur when the city decides to begin disinvesting in it, and the disproportionate influx of minorities shift the neighborhood from mostly live- in owners to absentee landlords. These landlords buy up the houses during white flight from the neighborhood and rent them to the minorities moving in for a high price. In Albina, this process was shown through intensive white flight from the neighborhood, and large redevelopment projects that destroyed the heart of the African American community for the remodeling of a veteran's hospital. This project relocated many African Americans into an even smaller area, creating an overcrowded, volatile environment. Most of the community that survived did not own their homes, and the absentee landlords neglected to make repairs on their properties. The relocation of so many African Americans from southern Albina because of the hospital project caused more white flight on the northern side of Albina, creating more opportunities for landlords use the tactic of blockbusting, or using the fear of racial turnover and property value decline to convince homeowners to sell at below-market prices, allowing the landlords to then inflate the cost of the property and extort the new African American home buyers.See: Blockbusting The relegation of African Americans to certain contained neighborhoods continues today. The cycle of neighborhood disinvestment followed by gentrification and dislocation of the minority has made it difficult for African Americans to establish themselves, build equity, and try to break out into suburban neighborhoods. If they have the means to relocate, the neighborhoods they relocate to are most likely populated by European American people who support open housing laws in theory, but become uncomfortable and relocate if they are faced with a rising Black population in their own neighborhood. This white flight creates an overwhelmingly African American neighborhood, and then disinvestment begins anew. All of these subtle discriminatory practices leave the metropolitan African American population with few options, forcing them to remain in disinvested neighborhoods with rising crime, gang activity, and dilapidated housing. === Real-estate discrimination === There is an existence of a dual housing market that results in unequal housing opportunities for different populations of people. The basis of the dual housing market model is that similar housing opportunities are available to different racial groups at different prices. There are many explanations for the existence of a dual housing market. One theory explains the dual housing market through racial steering. This occurs when real estate brokers steer their clients to specific geographic locations of available housing based on race. Although racial discrimination in housing market processes is outlawed by several court decisions and legislation, there is evidence that it still occurs. For example, an HUD Housing Market Practice survey found that African Americans felt discriminated against in the renting and/or buying process of housing. Institutional factors, such as realtor agencies withholding housing information or financial institutions denying mortgages, further perpetuate the effects of the dual housing market model. Another explanation of the existence of a dual housing market is the availability of housing units, either for sale or for rent, for minority groups. Oftentimes, price discriminations results from price fluctuations of property based on the existing demographic of residence in a neighborhood. Racial preference affects the available geographic spaces open to certain minority groups. For example, African Americans are disproportionately found in a small distribution of suburban communities. === Socioeconomic status === One theory of the cause of residential segregation is the difference in income between minority groups and their white counterparts. The basis of this theory stems from purchasing power: the higher the income, the more likely minority groups are to move to better neighborhoods which in turn results in more integrated neighborhoods. In other words, there seems to be an inverse relationship between a minority group's socioeconomic status and the minority group's level of residential segregation. Many argue that residential segregation occurs because minority groups, particularly immigrants, do not have the wealth or income to purchase homes in more affluent and predominantly white neighborhoods. Although there is a definite relationship between socioeconomic status and residential segregation, the effect of this relationship is different among minority groups. In terms of location, poverty-stricken communities tend to reside in the inner cities while affluent communities tend to reside in the suburbs. In addition, better neighborhoods contain better educational services and easier access to various occupations. This spatial and economic segregation further perpetuates residential segregation. Across all minority groups, there is a residential gap based on income. Residential segregation between the rich and the poor, occurring at different rates, takes place across the board. African Americans and Latinos, compared to their white counterpart, experience a greater difference in income, education, and occupation levels. On the other hand, Asians experience a lesser difference in terms of income, education, and occupation levels when compared to their white counterpart. These factors, education and occupation, influence income and purchasing power of an individual. For African Americans, Asians, and Latinos, higher income resulted in less segregation from their white counterpart whereas lower income resulted in greater segregation from their white counterpart. However, that an increase in socioeconomic status resulted in a greater decrease in segregation for Latinos and Asians and a lesser decrease in segregation for African Americans suggests that socioeconomic status alone cannot explain residential segregation. === Spatial assimilation and immigration === Recent reforms and policies on Immigration to the United States have caused an influx of immigrants from Latin America and Asia. The spatial assimilation theory states that immigrants are more likely to experience residential segregation because of a variety of factors such as social networks, family, income, and cultural preference. Upon moving to a new country, immigrants are more likely to relocate to an area where they have feel comfortable and accepted. In addition, their income may only allow them to occupy spaces that are more ethnically diverse. The three generation model is a theory that attempts to explain assimilation across generations. It states that over time, as the children of immigrants become more acculturated, they begin to disperse geographically and assimilate themselves in suburban neighborhoods. Therefore, there is a correlation between residential segregation and the intergenerational process of assimilation. The acculturation of immigrant children also relates to the socioeconomic status of the parent or parents. As the children become more acculturated to the customs of the host country, they become more comfortable with the cultural norms and improve their speaking abilities. A higher socioeconomic status allows them to disperse from the ethnically concentrated community and move into neighborhoods with better services and quality housing. This process across several generations eventually results in the continued desegregation of more affluent, predominantly white, suburban neighborhoods. Among all minority groups, foreign-born immigrants experience greater segregation from whites than native-born groups. However, assimilation varies among minority groups. Overall, Latino-white segregation is higher than Asian-white segregation. Black-white segregation is the highest when comparing all minority groups. New immigrants tend to experience higher levels of segregation than immigrants that have lived in the host country for a while. == Effects == === Relocation === Once their old neighborhood has been gentrified, many of the residents are forced to relocate, if they have not already done so. When hunting for a new residence, African Americans will more than likely encounter discrimination on some level. Audits performed by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and a later Housing Development Study suggest that if realtors have a chance to discriminate, they usually do. These studies analyzed the number of cases where whites were given more information about available units or financing options or shown extra units in proportion to African Americans. The results showed that whites were systematically favored for both rental and sales units throughout metropolitan areas in the United States. Racial steering was also taken into account during these audits, and it was shown through the results that African Americans were shown homes in areas that had more minorities, lower home values, or lower median incomes that the homes that were shown to European Americans, even if their economic position was the same. It was shown that about one in every three encounters, African Americans were systematically steered to these non-European American neighborhoods. This segregation is not self-imposed. That is, African Americans do not prefer to live in neighborhoods that are overwhelmingly Black. Survey evidence from a Detroit Area Survey from 1976 shows that African Americans strongly favor the desegregation of the United States, with the overall ideal neighborhood being 50% black and 50% white. Whites, on the other hand, favor neighborhood composition that is dominated by whites. In the same survey, about one-quarter of the whites surveyed said they would feel uncomfortable if their neighborhood exceeded 8% Black. Once the neighborhood reached 21% Black, almost half of the whites surveyed said they would feel uncomfortable. === Unequal living standards === ===Behavioral effects=== One of the important social effects on the individual that results from residential segregation is the influence on behavior. Segregated communities tend to slow the rate of assimilation, especially in the ability to speak English, which is considered a primary aspect of assimilating in the United States. The ability to speak English has been shown to result in the increased rate of desegregation in communities. Another behavioral influence of residential segregation is the effect on social networks created. Friendships and marriages tend to occur at a higher probability among people living in close proximities. In other words, people who are spatially separate are less likely to form lasting relationships. A negative behavioral influence of residential segregation is the perpetuation of violence. Specifically with gang activity, the higher the level of segregation, the greater the density of altercations between rival gangs. USDA Food Desert Locator Map ===Health=== Many studies have shown that racial or ethnic minority neighborhoods are disproportionally affected by health issues related to the environment, such as a lack of healthy food options, a lack of available pharmacies, and an increased number of advertisements for alcohol and tobacco. In addition, there has been a trend over the past few years of a concentration of ethnic minorities in low-income urban neighborhoods. One of the factors associated with this rise in urban, low-income neighborhoods is residential segregation. Many of these urban, low- income neighborhoods experience unequal accessibility to services compared to their suburban counterparts, which often results in an unhealthy food environment. One of the main reasons for the increasing presence of unhealthy food environments in these neighborhoods is the emergence of food deserts. Several theories regarding the rise of food deserts in low-income neighborhoods are circulating in the literature. One of the prevailing theories states that food deserts resulted from the development of larger supermarkets in affluent areas and the closure of small, independent groceries stores that could not compete economically. Another theory states that supermarket development shifted spatially with the rise of income segregation. As more the more affluent middle-class moved to the suburbs, many inner city grocery stores closed from lack of business. Another prevailing theory is the idea of supermarket redlining, the unwillingness of supermarkets to open stores in the inner city due to various economic reasons. This overall development of unhealthy food environments in low-income urban neighborhoods affects the development of health in the community members. The lack of healthy food options forces these residents to purchase and consume energy dense food options such as meals from fast-food restaurants. These residents are also forced to purchase highly processed foods because of the lack of fresh food options. In addition, food at independently owned grocery stores are often 10-60% more expensive than food offered at large chain supermarkets. ===Education=== Housing segregation has an effect on the quality of education received by community members. Specifically, the spatial separation of specific populations due to housing segregation leads to geographic concentrations of quality education. For example, public schools in suburban areas are usually more equipped with resources, have a higher percentage quality teachers, and produce a larger amount of successful students. The negative effects of housing segregation on quality of education is demonstrated by the lack of integration and diversity in schools. The Equality of Educational Opportunity study in 1966 found that racial composition of schools impacted student success more than the resources available to schools. This cycle of unequal educational opportunities is perpetuated by the real estate market. Areas with quality school systems usually contain higher housing prices and higher property taxes. In addition, these areas are typically racially and economically homogenous. One of the primary reasons of unequal educational opportunities is the low accessibility to the suburbs by minority groups due to lack of income. The suburban areas, containing higher quality education, are less accessible to low-income minority groups. Another reason of unequal education opportunities is the rise in options of schooling for parents. In addition to public schools, parents with enough purchasing power can opt to send their children to private schools, magnet schools and even home school. Other options include charter schools. These various educational options contribute to the relationship between school quality and school enrollment demographics. Quality of education also affects the outcomes of community members. In other words, the kind of education children receive plays a major role in economic opportunities in their future. Students surrounded by other educated members of the community often experience more success with school. Furthermore, community environment and housing quality affect the drop-out rate of students. === Poverty === Housing segregation affects the development of concentrated areas of poverty, especially among racial minorities groups. Housing segregation interacts with existing poverty rates among minority groups, especially African Americans and Latinos, to perpetuate the cycle of poor people moving into concentrated areas of poverty. These concentrated areas of poverty often experience a lack of public services and infrastructure. Studies have shown that these residential areas often have less employment opportunities, unequal schooling environments, and increased health risks. These factors combine to perpetuate poverty and prevent social and spatial mobility. The lack of employment opportunities come in many different forms such as decreased accessibility to jobs because of transportation or unavailability of jobs due to location. The result of unequal economic opportunities is the increase in income segregation. This further perpetuates poverty because low-income residents experience higher rent burden which forces them to accept low quality housing. This cycle of poverty also extends between generations. This means that children living in low-income neighborhoods are more likely to experience poverty and the same living standards as their parents' generation. In addition to income segregation, the effects of housing segregation on the development of concentrated areas of poverty are also associated with class and racial segregation. Class segregation plays a role in the concentration of poverty areas in that affluent classes of society have a desire to spatially separate themselves from the less fortune, poverty-stricken class. As a result, they move towards more affluent neighborhoods leaving the poor concentrated in a certain area. Racial segregation also plays a role in the concentration of poverty areas. In fact, the degree of housing segregation due to racial differences is greater than the degree of housing segregation due to class differences. The three factors of income, class, and racial segregation can explain the increasing concentration of poverty in certain areas. All three of these factors can be associated with the causes and effects of housing segregation. == Initiatives against housing segregation == Seal of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The seal is a representative of high rise buildings simulating an eagle and giving emphasis to the \\"urban\\" in HUD's name. The eagle (shown abstractly) is a symbol of federal authority. The use of green symbolizes open space, land, growth and prosperity. The blue in the Seal alludes to the quality of life and environment in America's cities. ===Community building strategies=== The relationship of community members is often affected by their physical surroundings. Diverse neighborhoods containing various racial and ethnic groups experience many barriers to community collectivism, such as culture, economic background, and fundamental values. However, having a strong community building strategy can help break down barriers of segregation. Leaders of community strong pro-diversity organizations stress the need for a sense of community among members. Creating a diverse and stable neighborhood requires focusing on economic development, community safety, and education. Focusing on economic development means creating a market in the existing neighborhood. This not only creates jobs for community members but also inhibits disinvestment, a common cause of housing segregation, in neighborhoods. Community safety strongly influences the perception of the stability of a neighborhood. Active participation of community members in the safety of their neighborhood increases community efficacy because there is a perception of controlled crime which, in turn, gives people a sense of control over their quality of life. Education is also related to the positive, or negative, perception of a neighborhood. Schools not only foster safe environments for cross-cultural cooperation but also influence community attitudes towards race, ethnicity, and diversity. ===U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development=== Traditionally, public housing programs perpetuate housing segregation by forcing minority populations in low-income neighborhoods containing lower quality housing options. However, the Section 8 housing program combats this problem by providing households with housing certificates/vouchers that can be used to rent units anywhere in the private market at a moderate price. In other words, low-income families have the chance to move into affordable and higher quality housing. This option of choice and mobility offers a solution to the social and economic isolation of minority populations. In addition, families using these housing vouchers are more likely than public housing residents to live in racially and economically integrated neighborhoods. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development federal housing assistance program is the nations largest housing assistance program. Recipients of the voucher/certificate contribute 30% of their income to paying the rent and the government subsidizes the difference. The program is not only less costly because it relies on the existing housing market, but also more likely to offer affordable and quality housing to participants. This program contrasts previous housing programs which often clumped federally funded families into low-income urban neighborhoods. This program is extremely effective, with the majority of participants living in areas that are less than 20% poor. Despite this effectiveness, there is still a racial disparity among participant success. Overall, participants across all races are more likely to live in low-poverty, racially heterogenous neighborhoods compared to their counterparts in public housing. However, African American and Latino recipients are much more likely to live in high poverty areas compared to white recipients. ==See also== *Blockbusting *Residential segregation *Housing discrimination in the United States *Racial inequality in the United States#Housing *Redlining *Income inequality in the United States *Racism *Gentrification *Zoning ==References== ==Further reading== * Dianne Harris, Little White House: How the Postwar Home Constructed Race in America.

The film was directed by Michael Pavone. Pavone wrote and produced the film, with Dave Alan Johnson. ==Plot== When agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration are ambushed during a raid, Agent Matt Gianni suspects a leak, and asks his boss Stuart Langston, to enlist an outside agent. Langston brings in Willie Serling, who is a master of disguises, and whose family was killed by Alberto Cortese, a drug smuggler. Langston sends Serling to jail undercover, to investigate a drug operation, possibly run by Cortese. While in jail, Serling disguises himself, as a computer expert, and recovers critical bank records. Gianni frees him from jail and sends him to a bank, to pose an auditor, and follow up on the records. Serling investigates bank executive, Jill Hallmann, but begins dating her. He finds out that another executive, Morris Steinfeld, is the one involved in criminal activity. Steinfeld finds out that he is being investigated, and reports to bank president, Jason Ainsley, who informs Cortese of the investigation. Cortese kills Ainsley, and also gets Steinfeld killed. Serling, who is targeted next, disguises himself as a hobo, and is able to shoot Cortese first, though he does not kill him. Serling‚Äôs behaviour, after the events, becomes bizarre, and he ignores Gianni‚Äôs imploring to quit. Gianni arrests at the prison, and the bank, and the perpetrators involved with the drug operation. Meanwhile, Serling transfers Cortese‚Äôs money from an offshore account.

Craig was involved in numerous research expeditions, which visited the Great Rift Valley of East Africa, the crater of Loihi, the Afar Depression of Ethiopia, Greenland's ice cores, and Yellowstone's geysers, among many others. This led to him being described as \\"the Indiana Jones of the earth sciences\\", someone \\"whose overriding impulse was to get out and see the world they were studying\\". Craig made many significant discoveries in geochemistry. He is credited with establishing the field of carbon isotope geochemistry by characterizing carbon's stable isotopic signatures in various natural materials. This had immediate applications in radiocarbon dating. By studying stable and radioactive carbon isotopes in the biosphere and air-sea system, he derived the atmospheric residence time of carbon dioxide with respect to oceanic uptake. His work laid the foundation for isotopic studies of the carbon cycle, and was fundamental to understanding carbon sequestering in the oceanic and the terrestrial biosphere and the modulation of global warming. In addition, from 1969 to 1989, Harmon Craig served as an editor for Earth and Planetary Science Letters. ==Family and early life== Harmon Craig was born in Manhattan, in New York City, to John Richard Craig, Jr. (1896-1945) and his wife Virginia (Stanley) Craig. He was named after his uncle, Harmon Bushnell Craig (1895-1917), but does not use his middle name. Harmon Craig's grandparents on his father's side were actors, directors and producers. During World War I, John Craig (1868-1931) and his wife, actress Mary Young, led the first professional American stock theater company to travel to France and entertain troops at the front. While they entertained the troops, their sons Harmon Bushnell Craig (1895-1917) and John Richard Craig, Jr. (1896-1945) served in the war effort. John Craig, Jr. received a French Croix de Guerre for his efforts as a second lieutenant of artillery, working with French 75s. Harmon Bushnell Craig died serving with an ambulatory corps run by the American Field Service, and was posthumously awarded the French Croix de Guerre. In November 1924, John Craig, Jr. married Virginia Stanley of Wichita, Kansas. They had three children: Harmon (named after his uncle), John Richard III (named after his father and grandfather), and Stanley Craig. Harmon Craig's mother, Virginia Stanley, was descended from Quakers who helped found schools for freed slaves. His mother's involvement with the Quakers was a strong influence on Harmon Craig. == University of Chicago == Harmon Craig studied geology and chemistry at the University of Chicago. In 1944, he joined the U.S. Navy, serving as a communications and radar officer during World War II. After the war, he continued his education at University of Chicago, working with Nobel Laureate Harold Urey. Craig credits Urey with giving him valuable advice on how to choose scientific problems: ‚ÄúIf you go into a project, it‚Äôs got to be a scientific problem that has rooms that continue into other rooms.‚Äù Craig earned his Ph.D. in 1951, with The geochemistry of the stable carbon isotopes, a thesis on carbon isotope geochemistry. Craig created his thesis to find the measurement of ancient sea temperature. Craig used the carbon dioxide released from calcium carbonate fossils as a basis for future researches involving the carbon system. The masses of carbon dioxide that are produced by 18O and 16O were used to calculate respective masses. Craig‚Äôs study of the carbon isotope produced corrections that deal with mass fractionation and radiocarbon ages. Craig‚Äôs thesis work is considered a foundational accomplishment for its studies of 13 C and 12 C in a wide range of natural materials, including everything from ocean water to the atmosphere; volcanic gases; plants, coal, diamonds, and petroleum; sediments, igneous rocks and meteorites. His theory has been applied to applications as varied as determining food chains and the identifying the sources of stone for ancient statues. Karl Turekian has stated that ‚ÄúCraig‚Äôs 35-year-old dissertation is still the measure of all subsequent work in the field.‚Äù Craig joined the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago as a research associate in 1951. In 1953, Urey and Craig published results showing that chondrites, meteors from the Solar System, did not have a single fixed composition, as had been assumed. After carrying out analyses of the chemical composition of hundreds of different meteorites, they reported that chondrites fell into two distinguishable groups, high iron (H) and low iron (L) chondrites. Their work \\"underscored the value of reliable chemical data\\" and led to significant improvements in data analysis in the field. It led to a better understanding of the materials and processes involved in forming planets. == Scripps Institution of Oceanography == In 1955 Harmon Craig was recruited to Scripps Institution of Oceanography by Roger Revelle. His laboratory at Scripps eventually contained five mass spectrometers, one of them a portable unit. As a professor of geochemistry and oceanography at Scripps, Craig developed new methods in radiocarbon dating and applied radioisotope and isotope distribution to various topics in marine-, geo-, and cosmochemistry. Craig produced fundamental findings about how the deep earth, oceans and atmosphere work. During the 1950s Craig measured variations in the concentrations of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in natural waters. In 1961, Craig identified the global meteoric water line, a linear relationship describing the occurrence of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in terrestrial waters. Craig also established the oxygen isotope shift in geothermal and volcanic fluids, demonstrating that the water is meteoric. His discovery outlined the relation between rocks and water in geothermal systems. In 1963, Craig received a Guggenheim Fellowship, using it to spend a year at the Istituto de Geologia Nucleare, Pisa, Italy. He described a framework for studying the isotopic composition of the hydrosphere, discussing kinetics, equilibrium, and the use of isotopes for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. The work he presented with Louis I. Gordon on isotopic fractionation of the phase changes in water is known as the Craig- Gordon Model. The model is applied to problems in watershed and ecosystem studies such as the calculation of evaporation. It has been called \\"a corner stone of isotope geochemistry.\\" During the Nova Expedition of 1967, Craig and colleagues W. Brian Clarke (1937‚Äì2002) and M.A. Beg from McMaster University in Canada observed the Kermadec Trench in the Pacific Ocean. They found unexpectedly high proportions of the helium-3 isotope in the ocean waters. Craig concluded that the isotope was present within the earth's mantle and theorized that it was leaking into sea water through cracks in the sea floor. Craig and coworkers studied the isotopic composition of atmospheric and dissolved oxygen in the composition of dissolved gases, where he discovered the biochemical oxygen demand and the intake in the ocean mixed layer. Craig determined by measuring that the element, 210Pb is rapidly scavenged by sinking particulate matter. In 1970, Craig teamed up with colleagues at Scripps, Columbia University's Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to direct the GEOSECS Programme (geochemical ocean sections study) to investigate the chemical and isotopic properties of the world's oceans. GEOSECS produced the most complete set of ocean chemistry data ever collected. In 1971, as part of the Antipode Expedition, Craig and his colleagues gathered hydrographic casts and other data, and discovered a benthic front separating the South Pacific deep and bottom water. During the 1970s Craig examined the relationship of gases such as radon and helium to earthquake prediction, developing a monitoring network at thermal springs and wells near major fault lines in southernmost California. In 1979, he detected an increase in radon and helium as a precursor to an earthquake near Big Bear Lake, California. In a long-term project, Harmon Craig and Valerie Craig (his wife) used carbon and oxygen isotopes to identify the sources of the marble used in ancient Greek sculptures and temples. Craig discovered submarine Hydrothermal vents by measuring helium 3 and radon emitted from seafloor spreading centers. He made 17 dives to the bottom of the ocean in the ALVIN submersible, including the first descent into the Mariana Trough. There he discovered hydrothermal vents nearly 3700m deep. Craig proved that there was excess 3He instead of 4He, affecting the understanding for ocean circulation and seafloor spreading. Craig led 28 oceanographic expeditions and traveled to the East African Rift Valley, The Dead Sea, Tibet, Yunnan (China) and many other places to sample volcanic rocks and gases. He visited all the major volcanic island chains of the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean to collect lava samples. He identified 16 mantle hotspots where volcanic plumes rise from the Earth's outer core through the deep mantle by measuring their helium 3 to helium 4 ratio, identifying the higher helium 3 content present in the hotspots as primordial helium, trapped in the earth's core when it was first formed. Craig was one of the earliest people to analyze the gases trapped in the glacier ice. Craig reported that the methane in the atmosphere had increased twice due to human day to day activities in the last 300 years. ==Awards and honors== Craig was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1979. Craig won the VM Goldschmidt Medal of the Geochemical Society in 1979, the National Science Foundation's Special Creativity Award in Oceanography in 1982 and the Arthur L. Day Prize and Lectureship of the National Academy of Sciences in 1987. He shared the Vetlesen Prize with Wallace S. Broecker in 1987. In 1998 he was awarded the Balzan Prize for Geochemistry, from the International Balzan Foundation of Milan, Italy. The Foundation commended him as \\"a pioneer in earth sciences who uses the varied tools of isotope geochemistry to solve problems of fundamental scientific importance and immediate relevance in the atmosphere, hydrosphere and solid earth.\\" It was the first time that the prize had gone to a geochemist. Craig was quoted as saying \\"The Prize's most significant effect was to establish that Geochemistry, especially Isotope Geochemistry, which began in 1947, had come of age and is a mature science. This was much more important than the specific person chosen for the award.\\" He received an honorary degree from the University of Paris. ==Death== Craig died at Thornton Hospital in La Jolla, California on 14 March 2003 from a massive heart attack a day before his birthday. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1926 births Category:2003 deaths Category:American geochemists Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:American climatologists ","title":"Harmon Craig"},{"id":"17320409","text":"Andranik Hakobyan (, born 6 October 1981 in Vagharshapat, Armenian SSR) is a Swiss amateur boxer with Armenian roots.

The Berar Division, formerly Berar Province, was one of the former administrative divisions of the Central Provinces and Berar of British India. Ellichpur (Achalpur) was the capital and the administrative headquarters of the division. The Berar Division had an area of 28,515 km¬≤ with a population of 2,672,673 in 1881. The main mountain chains in the area were the Satpura and the Ajanta ranges, and the main rivers the Tapi, the Purna, the Wardha, the Penganga and the Pranhita.Hunter, William Wilson, Sir, et al. (1908). Imperial Gazetteer of India, Volume 6. 1908-1931; Clarendon Press, Oxford. It was located in present-day Maharashtra state of India. ==History== Berar Province, formerly ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad, was administered by the British after 1853, although the Nizam retained formal sovereignty over the province. Through an agreement signed on 5 November 1902, Nizam Nawab Mir Sir Mahbub Ali Khan leased Berar permanently to the British against an annual payment of 25 lakh (2.5 million) rupees. Lord Curzon decided to merge Berar with the Central Provinces, and this was proclaimed on 17 September 1903. Thus the Central Provinces and Berar was born by a Residency Order, dated the 30 September 1903, and the administration of Berar was placed under the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces. After October 1, 1903 the administration of the province was placed under the commissioner-general for the Central Provinces as the 'Berar Division'. On 24 October 1936, with the establishment of the legislative assembly of the 'Central Provinces and Berar' the Central Provinces became 'Central Provinces and Berar' when it was fully merged with Berar, although Berar Division remained under the nominal sovereignty of Hyderabad.Olson, James S. and Robert Shadle, eds. Historical Dictionary of the British Empire, Vol. 1. Greenwood Publishing Group, UK 1996. P. 227. Following the independence of India in 1947, the Central Provinces and Berar became a province of India, and in 1950 became the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. In 1956, the Indian states were reorganized along linguistic lines, and Berar and Nagpur became part of Bombay state. In 1960, Bombay state was split along linguistic lines, and the southern, Marathi-speaking portion of the state, including Berar Division, became the new state of Maharashtra. ==Territory== Berar consisted of one Division with Commissioner. It was under the administrative authority of the Chief Commissioner for the Central Provinces, but administered separately from the other divisions until 1936. In 1904 there were twelve municipalities in Berar, including Amraoti, Akola, Ellichpur, Bashim, Yeotmal, Khamgaon, Shegaon, Akot and four more.Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 7, page 411 - Imperial Gazetteer of India - Digital South Asia Library After the Independence of India it became the Amravati division of the state of Maharashtra. ===Districts=== The Berar Division included the five districts of Ellichpur (Achalpur), Wun (Wani), Akola, Buldana (Buldhana) and Basim (Washim) in 1905.

It is a black yeast that is investigated for its remarkable halotolerance. While the addition of salt to the medium is not required for its cultivation, H. werneckii can grow in close to saturated NaCl solutions. To emphasize this unusually wide adaptability, and to distinguish H. werneckii from other halotolerant fungi, which have lower maximum salinity limits, some authors describe H. werneckii as \\"extremely halotolerant\\". Several salt-tolerance mechanisms of H. werneckii have been studied on molecular level. For example, it is known that its major compatible solutes are glycerol, erythritol, arabitol, and mannitol; melanin accumulation of the cell wall aids in retention of at least glycerol inside of the cell. Several components of the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signalling pathway (which controls responses to osmotic shock) have been studied in detail and some seem to differ in function compared to their counterparts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Adaptation to high concentrations of salt are also accompanied by changes in membrane lipid composition, mainly by increasing the unsaturation of the phospholipid fatty acids. H. werneckii causes a rare superficial and non-invasive skin infection Tinea nigra. The typical symptoms are non-scaly, smooth, brown-black painless spots on the palms of hands and soles of feet. The growth of H. werneckii in liquid media is often yeast-like, although it can switch to filamentous growth. The mechanism of the switch is not known. The cells appear brown because of melanin production. Whole genome sequencing of H. werneckii revealed a recent whole genome duplication, thought to be the only reported whole-genome duplication among ascomycetous yeasts besides the better known one in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae lineage. Based on genome sequencing of additional strains, 10 out of 12 strains have a genome that was duplicated by several hybridizations between haploid strains, yielding formed stable diploids. Apart from these hybridization events, no signs of sexual reproduction were found. As a consequence, the genome of H. werneckii is relatively large (49.9 Mb) with 15974 predicted genes. Genes encoding metal cation transporters, which are thought to play a role in halotolerance, experienced several additional gene duplications at various points during their evolution. A homothallic mating locus was found in all sequenced genomes, although one of the mating genes may have been inactivated in some strains. Despite this, phylogenetic analyses and linkage disequilibrium analyses indicate that H. werneckii is asexual. == References == Category:Capnodiales ","title":"Hortaea werneckii"},{"id":"17320625","text":"Samastha Kerala Sunni Student Federation (SKSSF) is a student organisation affiliated to Samastha, a body of Sunni (Shafi‚Äòi) scholars and clerics in Kerala.

After attending schools in Britain and the US, he studied sculpture for four years at Chelsea School of Art and followed this with two years at the Arch Bronze Foundry, working with Ben Kneale. In 1985 he took part in designing masks and costumes for one of his father‚Äôs music theatre pieces at Dartington Summer School of Music. In 1986 he attended printing classes at the Royal Academy while preparing his first one-man show in London with Piano Nobile Fine Paintings. Since then he has regularly held solo shows at Piano Nobile and completed numerous commissions. ==Commissions and Paintings== Two paintings by Birtwistle have been purchased by the National Portrait Gallery in London : a portrait of his father, Sir Harrison,portrait of Sir Harrison National Gallery and one of Elvis Costello (Declan McManus).portrait of Elvis Costello National Gallery Other musicians, conductors and composers to feature in his paintings include the pianist Alfred Brendel, and the composers Hans Werner Henze and Sir Michael Tippett.

Chittick (September 18, 1924 ‚Äì July 27, 1984) was a British scholar and archaeologist. He specialized in the historic cultures of Northeast Africa, and also devoted various works to the Swahili Coast. ==Biography== Chittick was born in 1924. In a professional capacity, he initially worked in Sudan as the Director of Antiquities.Ogot, 2003. (p. 308). He later lived in Tanganyika, serving as the colonial territory's first Conservator of Antiquities. In 1961, Chittick was appointed the first Director of the British Institute in Eastern Africa in Nairobi. He worked in that position until 1983. After a long career in archaeology, Chittick died in 1984. He is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground. ==Expeditions== Chittick's expeditions and residence on the Swahili Coast produced a body of research into the pre-colonial sites Kilwa Kisiwani and the port of Manda Island. He also wrote extensively on the archaeology of ancient civilizations in the more northerly Horn of Africa, such as the Axumite Empire and the Hafun city-states. From late October to early December 1975, at the invitation of the Somali government, Chittick led a British-Somali archaeological expedition in the northern half of Somalia. Members of the party included the Director of the Somali National Museum in Mogadishu, Sa'id Ahmad Warsame, as well as 'Ali 'Abd al-Rahman and Fabby Nielson. Particular emphasis was placed on the area near Cape Guardafui in the far northeast. Financed by the Somali authorities, the reconnaissance mission found numerous examples of historical artefacts and structures, including ancient coins, Roman pottery, drystone buildings, cairns, mosques, walled enclosures, standing stones and platform monuments. Many of the finds were of pre-Islamic origin and associated with ancient settlements described by the 1st century Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, among other documents. Based on his discoveries, Chittick suggested in particular that the Damo site in the Hafun peninsula likely corresponded with the Periplus' \\"Market and Cape of Spices\\". Some of the smaller artefacts that Chittick's company found were later deposited for preservation at the British National Museum. ==Notes== ==References== *The British Institute in Eastern Africa.

He served as the 16th Minister-President of Cisleithania (therefore the 28th Minister-President of Austria overall). ==Biography== === Family === Born into a prominent Austro-Hungarian princely family of Bohemian origin (the Clary-Aldringens), the son of F√ºrst (prince) Edmund Moritz and F√ºrstin (princess) Elisabeth-Alexandrine von Clary-und-Aldringen, (born countess de Ficquelmont). He is the younger brother of F√ºrst (prince) Siegfried (1848‚Äì1929) who was a prominent Austro-Hungarian diplomat and the grandson of count Charles-Louis de Ficquelmont (1777‚Äì1857), 2nd Minister-President of the Austrian Empire. In 1884, he married in Vienna Gr√§fin (countess) Franziska Pej√°csevich von Ver√∂cze, heiress of one of the most powerful family of the Croatian descending from the princes Esterh√°zy von Gal√°ntha. The couple had two children. === Political career === Count Clary-und-Aldringen studied Law at the University of Vienna before starting a political career in Imperial Austria. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was dominated by a small circlecalled the 100 Familien (100 families) see Austrian nobility of high nobility familiessee List of princes of Austria-Hungary and List of counts of Austria-Hungary that had great power and enormous riches and thus played a major role in politics and diplomacy. Count Manfred is the perfect example of such an influence. On February 22, 1896, he became Governor of the L√§nder of Austrian-Silesia, a key office in a strategic region for the Empire: not only was the l√§nder rich in natural resources but it also lay at the border with both German and Russian Empires. Austrian-Silesia was heir to a long power struggle between these three empires and at the heart of the nationalistic issues of central European irredentisms. In 1898, Count Manfred became Governor and representative at the Imperial Austrian Reischrat (Imperial Austrian Council) for the L√§nder of Styria, an office of major importance he kept until the fall of the Empire in 1918. Styria was one of the powerhouses of the Austro-Hungarian economy, the l√§nder was a center of industries and agricultures, and its capital Graz was one of the Empire's most populous cities. From October 2 to December 21, 1899, Count Clary-und-Aldringen served as Minister-President of Austria, following in the steps of his grandfather, Count Charles-Louis de Ficquelmont (1777‚Äì1857) who succeeded Prince Metternich as the second Minister-President of the Empire in 1848. === Later life === Herrnau castle, Salzburg After the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire following the defeat of the Central Powers during the autumn of 1918, Count Manfred resigned from all his official offices and spent his remaining years between his estates in Austria and his family's Czech estates (Teplice). On February 12, 1928 count Manfred von Clary-und-Aldringen died in his Salzburg residence of Schoss Herrnau (Herrnau Castle). Count Clary und Aldringen is widely seen as a modernizer and has been regarded as both one of the most prominent statesman of the end of the Austro- Hungarian Empire and a symbol of the influence of the Austro-Hungarian high nobility in politics at the turn of the 19th century. He has also been well known for successfully fighting Tuberculosis when he was President of the Austrian Red Cross in Kronland. ==See also== * The House of Clary-Aldringen * Minister-President of Austria == Notes == ==Bibliography== * * : Badeni ‚Äì Thun ‚Äì Clary-Aldringen ‚Äì Eulenburg.

Present-day Bonneyville Mill County Park, is all that survives of Bonney's dream. Spanish silver peso was the most common currency found on the American frontier. Edward Bonney was arrested in 1842 for counterfeiting in northern Indiana. Ironically, from 1845-1846, as a detective and bounty hunter, Bonney posed undercover as a counterfeiter to infiltrate a faction of the Midwestern, outlaws known as the \\"Banditti of the Prairie\\" and track down the infamous murderers of Colonel George Davenport. The \\"Spanish milled dollar\\" was minted in M√©xico and was considered U.S. legal tender. As a result of this, the Spanish coin became one of the most counterfeited coins in the United States, until the Coinage Act of 1857.

He is best known for his undercover work in exposing the \\"Banditti of the Prairie\\", resulting from his investigation of the torture-murder of noted Illinois pioneer and frontiersman, Colonel George Davenport. ==Early life== Edward William Bonney was born and raised in Hittsboro, Essex County, New York. ==Founding of Bonneyville, Indiana== Edward Bonney got married and moved to the frontier, in Elkhart County, Indiana in 1837, with the intent of creating the city of Bonneyville, named after himself. In 1839, he was charged and fined for assault. Bonney built the Bonneyville Mill for grinding grain into flour and also built a saw mill. When Bonneyville failed to grow rapidly from a sleepy farm town into a bustling city, Bonney sold his most of the 80 acres he had purchased for his planned city in 1841. He later bought the Goshen Hotel in Bonneyville and not long after sold the hotel and both his mills. ==Arrest for alleged counterfeiting== After being arrested in 1842 for allegedly being a counterfeiter, Bonney escaped from custody while being transported under armed guard for trial in Indianapolis. Bonney immediately left Indiana and traveled to Illinois. ==Mormon affiliation and offices held in Nauvoo, Illinois== Bonney eventually \\"fiddle-footed his way\\" to Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1844, a Latter Day Saint community on the Mississippi River, where he and his wife decided to settle. Between March 14 and April 11, 1844, he was chosen by Joseph Smith, the founder and leader of the Mormon Church, who was a friend, to be a member of the Mormon theocratic \\"Council of Fifty. He was one of three non-members on the Mormon Council that made important government and community decisions for the Nauvoo Saints. Bonney was chosen by Smith to be his aide-de- camp in the Nauvoo Legion from June 18 to June 27, until the murder of Smith. After the murders of Joseph and Hyrum Smith in Carthage, Illinois, in 1844, Bonney, who as a non-Mormon was considered an outsider by the Nauvoo Mormon Church elders, lost his influential status among the Council of Fifty. He was released from his Council duties on February 4, 1845, and he left for Iowa. Bonney continued to be involved in fighting against criminal elements both outside and within the Nauvoo Mormon community. Bonney was also particularly antagonistic of the Mormon Danites. ==Bounty hunter and amateur detective in Montrose, Iowa Territory== In 1845, Edward Bonney moved across the Mississippi River from Nauvoo to Montrose, Lee County, Iowa Territory, now Montrose, Lee County, Iowa, where he operated a livery stable. During the next several years, he worked with law enforcement agencies, in Montrose and Lee County, to hunt down various criminals, in the area, as a sort of freelance bounty hunter. Bonney gradually attained a reputation as a skilled detective, adept at \\"piecing together odd bits of information and rumor\\", although he was often subject to suspicion and persecution for his Mormonism. ==Investigations of the Banditti of the Prairie and the murderers of Colonel Davenport== The criminal investigations of Edward Bonney into the criminal activity occurring along the vast mid-river area of the Mississippi between 1843-1848, attributed to the organization known as the \\"Banditti of the Prairie\\", were claimed by Bonney to being carried out by outlaws who considered themselves \\"self-styled\\" Mormons conveniently seeking refuge in Nauvoo as persecuted \\"Saints\\" where they headquartered their criminal activities unhindered by law enforcement.Storm, Colton. A Catalogue of the Everett D. Graff Collection of Western Americana. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1968. (pg. 55) It was not until going undercover within the organization, posing as a counterfeiter, that he was able to connect the gang to the torture-murder of Colonel George Davenport. After a four-month chase through Illinois, Missouri, Indiana and Ohio, he finally brought most of his murderers to justice. Of the eight men taken into custody, three of the four men involved in Davenport's murder, Granville Young and brothers John and Aaron Long, were convicted and hanged. The fourth man, Robert H. Birch, agreed to turn state's evidence and later escaped from jail. After learning \\"crime doesn't pay\\" Birch finally became an honest man and twelve years later, was one of the founders of the Pinos Altos gold mining camp in 1858 in the New Mexico Territory. ==Publication of the Banditti of the Prairies== In 1850, Edward Bonney wrote and published a sensational account of the Banditti of the Prairie, titled The Banditti of the Prairies: or, The murderer's doom, a tale of Mississippi Valley and the Far West, which was an immediate success and went through eight editions until 1858. Although, it is thought Bonney may have been assisted by a ghost writer, most likely Henry A. Clark, the book, though poorly written, by an amateur writer, is considered remarkably accurate, when compared with official court records and other official evidence. The Bonney book was not specifically anti-Mormon, but reflected his criticism of organized religion. ==Life after Colonel Davenport trial== Following the trial and execution of Granville Young and the Long brothers, Edward Bonney returned to Lee County, Iowa Territory the following year and was indicted by the local district court for murder and later acquitted. Bonney lived in Rock Island, Illinois for a time and before moving to Chicago in Prospect Park in DuPage County where he was appointed as the second postmaster of the town.Federal Writers' Project. Du Page County: A Descriptive and Historical Guide, 1831-1939. Elmhurst, Illinois: I.A. Ruby, 1948. (pg. 51-52) before settling in Aurora, Illinois around 1852. ==Detective in Chicago== . ==American Civil War service== In 1862, Edward Bonney was living in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois and continued working, as a bounty hunter and detective. In the same year, during the height of the American Civil War, Bonney, at age 56, enlisted into Captain John S. Williams Company G, 127th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, of the Union Army and participated in General Grant's Mississippi River Campaign, which included the Siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi, where he received a paralyzing leg wound. He was sent to the U.S. Marine Hospital, in St. Louis, Missouri, to recover from his severe wound. ==Death== Private Edward Bonney was medically discharged, from the Union Army, on December 23, 1863 and went back to Chicago, dying on February 4, 1864, as the result of his crippling leg wound.Thrapp, Dan L.

Having received his doctorate, he began a career as a state official at the Austrian Ministry of Commerce, where he was concerned with the establishment of the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways upon the Long Depression from 1873 onwards. As a proven expert, he was promoted to head of the railway department in 1886 and led the ministry for a short while in 1895. On 30 November 1897, Wittek was appointed Railway Minister in the Austrian government of Minister-President Paul Gautsch von Frankenthurn, a post he held in various succeeding Austrian cabinets until 1 May 1905. Upon the resignation of Count Manfred von Clary-Aldringen on 21 December 1899, he also served as acting Austrian Minister-President until the appointment of Ernest von Koerber on 18 January 1900. During Wittek's time in office, the public railroad network of the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways was significantly enlarged by an extensive construction programme, as decided by the Austrian Imperial Council parliament in 1901, including the Alpine Bohinj and Tauern Railway lines. Wittek is also credited with improving the social conditions of the railway employees. However, as the building projects suffered substantial cost overruns, he lost support and finally handed in his resignation on 1 May 1905. A few days later, his CS party colleague Mayor Karl Lueger made him an honorary citizen of Vienna. On August 16 he was appointed life peer of the Austrian House of Lords by Emperor Franz Joseph I. Upon the 1907 legislative election, he succeeded Mayor Karl Lueger as a CS member of the House of Deputies. Wittek died in Vienna and was buried in the Hietzing Cemetery. == References == == External links == * Entry on Aeiou Encyclopedia * Ott≈Øv slovn√≠k nauƒçn√Ω nov√© doby == See also == * Portrait Category:1852 births Category:1928 deaths Category:19th-century Ministers-President of Austria Category:Ministers-President of Austria Category:Austrian knights Category:Politicians from Vienna ","title":"Heinrich Ritter von Wittek"},{"id":"17320712","text":"Karl Witte.

He briefly served as Prime Minister of Austria (Cisleithania) in Austria‚ÄìHungary in 1906. ==Life== Prince Konrad was born in Vienna, the son of Prince Konstantin of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst (1828‚Äì1896), k.u.k. Chief Intendant and General of the Cavalry, and his wife Marie n√©e Princess of Sayn- Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1837‚Äì1920), a daughter of Carolyne zu Sayn- Wittgenstein, known for her liaison with Franz Liszt. By his father, Konrad was a nephew of Victor I, Duke of Ratibor, of Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe- Schillingsf√ºrst (Chancellor of Germany 1894-1900), and of Gustav Adolf, Cardinal Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst. Prince Konrad attended the Schottengymnasium and went on to study law at the University of Vienna from 1883 to 1887. He entered the Cisleithanian civil service in Prague and later worked at the k.k. Ministry of the Interior. Appointed district officer (Bezirkshauptmann) in Teplitz-Sch√∂nau, Bohemia, he proved to be a man of conciliation and social justice, when he achieved settlement of a miners' strike and granted permission for performance of Hauptmann's socially critical play The Weavers, which earned him the nickname \\"Red Prince\\". In 1888 Prince Konrad married Countess Franziska of Sch√∂nborn-Buchheim (1866-1937). One of their six children, Princess Franziska of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst (1897-1989), by her marriage with Archduke Maximilian Eugen of Austria, became the sister-in-law of Archduke Karl Franz of Austria, the last Emperor of Austria. Prince Hohenlohe with Georg Wassilko von Serecki in Berehomet, about 1903/04 In 1903/04, Prince Konrad served as k.k. Stadtholder (Steward) of the Bukovina in Czernowitz, and from 1904 as Stadtholder of the Austrian Littoral in Trieste. A confidant of the heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, he was appointed Minister-President of Cisleithania on 2 May 1906, in order to push through an electoral reform establishing universal male suffrage in elections to the Imperial Council, where his predecessor Paul Gautsch von Frankenthurn had failed. Prince Konrad tried to mobilize the votes of the Italian representatives in the Council against a \\"Slavic\\" block, but did not succeed in achieving a majority. He resigned within one month and returned to Trieste. It was left to his successor Max Wladimir von Beck to get the new electoral law passed. Prince Konrad remained Stadtholder of the Littoral until 1915. He had to cope with rising Italian irredentism and his measures of centralization in favour of the Vienna government met with strong protest. When the Kingdom of Italy threatened to join the Entente Powers, he resigned and temporarily joined the Imperial-Royal Landwehr forces on the Eastern Front. Back in Vienna he assumed the office of k.k. Minister of the Interior on 30 November 1915 in the cabinet of Minister-President Count Karl von St√ºrgkh. As minister, he evolved plans of re-arranging the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy into a federation of four major states: Austria proper, Hungary, Poland (Galicia), and \\"Illyria\\" (i.e. Croatia-Slavonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Dalmatia). However, those plans were rejected mainly by Hungarian politicians. Prince Konrad resigned as Interior Minister on 31 October 1916, shortly after Minister-President St√ºrgkh was assassinated by Friedrich Adler. From 2 December 1916 he served for three weeks as Joint Finance Minister of Austria-Hungary, before he was succeeded by Stephan Buri√°n von Rajecz on 22 December. Also from 2 December he was a member of the Austrian House of Lords until its dissolution in November 1918. With the end of World War I he retired from politics, and died shortly afterwards while hunting in Kammern im Liesingtal, Styria. ==External links == * Hohenlohe on Encyclopedia of Austria * Hohenlohe on Austrian Commanders == See also == * Konstantin zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst (de) * Marie zu Hohenlohe- Schillingsf√ºrst (de) * Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst, Hohenlohe- Schillingsf√ºrst Category:1863 births Category:1918 deaths Category:20th- century Ministers-President of Austria Category:Politicians from Vienna Category:Politicians of Bukovina Category:Austro-Hungarian politicians Category:19th-century Austrian people Category:Ministers-President of Austria Category:Austrian people of German descent Konrad Category:Austrian princes Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Austria Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint Alexander (Bulgaria) Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown (W√ºrttemberg) Category:Recipients of the Order of the Black Eagle Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Red Eagle Category:Grand Crosses of the Albert Order ","title":"Prince Konrad of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst"},{"id":"17320731","text":"Arhopala opalina, the opal oakblue, is a species of lycaenid or blue butterfly found in Assam, Burma, Thailand, the Malay Peninsula and Java.

Instead, the Administration extended diplomatic recognition to the Soviet government in November 1933, immediately after the Famine. *18 During the Famine certain members of the American press corps cooperated with the Soviet government to deny the existence of the Ukrainian Famine. *19 Recently, scholarship in both the West and, to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union has made substantial progress in dealing with the Famine. Although official Soviet historians and spokesmen have never given a fully accurate or adequate account, significant progress has been made in recent months. == References == == External links == * Full text: Investigation of the Ukrainian Famine 1932‚Äì1933: Report to Congress Category: Reports of the United States government Category: Soviet Union‚ÄìUnited States relations Category: Holodomor Category:Famines in Europe Category:1985 establishments in the United States Category:Government agencies established in 1985 Category:1988 disestablishments in the United States Category:Public inquiries in the United States ","title":"U.S. Commission on the Ukraine Famine"},{"id":"17320793","text":"All Saints‚Äô Church is a church in Monkwearmouth, Sunderland, England.

He graduated from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1927 and was a prolific researcher and writer of academic publications. A professor of chemistry at the Norwegian Institute of Technology from 1936, he was also among the pioneers of heavy water research, and was instrumental when a heavy water plant was built at Vemork. During World War II Norway was invaded by Germany and Tronstad conducted domestic resistance for one year before fleeing the country for England. There, he gathered valuable intelligence from Norwegian sources, both on the development of the V-2 rocket and the growing German interest in heavy water. In 1943 Tronstad planned Operation Gunnerside, in which the German access to heavy water processing at Vemork was severely impeded. His information about the V-2 rocket contributed to the massive Allied bombing of Peenem√ºnde. For a long time Tronstad had wanted to return to Norway to organize resistance work, however he was prevented by the Norwegian military authorities in Britain. In 1944, however, he did travel to Norway, to organize Operation Sunshine, for the defence of Norwegian infrastructure. After five months in the country, he was killed in action after his team had taken the local bailiff hostage. ==Early life== Tronstad was born in B√¶rum; the son of Hans Larsen and Josefine Amalie Tronstad, Hans died three months before Leif was born. Leif thus grew up in Sandvika with his mother and four siblings. He graduated from middle school in 1918, with top grades in mathematics. He then embarked on thirty months of professional practice in two local electricity companies, which was a requirement to enrol at Kristiania Technical School, a predecessor of the Faculty of Engineering at Oslo University College. When he enrolled in 1920 he chose technical chemistry instead of electronic engineering. He graduated in 1922, the best chemistry student; a fellow student recalled that he \\"did not have to read anything more than once\\" in order to remember it. In the spring of 1923, he also took the examen artium after attending the Haagaas School for one year.Studentene fra 1923 p. 391 He was ready to enroll at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, but waited one year, possibly wanting to strengthen his personal finances. In the meantime, he started on his compulsory military service. He was an accomplished athlete and helped his hometown club Grane SK to two Norwegian 4 √ó 1500 metres relay records. The records were set in 1921 and 1923, but broken by the team IL i BUL in 1926. His brother John, a bronze medalist in 1500 metres at the 1917 Norwegian championships, was on the relay team as well. Both brothers used their father's name Larsen at the time; Leif took up his mother's name Tronstad later. In 1924 Tronstad moved to Trondheim to study at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, graduating in 1927. His graduation paper was deemed exceptional and as such was reported to King Haakon of Norway. Regarded as a fully-fledged academic work, it was published scientifically in 1928. Tronstad had taken various stray jobs while studying, and also finished his military service, reaching the rank of Second Lieutenant in the Norwegian Army Corps of Weaponry in 1927. From 1927 to 1928 Tronstad worked briefly as an assistant at the Norwegian Institute of Technology as well as in a private company in Kristiansand. In 1928 he returned to the Norwegian Institute of Technology as a research fellow. In the same year, Tronstad married Edla Obel, who was nine years his junior, in Trondheim. The couple had two children. ==Academic career== Tronstad spent the first year of a research period as an assistant to Herbert Freundlich in Dahlem, Berlin. He studied the passivity of metal surfaces, and made a breakthrough when he managed to measure extremely thin oxide surface coatings, thus solving a problem dating from the time of Michael Faraday. He continued to Stockholm to study metallography under Carl Benedicks, and to elaborate further on his results from Berlin. The work was completed in 1931 and his thesis, spanning 250 pages, was published in German as Optische Untersuchungen zur Frage der Passivit√§t des Eisens und Stahls. For it, he received the doctorate degree. He was hired at the Norwegian Institute of Technology as a lecturer in the summer of 1931, although he spent the first year at the University of Cambridge, conducting further research with a scholarship from a memorial fund of Christian Michelsen. The research at Cambridge was a continuation of his thesis work, but this time he tested his method on mercury. Following the death in 1934 of a professor of technical inorganic chemistry at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, Tronstad was appointed his successor on 17 April 1936, effective from 1 May. At the time, he was one of the youngest professors in Norway. He was a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters, and in early 1940 he became vice president of the Norwegian Chemical Society. During his short scientific career, Tronstad penned about eighty scientific publications, including fourteen on heavy water-related topics. Vemork in 1935. Vemork power station in 2008. The electrolyzing plant no longer exists. The properties of heavy water had been discovered in 1932 by Harold Urey. In 1933, Leif Tronstad and Jomar Brun, the head of Norsk Hydro Rjukan, created a plan for industrial production of heavy water in Norway. As Norsk Hydro were already producing ammonia for nitrogen fertilizer, Tronstad and Brun had realized that large amounts of electrolyzed water were available. Tronstad was paid by Norsk Hydro as a consultant. Already in 1934, Norsk Hydro had opened a plant near the power station at Vemork. This was the world's first plant for industrial mass production of heavy water. Both French and German scientists expressed interest in the project. ==World War II== ===German invasion of Norway=== Tronstad, holding a military rank, had a standing order to report to the Norwegian military headquarters in Oslo in the face of a military peril. When Germany invaded Norway on 9 April 1940, he first informed his students of the situation, and then drove towards Oslo. He brought his wife and children with him, but having no intention of taking them to a possible theatre of war, he left them in the Drivdalen valley. He continued alone but shortly after, upon learning that Oslo was the first city to fall to the invaders, he stopped at Dovre. The family had a cabin in the vicinity. Here, he helped organize volunteers from local rifle associations to form a line of defence meant to repel any advancing German forces. German Fallschirmj√§ger paratroops did land at nearby Domb√•s, but were surprised by a contingent of regular Norwegian forces already in the area, who ensured a tactical victory for Norway in the ensuing Battle of Domb√•s. ===Resistance=== When the Norwegian Campaign ended and the German occupation of Norway was a reality, Tronstad became involved in resistance work, largely based around the Norwegian Institute of Technology. He was associated with the radio agent group Skylark B, which had regular contact with London from January 1941. Among other things, he sent reports on the interest shown by German authorities in the heavy water plant at Vemork. One source of this information was Tronstad's old companion, Jomar Brun, still in charge of the plant, who also helped people to flee the country by sea, via the M√∏re coast. After exposure of the group in September 1941, Tronstad himself had to flee the country. Another resistance member, who had already been jailed, managed to warn Tronstad, who travelled from Trondheim to Oslo by train. The following day, the Gestapo visited his house to arrest him. After a few days in hiding, Tronstad was driven by car to √òstfold, and then travelled on foot to T√∂cksfors via √òrje. From there he continued by plane to England, rejecting an offer of a civilian job in Sweden. He reached England in October 1941. He already had a broad network of contacts there, stemming both from his academic career as well as from his radio operations. He also maintained several contacts abroad, including scientists whom he knew from the Norwegian Institute of Technology: Harald Wergeland and Nj√•l Hole. The opportunity to work directly for the British was presented to Tronstad, but instead he chose to aim his efforts towards disrupting the German occupation of Norway and improving the Norwegian resistance work. He even wanted to enrol in active duty, but was stopped by the Norwegian military command, who considered him \\"too valuable\\" for the war theatre. Tronstad's foremost skill was that of organization, which he owed to his experience in science. Thus, Tronstad became a part of the staff of the Ministry of Defence, and later of the Norwegian High Command. From 1943, he headed a section in department 4 (FO IV). This had been established in December 1942 under the leadership of Colonel Bjarne √òen, and Tronstad was brought in as a reinforcement as the work burden increased. Also, he had recently been promoted from Captain to Major. Tronstad's section was responsible for the special operation towards industry and shipping; training of the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (Kompani Linge); technical advice on sabotage, and towards the end of the war also the protection of Norwegian industry. He established the Norwegian High Command Technical Committee, which included other Norwegian scientists-in-exile such as Svein Rosseland, Helmer Dahl and Gunnar Randers. The Technical Committee is considered as the precursor to the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, established in 1946. ===Heavy water sabotage=== Already in 1941, Tronstad was aware that heavy water production at Vemork had greatly increased. In the beginning, Tronstad had not been aware of the connection between heavy water and atomic weaponry, but it eventually became clear that Germany could be running a nuclear energy project, especially after Harold Urey visited the United Kingdom in November 1941. Tronstad later learned from Jomar Brun that further expansion of heavy water production was being discussed. Brun had been a part of a small conference on the issue, hosted by Kurt Diebner in Berlin, in January 1942. Brun would later communicate with England through Einar Skinnarland, a covert Special Operations Executive agent hailing from Rjukan. In October 1942, Brun was summoned to England, reportedly at the request of Winston Churchill. Instead, a team of agents were parachuted into the area to gather more intelligence, under the codename Operation Grouse. The idea of subjecting the heavy water facility at Vemork to heavy air bombing surfaced, but Tronstad was a staunch opponent of such an idea, which he saw as too hazardous. He warned of the presence of civil housing, and argued that bombing was not even guaranteed to succeed, given that the heavy water facility was located in the armoured basement of the electrolyzing plant. The first attempt to take out the facility, in November 1942, had consisted of British personnel using gliders to land near Vemork. The operation, codenamed Freshman, was a catastrophe, as all units except for one towing aircraft perished, either due to crash landings or in German captivity. Tronstad then organized the next attempt. He had wanted to take an active part in the sabotage mission, but again he was stopped by his commanders, who regarded him as inexpendable. Tronstad and Brun supplied the would-be saboteurs with extensive knowledge of the facility, and organized the training. The operation, codenamed Gunnerside and led by Joachim R√∏nneberg, was carried out successfully between 27 and 28 February 1943. However, after three months, Germany managed to resume production. Against the will of Tronstad, in July 1943, an American-led raid by 161 aircraft bombed Vemork as well as the shipment yard at Her√∏ya. The two bombings claimed the lives of 76 people, many of whom were civilian. The heavy water plant was not directly affected by the bombing, nevertheless production was halted due to a damaged generator. The Germans then tried to disassemble the production facility, followed by a retreat from Vemork with the remaining stock of heavy water. This resulted in the sinking of by Norwegian saboteurs, halting the heavy water transport, but again claiming many civilian lives. Tronstad had given his consent to the latter operation, reportedly with a \\"heavy heart\\". Concealed listening posts at Rjukan and Notodden also revealed high-level German discussions of long-range weaponry. The place name Peenem√ºnde was frequently mentioned. As this intelligence reaching Tronstad's ear via his contacts in Norway, he forwarded it to the British. As a result, the Royal Air Force bombed the Army Research Center of Peenem√ºnde in August 1943. Further raids were made by the US Army Air Force in July and August 1944. The bombing halted the weapons program there, which centered around development of the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rocket. Fellow scientists Rideal and Evans later wrote that Tronstad \\"contributed directly to the speedy victory of the Allied Nations, besides saving the region which came to be known as 'Southern England' from an even longer and more severe ordeal than it actually endured\\". ===Operation Sunshine=== In 1944, when the tide of war was turning against Germany, the German forces started to retreat from Northern Norway. However, they used scorched earth tactics as they retreated. Consequently, Tronstad started to plan how to organize a defence of industrial sites in Southern Norway. The first plan pertained to Upper Telemark, and was codenamed Operation Sunshine. Its basic principle was to build a defence force from the existing Milorg pockets in the district. Tronstad, who earlier had been stopped from travelling to Norway himself, did so this time. He felt that it was time to deal a decisive blow to a dwindling German war power, and called for the \\"full effort ... from all who would be called men\\". Tronstad was parachuted into Hardangervidda on 4 October 1944, together with eight Norwegian Independent Company 1 members. The group included Gunnar Syverstad, Jens-Anton Poulsson and Claus Helberg. They lived in a small cabin built by Einar Skinnarland. However, after a few months a situation arose that could compromise the operation. It was feared that Torgeir Lognvik, the bailiff installed by the Nazis in Rauland municipality, had become suspicious. Thus, the people behind Operation Sunshine created a plan to lure him to the mountains, and capture and interrogate him there. On 11 March 1945, resistance member Jon Landsverk managed to travel with Torgeir Lognvik towards the mountains on the pretext of showing him some stolen goods. The two were soon met by Gunnar Syverstad and Einar Skinnarland, who captured the bailiff. He was taken to a lodge in the hills of Syrebekkst√∏len, where he was to be interrogated by Landsverk, Syverstad and Tronstad. However, on the same day, Torgeir's brother Johans became suspicious and decided to follow the ski trails, which led him to Syrebekkst√∏len. Armed, he entered the lodge, firing several shots, taking the Resistance fighters by surprise. Gunnar Syverstad was killed in the initial attack. Torgeir, who was not bound, grabbed a rifle. In the struggle, Tronstad charged at Johans, but was killed. The two brothers then escaped. Jon Landsverk survived, and together with Einar Skinnarland he disposed of the two bodies in a lake. However, the next day the bodies were found and burned by German forces. After the war, Jon Landsverk testified against the Lognvik brothers as a part of the legal purge in Norway after World War II. While Landsverk claimed that the wounded Tronstad had been killed by a blow from the butt of a rifle held by Torgeir, the court found Johans guilty of both murders, and Torgeir of attempted murder. Johans was sentenced to a ten-year prison term, and Torgeir to a five-year term. ===Diaries=== Tronstad's coded diaries from 1941 to 1945 are preserved, and the 13 original books are kept by the National Archival Services of Norway. They have been transcribed and made available to historians, and are regarded as an important source of information from the \\"outer front\\". ==Awards and legacy== Tronstad had a military funeral on 30 May 1945, being buried at Vestre gravlund in Oslo. He was awarded Norway's highest decoration for military gallantry, the War Cross with sword, as well as the Norwegian War Medal and the Defence Medal 1940‚Äì1945. In addition to his Norwegian decorations, Tronstad received the Order of the British Empire, Chevalier of the French L√©gion d'honneur and Croix de guerre and the US Medal of Freedom with bronze palm as well as the British Distinguished Service Order. A memorial stone was raised at Syrebekkst√∏len, commemorating the death of Tronstad and Gunnar Syverstad. Also, several streets in Norway have been named after him. A statue of Tronstad today stands at the square Leif Tronstads plass in Sandvika, the administrative centre of B√¶rum. It was commissioned in 1965 by the local Rotary club, and erected in 1973.

A few members of this serving class enjoyed high social status and were appointed officials by the Sapa Inca.Childress, D. (2000). Who's who in Inca society. Calliope, 10(7), 14. They could own property and sometimes had their own farms, before and after the conquest. The Spanish continued the yanakuna tradition developing it further as yanakuna entered Spanish service as Indian auxiliaries or encomienda indians. ==Etymology and spelling== The word yana in Quechua, the main Inca language, means black, servant, and is possibly derived from the verb yanapa to help, Qosqo Quechua, yana, black, servant, partner, spouse, and paramour. The -kuna suffix in yanakuna indicates the plural,Alan L. Kolata, Ancient Inca, Cambridge University Press, 2013 thus if yana is translated as \\"servants\\" yanakuna is \\"servants\\"Garcilazo de la Vega, Primera Parte de los Comentarios Reales de los Incas(1609), available online or \\"slaves\\".Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Biling√ºe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary) Hispanicized spellings of yanakuna are yanacona and yanaconas. == Inca Empire == In the Inca Empire yanakuna was the name of the servants to the Inca elites. The word servant, however, is misleading about the identity and function of the yanakuna.The Inca and Aztec States 1400-1800. Anthropology and History by George A. Collier; Renato I. Rosaldo; John D. Wirth. It is important to note that they were not forced to work as slaves. Some were born into the category of yanakuna (like many other professions, it was a hereditary one), some chose to leave ayllus to work, and some were selected by nobles.Malpass, M. A. (1996). Daily life in the inca empire. (pp. 55). Greenwood Publishing Group. They were to care for the herds of the nobles, do fishing, and were dedicated to other work, like the making of pottery, construction, and domestic service. Yanakuna were sometimes given high positions in the Inca government. Mitma is a term commonly associated with yanakuna, but its meaning is different, as the mitmaqkuna were used as labor for large projects. Yanakuna were specifically not a part of an ayllu and were relocated individually instead of in large labor groups. An example of the differences of the classes is that mitmaqkuna were labor that built Machu Picchu, but yanakuna lived and served the Inca there.Bethany L. Turner, George D. Kamenov, John D. Kingston, George J. Armelagos, Insights into immigration and social class at Machu Picchu, Peru based on oxygen, strontium, and lead isotopic analysis, Journal of Archaeological In Chile, the mapuche used this word to refer to alleged \\"traitors of their race\\". The concept of traitor was unknown to them, so when asked to translate the word from Spanish they referred to the Spanish native auxiliaries. == Spanish Empire == When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in modern-day Peru, the yanakuna declared themselves \\"friends of the Spaniards.\\"Stern, S. J. (1982). Peru's Indian peoples and the challenge of spanish conquest. (pp. 30-55). Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press. They assisted the Spaniards to take control of the empire. These people, who the Spaniards, during the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, began to use the name for the indigenous people they had in servitude, in encomiendas, or in military forces as indios auxiliares (Indian auxiliaries). After the conquest, the yanakuna population grew rapidly with people leaving ayllus to work in mining. Spaniards favored the individual yanakuna (as they were an alternative labor force) instead of the ayllu-based encomienda system, so the population continued to increase. The Spaniards did not share the same views of yanakuna as the elites did in the Incan Empire. Sometimes, Indians had to leave ayllus to pay off debts and other forms of economic dependence. The population was not large enough, however, to replace the encomienda system but instead supplemented it.Stern, S.J. (1982). Peru's Indian peoples and the challenge of Spanish conquest. (pp. 155). Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press. The term yanakuna also was used during the conquest of Chile and other areas of South America. ==See also== *Indios reyunos *Indios amigos *Yanacona language ==References== == Sources == * Ann M.

He attended school in Lemberg (Lviv), Galicia, in Hermannstadt (Sibiu), and at the Theresian Academy in Vienna. In 1883, he enrolled at the University of Vienna to study canon law, obtaining his doctorate sub auspiciis Imperatoris in 1889. He went on to give lectures at the Theresian Academy and became an educator of Prince Abbas II, the future Khedive of Egypt. From 1892, Hussarek served at the k.k. Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs and also worked as a private lecturer. In 1895 he was appointed professor of ecclesiastical law at the Vienna University. Two years later he was appointed head of the Ministry's Catholic Church department; from 1907, he led the Office of Religious Affairs. A member of the Christian Social Party, Hussarek served as Education Minister in the Cisleithanian cabinets of Karl von St√ºrgkh, Ernest von Koerber, and Heinrich Clam-Martinic from 1911 to 1917. He worked for the recognition of Evangelical professorships at the theological department of the Vienna University and had Sunni Islam, according to the Hanafi school of jurisprudence, acknowledged as a religious community.

Facing the American entry into World War I, and the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, as well as rapidly deteriorating supply conditions, he tried in vain to hinder the collapse by an Imperial manifesto (V√∂lkermanifest). The manifesto was issued by Charles I on October 16, granting wide-range autonomy to the Cisleithanian nations. The declaration failed: while several constituent national assemblies convened in the Austrian crown lands, the manifesto was rejected by the Hungarian minister-president S√°ndor Wekerle and two days later the Budapest government officially terminated the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. Hussarek resigned on October 27, the Cisleithanian cabinet of his successor Heinrich Lammasch was already referred to as \\"liquidation ministry\\".

The history of Catholic Mariology traces theological developments and views regarding Mary from the early Church to the 21st century. Mariology is a mainly Catholic ecclesiological study within theology, which centers on the relation of Mary, the Mother of God, and the Church. Theologically, it not only deals with her life but with her veneration in life and prayer, in art, music, and architecture, from ancient Christianity to modern times. Throughout history, Catholics have continued to build churches to honor the Blessed Virgin. Today, many Catholic churches dedicated to the Blessed Virgin exist on all continents and, in a sense, their evolving architecture tells the unfolding story of the development of Catholic Mariology. Throughout Catholic history, the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary has led to the creation of numerous items of Roman Catholic Marian art. Today, these items may be viewed from an artistic perspective, but also they are part of the fabric of Catholic Mariology. == Mary in the Early Church == Roman catacombs, 4th century. \\"Many centuries were necessary to arrive at the explicit definition of the revealed truths concerning Mary,\\" said Pope John Paul II during his papacy in the 1995.Pope John Paul II, \\"General Audience\\", 8 November 1995 The importance of Mary and of Marian theology can be seen in the Church after the third century. The New Testament Gospels, composed during the late 1st century, contain the first references to the life of Mary; the New Testament Epistles, composed earlier, make no mention of her by name. There are, however, references to Mary in the Epistles, most notably in Galatians.Sr. M. Danielle Peters, \\"An Overview of New Testament References,\\" The Mary Page, retrieved 21 January 2015.Galatians 4:4, \\"But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law\\" (NASB) In the 2nd century, St. Irenaeus of Lyons called Mary the \\"second Eve\\" because through Mary and her willing acceptance of God's choice, God undid the harm that was done through Eve's choice to eat the forbidden fruit. The earliest recorded prayer to Mary is the sub tuum praesidium (3rd or 4th century) and the earliest depictions of her are from the Priscilla catacombs in Rome (early 3rd century). Hugo Rahner's 20th- century discovery and reconstruction of Saint Ambrose's 4th-century view of Mary as the Mother of the Church was adopted at the Second Vatican Council. This shows the influence of early traditions and views on Mary in modern times.Burke, Raymond L.; et al. (2008). Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons page 587Heart of the Redeemer by Timothy Terrance O'Donnell 1992 page 83Lumen gentium, Chapter 8 This view was then emphasized by Pope John Paul II in 1997, and today Mary is viewed as the Mother of the Church by many Catholics, as well as the Queen of Heaven. In the 5th century, the Third Ecumenical Council debated the question of whether Mary should be referred to as Theotokos or Christotokos.Braaten Carl E., and Jenson, Robert W. Mary, Mother of God, 2004, p. 84 Theotokos means \\"God- bearer\\" or \\"Mother of God\\"; its use implies that Jesus, to whom Mary gave birth, is truly God and man in one person. Nestorians preferred the title Christotokos meaning \\"Christ-bearer\\" or \\"Mother of the Messiah\\" not because they denied Jesus' divinity, but because they believed that God the Son or Logos existed before time and before Mary, and that Mary was mother only of Jesus as a human, so calling her \\"Mother of God\\" was confusing and potentially heretical. Both sides agreed that Jesus took divinity from God the Father and humanity from his mother. The majority at the council agreed with the Pope that denying Mary the title Theotokos would either imply that Jesus was not divine, or that Jesus had two separate personhoods, one of whom was son of Mary and the other not. Ultimately, the council affirmed the use of the title Theotokos and by doing so affirmed Jesus' undivided divinity and humanity. Thus, while the debate was over the proper title for Mary, it was primarily a Christological question about the nature of Jesus Christ, a question which would return at the Fourth Ecumenical Council. Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican theological teaching affirms the title Mother of God, while other Christian denominations give no such title to her. == Medieval Mariology == The medieval cathedral Notre Dame dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Paris France, was built in the years 1163‚Äì1345. The Middle Ages saw a growth and development of Mariology. Belief in the Assumption of Mary became widespread across the Christian world from the 6th century onward, and is celebrated on 15 August in both the East and the West.Butler, Alban and Burns, Paul. Butler's Lives of the Saints, 1998 pp. 140-141 The Medieval period brought major champions of Marian devotion to the fore, including Ephraim the Syrian and John Damascene. The Dogma of the Immaculate Conception developed within the Catholic Church over time. Conception of Mary was celebrated as a liturgical feast in England from the 9th century, and the doctrine of her \\"holy\\" or \\"immaculate\\" conception was first formulated in a tract by Eadmer, companion and biographer of the better- known St. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury (1033‚Äì1109), and later popularized by the archbishop's nephew, Anselm the Younger.Mary's Immaculate Conception The Normans had suppressed the celebration, but it lived on in the popular mind. It was rejected by St. Bernard of Clairvaux, Alexander of Hales, and St. Bonaventure (who, teaching at Paris, called it \\"this foreign doctrine\\", indicating its association with England), and by St. Thomas Aquinas who expressed questions about the subject, but said that he would accept the determination of the Church. Aquinas and Bonaventure, for example, believed that Mary was completely free from sin, but that she was not given this grace at the instant of her conception. The majority of Western Marian writers during this period belonged to the monastic tradition, particularly the Benedictines. The twelfth and thirteenth centuries saw an extraordinary growth of the cult of the Virgin in western Europe, in part inspired by the writings of theologians such as Saint Bernard of Clairvaux (1090‚Äì1153). Bernard of Clairvaux was one of the most influential churchmen of his time. In the \\"Sermon on the Sunday in the Octave of the Assumption\\" he described Mary's participation in redemption.Pope Benedict XVI. \\"General Audience\\", 21 October 2009, L'Osservatore Romano, 28 October 2009, p. 24 Bernard's Praises on the Virgin Mother was a small but complete treatise on Mariology.Duignan, Brian. Medieval Philosophy, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2011 Pope Pius XII's 1953 encyclical Doctor Mellifluus, issued in commemoration of the eighth centenary of Bernard's death, quotes extensively from Bernard's sermon on Mary as \\"Our Lady, Star of the Sea\\".Hom. II super \\"Missus est,\\" 17; Migne, P. L., CLXXXIII, 70-b, c, d, 71-a. Quoted in Doctor Mellifluus 31 Western types of the Virgin's image, such as the twelfth-century ‚ÄúThrone of Wisdom‚Äù, in which the Christ Child is presented frontally as the sum of divine wisdom, seem to have originated in Byzantium. This was much used in Early Netherlandish painting in works like the Lucca Madonna by Jan van Eyck. Theologically, one major controversy of the age was the Immaculate Conception. Anthony of Padua (1195‚Äì1231) supported Mary's freedom from sin and her Immaculate Conception.Huber, Raphael Mary, St. Anthony of Padua: Doctor of the Church Universal, 1948 p. 31Huber, Raphael M. ‚ÄúThe Mariology of St. Anthony of Padua,‚Äù in Studia Mariana 7, Proceedings of the First Franciscan National Marian Congress in Acclamation of the Dogma of the Assumption, October 8‚Äì11, 1950 Burlington, Wisconsin His many sermons on the Virgin Mary shaped the Mariological approach of many Franciscans who followed his approach for centuries after his death.Kleinhenz, Christopher. Medieval Italy: an encyclopedia, Vol. 1, 2003 p. 40 Oxford Franciscans William of Ware and especially John Duns Scotus defended the doctrine. Scotus proposed a solution to the theological problem involved of being able to reconcile the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, by arguing that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ. Rather it was the result of a more perfect redemption given to her on account of her special role in history. Furthermore, Scotus said that Mary was redeemed in anticipation of Christ's death on the cross.Fastiggi, Robert. \\"11 questions answered about Mary, OSV Newsweekly, April 29, 2015 Scotus' defense of the immaculist thesis was summed up by one of his followers as potuit, decuit ergo fecit ‚Äì God could do it, it was fitting that He did it, and so He did it. Gradually the idea that Mary had been cleansed of original sin at the very moment of her conception began to predominate, particularly after Duns Scotus dealt with the major objection to Mary's sinlessness from conception, that being her need for redemption.Ludwig Ott, Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, Mercier Press Ltd., Cork, Ireland, 1955 The very divine act, in making Mary sinless at the first instant of her conception was, he argued, the most perfect form of redemption possible. By the end of the Middle Ages, Marian feasts were firmly established in the calendar of the liturgical year. Pope Clement IV (1265‚Äì1268) created a poem on the seven joys of Mary, which in its form is considered an early version of the Franciscan rosaryOtto Stegm√ºller Clemens IV in Marienkunde, 1159 == Renaissance to Baroque == As an example of Baroque painting and architecture, Ettal Abbey, 1776: frescos under the dome, dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, unite heaven and earth. Beginning in the 13th century, the Renaissance period witnessed a dramatic growth in Marian art, by masters such as Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael.Renaissance Art: A Very Short Introduction by Geraldine A. Johnson 2005 pages 103-104 Some was specifically produced to decorate the Marian churches built in this period. Major Italian artists with Marian motifs include: Fra Angelico, Donatello, Sandro Botticelli, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Piero di Cosimo Paolo Uccello Antonello da Messina Andrea Mantegna, Piero della Francesca and Carlo Crivelli. Dutch and German artists with Marian paintings include: Jean Bellegambe, Hieronymus Bosch, Petrus Christus, Gerard David (c.1455‚Äì1523), Hubert van Eyck, Geertgen tot Sint Jans, Quentin Matsys, Rogier van der Weyden, Albrecht Altdorfer, Hans Baldung and Albrecht D√ºrer. French and Spanish artists with Marian paintings include: Jean Fouquet, Jean Clouet, Fran√ßois Clouet, Barth√©lemy d'Eyck, Jean Hey (formerly known as the Master of Moulins), Bartolom√© Bermejo, Ayne Bru, Juan de Flandes, Jaume Huguet, and Paolo da San Leocadio. Francis of Assisi is credited with setting up the first known presepio or cr√®che (Nativity scene). He was also particularly devoted to Christ's passion and crucifixion.Robson, Michael J., The Cambridge Companion to Francis of Assisi, Cambridge University Press, 2011 The influence of the Franciscans gave rise to a more affective spirituality. Pope Sixtus IV, a Franciscan, greatly increased the prominence given to Mary, introducing the Presentation of Mary (1472) and extending the Feast of the Visitation, for the whole church (1475), and introducing the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, observed by the Franciscans since 1263 but strenuously opposed by the Dominicans and still highly-controversial in the fifteenth century.[Hollingsworth, Mary, Patronage in Renaissance Italy, John Murray, 1994] Around the time of the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 many Orthodox monks fled to the West, bringing with them traditions of iconography. Depictions of the Madonna and Child can be traced to the Eastern Theotokos. In the Western tradition, depictions of the Madonna were greatly diversified by Renaissance masters such as Duccio, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, Caravaggio and Rubens. The early Renaissance saw an increased emphasis on Christ crucified and therefore Mary as the Sorrowful Mother, an object of compassionate devotion.Viladesau, Richard. The Triumph of the Cross, Oxford University Press, 2008 Artists such as Titian depicted Mary as the Mater Dolorosa. With the Protestant Reformation, Roman Catholic Mariology came under attack as being sacrilegious and superstitious. Protestant leaders like Martin Luther and John Calvin, while personally adhering to Marian beliefs like virgin birth and sinlessness, considered Catholic veneration of Mary as competition to the divine role of Jesus Christ. Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina composed numerous Marian Masses. As a reflection of this theological opposition, Protestant reformers destroyed much religious art and Marian statues and paintings in churches in northern Europe and England. Some of the Protestant reformers, in particular Andreas Karlstadt, Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin, encouraged the removal of religious images by invoking the Decalogue's prohibition of idolatry and the manufacture of graven images of God. Major iconoclastic riots took place in Z√ºrich (in 1523), Copenhagen (1530), M√ºnster (1534), Geneva (1535), Augsburg (1537), and Scotland (1559). Protestant iconoclasm swept through the Seventeen Provinces (now the Netherlands and Belgium and parts of Northern France) in the summer of 1566. In the middle of the 16th century, the Council of Trent confirmed the Catholic tradition of paintings and artworks in churches. This resulted in a great development of Marian art and Mariology during the Baroque Period. At the same time, the Catholic world was engaged in ongoing Ottoman Wars in Europe against Turkey which were fought under the auspices of the Virgin Mary. The victory at Battle of Lepanto (1571) was accredited to her \\"and signified the beginning of a strong resurgence of Marian devotions, focusing especially on Mary, the Queen of Heaven and Earth and her powerful role as mediator of many graces\\".Otto Stegm√ºller, Barock, in Marienkunde, 1967 566 The Colloquium Marianum, an elite group, and the Sodality of Our Lady based their activities on a virtuous life, free of cardinal sins. The baroque literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth with over 500 pages of Mariological writings during the 17th century alone.A Roskovany, conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873 The Jesuit Francisco Su√°rez (1548-1617) was the first theologian who used the Thomist method on Mariology and is considered the father of systematic Mariology. Other well-known contributors to baroque Mariology are Lawrence of Brindisi, Robert Bellarmine, and Francis of Sales. After 1650, the Immaculate Conception is the subject of over 300 publications from Jesuit authors alone.Otto Stegm√ºller, Mariologisches Schrifttum in der Barockzeit, 1967 568 This popularity was at times accompanied with Marian excesses and alleged revelations of the Virgin Mary to individuals like Mar√≠a de √Ågreda.who was placed on the Index of forbidden book of the Church in 1681. Many of the baroque authors defended Marian spirituality and Mariology. In France, the often anti-Marian Jansenists were combated by John Eudes and Louis de Montfort, canonized by Pope Pius XII.although in 1673, the Holy Office itself acted against his book on slavery. (Stegm√ºller, 573) Baroque Mariology was supported by several popes during the period: Popes Paul V and Gregory XV ruled in 1617 and 1622 that it is inadmissible to state that the virgin was conceived non-immaculate. Alexander VII declared in 1661 that the soul of Mary was free from original sin. Pope Clement XI ordered the feast of the Immaculata for the whole Church in 1708. The feast of the Rosary was introduced in 1716 and the feast of the Seven Sorrows in 1727. The Angelus prayer was strongly supported by Pope Benedict XIII in 1724 and by Pope Benedict XIV in 1742.F Z√∂pfl, Barocke Fr√∂mmigkeit, in Marienkunde, 577 Popular Marian piety was more colorful and varied than ever before: Numerous Marian pilgrimages, Marian Salve devotions, new litanies, Marian theatre plays, Marian hymns, Marian processions. Marian fraternities, today mostly defunct, had millions of members.Z√∂pfl 579 Lasting impressions from the baroque Mariology are in the field of classical music, painting and art, architecture, and in the numerous Marian shrines from the baroque period in Spain, France, Italy, Austria and Bavaria as also in some South American cities. == Mariology during the Enlightenment == Santa Maria della Salute, Venice, 1629. During the Age of Enlightenment, the emphasis on scientific progress and rationalism put Catholic theology and Mariology on the defensive. The Church continued to stress the virginity and special graces, but deemphasized Marian cults.RG Giessler, die geistliche Lieddichting im Zeitalter der Aufkl√§rung. 1928, 987 During this period, Marian theology was even discontinued in some seminaries (for example: in Salzburg Austria in the year 1782Narr Zoepfl Mariologie der Aufkl√§rung, 1967, 411). Some theologians proposed the abolition of all Marian feast days altogether, except those with biblical foundations and the feast of the Assumption.Benedict Werkmeister, 1801 Nonetheless, in this period a number of significant Marian churches were built, often laden with Marian symbols, and popular Marian devotions continued in many areas. An example is Santa Maria della Salute in Venice, built to thank the Virgin Mary for the city's deliverance from the plague. The church is full of Marian symbolism: the great dome represents her crown, and the eight sides, the eight points on her symbolic star. Many Benedictines such as Celestino Sfondrati (died 1696) and Jesuits,such as Anton Weissenbach SJ, Franz Neubauer SJ, supported by pious faithful and their movements and societies, fought against the anti-Marian trends. Increasing secularization led to the forced closing of most monasteries and convents, and Marian pilgrimages were either discontinued or greatly reduced in number. Some Catholics criticized the practice of the Rosary as not Jesus-oriented and too mechanical. In some places, priests forbade the praying of the Rosary during Mass.In 1790, monastery schools outlawed the praying of the rosary during mass as a distraction. (D Narr 417). The highly conservative rural Bavarian dioceses of Passau outlawed Marian prayer books and related articles in 1785.D Narr 417 During this time, Mariologists looked to The Glories of Mary and other Mariological writings of Alphonsus Liguori (1696‚Äì1787), an Italian, whose culture was less affected by the Enlightenment. \\"Overall, Catholic Mariology during the Enlightenment lost its high level of development and sophistication, but the basics were kept, on which the 19th century was able to build.\\"Otto Stegm√ºller, 1967 == Mariology in the 19th century == Pope Pius IX (1846‚Äì1878) solemnly declared the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception in 1854. Mariology in the 19th century was dominated by discussions about the dogmatic definition of the Immaculate Conception and the First Vatican Council. In 1854, Pope Pius IX, with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic Bishops whom he had consulted between 1851‚Äì1853, proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, which had been a traditional belief among the faithful for centuries.Vatican website Eight years earlier, in 1846, the Pope had granted the unanimous wish of the bishops from the United States, and declared the Immaculata the patron of the USA.Pius IX in B√§umer, 245 During the First Vatican Council, some 108 council fathers requested adding the words \\"Immaculate Virgin\\" to the Hail Mary prayer and to add the Immaculata to the Litany of Loreto. Some fathers requested the dogma of the Immaculate Conception to be included in the Creed of the Church.Bauer 566 Many French Catholics supported making dogma both Papal infallibility and the assumption of Mary in the forthcoming ecumenical council.Civilta Catolica, 6 February 1869. During the First Vatican Council, nine Mariological petitions favored a possible Assumption dogma. It was strongly opposed by some council fathers, especially those from Germany. On 8 May, a majority of the fathers voted to reject making the Assumption a dogma, a position shared by Pope Pius IX. The concept of Co-Redemptrix was also discussed but left open. In its support, Council fathers highlighted the divine motherhood of Mary and called her the mother of all graces.B√§umer 566 \\"Rosary Pope\\" is a title given to Pope Leo XIII (1878‚Äì1903) because he issued a record eleven encyclicals on the Rosary, instituted the Catholic custom of daily Rosary prayer during the month of October, and in 1883 created the Feast of Queen of the Holy Rosary.Lauretanische Litanei, Marienlexikon, St. Ottilien: Eos, 1988, p.41 John Henry Newman, wrote of the Eve-Mary parallel in support of Mary's original state of grace (Immaculate Conception), her part in redemption, her eschatological fulfilment and her intercession.Newman, John Henry. The Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman, ed. C. S. Dessain, Birmingham Oratory, 31 vols. (London: Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1972), Vol. XII Popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary's immaculate conception. The doctrine itself had been endorsed by the Council of Basel (1431‚Äì1449), and by the end of the 15th century was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties. The Council of Basel was later held not to have been a true General (or Ecumenical) Council with authority to proclaim dogma. Such was the influence of the Dominicans, and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas (who had been canonised in 1323 and declared \\"Doctor Angelicus\\" of the Church in 1567) that the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì63) ‚Äì which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine ‚Äì instead declined to take a position. It simply reaffirmed the constitutions of Sixtus IV, which had threatened with excommunication anyone on either side of the controversy who accused the others of heresy. But it was not until 1854 that Pope Pius IX, with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic Bishops, whom he had consulted between 1851‚Äì1853, proclaimed the doctrine in accordance with the conditions of papal infallibility that would be defined in 1870 by the First Vatican Council. == Mariology in the 20th century == In 1904, in the first year of his pontificate, Pope Pius X celebrated the previous century's proclamation of the dogma of Immaculate Conception with the encyclical Ad diem illum. In 1950, the dogma of the Assumption was defined by Pope Pius XII. The Second Vatican Council spoke of Mary as Mother of the Church. Fifteen hundred years after the Council of Ephesus, Pope Pius XI issued the encyclical Lux Veritatis, reminding the Orthodox Christians of the common faith. He presided over a Mariological congress in 1931.B√§umer 534 Mariology in the 20th century reflected an increased membership in Roman Catholic Marian Movements and Societies. At the popular level, the 20th century witnessed growth in the number of lay Marian devotional organizations such as free Rosary distribution groups. The number of 20th century pilgrims visiting Marian churches set new records. In South America alone, two major Marian basilicas, the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida in Brazil and the new Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Tepeyac hill, were constructed and jointly recorded over 10 million visitors per year. Prior to Vatican II, the French Mariological Society held a three-year series of Marian studies on the theme of Mary in relation to the Church.‚ÄúMarie et l‚ÄôEglise,‚Äù √âtMar 9-11 (1951-53), 3 Vols === Second Vatican Council === Mariological issues were included in the discussions at the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965), although the Council indicated that it had not addressed all Marian issues. The Council members had in depth discussions regarding the question of whether to treat Mary within the Constitution of the Church or outside it in a separate document.Mary for Time and Eternity by William McLoughlin, Jill Pinnock 2007 -page 66 The final decision, by a vote of 1114‚Äì1074, resulted in the treatment of Marian issues within the Church Constitution, as chapter eight of Lumen gentium. This chapter provides a \\"pastoral summary\\" of Catholic doctrines on Mary but does not claim to be complete.Leo Cardinal Scheffczyk, Vaticanum II, in Marienlexikon 567 At the conclusion of the Vatican II Council in December 1965, Catholics were presented with a multitude of changes. Some authors such as John W. O'Malley have commented that these issues would forever alter Catholic practices and views, including those surrounding the Virgin Mary. These changes reflected the Council's desire to make the Church more ecumenical and less isolated as it increasingly had become in the past century.What Happened at Vatican II, John W. O‚ÄôMalley. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. London, 2008. One of the roadblocks towards finding common ground was the complaint by other faiths regarding the Church's dogmas on the Virgin Mary, and especially the fervor of the Catholic laity to preserve Mary at the center of their devotions.The Church: The Evolution of Catholicism. Richard P. McBrien. HarperOne. 2008Vatican Council II: The Basic Sixteen Documents. Rev. Austin Flannery, O.P. Costello Publishing Company, 1996 Mariologists had hoped for a dogma on Mary as Mediatrix, the foundations of which were laid by several popes especially Leo XIII, Pius X, Benedict XV, and Pius XII. The preparations for the council included an independent schema \\"About the Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of God and Mother of the People\\". Some observers interpreted the renunciation of this document on Mary as minimalism, others interpreted her inclusion as a chapter into the Church document as underlining her role for the Church. With the inclusion of Marian issues within the Constitution of the Church rather than in a separate document, at Vatican II the contextual view of Mary was emphasized, namely that Mary belongs \\"within the Church\\":McNally, Terrence, What Every Catholic Should Know about Mary -page 30-32 * For having been the Associate of Christ on earth * For being a Heavenly mother to all members of the Church in the order of grace * For having been the model disciple, a model which every member of the Church should aim to imitate. Calling Mary \\"our mother in the order of grace\\", Lumen gentium referred to Mary as a model for the Church and stated that:Miravalle, Mark Introduction to Mary 1993, , pp 119‚Äì124 > By reason of the gift and role of divine maternity, by which she is united > with her Son, the Redeemer, and with His singular graces and functions, the > Blessed Virgin is also intimately united with the Church. As St. Ambrose > taught, the Mother of God is a type of the Church in the order of faith, > charity and perfect union with Christ. The Marian chapter has five parts which link Mary to the salvation mysteries which continue in the Church, which Christ has founded as his mystical body. Her role in relation to her son is a subordinate one. Highlighted are her personality and fullness of grace. The second part describes her role in salvation history. Her role as a mediator is detailed, as Mary is considered to secure our salvation through her many intercessions after her assumption into heaven. The Council refused to adopt the title mediator of all graces and emphasized that Christ is the one mediator.Leo Cardinal Scheffczyk, Vaticanum II, in Marienlexikon 569 Pope Paul VI declared Mary Mother of the Church during the Vatican Council. === Late 20th century === Following Vatican II, the perception that Marian devotions had decreased was expressed by several authors. Other authors have indicated that the continued strength of devotion to Mary within Catholicism following Vatican II has been manifested in multiple forms worldwide.Mary in the plan of God and in the communion of the saints by Alain Blancy, Maurice Jourjon 2002 -page 46 Examples of this are the increase in Marian pilgrimages at major Marian shrines and the construction of major new Marian Basilicas since Vatican II. At the end of the 20th century, two of the top three most visited Catholic shrines in the world were Marian, with the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, built between 1974 and 1976, being the most visited Catholic shrine in the world. In 1968, shortly after Vatican II, the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida in Brazil used to receive about four million pilgrims per year, but the number has since doubled to over eight million pilgrims per year, indicating the significant increase in Marian pilgrimages since Vatican II.Brazil rediscovered by Roberta C. Wigder 1977 -page 235Pilgrimage: from the Ganges to Graceland : an encyclopedia, Volume 1 by Linda Kay Davidson, David Martin Gitlitz 2002 page 38 The perceived impact of concessions to ecumenism made at Vatican II did not impact the fundamental loyalties to Mary among Catholics and their attachment to Marian veneration. A 1998 survey among young adult Catholics in the United States provided the following results: * Devotion to Mary had not been reduced in any significant manner since Vatican II, despite the various statements made about its perceived impact on Catholics. * Young Catholics stated that in their view the \\"passionate love of God\\" is revealed through Mary, possibly as a result of the Marian emphasis of the pontificate of Pope John Paul II. * Mary continues to be a \\"distinctive marker\\" of the Catholic identity. Papal extensions and enhancement to the Mariology of Vatican II continued shortly thereafter, with Pope Paul VI issuing the Apostolic Exhortation Marialis Cultus (to Honor Mary) in 1974, which took four years to prepare. Marialis Cultus provided four separate guidelines for the renewal of Marian veneration, the last two of which were new in Papal teachings. The four elements were: biblical, liturgical, ecumenical and anthropological. Marian devotions were the hallmark of the pontificate of Pope John Paul II and he reoriented the Catholic Church towards the renewal of Marian veneration.John Paul II: a light for the world by Mary Ann Walsh 2003 page 26Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons by Raymond Burke et al. 2008 pages 392 In March 1987 he went further than Paul VI in extending the Catholic views on Mary beyond Vatican II by issuing the encyclical Redemptoris Mater. Rather than being just a new presentation of the Marian views of Vatican II, Redemptoris Mater was in many aspects a re-reading, re-interpretation and further extension of the teachings of Vatican II.The Vision of John Paul II by Gerard Mannion 2008 page 251 In 1988 in Mulieris Dignitatem Pope John Paul II stated that the Second Vatican Council confirmed that: \\"unless one looks to the Mother of God, it is impossible to understand the mystery of the Church\\".John Paul II's book of Mary by Pope John Paul II, Margaret Bunson 1996 page 81Vatican website: Mulieris Dignitatem In 2002 in the Apostolic letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae he emphasized the importance of the Rosary as a key devotion for all Catholics and added the Luminous Mysteries to the Rosary.Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae The Marian Magisterium of John Paul II may well constitute his single most important contribution to the Catholic legacy he left behind. By 2005, when he died, he had inspired a worldwide renewal of Marian devotions, that was reflected upon on the occasion of his death within non- Catholic media such as US News and World Report. == 21st century == Pope Benedict XVI continued the program of redirection of the Catholic Church towards a Marian focus and stated: \\"Let us carry on and imitate Mary, a deeply Eucharistic soul, and our lives will become a Magnificat\\".Miravalle, Mark Introduction to Mary 1993, , pages 13 and 99Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons by Raymond Burke 2008 page xxi In 2008 Benedict composed a prayer on Mary as the Mother of all Christians: :You became, in a new way, the Mother of all those who receive your Son Jesus in faith and choose to follow in his footsteps.Vatican website Benedict journeyed to Marian shrines such as Lourdes and Fatima to support his message.Vatican website: Pope Beneict XVI at Fatima == See also == * Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary * Mariology (Roman Catholic) * Mariology of the popes * Mariology of the saints * Mariology Ecumenical views * Protestant views of Mary == Notes == == References == * Michael Schmaus, Mariologie, Katholische Dogmatik, M√ºnchen Vol V, 1955 * K Algermissen, Boes, Egelhard, Feckes, Michael Schmaus, Lexikon der Marienkunde, Verlag Friedrich Pustet, Regensburg, 1967 * Mariology Society of America https://web.archive.org/web/20170925082500/http://mariologicalsocietyofamerica.us/ * The Marian Library at University of Dayton https://udayton.edu/imri/marian- library/index.php * Pope Pius IX, Apostolic Constitution ** Apostolic Constitution Ineffabilis Deus * Pope Pius XII, encyclicals and bulls **Encyclical Fulgens Corona on the Vatican website ** Encyclical Ad Caeli Reginam on the Vatican website ** Encyclical Mystici Corporis Christi on the Vatican website ** Apostolic Constitution Munificentissimus Deus on the Vatican Website * Pope John Paul II, encyclical, apostolic letters and addresses **Encyclical Redemptoris Mater on the Vatican website ** Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae on the Vatican Website ** Pope John Paul II on Saint Louis de Montfort ** Pope John Paul II, Address to the Mariology Forum ==Further reading== * Gambero, Luigi.

Home Before Dark received generally positive reviews from critics upon its release and topped the national albums charts in the United States, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. It has since been accredited with album certifications in several regions. In May 2008, at the age of 67, Neil Diamond was the oldest performer to have a number one record. This mark was previously held by Bob Dylan in 2006 with his Modern Times album, released when he was 65. However, Bob Dylan's 2009 album, Together Through Life, earned Dylan that position again since Dylan released his most recent work at 67 years and 11 months unlike Diamond releasing Home Before Dark at 67 years and 3 months. The album is Diamond's second to be produced by Rick Rubin, a producer of hip-hop and heavy metal music, who had discovered a talent for re-invigorating the careers of musicians when he produced Aerosmith and a string of albums with Johnny Cash. After Cash's death, Diamond became the next artist to find his career given a shot in the arm, via Rubin's production on his 2005 album 12 Songs.

She was the longest serving openly lesbian member to serve in a state legislature in the United States. On December 8, 2017, Clark announced in a press release that she would not be running for reelection. ==Early life, education, and career== Raised on a farm in southwestern Minnesota, Clark attended public schools in Edgerton, graduating from Edgerton High School in 1963. She earned her B.S. in nursing at the College of Saint Teresa in Winona. She later attended the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, earning her Master of Public Administration degree in 1996. Clark has been an instructor at the University of Minnesota since 1985. She previously worked as public health nurse, VISTA nurse-organizer and an OB-GYN Nurse Practitioner. She is a member of the adjunct Faculty of the Department of Human Relations at St. Cloud State University, of the University of Minnesota‚Äôs Women‚Äôs Studies Department, of the Macalester College Women‚Äôs Studies Department, and of the College of St. Catherine Graduate School of Holistic Health.

Scott Dibble and Rep. Susan Allen, both Minneapolis Democrats. After the Minnesota House voted on May 21, 2011, to place a gay marriage amendment referendum on the ballot in the 2012 general election, she and Dibble released a joint statement condemning the referendum. The referendum had voters decide whether a legal marriage was defined as between one man and one woman.http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/122426949.html Following the May 2011 House vote on the gay marriage amendment referendum, Clark stated: \\"It‚Äôs a sad day for the State of Minnesota. Tonight, we‚Äôve moved one step closer to discriminating against Minnesotans simply based on who they love. This amendment won‚Äôt help a single family in Minnesota, and this vote is absolutely heartbreaking to thousands of people and families across our state. History will not look back kindly on this day or the people who voted for discrimination. The Minnesota I know is a place of inclusion, tolerance and love, and I truly believe the people of this great state will not vote to enshrine discrimination in our constitution...\\" In 2013, after voters voted against the amendment, Clark was the House sponsor of an effort to legalize same-sex marriage. The act passed the House 75-59, as well as the Senate, and was later signed into law by Governor Mark Dayton. It took effect on July 1, 2013. (See also Same-sex marriage in Minnesota.)

The reserve lies on a nineteen- acre site and is part of the Derwent Valley Heritage Way. It is also placed on reoccurring flood plain which makes it an attractive place for wildlife, especially wading birds. Derbyshire Wildlife Trust leases the area from Amber Valley Borough Council and now manages it as a nature reserve and is one of Derbyshire‚Äôs most important wetland reserves. To ensure that the many bird species continue to thrive there, there is no access onto the reserve. The reserve consists of two pools both surrounded by water meadows and reed beds. A huge variety of birds has been recorded there over the years. ==History== When Belper Mill was originally built in the 1700s, they dammed the River Derwent to channel water to power the mill. They then raised the river bank north of the Mill where the reserve now stands to try and avoid the river overflowing. Despite this, the river breached many times forming several pools which you can see today. In later years, the Territorials used the area for shooting practice. One can still see the old firing range at the bottom of the lane. Several buttresses are still visible. One is the island that is on the left-hand side of the main pool. One is barely visible on the right hand side of the main pool. Others have now almost disappeared. To the left of where the viewing mound stands is an old metal gate post. It was used by the Territorials. If there was a green flag on the gate it was safe to go through. If a red flag, then it wasn't. A little further down the lane there is a bricked up hut on the left hand side. This was the ammunition store. Because the Territorials didn't want water on the land they used to pump it into the river. The pump house is the brick building at the southern end of the reserve with the big pipe sticking out. After the Territorials had finished using the land, the Amber Valley Council started using it as a tip. The big field that is in front of the viewing mound has all sorts of nasty things buried underneath it. In those days there weren‚Äôt any laws on what one could and couldn't dump. By burying thousands of tons of rubbish, it pushed any water that was there further up and this created bigger pools. A few local birders still sometimes pump out water into the river to keep the pools low to attract waders. As with most tips it used to be good for Gulls including visits from Iceland and Glaucous Gulls. Eventually the tip closed in the 1970s and things started to settle down. Levels are now controlled by a sluice at the southern end of the main pool. There is also a pipe that leads from the main pool to the river which is bunged during winter to maintain the water levels for wintering wildfowl. Then come spring it's taken out again and if we get a dry summer it should be low enough to attract waders late summer/autumn. ==References== ==External links== * Wyver Lane - Derbyshire Wildlife Trust Category:Nature reserves in Derbyshire ","title":"Wyver"},{"id":"17321359","text":"Substitute is a film by the French former footballer Vikash Dhorasoo.

Upon its release on 29 April 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Grand Theft Auto IV generated controversy. The game's depiction of violence received mass commentary from journalists and government officials, occasionally being referred to as a \\"murder simulator\\". The ability to drive under the influence of alcohol in the game also received criticism, resulting in a request for the ESRB to change the game's rating. Similarly, some gameplay features were censored for the Australian and New Zealand versions of the game, though these censors were subsequently removed. Several crimes that were committed following the game's release, such as murder and sexual violence, were attributed to the perpetrators' experience with the game, generating further controversy. Former attorney Jack Thompson, known for his campaigns against the series, heavily criticised Grand Theft Auto IV prior to its release, filing lawsuits against parent company Take-Two Interactive, and threatening to ban distribution of the game if some gameplay features were not removed. The game also generated further controversy and lawsuits from city officials and organisations. == Gameplay features == === Depiction of violence === Grand Theft Auto IV has been widely criticised for its depiction of violence and murder. On his program, conservative American talk-radio host Glenn Beck used Grand Theft Auto IV as an example to make wider claims about the use of violent video games by the US military, repeating claims made by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman that the military uses shooting games to desensitise soldiers to killing. Beck also spoke to Jack Thompson, who labelled the game as a \\"murder simulator\\". Gavin McKiernan, national grass roots director for the Parents Television Council, added that the game is an \\"adult product\\", claiming that research displays the potential effect violent media has on children. Thompson reiterated that the game should be re-rated in the United States, referring to the Australian release as an example. There have been a number of reported crimes in which the perpetrators cited Grand Theft Auto IV as their primary influence. On 27 June 2008, six teenagers were arrested after participating in a crime spree in New Hyde Park, New York. The teenagers mugged a man, knocking his teeth out, attempted to hijack a car, and smashed a passing van with a bat. According to the Nassau County Police, the teenagers claimed that they were inspired by Grand Theft Auto IV. On 4 August 2008, BBC Newsbeat reported that an 18-year- old student had been arrested in Bangkok, Thailand for the murder of a taxi driver after attempting to hijack the vehicle. Bangkok police captain Veerarit Pipatanasak stated that the student \\"wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game\\". Grand Theft Auto IV was subsequently banned in Thailand as a result. On 24 August 2013, Sky News reported that a 90-year-old woman was killed in Slaughter, Louisiana when an eight-year-old boy, her grandson, grabbed a handgun and shot her in the head after playing Grand Theft Auto IV. === Drunk driving option === intoxicated, resulting in a shaky and blurry vision. This gameplay feature led to controversy, resulting in a request to change the game's rating.alt=Player character Niko Bellic walks down a road while intoxicated, followed by driving in a car while intoxicated. In both scenes, the gameplay vision is blurred and shaky. In Grand Theft Auto IV, the player can choose to make protagonist Niko Bellic and his non-playable friends become intoxicated, resulting in a shaky and blurry gameplay vision. Players also have the option to enter cars while intoxicated, and to drive under the influence of alcohol. This gameplay feature received criticism, particularly from the nonprofit organisation Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). MADD referred to the action as a \\"choice, a violent crime\\", and that it is \\"100 percent preventable\\". As a result, MADD requested for the Entertainment Software Rating Board to change the rating of the game from Mature (17+) to Adults Only (18+), which would have effectively removed the game from retail stock. They also asked Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar Games to consider halting the game's distribution out of a sense of social responsibility, or out of respect for victims of driving under the influence. Rockstar later issued a statement to the Associated Press: > We have a great deal of respect for MADD's mission, but we believe the > mature audience for Grand Theft Auto IV is more than sophisticated enough to > understand the game's content. === Sex and nudity allegations === In November 2008, 19-year-old Ryan Chinnery was jailed for performing two sex attacks on women at night. During the court hearings, it was told that Chinnery had spent considerable hours playing Grand Theft Auto IV. The judge said that Chinnery's experience with the game \\"cannot have helped him in all the circumstances of this case\\". Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned, the first episodic expansion to Grand Theft Auto IV, features a cutscene displaying full-frontal male nudity. As a result, parents group Common Sense Media condemned the expansion, issuing a public warning against the nudity. The organisation claimed that the inclusion of nudity resulted in the game's status as \\"more controversial than its predecessors\\". Rockstar vice president Dan Houser stated that the game's depiction of sexual content is intended as humorous, hoping that \\"the fans\\" recognise the humour. === Censored release === alt=A dead civilian from the uncensored version on the left, and the censored version on the right. A pool of blood is visible on the uncensored version, while the censored version features a small splash of blood. Despite confirmation in February 2008 that the Australian version of Grand Theft Auto IV would not be edited, Rockstar later revealed that some features would be censored. The game was assigned an MA15+ rating on 11 December 2007. Rockstar stated that a special version of the game was produced to comply with the Australian classification system. Features censored in the Australian versions include: the inability to select a \\"service\\" when hiring a prostitute, and the restriction of animation and camera angles; the lack of blood pools and bloody footprints; the replacement of bullet wounds and blood patches with \\"slight discolouration\\". In December 2008, a Rockstar spokesman stated that the game would be released uncensored in Australia for its release on Microsoft Windows, with an MA15+ certificate. In February 2009, Rockstar distributed a patch which uncensored the Australian release for consoles. On 15 April 2008, it was announced that the New Zealand release of the game would be identical to the censored Australian release, with Take-Two Interactive attributing \\"time scales and logistical reasons\\". Bill Hastings, Chief Censor for the New Zealand Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC), stated that Rockstar \\"did not tell [the OFLC] which version of the game they submitted\\", and that \\"the version [Rockstar] submitted for classification was the version they intended to market in New Zealand\\". However, the game was resubmitted to the OFLC by Stan Calif, a 21-year-old student who was unhappy that New Zealand received an edited version of the game as a result of Australian censorship laws. The unedited version was subsequently given an R18 rating and cleared for sale in New Zealand. == Political response == Former attorney Jack Thompson, known for campaigning against games published by Rockstar Games, heavily criticised Grand Theft Auto IV prior to its release. In 2007, then Florida lawyer Jack Thompson, who had previously campaigned against other games from Rockstar, stated that he would take measures to prevent the sale of Grand Theft Auto IV to minors. On 14 March 2007, Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive filed a lawsuit against Thompson in an attempt to preemptively restrict him from his attempts to declare Rockstar's games as a nuisance. Games declared to be a nuisance are effectively banned for sale, which Take-Two believed would be a violation of First Amendment rights. Thompson responded by filing a countersuit, accusing Take-Two of violating federal RICO statues, committing perjury, obstruction of justice, and conspiring against him with third parties to deprive him of his civil rights. Both parties reached a settlement on 20 April 2007, agreeing to drop their respective lawsuits. Under the terms of the settlement, Thompson has been barred from suing to ban the sale or distribution of games by Take- Two or its subsidiaries. He is restricted to communicating through Take-Two's attorneys on any future matter, but is able to maintain his outspoken stance against their titles and may act as counsel in lawsuits against Take-Two by other parties. For their part, Take-Two agreed to drop the contempt of court lawsuit against Thompson regarding alleged improper conduct during the court hearings for Rockstar's game Bully in 2006. Thompson filed a document with a federal court in Florida on 18 September 2007, claiming that the assassination target of a mission in Grand Theft Auto IV is a lawyer character based upon himself. When the player enters his office and brandishes a weapon, the lawyer yells \\"Guns don't kill people, video games do!\\", a phrase often attributed to Thompson. Thompson threatened that he will \\"take necessary and proper means to stop release of the game\\" if the similarities were not removed; the similarities were not removed, and Thompson did not follow through. On 25 April 2008, Metro reported that Thompson had written a letter to the mother of Strauss Zelnick, director of Take-Two Interactive. In the letter, which strongly criticised both the game and Zelnick's upbringing, Thompson labelled Grand Theft Auto as a \\"murder simulator\\". He follows: > The pornography and violence that your son trafficks in is the kind of stuff > that most mother would be ashamed to see their son putting into the hands of > other mothers' children ... Maybe you, Mrs. Zelnick, were so taken by your > handsome son that you spared the rod and spoiled the child. That would > explain why he has brought you, by the way he presently acts, \\"to shame.\\" > ... Happy Mother's day, Mrs. Zelnick, which this year is ... two weeks after > your son unleashes porn and violence upon other mothers' boys. I'm sure > you're very proud. Thompson subsequently claimed that he sent the letter to Zelnick's lawyer, as opposed to his mother, formulated as a parody intended to induce feelings of \\"shame\\" in Zelnick. A mural in New York City, advertising Grand Theft Auto IV in July 2007. Following the release of the game's first trailer, New York City officials were appalled with the choice of their city as the inspiration for the setting of the game, stating that a game like Grand Theft Auto does not represent the city's crime levels accurately. A spokesperson for Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that Bloomberg \\"does not support any video game where you earn points for injuring or kill police officers\\". Although points are not awarded in the game and the murder of police officers is discouraged to the player, the game often suggests to players that police officers must be killed in order to advance in the game's main story without difficulty. Several mission objectives also directly require the player to murder police officers. As a response, Jason Della Rocca, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, accused New York City officials of double standards, for criticising video games of using the city, but avoiding the argument in terms of other forms of entertainment, such as books, films and television shows. == Legal action == Take-Two Interactive filed a lawsuit in response to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) removing advertisements promoting the game from their property, which violates a contract that requires the advertisements to remain until June 2008. In response, a representative from the CTA attributed the removal of the advertisements to the controversy surrounding the advertisement campaign for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas in 2004. ==ReferencesControversy Grand Theft Auto IV Grand Theft Auto 4 Category:Criticisms of software and websites Category:Obscenity controversies in video games ","title":"Controversies surrounding Grand Theft Auto IV"},{"id":"17321442","text":"is a train station located in the city of Kadoma, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. ==Lines== * Keihan Electric Railway ** Keihan Main Line ==Layout== The elevated station on the four-track section has only two side platforms for local trains.

Opened in 1975, it is owned and operated by Ineos as an oil-export terminal for North Sea oil and is the largest such facility in Scotland. The terminal is made up of two sea-island berths that can load vessels of up to 350,000 DWT and a vapour recovery platform. Crude oil from the Forties pipeline undergoes stabilisation and gas processing and treatment at the Kinneil Terminal at Grangemouth before being pumped to a tank farm at Dalmeny on the southern shore of the Firth. The oil is then pumped to the Hound Point terminal where it is loaded onto tankers. The name 'Hound Point' derives from a local legend concerning the lord of nearby Barnbougle Castle, currently Lord Rosebery. The legend states that one of the first lords set off to fight in the Crusades, leaving his beloved hunting-hound behind. At the moment the man was killed, the hound began howling uncontrollably, eventually dying of its grief. Ever since, the howling ghost of the hound is said to appear on the Point whenever the present lord is about to die. ==See also== *List of ports and harbours in Scotland *List of Panamax ports#Great Britain ==External links== *http://www.forthports.co.uk/ports/ports/scotland/marine/ *http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/U/uk_asset_forties.pdf Category:Ports and harbours of Scotland ","title":"Hound Point"},{"id":"17321513","text":"Keith John Reames (19 February 1942 ‚Äì 6 May 2008) was an English football manager and administrator who was chairman of Lincoln City from 1985 to 2000.

Appleton has been described by the Washington Post as a songwriter with a \\"pop-rock sound but with considerably more edgy energy, adding figurative lightning to the stormy night.\\" Previously a member of the popular New York band The Grasshoppers, Appleton released his first solo album 500 Moments in 2003 which led to appearances on the NBC television show Last Call with Carson Daly, a feature on E!'s Wild On, and a national affiliation with Budweiser's True Music Live program and Gibson Guitars. Appleton released his album Uphill to Purgatory in the United States in 2005 which was then re-released in the United Kingdom in 2006 as Someone Else's Problem and included three songs from the 500 Moments EP. Based on the recognition he was receiving in England, Appleton decided to move to London in 2006 where he became a regularly featured performer at popular venues such as Ronnie Scott's, The Borderline, and The Regal Room. In the meantime, the single \\"Walk Into The Room\\" and its accompanying video became a favorite on English radio and MTV Two. In 2015, Appleton released an acoustic blues album entitled \\"Dirty Memory\\" with harmonicist Jason Ricci. == Early life == Appleton was born in Norwich, Vermont, on April 4, 1967, the son of Georganna Towne and Jon H. Appleton, a composer and professor of electro-acoustic music at Dartmouth College. Professor Appleton was also one of the co-inventors of the Synclavier digital music synthesizer and recording system, which JJ would later use as a producer in New York City to record his own and other artists' music. In his capacity as a performer and a teacher, Jon Appleton was able to bring his family with him around the world where they would sometimes live for extended periods of time.\\"Wherever the Appletons went, Jon had a musical agenda, which afforded JJ the rare opportunity to immerse himself in the indigenous music of such exotic places as Tonga, Sweden, Israel and Turkey.\\" Of his Mother's support for his developing interest in music, JJ has said, \\"She definitely encouraged my musical pursuits. She would tape record me singing twenty minute songs about Viking battles and spaghetti when I was 6\\". == Early career == While attending Berklee College of Music in Boston, Appleton met and played in several bands including a stint with the power funk outfit Hamhorta and the band Electric Jellyfish. Appleton's primary instrument was guitar and as a developing guitarist, Appleton was a fan of Albert King, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Johnny Winter. During this time, he wrote and recorded a considerable amount of original material that reflected his respect for and developing mastery of the blues guitar and singing styles of these artists. Upon moving to New York City in the early 1990s, Appleton worked at producer Mike Thorne's Synclavier-based recording studio as an engineer and Synclavier programmer where he continued to develop his skills on records by Betty, Information Society, and Peter Murphy. == Work as songwriter, composer, music consultant and producer == Appleton has co-written, produced and performed on songs for a wide range of performers, including Jimmy Sommerville, China Crisis, Stephen Schwartz, Farrad, Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas, Luan Parle, Ke$ha, Darius Rucker, Ben Adams/A1, Pebe Sebert, Marc Copely, Ashford & Simpson, Stephen Lironi, Erin Bowman, and David Wolfert. He has composed and performed music for numerous television programs and films, including Jungle Junction, Ten Days That Unexpectedly Changed America, PBS's P.O.V., The Wire, The Sopranos, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Real World Cancun, Real World Washington DC, The Regis and Kathie Lee Show, and Lizzie McGuire. He may be best known to Millennials for singing the Pokemon: Advanced Generation series‚Äô theme song. As a music consultant, Appleton has been featured at music industry meetups, teaching advertising, TV, and film composition. Appleton's career as a jingle writer has spanned over 15 years, and his compositions can be heard in television commercials for Diet Coke, Burger King, McDonald's, Time Warner Cable, BMW, Singulair, Levitra, IBM, Clairol, Maybelline Cosmetics, Budweiser, 7-up, American Express, Procter and Gamble, and Campbell's Soup. == Collaboration with Jason Ricci == In 2014/2015, Appleton teamed up with Grammy Award-winning harmonica player and singer Jason Ricci to record an Acoustic blues album entitled \\"Dirty Memory,\\" which Appleton also produced. Hailed as \\"keeping the tradition of Piedmont blues alive\\" and \\"a killer, wild man of a set that almost sounds like early Holy Modal Rounders played straight,\\" the album spent 10 weeks on the Roots Music Report's Top 50 Acoustic Blues Albums chart. Six of the tracks from \\"Dirty Memory\\" dominated the Top 10 Acoustic Blues Singles chart in the autumn of 2015, and in November 2015 \\"Dirty Memory\\" was given the 2015 Jimi Award for \\"best new artist debut\\" by Blues 411. == Tours and notable appearances == Appleton has toured the United States and UK extensively and has worked as a session musician/band leader with members of Gov't Mule, Tedeschi Trucks, Black Crowes, Lenny Kravitz, The Spin Doctors, and John Scofield bands. In November 2015, Appleton was chosen to be one of two guitarists (along with Chris McQueen of Snarky Puppy) in the New York Theatre Workshop‚Äôs production of Lazarus, starring Michael C. Hall and Cristin Milioti and co-written by David Bowie and Enda Walsh. The play features new and revamped songs by Bowie, and is based on Walter Tevis‚Äô novel The Man Who Fell to Earth.

He served as the Habsburg monarchy's Governor of his native Bohemia from 1889 to 1896 and again from 1911 to 1915. He was also briefly the 15th Minister-President of Austria and Minister of the Interior from 1898 to 1899. == Biography == Like most of the rest of the Thun und Hohenstein family, he belonged to the Federalist party, and his appointment in 1889 as governor of Bohemia was the cause of grave dissatisfaction to the German Austrians. He took a leading part in the negotiation of 1890 for the Bohemian settlement, but the elections of 1891, in which the Young Czechs who were opposed to the feudal party gained a decisive victory, made his position a very difficult one. Contrary to expectation, he showed great energy in suppressing disorder; but after the proclamation of a state of siege his position became untenable, and in 1895 he had to resign. On the resignation of Badeni in 1898 he was made minister president, an office which he held for little more than a year. Although he succeeded in bringing to a conclusion the negotiations with Hungary, the support he gave to the Czechs and Slovenians increased the opposition of the Germans to such a degree that parliamentary government became impossible, and at the end of 1899 he was dismissed. His sympathy towards the Czech people was responsible for a minor diplomatic spat between Austria-Hungary and the German Empire when the Prussian government deported some of its migrant Czech and Polish workers in 1899. The incident was part of an overall cooling of relations between the two empires at the end of the 19th century.F. R. Bridge, The Habsburg Monarchy Among the Great Powers, 1815-1918. Pg. 237, 412. == Personal life == Franz was firstly married in Prague to Princess Anna Maria Gabriela zu Schwarzenberg (1854-1898) in 1874. The marriage was childless. He married for the second time in 1901. to his distant cousin, Countess Ernestine Gabriele von Thun und Hohenstein (1858-1948), widow of Count Eugen Wratislaw of Mitrovic (1855-1897). They had one daughter, Countess Anna Maria Wilhelmine (1903-1943), who married her first cousin once removed, Baron Wolfgang von Thienen-Adlerflycht (1896-1942) and got Castle Neuhaus near Salzburg as a wedding present. == Title of Prince == He was raised to Princely rank by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria on 19 July 1911. As he had only one daughter, upon his death in 1916 the Princely title was inherited by his brother, Prince Jaroslav von Thun und Hohenstein (1864-1929), uncle and legal guardian of Hohenbergs, children of murdered Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, who was sister of Jaroslav's wife Countess Maria Pia Chotek von Wognin. == References == == External links == * Ott≈Øv slovn√≠k nauƒçn√Ω * Ott≈Øv slovn√≠k nauƒçn√Ω nov√© doby Category:1847 births Category:1916 deaths Category:19th-century Ministers- President of Austria Category:People from Dƒõƒç√≠n Category:German Bohemian people Category:Ministers-President of Austria Franz Anton Category:Czech monarchists Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Austria ","title":"Franz, Prince of Thun and Hohenstein"},{"id":"17321608","text":"The Hellenic Actuarial Society (HAS, (EAE)) is the association of actuaries in Greece.

It is the second largest municipality in the province after the provincial capital Bertoua. It is located on the main (though unpaved) road connecting Bertoua to the Central African Republic and to the Cameroonian town of Yokadouma. It had an estimated 33,500 inhabitants as of 2012. == People == Batouri lies in an ethnically Kako area and a large percentage of the population speaks the Kako language. However several other ethnic groups, such as the Baya, Yang√©l√©, and the M√©zim√© are also native to the area. In addition there are many recent immigrants to the Batouri area. Many come from other parts of southern Cameroon and speak other Bantu languages. There is also a large Muslim population in town living mainly in the Mokolo quarter. Most people speak French though Fulfulde serves as a lingua franca for much of the Muslim community and is spoken widely throughout the town. There are also a number of other language groups, notably Hausa and a small number of Arabic speakers. There are a number of Cameroonian English and Cameroonian Pidgin speakers as well. All of the languages spoken, except for the colonial languages, Pidgin, Hausa, and Arabic are part of the Niger‚ÄìCongo family. == Geography == Batouri lies on the South Cameroon Plateau at an elevation of about 653 m (2142 ft). It has a Guinea type climate which is hot and humid for most of the year with a dry season from mid-November to early March, then another small one in July. The wettest times of the year are April and May and then August through October. October is the wettest month with an average of 240.6 mm (9.5 in) of rain and January is the driest with an average of 17.3 mm (0.68 in). The average annual precipitation is 1479.4 mm (58.2 in). Temperature extremes are greatest during the dry season with the highest average high temperatures of 32.1 ¬∞C (89.8 ¬∞F) in February and the lowest average lows of 17.1 ¬∞C (62.8 ¬∞F) in January. Meanwhile the wet season produces more tempered average daily temperature fluctuations with both July and August having average highs 27.4 ¬∞C (81.3 ¬∞F), and average lows of 27.4 ¬∞C (66.0 ¬∞F). Like Bertoua, Batouri lies in an area of transition of vegetation and climatic zones. In a simplified description the Guinea savanna vegetation lies north of the town while the lowland rainforest vegetation lies south of the town. However, much of the forest around Batouri is severely degraded. Wooded areas follow rivers northward and can extend many miles into the surrounding Guinea vegetation. The topography consists mostly of gently rolling hills. There is a large granite outcrop called Mt. Pandi about 25 km (15.5 mi) north of town, just west of the P5 road to Ngoura. The Kad√©√Ø River flows just west of town (3.5 km or 2 mi). The area all drains into the Kad√©√Ø and is part of the large Congo River basin. === Climate === Batouri has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Aw). == Institutions == Batouri is home to a post office, three health centers (a government hospital, an Adventist hospital, and a Catholic health centre (Centre de Sant√© Catholique). It is the seat of the prefecture for the Kadey Department and it is the seat a Catholic Dioceses and three parishes (St. Martin, St. John and Notre Dame). Hospitals in Batouri have provided care to refugees fleeing violence in the Central African Republic, as it is one of the nearest medical facilities for the refugee camps on the Cameroon-CAR border. An assessment released 4 July 2014 indicated that \\"in Cameroon, up to 1 out of 3 refugee children from Central African Republic suffer from malnutrition ... The risk of severe acute malnutrition, which can be deadly if left untreated, is particularly high. In the inpatient center of Batouri close to the border, the mortality rate in May exceeded 24 per cent.\\" == References == Category:Populated places in East Region (Cameroon) Category:Communes of Cameroon ","title":"Batouri"},{"id":"17321733","text":"The Surrey County Senior League (previously known as the Surrey County Premier League) was a football competition based in Surrey, England.

Mount Solitary is located approximately west of Sydney, and a few kilometres south of Katoomba, the main town in the Blue Mountains. The local indigenous people called the mountain Korowal, meaning 'the strong one'. The origin of the contemporary name is obscure, but it may be based on the fact that Mount Solitary is the only mountain in the Jamison Valley. ==Description== Mount Solitary is located in the middle of the Jamison Valley, one of the main valleys of the Blue Mountains region, immediately south of Katoomba. It is a long, low mountain of sandstone, stretching across the valley from west to east. Its top is approximately long; counting its lower slopes, it would be approximately long. It is approximately above sea level at its highest point. It is nearly covered in eucalyptus forest, with a small group of pine trees at the western end. Small and rugged pockets of semi-rainforest are found along its slopes, particularly where water gathers in gullies. Snow is known to fall occasionally on the high points during winter. ==Bushwalking== Mount Solitary is a popular spot for bushwalking and is reached via a track that begins at the Golden Stairs, near Katoomba, and heads south-east towards the lower slopes of Mount Solitary. Along the way is the Ruined Castle, a rock formation on a ridge above the track, and the sealed opening of an old coal mine. In this area there's a large clearing which was once home to the mining community and is now used by campers. On the western end of the mountain is Chinamans Gully with a large rock shelter. There are expansive views to the south from the southern side of the mountain. From here the track descends to the Kedumba River, and then up to Kings Tableland, south of Wentworth Falls. In December 2006, a bush walker, 17-year-old David Iredale, lost the track while on the Katoomba to Wentworth Falls trek with friends. He made calls to \\"000\\" on his mobile phone, but was repeatedly rebuffed by emergency operators because he could not provide a street address to which an ambulance could be dispatched.Miamiherald.com After his seventh and final call, a search and rescue operation was mounted. His body was found eight days later, approximately north of the track, somewhere above the Kedumba River. In July 2009, a British tourist named Jamie Neale got lost on his way to Mount Solitary. He had walked as far as the Ruined Castle after leaving Katoomba, he went on to Mount Solitary reaching the summit. But on return he got lost coming down Korowal knife edge. He was lost in the bush for twelve days before finally finding some campers in the vicinity of Narrow Neck Plateau.Sydney Morning Herald, July 16, 2009, p.2 Later, it was reported that the agent Sean Anderson had taken Neale on as a client, after the story had received worldwide attention.

Upon the enactment of Missouri's May 1861 \\"Military Bill\\" Snead was appointed aide-de-camp to Governor Jackson and commissioned an officer in the Missouri State Guard.There is some confusion about this period, with some reports indicating that Snead served as Adjutant General of the Missouri State Guard. In the preface of Fight for Missouri (p v) Snead specifically denies this, noting that career Army officer Lewis Henry Little actually filled this role. He participated in the Battles of Boonville, Carthage, Wilson's Creek, and Lexington during the fight against Union forces for control of the state. After the Missouri State Guard was merged into the Confederate Army, Snead served as chief of staff for General Sterling Price's Army of the West.

Zuroweste, the Bishop of Belleville, met with lay leaders of the Belleville area concerning conditions existing at the Cathedral High School for boys and the Academy of Notre Dame for girls. Since both schools were overcrowded, it was decided that new, co-ed facilities must be provided for students coming in from the area's Catholic grade schools. The high school was dedicated on August 30, 1964, and named in honor of the previous Bishop, Henry J. Althoff. The new high school opened its doors on September 3, 1964. As of 2008, Althoff has graduated 9123 students, including 1105 Illinois State Scholars, 2 National Merit Finalists (top 1% of the nation), 91 National Merit commended Students (top 5% in nation), and 22 National Merit Finalists (top 1% in the nation). ==Admissions== For potential students, a \\"Spend-A-Day Program\\" is offered. When a grade school student does not have school, but Althoff does, they are able to attend classes and lunch with a current ACHS student. This is helpful in the decision making process of which high school to attend. Incoming freshmen must take a placement test. This is used along with 7th and 8th grade transcripts to determine placement in classes. Classes are generated for the average and above average. Students with strong grades and score in the 90% on the placement test are placed in Honors classes. Transfer students are admitted for the first three years. However, seniors are typically not accepted, but it is at the principal's discretion. Transfer requirements include two letters of recommendation, grades, standardized test scores, and transcripts showing that classes taken are similar to Althoff's curriculum. ==Academics== Althoff Catholic High School has ten academic departments. These are: art, business, English, foreign language, mathematics, music, physical education, science, social studies, and theology. Students must take 24 hours to graduate and have more than 100 courses to choose from. Students are required to take four years of theology and English. Three years are required for mathematics, science, and social studies. In addition, Health, Technology Skills, and Information Processing are all required courses for graduation. Two years of an art, music, or foreign language is necessary as well. To fulfill Althoff's Mission Statement, a retreat each year is required for graduation. Freshmen and Sophomores attend a \\"Day of Recollection.\\" Juniors attend a closed retreat that is overnight. Lastly, seniors participate in a Senior Service Project. For the first three weeks of January they spend their time giving back to the community. Popular places for this include day cares, grade schools, and nursing homes. ==Athletics== The Althoff Crusaders offer both girls and boys athletics, as well as co-ed teams. Boys athletic teams include: lacrosse, curling, cricket, baseball, basketball, football, golf, hockey, soccer, swimming, tennis, volleyball, and wrestling. Girls sports include: basketball, cheerleading, golf, poms, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, and volleyball. In addition, the co-ed sports are: bowling, track & field, and cross country. ==Notable alumni== * Kevin Lisch, member of the 2016 Australian Men's Olympic Basketball team. * DaRond Stovall, professional baseball player. ==Notes and references== ==External links== * School website Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Belleville Category:Catholic secondary schools in Illinois Category:Belleville, Illinois Category:Educational institutions established in 1964 Category:Schools in St. Clair County, Illinois Category:1964 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Althoff Catholic High School"},{"id":"17322105","text":"Raffaele di Paco (6 July 1908-21 May 1996) was an Italian road racing cyclist, who won five stages in the 1931 Tour de France four stages in the 1932 Tour de France and two stages in the 1935 Tour de France, and wore the yellow jersey for a total of four days in 1931.

Two and one tall chimneys and two high cooling towers were blown up. The two Parsons turbo- alternators of the B station were shipped to Malta. One was recommissioned as Unit 8 at Marsa Power Station and remained in service until 15 February 2015. ===CCGT site history=== Construction of the gas-fired station started in 1994, and it opened in 1996. The company that built it, Swindon-based National Power, became Innogy plc in August 2000. That company was bought by the German electricity company, Essen-based RWE in March 2002, and became RWE npower. The station is now owned and operated by RWE Generation UK. In 2002, a 12MWe electrical storage facility was built by Regenesys Technologies Ltd (previously owned by Innogy plc but bought by VRB Power Systems in October 2004) which uses polysulfide bromide flow batteries. However, the facility was never operated commercially due to engineering issues in scaling up the technology. In 2019, the failure of the plant was partially responsible for a large scale nationwide power cut on the evening of 9 August, after lightning hit a transmission line. The site was originally built by EGT, Atlantic Projects and Henry Boot, and went through a major upgrade in 2012 ==Original specification== The site is a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power station using natural gas. It originally had two General Electric Frame 9F gas turbine engines each producing 220 MWe. Each of these had a Stein Industry heat recovery steam generator which lead to one steam turbine produced by Alstom which produced 256MWe. ==Upgraded specification== In 2012, the plant was upgraded to General Electric Frame 9FA+e gas turbine engines each producing 241 MWe. They are still connected to the original heat recovery steam generator which led to the steam turbine produced by Alstom which now produces 265 MWe. ==References== ==External links== * Other CCGTs in eastern England Category:Buildings and structures in Bedfordshire Category:Natural gas-fired power stations in England Category:Power stations in the East of England Category:Demolished power stations in the United Kingdom Category:Former power stations in England Category:Coal-fired power stations in England Category:RWE ","title":"Little Barford Power Station"},{"id":"17322346","text":"Buzz is the second album by Keller Williams, released in 1996.

Invoices have many variations and types. In general, invoices are grouped into two types: 1\\\\. Invoices associated with a company's internal request or purchase order (PO-based invoices) and 2\\\\. Invoices that do not have an associated request (non-PO invoices). Most organizations have clear instructions regarding the way that they should process incoming invoices. It is common to have one approach for PO-based invoices, and another for non-PO invoices. Some companies also have unique requirements based on the type or dollar amount of a transaction. In general, both types of invoices are processed by a company's accounts payable department. The process in which a supplier invoice is validated and paid is also known as the purchase-to-pay cycle. ==Typical Process== The process usually begins when a supplier's invoice is received. Invoices can be sent via email, postal mail, fax, or EDI. Once an invoice arrives, the accounts payable clerk must ensure that the document is indeed an invoice. Then the clerk classifies and sorts the invoice into various categories (e.g., by vendor, by transaction type, or by department). The definition of invoice categories is usually unique to a specific organization. Once the invoice is classified, it is forwarded to the AP processor who is responsible for the particular invoice. This is normally the person who has placed that order. If there was a purchase order created during procurement, the invoice must then be matched against the purchase order to confirm that the amount that is being paid is correctly stated on the invoice. (This helps protect against fraud and unauthorized transactions.) If the amount is right and the goods have arrived, the responsible person will have to approve the invoice by signing off on it. If the amount invoiced exceeds a certain amount that is limited by the organization, the superior of that person may have to approve the invoice as well. This, of course, also differs from organization to organization. Once the invoice has been approved and there have been no variances, the invoice is posted into the accounting system.http://www.obfs.uillinois.edu/obfshome.cfm?level=2&path;=payments&xmldata;=processinvoices From there, a voucher can be created and the payment can be issued. A manual invoice process can sometimes exceed 15 steps before the final posting is done. == Automatic process == Technology has long enabled the automation of invoice processing from arrival to post. This means that at arrival of the invoice, the same accounts payable clerk will only need to scan the invoice into an automation software. The automation software then converts the invoice's scanned image into a text-researchable document. The different fields on an invoice can also be defined into the software so that it remembers which fields it should capture and register into the ERP systems, for instance, the purchase amount, the quantity, the supplier name, the supplier code, and so on. The benefits of an automatic processing workflow may include reduced human error, on-demand reports, and data resilience. Most automation software today integrates into common organizational ERP systems such as SAP, Microsoft, and Oracle.Borges, V., & Rouco, J. C. D., eds., Proceedings of the 17th European Conference on Digital Government (Lisbon: Academia Militar, 2017), p. 129. In an automatic process, once the data is extracted or captured from the invoice the data is sent into the system for automatic matching against the purchase order. This matching process can compare just the invoice data with that shown on the purchase order or be expanded to include a deeper level that looks at the receiving documents. Workflow steps can be configured such that the responsible person will then receive an email alert so that he or she can approve the invoice. If there are other people involved in the approval workflow, email alerts to them will also be automatically generated. The typical workflow is a four-step process beginning with 1. Import of the images through scanning or email, 2. Identification of the vendor and business unit associated with the invoice, 3. Data extraction, and 4. Export of the extracted data and images. == Automation software == Accounts payable automation is a technology-driven approach to invoice processing. According to the Document Imaging Report, issue no. 8-17-07, there are around 3757 invoice processing applications in the world. > Intelligent Data Capture (IDC) or learning systems enable end users to > extract content from invoices without the system having to learn the layout > of the invoice. Some intelligent engines are able to correctly sort batches > on the fly, locate data fields such as invoice and PO number, as well as > line item information, and then extract the desired content from those data > fields. Intelligent solutions do not require the coding of rules or design > form templates. Rather the system learns by reviewing a relatively small > number of invoice samples. This helps the system scale to large invoice > volumes and widely varying document layouts without requiring a human > operator to specify a template for each one, or explicitly create and tune > an extensive library of keywords. Invoice processing automation software has emerged as what one consulting company has called a \\"disruptive innovation,\\" whereby this new technological innovation has created a demand for a whole line of software products that previously did not exist. Invoice processing software has produced tremendous labor savings to the extent that many companies have begun to consider it an essential piece of their technology, much like word processing software. Other advantages of accounts payable automation include: * Up to an 80 percent reduction in a company's procure to pay cycle * A reduction in duplicate invoice payments and invoice entry errors * The ability to assign GL codes to invoices without direct access to a company's accounting platform. == Comprehensive invoice process management == The typical approach towards invoice management processes start from the arrival of a supplier invoice. Depending on the process design, the invoice should be identified, categorized, filed and matched against a PO by the person who was responsible for the order. After these steps the invoice is usually transferred to the financial department and the sum is paid. The problem with this process is the lack of comprehensive cost management, which should involve the following checkpoints and controlling points: ¬∑ Was the person who ordered item eligible to place the order? ¬∑ Was the PO approved by a responsible person? ¬∑ Can the PO or invoice be linked to an existing supplier contract? Comprehensive invoice management processes, therefore, shall involve the above-mentioned checkpoints in order to ensure that no fake suppliers can issue an invoice and get paid. This has happened to tech giants, Facebook and Google with a total sum of 100 million US dollars hence the danger is real and shall not be overlooked. == References == Category:Accounting systems Category:Accounts payable ","title":"Invoice processing"},{"id":"17322387","text":"is a train station in ≈åtsu, Shiga, Japan, on the Keihan Electric Railway Ishiyama Sakamoto Line.

He was born in Dannenberg/Elbe and died in Heidelberg. ==Life== ===Training=== Harry (also Heinrich) Bresslau studied in G√∂ttingen and Berlin: first Law, and then History. During his studies he was a teacher in the Auerbach Orphanage in Berlin. His most important teachers were Johann Gustav Droysen and Leopold von Ranke, whose assistant he became. In 1869 he took a doctorate at G√∂ttingen with Ranke's pupil Georg Waitz, with a thesis on the government of Emperor Conrad II. Immediately before his academic inauguration, he became Senior teacher at the Frankfurt Philanthropin. After his inauguration (1872), in 1877 Bresslau obtained an extraordinary-professorship at Berlin University. He was certainly a convinced National Liberal, and very attached to German nationality, but was a Jew and unbaptized. Hence the path to a regular professorship in Prussia was barred from him. ===Bresslau and Treitschke=== When Heinrich von Treitschke published his controversial writings against the Jews in 1879, Bresslau spoke openly and in a determined manner against his elder and senior professional colleagues, even though his position as extraordinary-professor had no permanent security.Zur Judenfrage. Sendschreiben an Heinrich von Treitschke (Concerning the Jewish Question. Open letter to Heinrich von Treitschke) (Berlin 1880). Nonetheless in 1878 Bresslau had worked together with Treitschke, a year before his anti-semitic contribution to the Prussian Annals, in an election-committee of the National- Liberal Party. Bresslau believed in the possibility of a complete assimilation of German Jewry through an open affirmation of the ideal of German nationhood. Thus he was one of the examples whom Treitschke brought forward as evidence for the proposal that an assimilation of the Jews might be possible. ===Strasbourg=== In 1890 Bresslau followed a calling to Strasbourg in Alsace, where he held a regular professorship of History in the University until 1912. There he developed a thorough-going teaching and research programme and made himself a leading National-Liberal advocate for German identity. Shortly after the end of the First World War, on 1 December 1918, the French expelled Bresslau from Strasbourg as a 'militant pan-Germanist'. When in 1904 the Academic-Historical Society in Berlin, to which Bresslau had belonged for 25 years, turned itself into an association (\\"Holsatia\\") wearing badges or liveries, and required other forms of co-operation from Bresslau, he bluntly refused. Holsatia had introduced a veto against admission for Jewish students. Bresslau spent the final years of his life first in Hamburg, then in Heidelberg. His son was the zoologist Ernst Bresslau. His daughter was the medical missionary, nurse, social worker, and public health advocate Helene Bresslau Schweitzer. ==Work== ===Monumenta Germaniae Historica=== Bresslau was involved from 1877 in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, and from 1888 in its central planning. For the Diploma section of the Monumenta he edited the original charters of Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor (Part 1: 1900, Part 2: 1903) and of Konrad II (1909). Bresslau's Handbuch der Urkundenlehre f√ºr Deutschland und Italien (Handbook of Charter and Diploma Studies for Germany and Italy), (2nd enlarged edition, Leipzig 1912) has even today not been superseded as the standard work on medieval Diplomas. For the Centenary of the Monumenta in 1919 Bresslau wrote the history of the project (Geschichte der Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Hanover 1921, reprinted Hanover 1976), his last book. As research supervisor, Bresslau supervised over 100 doctoral dissertations. ===Historical Commission for the History of Jews in Germany=== Under Bresslau's chairmanship in 1885, the Historical Commission for the History of the Jews in Germany was founded by the Union of German-Jewish Congregations. On the model of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica and the Historical Commission of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, the relevant source-material was sought out and usefully assembled for research. Bresslau obstructed the co-option of the popular historian Heinrich Graetz, because he believed that the official recognition of Graetz as a historical writer would dangerously aggravate the relationship between Jews and Christians. Graetz had evolved a sort of Judaeo-centric view of history, which was most sharply criticized in the Berlin anti-semitism controversies. Bresslau himself was a leading exponent of positivist science. The Historical Commission published until 1892 the Journal for the History of the Jews in Germany. ==Notes== ==Sources== * Harry Bresslau: 'Autobiographical statement', in Sigfrid Steinberg (Ed.), Die Geschichtswissenschaft der Gegenwart in Selbstdarstellungen (Historical science of the present in autobiographical statements), Vol. 2, 1926, pp. 29‚Äì83. * Paul Fridolin Kehr, 'Harry Bresslau' (Obituary).

He rents a house from another recovered alcoholic, Chef, and calls his wife, Edna, who he has not been with in over two years, to come and live with him. She does and they have a happy summer together until Chef tells him they have to leave by the end of the month so that he can give the house to his daughter, Linda. Wes, who has attached the success of his recovery to the house, takes the news badly and must decide whether to continue his success or to succumb to drinking again. == Background == \\"Chef's House\\" was originally published by The New Yorker magazine http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1981-11-30#folio=042 in their November 30, 1981 issue, and was the first of Carver's stories to be published in that magazine. Later, it was published in the short story collections Cathedral in 1983 and Where I'm Calling From in 1988. == Characters == Wes - One of the primary characters and a recovering alcoholic; he struggles with establishing his own identity apart from alcohol and Chef's house throughout the story Edna - Wes' wife who leaves her current boyfriend and peaceful situation to give Wes another chance one summer Chef - A recovered alcoholic who rents out his house to Wes Linda - Also called \\"Fat Linda,\\" Chef's daughter Cheryl and Bobby - Wes and Edna's children; mentioned in passing == Themes == There are multiple themes in \\"Chef's House,\\" all of which are closely interrelated. Alcohol Alcohol plays a major role in the short story, despite the fact that the word itself never appears. \\"Alcoholic,\\" \\"drink,\\" \\"drinking,\\" \\"drunk,\\" and \\"sober\\" all show up at some point, but never \\"alcohol.\\" Wes is a recovering alcoholic, attending \\"Don't Drink meetings\\" with Chef. It is implied that his marriage with Edna originally failed because of his drinking and his children have become estranged from him for the same reason. While Wes originally is very successful in stopping to drink, the end of the story sees him sinking back towards the decision to drink again because of shattered hopes and a fragile sense of identity. Identity Almost even more pervasive than alcohol in the story is the theme of identity. Wes has never been able to create an individual identity apart from things in his life (possibly because he was married and had two children by the age of 19). Originally, he finds his identity in alcohol but is able to replace that identity with one wrapped up in Chef's house. Chef's house comes to symbolize his recovery, safety, and a better life, however, no matter what he does, Wes cannot escape the fact that ultimately the house belongs to Chef as well as everything inside it. Thus, it can never be his own identity. That realization devastates Wes, and causes him to turn back to his original identity involving alcohol. Starting over In the story, starting over is linked with the idea of identity in the sense of someone trying to create another life and a new vision for himself/herself. By the end of the story, however, Wes has lost all faith in the possibility of anyone genuinely starting afresh since as he puts it, \\"If I was somebody else, I wouldn't be me. But I'm who I am.\\" To go through the \\"what if\\" situations and to pretend to start over is to try to become someone else and have someone else's life. Wes sees this as unrealistic and thus, makes the decision to give into the \\"self\\" he was originally, that of an alcoholic. Storytelling Storytelling has always been an important part of Raymond Carver's stories. \\"Chef's House\\" is unique, however, in that, unlike most of Carver's stories, the dialogue between characters is not within quotation marks. Thus, the whole story seems to be more like Edna's recounting of all of the events to a friend after the fact, rather than the action happening in real-time. Also unique, is the fact that it is Edna recounting the story, rather than Wes. Most of Carver's works come from the male perspective and more often from the alcoholic, rather than the alcoholic's wife. These changes give a special twist to \\"Chef's House\\" and reinforce the questions about identity from throughout the story. == References == ==Additional resources== Carver, Raymond. \\"Chef's House.\\" Where I'm Calling From.

Such videos tend to be made in a number of distinct pornographic subgenres and attempt to present a sexual fantasy and the actors selected for a particular role are primarily selected on their ability to create or fit that fantasy. Pornographic videos are characterized as either \\"softcore\\", which does not contain depictions of sexual penetration or \\"extreme fetishism\\" and \\"hardcore\\", which can contain depictions of penetration or extreme fetishism, or both. The genres and sexual intensity of videos is mainly determined by demand. Depending on the genre of the film, the on-screen appearance, age, and physical features of the main actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the video is of critical importance. Most actors specialize in certain genres, such as gay sex, lesbian sex, bondage, strap-on sex, anal sex, double penetration, semen swallowing, teenage women, interracial or MILFs. The pornography industry in the United States was the first to develop its own movie star system, primarily for commercial reasons. In other countries, the \\"star\\" system is not common, with most actors being amateurs. Most performers use a pseudonym and strive to maintain off-screen anonymity. A number of pornographic actors and actresses have written autobiographies. It is very rare for pornographic actors and actresses to successfully cross over to the mainstream film industry. The number of pornographic film actors who have worked in the United States can be indicated by number of actors tested by Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation (AIM). When in 2011 its patient database was leaked it contained details of over 12,000 pornographic actors that it had tested since 1998. As of 2011, it was reported that roughly 1,200‚Äì1,500 performers were working in California's \\"Porn Valley\\". ==History== Production of risqu√© films commenced with the start of photography. \\"Moving pictures\\" that featured nudity were popular in \\"penny arcades\\" of the early 1900s which had hand-cranked films and rotoscope (Holmes-style Stereoscope) glasses. These penny arcade attractions featured topless women, full frontal nudity, and even sexual coupling. Production of erotic films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture. The first erotic film was the 7-minute 1896 film Le Coucher de la Mari√©e directed by Frenchman Albert Kirchner (under the name \\"L√©ar\\") which had Louise Willy performing a bathroom striptease.Richard Abel, Encyclopedia of early cinema, Taylor & Francis, 2005, , p.518 Other French filmmakers also started making this type of risqu√© films, showing women disrobing. The Path√© brothers supplied the demand throughout Europe.Michael Achenbach, Paolo Caneppele, Ernst Kieninger: Projektionen der Sehnsucht: Saturn, die erotischen Anf√§nge der √∂sterreichischen Kinematografie. Filmarchiv Austria, Wien 2000, . In Austria, Johann Schwarzer produced 52 erotic productions between 1906 and 1911, each of which contained young local women fully nude, to provide an alternative local source to the French productions. Performers in these early productions were usually uncredited or used pseudonyms to avoid legal sanction and social disapprobation. The use of pseudonyms was the norm in the industry; pornographic film actors maintained a low profile, using pseudonyms to maintain a level of anonymity, while others performed uncredited. The use of pseudonyms has remained a tradition in the industry, and actors would perform under a number of pseudonyms, depending on the genre of film, or changed a pseudonym when the previous one ceased to be a draw card. Casey Donovan starred in the first mainstream pornographic hit, Boys in the Sand, in 1971. However, arguably the first pornstar to become a household name was Linda Lovelace (the pseudonym of Linda Susan Boreman) from New York City, who starred in the 1972 feature Deep Throat. The film grossed millions of dollars worldwide, success that was echoed by similar stars and productions such as Marilyn Chambers (Behind the Green Door), Gloria Leonard (The Opening of Misty Beethoven), Georgina Spelvin (The Devil in Miss Jones), and Bambi Woods (Debbie Does Dallas). The period from the early 1970s through the late-70s or early 1980s has been called The Golden Age of Porn, when erotic films were produced in the United States with narratives, backed by movie-style promotional budgets, and were shown in public theaters and accepted (or at least tolerated) for public consumption.Second wave: Feminism and porns golden age. Radical Society Oct 2002 by Loren Glass Performers in these productions became celebrities including Peter Berlin, John Holmes, Ginger Lynn Allen, Porsche Lynn, Desire√© Cousteau, Juliet Anderson (\\"Aunt Peg\\"), Lisa De Leeuw, Veronica Hart, Nina Hartley, Harry Reems, Seka, Annette Haven and Amber Lynn. Meanwhile in Europe, many pornographic actresses and actors come from the so- called pornographic bloc countries, such as Russia, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. In France, popular female performers have included Brigitte Lahaie, Clara Morgane, C√©line Tran (Katsuni), and Yasmine Lafitte. In Italy, the Swedish Marina Lothar rose to prominence in the early 1980s, as well as Moana Pozzi, Ilona Staller (Cicciolina), and Lilli Carati. ==Performers== ===Female performers=== Jenna Jameson is a former pornographic actress Most pornographic films are directed at a heterosexual male viewer, and the primary focus and most on-screen time is on the women in them. Pornographic films attempt to present a sexual fantasy and actresses are selected on their ability to create or fit that fantasy. Many times the fantasy can be an actress' physical features and appearance, such as figure, breast size, hair style, ethnicity, as well as on her willingness and expertise in performing particular sex acts. Actresses are required to present a positive attitude to on-screen sexual performance with all sex acts being presented as enjoyable and joyfully entered into. Actresses are usually presented as always being available and willing to engage in any sex acts that their on-screen partner, as the proxy of the viewer, wishes. Depending on the genre of a film, the on-screen appearance and physical features of the main actors and their ability to create the sexual mood of the film is of critical importance. Most actors specialize in certain genres, such as lesbian sex, bondage, strap-on sex, anal sex, double penetration, semen swallowing, teenage women, interracial or MILFs. Sex acts may be simulated or unsimulated. Irrespective of the genre, most actors are required to appear nude in pornographic films. The on-screen physical appearances of the female performers is of primary importance. They are typically younger in age than their male counterparts, in their teens, 20's, and 30's. There is a preference in the industry for thinness and large-breasted actresses; some film studios encourage their actresses to have breast implants, and offer to pay for the procedure. According to actor-turned-director Jonathan Morgan, Less desirable actresses are more likely to agree to perform more extreme and high-risk sexual acts such as \\"double-anal\\" in order to get work. According to Morgan, Some performers note that \\"a performer's pleasure is not of primary importance\\" and that \\"porn sex is not the same as private sex\\". According to a study investigating health risks for industry performers, the authors found that female performers are at significantly higher risk than male performers. They reported, Furthermore, there is a contrary opinion stating that porn production is not necessarily unethical or degrading. According to Lynn Comella, a women's studies professor at UNLV, presenting demeaning practices as representative of the entire porn industry is \\"akin to talking about Hollywood while only referencing Spaghetti Westerns\\". A 2018 review published in the Journal of Sex Research found that the majority of male pornography consumers surveyed dislike seeing \\"acts that were more clearly unpleasant/painful for female performers, such as forced gagging or forceful anal penetration.\\" They concluded that despite the oversaturation of extreme and kinky content in the industry, most consumers are not interested in kinky, fetish or degrading pornography. ===Male performers=== American Porn star Ron Jeremy was ranked by AVN at number one in their \\"100 Top Porn Stars of All Time\\" list, and is listed in the Guinness World Records for \\"Most Appearances in Adult Films\\". Peter North, active since the early 1980s, was ranked at number 15 by AVN in their \\"100 Top Porn Stars of All Time\\" list. While the primary focus of heterosexual adult films are the women in them, who are mostly selected for their on-screen appearance, there is a definite focus on the male performers who are able to fulfill the desires of the male watching audience as their on-screen proxies. Most male performers in heterosexual pornography are generally selected less for their looks and more for their sexual prowess, namely their ability to do three things: achieve an erection while on a busy and sometimes pressuring film set, maintain that erection while performing on camera, and then ejaculate on cue. However, the majority of on-screen ejaculations, semen, and \\"money shots\\" are artificial. In the past, an actor's inability to maintain an erection or being subject to premature ejaculation could make the difference between a film turning a profit or a loss. If an actor loses his erection, filming is forced to stop. This problem has been addressed with the use of Viagra, although Viagra can make the actor's face noticeably flushed, give him a headache, make it difficult to ejaculate, and can take about 45 minutes to take effect. According to director John Stagliano, using Viagra means \\"You also lose a dimension. The guy's fucking without being aroused.\\" Ron Jeremy, John Holmes, and Rocco Siffredi are considered by AVN as the top male performers of all time. Adding to his fame, Ron Jeremy has been a staple in the industry since the 1970s and has become something of a cultural icon. Ken Shimizu is credited with having had sex with over 8,000 women in the course of making 7,500 films.showbizinterview ==Industry practices== ===Pay rates=== Most male performers in heterosexual porn are paid less than their female counterparts. Some state that homosexual male porn generally pays men much more than heterosexual porn. Men who identify themselves as \\"heterosexual\\" but perform in gay pornography are said to do gay-for-pay. This means they perform in gay movies only for the paycheck. ==== By scene ==== Payment for pornstars is dependent on the sex acts performed; penetration typically paying highest. In a single scene, female actresses typically make between $100 and $6000, while male actors make between $100 and $400. In 2017, the Independent reported that female performers in scenes with male performers typically earn around $1,000, compared with $700‚Äì800 in scenes with other females. The Independent also claimed that pay rates are subject to variation up or down by around 10-20%, depending on various factors. The Daily Beast claimed in 2019 that female performers could make between $300 and $2500 per scene, depending on their level of experience and the sex acts performed. Higher paid female performers could make around $1200 per scene. The Los Angeles Times reported, in 2009, that the pay rates for a female actress performing heterosexual scenes were $700 to $1,000. According to the porn website Videobox in 2008, actresses make these rates: Blowjobs: $200‚Äì$400; Straight sex: $400‚Äì$1,200; Anal sex: $900‚Äì$1,500; Double Penetration: $1,200‚Äì$1,600; Double anal: $2,000. For more unusual fetishes, women generally get 15% extra. Ron Jeremy has commented that in 2008, \\"The average guy gets $300 to $400 a scene, or $100 to $200 if he's new.\\" According to producer Seymore Butts in 2007, who runs his own sex-film recruitment agency, as well as producing sex films; \\"depending on draw, female performers who perform in both straight and lesbian porn earn more than those who do just heterosexual scenes usually make about US$200‚Äì800 while those who only do oral sex (blow job) usually only make about US$100‚Äì300 for the scene\\". In a 2004 interview conducted by Local10 news of Florida, it was claimed that individuals were offered $700 for sexual intercourse while shooting a scene of the popular series Bang Bus. In 2001, actress Chloe said of pay-rates; \\"In Gonzo, you're paid not by the picture, but by the scene. So it's girl-girl: $700, plus $100 for an anal toy. Boy-girl: $900. Anal: $1,100. Solo: $500. DP: $1,500.\\" ==== Salaries ==== Salaries for female actresses typically range from $60,000 to $400,000, compared with $40,000 for male actors. In 2017, the Independent reported that top porn performers' salaries were around $300,000 to $400,000. In 2011, the manager of Capri Anderson said, \\"A contract girl will only shoot for one company, she won't shoot for anyone else. Most actresses in the adult industry are free agents ‚Äì they'll shoot for anyone. Most contract girls make $60,000 a year. In one year, a contract girl will shoot, on average, four movies and each movie takes about two or three weeks to shoot.\\" Ron Jeremy has commented on the salaries of performers, stating in 2008 that \\"A woman makes $100,000 to $250,000 at the end of the year\\", and in 2003 that \\"Girls can easily make 100-250k per year, plus stuff on the side like strip shows and appearances. The average male makes $40,000 a year.\\" ==== Other payment ==== Besides appearing in films, porn stars often make money from endorsements and appearance fees. For instance, in 2010, some night clubs were paying female porn stars and Playboy Playmates to appear there to act as draws for the general public; the Los Angeles Times reported that Jesse Jane was paid between $5,000 to $10,000 for one appearance by a Chicago club. ===Health issues=== Because pornographic film making involves unsimulated sex, usually without condoms (barebacking), pornographic performers are particularly vulnerable to unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, and sexually transmitted diseases. In a paper written by the Los Angeles Board of Public Health, officials claimed that among 825 performers screened in 2000‚Äì2001, 7.7% of females and 5.5% of males had chlamydia, and 2% overall had gonorrhea. These rates are much higher than in patients visiting family planning clinics, where chlamydia and gonorrhea rates were 4.0% and 0.7%, respectively. Between January 2003 and March 2005, approximately 976 performers were reported with 1,153 positive STD test results. Of the 1,153 positive test results, 722 (62.6%) were chlamydia, 355 (30.8%) were gonorrhea, and 126 (10.9%) were coinfections with chlamydia and gonorrhea. Less is known about the prevalence and risk of transmission of other STDs such as syphilis, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B or C, trichomonal infection, or diseases transmitted through the fecal‚Äìoral route. The data collection of Los Angeles public health was criticized by pornographic industry sources on the grounds that most of those testing positive were being excluded from pornographic film acting until they had treated their STDs. Non- treatable STDs like HSV represent a difficult case: according to actress Chloe, \\"After you've been in this business for a while, you have herpes. Everyone has herpes.\\" The high rate of STIs and STDs in the pornographic film industry began to be addressed in 1998 when major pornographic film producers started implementing a regular periodic testing program for pornographic film actors. In the 1980s, there was an outbreak of HIV/AIDS in the pornographic film industry and a number of deaths of actors and this led to the creation of the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation (AIM), which helped set up a voluntary standard in the United States pornographic film industry where pornographic film actors are tested for HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhea every 30 days, and hepatitis, syphilis and HSV twice a year. AIM claims that this program has reduced the rate of STDs among pornographic film actors to 20% of that of the general population. These claims have been proven false. As of 2013, rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea alone were 24% among female performers. Only 6% reported using condoms. ==Awards== Exceptional performance of pornographic actors and actresses is recognized in the AVN Awards, XRCO Awards and XBIZ Awards. The AVN Awards are film awards sponsored and presented by the American adult video industry trade magazine AVN (Adult Video News). They are called the \\"Oscars of porn\\". The AVN Awards are divided into nearly 100 categories, some of which are analogous to industry awards offered in other film and video genres, and others that are specific to pornographic/erotic film and video. The XRCO Awards are given by the X-Rated Critics Organization annually. The Venus Awards are presented each year in Berlin as part of the Venus Berlin trade fair. ==Media== ===Media and press coverage=== With some notable or occasional exceptions, pornographic actors are not generally reported on by mainstream media. As a result, specialized publications (or trade journals) emerged to serve as a source of information about the industry, its business dealings, trends and forecasts, as well as its personnel. Two of the predominant media outlets are Adult Video News and the X-Rated Business Journal known as XBIZ. Certain performers also have had their public accounts blocked on social media platforms. The Internet Adult Film Database (IAFD) lists adult film productions dating back to the 1970s, the performers in those films, and the associated directors. ===Autobiographies=== A number of pornographic actors and actresses have written autobiographies, including the following: ==See also== * List of pornographic film studios * List of pornographic actors who appeared in mainstream films * List of members of the XRCO Hall of Fame ==References== ==External links== * AVN Awards * Internet Adult Film Database * Adult Film Database * European Girls Adult Film Database Category:Entertainment occupations Category:Pornography ","title":"Pornographic film actor"},{"id":"17322726","text":"Rex (Live at the Fillmore) is the thirteenth album by Keller Williams, recorded live on February 8, 2006 at the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, Colorado.Keller Williams album for REX charity , news.jamradio.org, May 7, 2008, Retrieved May 7, 2008.

The poem was first published in 1939, under the title Rejoice in the Lamb: A Song from Bedlam, edited by W. F. Stead from Smart's manuscript, which Stead had discovered in a private library. ==Background== A \\"Commission of Lunacy\\" was taken out against Christopher Smart, and he was admitted in St. Luke's Hospital on May 6, 1757 as a \\"Curable Patient\\" by his wife Anna's stepfather John Newbery.Sherbo p. 112 It is possible that Smart was confined by Newbery over old debts and a poor relationship between the two.Mounsey p. 181 Regardless, there is evidence that an incident took place in St. James's Park in which he \\"routed all the company\\" (Jubilate Agno B89) and this incident may have provoked his being locked away.Mounsey p. 200 During this time, Smart was left alone, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker.Sherbo p. 130 It is very possible that he felt \\"homeless\\" during this time and surely felt that he was in a \\"limbo‚Ä¶ between public and private space\\".Hawes p. 155 He had nothing else but to turn inwards and devote himself to God and his poetry.Mounsey p. 238 No specifics are known about Christopher Smart's day-to-day activities, and he was released from the asylum on January 30, 1763, but his poem was not to be published until 1939.Mounsey p. 240 ==The manuscript== \\"Let\\" side of the manuscript Jubilate Agno is divided into four fragments labeled \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", and \\"D\\". The whole work consists of over 1,200 lines: all the lines in some sections begin with the word Let; those in other sections begin with For. Those in the series beginning with the word \\"Let,\\" associated names of human beings, mainly biblical, with various natural objects; and those beginning with the word \\"For\\" are a series of aphoristic verses.RPO - Christopher Smart : Jubilate Agno Editing the work in 1950, W.H. Bond stated that, \\"The poem was intended as a responsive reading; and that is why the Let and For sections [of the manuscript] are physically distinct while corresponding verse for verse. Smart's plan was to arrange the Let and For passages opposite one another antiphonally, following a practice of biblical Hebrew poetry, and that the present MS. represents less than half of Smart's original plan for the poem.\\"Tillotson and Fussel Although the original manuscript divided the \\"Let\\" and \\"For\\" verses onto opposing sides of the manuscript, Karina Williams claims that \\"Dr W. H. Bond then discovered that some of the LET and FOR folios were numbered and dated concurrently, and that these chronologically parallel texts were further connected by verbal links.\\"Prose Works I p. xxii Reinforcing this view of a parallel between the two sides is the fact that Christopher Smart's influence, Robert Lowth and his Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews, spends a large portion of his work exploring the \\"parallelism\\" found in \\"Hebrew verse.\\"Curry p. 19 In Karina Williamson's 1980 edition, she made an editorial decision and combined the \\"Let\\" and the \\"For\\" and then justified this combining the two sides to follow each other based on Bond's claims. Using Williamson's combining of the two halves as a model, Guest claims that the \\"For\\" verses explore religion with a \\"personal tone\\" and the \\"Let\\" are \\"unambiguous\\" and deal with public matters.Guest pp. 141-142 Jeanne Walker goes further than Guest and reinforced Bond's claims that the \\"Let \\" and \\"For\\" sections are reminiscent of the Hebrew tradition when she states that the purpose of the poems, as with the Hebrew poems, is to \\"iterate both present and future simultaneously, that is, they redeem time.\\"Walker p. 458 In Jubilate Agno, Smart describes his writing as creating \\"impressions\\".Liu p. 127 To accomplish this task, he incorporated puns and onomatopoeia in order to emphasize the theological significance of his poetic language.Costa p. 305 Jubilate Agno reflects an abandonment of traditional poetic structures in order to explore complex religious thought. His \\"Let\\" verses join creation together as he seemingly writes his own version of Biblical poetry.Guest p. 140 Smart, in Jubilate Agno, plays on words and the meaning behind words in order to participate with the divine that exists within language.Guest p. 167 This is most exemplified when the poet says, \\"For I pray the Lord Jesus to translate my MAGNIFICAT into verse and represent it\\" (B43), where the image of the Magnificat connects Smart to Mary and her praise of God before giving birth to Jesus, the future savior.Curry p. 24 ===Ark=== \\"Fragment A\\" of Jubilate Agno begins by combining the Patriarchs with animals.Curry p. 21 The beginning lines of the poem state the function of this action when they read, \\"Let Noah and his company approach the throne of Grace, and do homage to the Ark of their Salvation\\" (A4). These two groups are combined together in order to combine the images of \\"Noah's Ark\\" and the \\"Ark of Salvation\\" in a manner that is similar to a \\"Baptismal Service\\". For many of the pairs there is a logical or symbolic consistency. Figures, such as Abraham, Balaam, and Daniel are paired with animals mentioned directly in relationship with each other in their Biblical accounts, while others, like Isaac, are slightly more obscure are paired with animals that were involved in an important aspect of their life. Biblical priests follow the Patriarchs, and their animal companions are the unclean animals from Deuteronomy. The pairing slowly breaks down when later figures, such as political leaders, enter into the poem.Curry p. 22 Along with this transformation of pairing comes insects, legendary creatures, and finally seven birds at the end of the fragment. The next section, \\"Fragment B\\" returns to the various animal pairs and, in a mixture of Old and New Testament figures, begins to rely on local animals or animals that pun off of aspects of the figure's life. One such example is a pun on Salmon and Salome as a pair for John the Baptist. This fish image is further expanded to play off the idea that the Apostles were originally \\"fishermen\\" along with being \\"fishers of men\\". This pairs continue to go on until the poem turns to creatures from Pliny at B245.Poetical Works p. 53 The pairing stops at B295 when the \\"For\\" verses become the only type remaining in the fragment.Poetical Works p. 60 However, the pairing resumes in \\"Fragment C\\" when Biblical names from the Book of Ezra and the Book of Nehemiah are combined with various plants and herbs.Poetical Works p. 91 The last section, \\"Fragment D\\", relies on personal friends and those known by Christopher Smart to be paired with various stones, gems, minerals and a few herbs.Poetical Works p. 108 ===Science=== The poem contains many references to the scientific works of John Locke and Isaac Newton.Guest p. 132 However, some have claimed that Christopher Smart was involved with science and did not care about scientific principles since, for example, he relies on mythical creatures such as the \\"Leucrocuta\\" that come from pagan pseudo-scientific works like those of Pliny the Elder.Curry p. 25 Moreover, Jubilate Agno criticizes contemporary scientific theories, saying \\"Newton is ignorant for if a man consult not the WORD how should he understand the WORK?\\"(B220), and establishes Smart's own original natural philosophy, in which he emphasizes God's presence in the universe. Smart seems to be fascinated by contemporary science, but he also aims to incorporate it into a theology, and in so doing to create what has been called a \\"new science.\\" This \\"new science\\" that Smart seems to express in his poetry rewrites Newton's laws of motion to include the divine (B159-B168):Poetical Works I pp. 37-39 :For the grosser the particles the nearer to the sink, and the nearer to purity, the quicker the gravitation. :For MATTER is the dust of the Earth, every atom of which is the life. :For MOTION is the quality of life direct, and that which hath not motion, is resistance. :For Resistance is not of GOD, but he-hath built his works upon it. :For the Centripetal and Centrifugal forces are GOD SUSTAINING and DIRECTING. :For Elasticity is the temper of matter to recover its place with vehemence. :For Attraction is the earning of parts, which have a similitude in the life. :For the Life of God is in the Loadstone, and there is a magnet, which pointeth due EAST. :For the Glory of God is always in the East, but cannot be seen for the cloud of the crucifixion. :For due East is the way to Paradise, which man knoweth not by reason of his fall. The problem with Newtonian physics according to Smart, Harriet Guest argues, is that \\"it is not based on the principles of revelation: it builds up general notions or theories from analyses of particular instances, rather than attempting to understand each instance through perceiving its relation to the whole revealed to faith.\\"Guest p. 133 It is possible that Christopher Smart was influenced by John Hutchinson, Moses Principia being his major work on the subject, and it is Hutchinson that inspired Smart to adjust or alter Newtonian science in this way, as it was (in his view) lacking a proper relationship with the divine.Prose Works p. 131 However, the poem's \\"new science\\" seems also to come to an abrupt stop at the end, \\"as though [Christopher Smart] loses interest in it for a while.\\"Curry p. 28 ===Jeoffry=== \\"For\\" side of the manuscript The poem is chiefly remembered today ‚Äì especially among cat lovers ‚Äì for the 74-line section wherein Smart extols the many virtues and habits of his cat, Jeoffry.Curry p. 7 To this Neil Curry remarks, \\"They are lines that most people first meet outside the context of the poem as a whole, as they are probably the most anthologized extract in our literature.\\"Curry p. 29 Furthermore, Jeoffry himself is the \\"most famous cat in the whole history of English literature.\\"Curry p. 18 Smart is fond of his cat and praises his cat's relationship with God when he says (B695-B768): :\\"For I will consider my Cat Jeoffry. :For he is the servant of the Living God duly and daily serving him. :For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships in his Way. :For this is done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant quickness. :For then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of God upon his prayer :... :For when his day's work is done his business more properly begins. :For he keeps the Lord's watch in the night against the adversary. :For he counteracts the Devil, who is death, by brisking about the life :... :For he is the cleanest in the use of his forepaws of any quadruped. :For the dexterity of his defence is an instance of the love of God to him exceedingly. :For he is the quickest to his mark of any creature. :For he is tenacious of his point. :For he is a mixture of gravity and waggery. :For he knows that God is his Saviour. :For there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at rest. :For there is nothing brisker than his life when in motion :... :For God has blessed him in the variety of his movements. :For, tho he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer. :For his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other quadrupede. :For he can tread to all the measures upon the musick :For he can swim for life. :For he can creep.\\" His section of Jeoffry is just part of his larger desire to give a \\"voice\\" to nature, and Smart believes that nature, like his cat, is always praising God but needs a poet in order to bring out that voice.Curry p. 8 The themes of animals and language are thus merged in Jubilate Agno, and Jeoffry is transformed into a manifestation of the Ars Poetica tradition.Ennis p. 16 ==Critical interpretation== Many critics have focused on the unique language of Jubilate Agno. Christopher Smart's constant emphasis on the force of poetry in the poem takes on the qualities of the Ars Poetica tradition.Ennis p. 8 As such, Smart is attempting to develop a poetic language that will connect him to the \\"one true, eternal poem\\" of God.Ennis p. 10 This poetic language connects Smart to Orpheus and David, but also relates him to Adam's \\"onomathetic\\" tradition, or the idea that names hold significant weight in the universe and that Adam was able to join in with creation by naming objects.Costa p. 296 However, many critics have focused on the possible sexual images present in Jubilate Agno. The image of \\"horns\\" in Jubilate Agno is commonly viewed as a sexual image.Liu p. 121 Easton puts particular emphasis on the image of horns as a phallic image and contends that there are masculine and feminine horns throughout Smart's poem.Easton p. 234 Hawes picks up this theme and goes on to claim that the poem shows \\"that [Christopher Smart] had been ‚Äòfeminized‚Äô as a cuckold.\\"Hawes \\"Bawdy\\" p. 4 In response to this possible cuckolding, Jubilate Agno predicts a misogynistic future while simultaneously undermining this effort with his constant associations to female creation.Hawes \\"Bawdy\\" p. 16 ==Jubilate Agno in music== The text of Jubilate Agno is the source for Rejoice in the Lamb, a festival cantata composed by Benjamin Britten in 1943 for four soloists, a Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass choir, and organ. The cantata was commissioned by the Rev'd Canon Walter Hussey for the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the consecration of St Matthew's Church, Northampton. ==Performances== On 27 December 2007, the London arts radio station Resonance FM broadcast the whole of Jubilate Agno.https://archive.org/download/JubilateAgno/Hooting_Yard_Special_- _Jubilate_Agno_64kb.mp3 It was performed by Frank Key and Germander Speedwell. ==Notes== ==References== * Costa, Dennis. \\"Language in Smart's Jubilate Agno.\\" Essays in Criticism: A Quarterly Journal of Literary Criticism 52, 4 (Oct. 2002): 295‚Äì313. * Curry, Neil.

In a commercial context, mobile web analytics refers to the use of data collected as visitors access a website from a mobile phone. It helps to determine which aspects of the website work best for mobile traffic and which mobile marketing campaigns work best for the business, including mobile advertising, mobile search marketing, text campaigns, and desktop promotion of mobile sites and services. Data collected as part of mobile analytics typically includes page views, visits, visitors, and countries, as well as information specific to mobile devices, such as device model, manufacturer, screen resolution, device capabilities, service provider, and preferred user language. This data is typically compared against key performance indicators for performance and return on investment, and is used to improve a website or mobile marketing campaign's audience response. The majority of modern smartphones are able to browse websites, some with browsing experiences similar to those of desktop computers. The W3C Mobile Web Initiative identifies best practices to help websites support mobile phone browsing. Many companies use these guidelines and mobile-specific code like Wireless Markup Language or HTML5 to optimize websites for viewing on mobile devices. ==Drawbacks of applying traditional web analytics== To begin with, the way users interact with a cell phone or a tablet differs immensely from the way they interact with a desktop or laptop. The action of clicking with the mouse has been replaced with the action of swiping with a finger. Scrolling through longer pages with all the relevant information in one place has replaced top heavy navigation styles. These factors greatly influence the click-through rates, and consequently, the way web analytics can be used. Collecting mobile web analytics data has proven to be less straightforward than traditional web analytics due to a few defining factors. Traditional analytics software on a mobile website only provides data for HTTP requests coming from the most advanced mobile browsers; such as those found in the iPhone and other smart phones and PDAs, with no data on other mobile devices browsing the site. Common web analytics software that use server log parsing to associate different IP addresses with \\"unique visits\\" may fail to actually identify unique visitors. This is due to IP addresses from each mobile device originating from a gateway IP address of the network access provider. Several dynamic server-side platforms are used to develop mobile sites. Server-side tracking code is recommended for more accurate analytics reporting. ==Platforms== * HTML/JavaScript * WordPress Mobile Pack * PHP * .NET * Java * Python * ColdFusion * Ruby on Rails * node.js/Connect * TypePad Pro * Unify (Gravity4) Different tracking processes or mechanisms are available for each of the above platforms. For unsupported/HTML sites, the JavaScript pixel tracking mechanism is most commonly used. Because mobile websites are typically open to access from any kind of network - fixed, Wi-Fi, cellular wireless, satellite wireless, etc. - a traditional web analytics solution could range from fairly accurate to mostly inaccurate, depending on where the HTTP requests are coming from. In addition, mobile web analytics involve metrics and KPIs associated with mobile device information, such as model, manufacturer, and screen resolution. These data can usually be assembled by combining device identification information taken from special HTTP headers, such as user-agents, with device capabilities stored in a device information registry, such as WURFL. This method is not provided by traditional web analytics solutions because it is mobile web-specific. ==Problems with tracking== ===Visitor identification=== Visitor identification is the most important aspect of usable mobile web analytics and one of the hardest technical aspects to accomplish, primarily because JavaScript and HTTP cookies are so unreliable on mobile browsers. As a result, some mobile web analytics solutions only detect or count user visits per day. The best solutions provide reliable, persistent, and unique user identities, allowing accurate measurement of repeat visits and long-term customer loyalty. ===JavaScript page tagging=== Javascript-based Page tagging notifies a third-party server when a page is rendered by a web browser. This method assumes that the end user browser has JavaScript capabilities and that JavaScript is enabled, though it is possible that neither may be true. At this time, most mobile web browsers do not support JavaScript sufficiently for this to work. ===HTTP cookies=== HTTP cookies are commonly used to mark and identify visitors. Cookies are a standard capability for all desktop web browsers. With the prevalence of iPhones and Androids, HTTP cookies are now supported by most smartphones, because by default, iPhones and Android phones will accept browser cookies from web sites. As with desktop browsers, the mobile device user may choose to disable cookies. ===HTTP referrer=== HTTP referrer information showing where a visitor navigated from is generally not provided for mobile web browsing. This is either because the device manufacturer has disabled sending such information in the HTTP request to save bandwidth during network usage, or because the mobile network operator's internet gateway removes or alters the original HTTP header due to the gateway software or use of mobile web transcoding software. ===Image tags=== Handset caching mechanisms impact the use of images for page tagging. In some cases, image caching on handsets is performed regardless of any anti-caching headers output by the remote server. ===IP address=== For desktop web browsing, the network address of the client machine usually gives some form of user identification and location. For mobile web browsing, the client IP address refers to the internet gateway machine owned by the network operator. For devices such as the BlackBerry or for phones using Opera Mini browser software, the IP address refers to an operator-owned internet gateway machine in Canada or Norway. ==Collecting mobile web analytics data== Collection of mobile web analytics data requires a different approach from collecting traditional web analytics data. A number of solutions are available and the best results are obtained through the use of more than one technology. ===Packet sniffing=== Also known as tagless data capture or passive network capture, this technique uses a tap between the mobile users and the web server to capture the full content of the client-server exchange. Tagless data capture techniques are increasing in popularity for mobile web analytics because they capture all users, work with all devices and do not require JavaScript, cookies, server logs, or plugins. ===Image tags or beacons=== Images can be forced to work for mobile web analytics, provided that the transmitted image is always unique. The level of information recorded from these transmissions depends on the architecture provided by the supplier, and not all image beacon solutions are the same. ===Link redirection=== Link redirection is an important method of tracking mobile visitor activities. It is the only reliable way to record clicks from advertising, search, and other marketing activities. It also records visitors clicking on links to leave a site. This method helps address the lack of HTTP referrer information on mobile. ===HTTP header analysis=== This tells you a number of basic facts about the mobile phone and the browser. It can be used in conjunction with a device database such as WURFL. ===IP address analysis=== An operator database is used to identify operators and their countries based on the IP addresses of their internet gateway devices. IP addresses alone do not identify all operators and countries, as some operators share their mobile networks with virtual network operators (MVNO). Boost Wireless, for example, uses the Sprint network. Because these two operators have very different customer demographics, clear differentiation between operators is critical for good mobile marketing campaigns. Carriers may also share their mobile internet gateways, sometimes across multiple countries, and many change or add gateways on a regular basis. ===WAP Gateway Traffic logs=== The WAP gateway logs are the mine of information that can be analysed to get relevant information as all the mobile traffic goes through these servers. There are companies like OPENWAVE which have tools that can analyse these logs and provide the information required. ==References== Category:Mobile web Category:Web analytics ","title":"Mobile web analytics"},{"id":"17322832","text":"Fake Noise from a Box of Toys is the fourth and final studio album by American alternative rock band The Autumns, released in 2007. ==Track listing== All songs written by the Autumns. #\\"Turning Strangers Into Friends And Friends Into Customers\\" #\\"Boys\\" #\\"Clem\\" #\\"The Midnight Knock\\" #\\"Killer in Drag\\" #\\"Night Music\\" #\\"Only Young\\" #\\"Glass Jaw\\" #\\"Uncle Slim\\" #\\"Beautiful Boot\\" #\\"Adelaide\\" #\\"Oh My Heart\\" ==References== Category:2007 albums Category:The Autumns albums Category:Bella Union albums ","title":"Fake Noise from a Box of Toys"},{"id":"17322852","text":"A quasi Fermi level (also called imref, which is \\"fermi\\" spelled backwards) is a term used in quantum mechanics and especially in solid state physics for the Fermi level (chemical potential of electrons) that describes the population of electrons separately in the conduction band and valence band, when their populations are displaced from equilibrium. This displacement could be caused by the application of an external voltage, or by exposure to light of energy E>E_g, which alter the populations of electrons in the conduction band and valence band. Since recombination rate (the rate of equilibration between bands) tends to be much slower than the energy relaxation rate within each band, the conduction band and valence band can each have an individual population that is internally in equilibrium, even though the bands are not in equilibrium with respect to exchange of electrons. The displacement from equilibrium is such that the carrier populations can no longer be described by a single Fermi level, however it is possible to describe using concept of separate quasi-Fermi levels for each band. ==Definition== When a semiconductor is in thermal equilibrium, the distribution function of the electrons at the energy level of E is presented by a Fermi‚ÄìDirac distribution function. In this case the Fermi level is defined as the level in which the probability of occupation of electron at that energy is ¬Ω. In thermal equilibrium, there is no need to distinguish between conduction band quasi-Fermi level and valence band quasi-Fermi level as they are simply equal to the Fermi level. When a disturbance from a thermal equilibrium situation occurs, the populations of the electrons in the conduction band and valence band change. If the disturbance is not too great or not changing too quickly, the bands each relax to a state of quasi thermal equilibrium. Because the relaxation time for electrons within the conduction band is much lower than across the band gap, we can consider that the electrons are in thermal equilibrium in the conduction band. This is also applicable for electrons in the valence band (often understood in terms of holes). We can define a quasi Fermi level and quasi temperature due to thermal equilibrium of electrons in conduction band, and quasi Fermi level and quasi temperature for the valence band similarly. We can state the general Fermi function for electrons in conduction band as f_{\\\\rm c}(k,r)\\\\approx f_0(E,E_{\\\\rm Fc},T_{\\\\rm c}) and for electrons in valence band as f_{\\\\rm v}(k,r)\\\\approx f_0(E,E_{\\\\rm Fv},T_{\\\\rm v}) where: *f_0(E,E_{\\\\rm F},T)=\\\\frac{1}{e^{(E-E_{\\\\rm F})/(k_{\\\\rm B}T)}+1} is the Fermi‚ÄìDirac distribution function, *E_{\\\\rm Fc} is the conduction band quasi-Fermi level at location r, *E_{\\\\rm Fv} is the valence band quasi-Fermi level at location r, *T_c is the conduction band temperature, *T_v is the valence band temperature, *f_{\\\\rm c}(k,r) is the probability that a particular conduction-band state, with wavevector k and position r, is occupied by an electron, *f_{\\\\rm v}(k,r) is the probability that a particular valence-band state, with wavevector k and position r, is occupied by an electron (i.e. not occupied by a hole). *E is the energy of the conduction- or valence-band state in question, *k_{\\\\rm B} is Boltzmann's constant. ==p-n junction== As shown in the figure below, the conduction band and valence band in a p-n junction is indicated by blue solid line in the left, and quasi Fermi level is indicated by the red dashed line. When there is no external voltage(bias) applied to a p-n junction, the quasi Fermi levels for electron and holes overlap with one another. As bias increase, the valence band of the p-side gets pulled down, and so did the hole quasi Fermi level. As a result separation of hole and electron quasi Fermi level increased. p-n junction operation in forward bias mode showing reducing depletion width. Both p and n junctions are doped at a 1e15/cm3 doping level, leading to built-in potential of ~0.59 V. Observe the different quasi-fermi levels for conduction band and valence band in n and p regions (red curves). ==Application== This simplification will help us in many areas. For example, we can use the same equation for electron and hole densities used in thermal equilibrium, but substituting the quasi-Fermi levels and temperature. That is, if we let n be the spatial density of conduction band electrons and p be the spatial density of holes in a material, and if the Boltzmann approximation holds, i.e. assuming the electron and hole densities are not too high, then > n=n(E_{\\\\rm F_c}) > p=p(E_{\\\\rm F_v}) where n(E) is the spatial density of conduction band electrons that would be present in thermal equilibrium if the Fermi level were at E, and p(E) is the spatial density of holes that would be present in thermal equilibrium if the Fermi level were at E. A current (due to the combined effects of drift and diffusion) will only appear if there is a variation in the Fermi or quasi Fermi level. The current density for electron flow can be shown to be proportional to the gradient in the electron quasi Fermi level. For if we let \\\\mu be the electron mobility, and E_{F}(\\\\mathbf{r}) be the quasi fermi energy at the spatial point \\\\mathbf{r}, then we have > \\\\mathbf{ J}_n(\\\\mathbf{r})=\\\\mu_nn\\\\cdot ( abla E_{\\\\rm F_c}) Similarly, for holes, we have > \\\\mathbf{ J}_p(\\\\mathbf{r})= \\\\mu_pp\\\\cdot ( abla E_{\\\\rm F_v}) ==Further reading== * Category:Electronic band structures Category:Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics ","title":"Quasi Fermi level"},{"id":"17322894","text":"Institute of Management and Computer Studies (IMCOST) is an Indian business school, in Thane, Maharashtra. ==Parentage== IMCOST is a part of the ASM family.

To be considered a eurytherm, all stages of an organism's life cycle must be considered, including juvenile and larval stages. These wide ranges of tolerable temperatures are directly derived from the tolerance of a given eurythermal organism's proteins. Extreme examples of eurytherms include Tardigrades (Tardigrada), the desert pupfish (Cyprinodon macularis), and green crabs (Carcinus maenas), however, nearly all mammals, including humans, are considered eurytherms. Eurythermy can be an evolutionary advantage: adaptations to cold temperatures, called cold-eurythemy, are seen as essential for the survival of species during ice ages. In addition, the ability to survive in a wide range of temperatures increases a species' ability to inhabit other areas, an advantage for natural selection. Eurythermy is an aspect of thermoregulation in organisms. It is in contrast with the idea of stenothermic organisms, which can only operate within a relatively narrow range of ambient temperatures.Hill R, Wyse G, Anderson A. Animal Physiology. 2004. Sinaur Associates, Inc. Through a wide variety of thermal coping mechanisms, eurythermic organisms can either provide or expel heat for themselves in order to survive in cold or hot, respectively, or otherwise prepare themselves for extreme temperatures. Certain species of eurytherm have been shown to have unique protein synthesis processes that differentiate them from relatively stenothermic, but otherwise similar, species. A boreal forest in Canada. This forest would likely house deciduous conifers. == Examples == * Tardigrades, known for their ability to survive in nearly any environment, are extreme examples of eurytherms. Certain species of tardigrade, including Mi. tardigradum, are able to withstand and survive temperatures ranging from ‚Äì273 ¬∞C (near absolute zero) to 150 ¬∞C in their anhydrobiotic state. * The desert pupfish, a rare bony fish that occupies places like the Colorado River Delta in Baja California, small ponds in Sonora, Mexico, and drainage sites near the Salton Sea in California, can function in waters ranging from 8¬∫ to 42 ¬∞C. * The green crab is a common species of littoral crab with a range that extends from Iceland and Central Norway in the north to South Africa and Victoria, Australia in the south, including more temperate regions like Northwest Africa in between. The green crab has been shown to survive in waters at least as cold as 8 ¬∞C, and at least as warm as 35 ¬∞C. * Boreal deciduous conifers (genus Larix) are the primary plants occupying the boreal forests of Siberia and North America. Although they are conifers, they are deciduous, and therefore lose their needles in Autumn. Species like the black spruce, or tamarack (Larix laricina) occupy wide swaths of land ranging from Indiana in the south, well into the arctic circle in Northern Alaska, Canada, and Siberia in the north. It has been shown that the black spruce can endure temperatures as cold as ‚Äì85¬∞, and at least as warm as 20 ¬∞C. * Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are found at nearly every latitude on earth. They are able to withstand water temperatures ranging from 0¬∞ to 30-35 ¬∞C. Killer whales are deemed a cosmopolitan species, along with the osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). world ocean. == Advantages over Stenotherms == It is thought that adaptations to cold temperatures (cold-eurythermy) in animals, despite the high cost of functional adaptation, has allowed for mobility and agility. This cold eurythermy is also viewed as a near necessity for survival of the evolutionary crises, including ice ages, that occur with relative frequency over the evolutionary timescale. Due to its ability to provide the excess energy and aerobic scope required for endothermy, eurythermy is considered to be the \\"missing link\\" between ectothermy and endothermy. The green crab's success demonstrates one example of eurythermic advantage. Although invasive species are typically considered to be detrimental to the environment in which they are introduced, and even considered to be a leading cause of animal extinctions, the ability of an animal to thrive in various environmental conditions is a form of evolutionary fitness, and therefore is typically a characteristic of successful species. A species' relative eurythermality is one of the main factors in its ability to survive in different conditions. One example of eurythermic advantage can be seen in the failure of many of the world's coral reefs. Most species of coral are considered to be stenothermic. The worldwide increase in oceanic temperatures has caused many coral reefs to begin bleaching and dying because the coral have begun to expel the zooxanthellae algae that live in their tissues and provide them with their food and color. This bleaching has resulted in a 50% mortality rate in observed corals in the waters off of Cape York in Northeastern Australia, and a 12% bleaching rate in observed reefs throughout the world. Although regulators, especially endotherms, expend a significantly higher proportion of energy per unit of mass, the advantages of endothermy, particularly endogenous thermogenesis, have proven significant enough for selection. ==Thermal Coping Mechanisms== The ability to maintain homeostasis at varying temperatures is the most important characteristic in defining an endothermic eurytherm, whereas other, thermoconforming eurytherms like tardigrades are simply able to endure significant shifts in their internal body temperature that occur with ambient temperature changes. Eurythermic animals can be either conformers or regulators, meaning that their internal physiology can either vary with the external environment or maintain consistency regardless of the external environment, respectively. It is important to note that endotherms do not solely rely on internal thermogenesis for all parts of homeostasis or comfort; in fact, in many ways, they are equally as reliant upon behavior to regulate body temperature as ectotherms are. Reptiles are ectotherms, and therefore rely upon positive thermotaxis, basking (heliothermy), burrowing, and crowding with members of their species in order to regulate their body temperature within a narrow range and even to produce fevers to fight infection. Similarly, humans rely upon clothing, housing, air conditioning, and drinking to achieve the same goals, although humans are not considered indicative of endotherms on the whole. The green crab is an exceedingly common species of shore crab. Considered an invasive species, the green crab's ability to function in a wide range of water and air temperatures allows it to vary widely in its range. The sustained supply of oxygen to body tissues determines the body temperature range of an organism. Eurytherms that live in environments with large temperature changes adapt to higher temperatures through a variety of methods. In green crabs, the process of initial warming results in an increase of oxygen consumption and heart rate, accompanied by a decrease in stroke volume and haemolymph oxygen partial pressure. As this warming continues, dissolved oxygen levels decrease below the threshold for full haemocyanin oxygen saturation. This heating then progressively releases haemocyanin-bound oxygen, saving energy in oxygen transport and resulting in an associated leveling off of metabolic rate. Key to maintaining homeostasis, individual thermoregulation is the ability to maintain internal body temperature in humans, the most recognizable eurytherm. In humans, deep-body temperature is regulated by cutaneous blood flow, which maintains this temperature despite changes in the external environment. Homo Sapiens' ability to survive in different ambient temperatures is a key factor in the species success, and one cited reason for why Homo sapiens eventually outcompeted Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis). Humans have two major forms of thermogenesis. The first is shivering, in which a warm-blooded creature produces involuntary contraction of skeletal muscle in order to produce heat. In addition, shivering also signals the body to produce irisin, a hormone that has been shown to convert white fat to brown fat, which is used in non- shivering thermogenesis, the second type of human thermogensis. Non-shivering thermogenesis occurs in the brown fat, which contains the uncoupling protein thermogenin. This protein decreases the proton gradient generated in oxidative phosphorylation during the synthesis of ATP, uncoupling the electron transport in the mitochondrion from the production of chemical energy (ATP). This creation of a gradient across the mitochondrial membrane causes energy to be lost as heat. On the other hand, humans have only one method of cooling themselves, biologically speaking: sweat evaporation. Cutaneous eccrine sweat glands produce sweat, which is made up of mostly water with a small amount of ions. Evaporation of this sweat helps to cool the blood beneath the skin, resulting in a cooling of deep-body temperature. A Tardigrade is able to enter an anhydrobiotic stage, often called a tun, in order to increase the range of temperatures that it can withstand. While some organisms are eurythermic due to their ability to regulate internal body temperature, like humans, others have wildly different methods of extreme temperature tolerance. Tardigrades are able to enter an anhydrobiotic state, often called a tun, in order to both prevent desiccation and endure extreme temperatures. In this state, tardigrades decrease their bodily water to about 1‚Äì3% wt./wt. Although this state allows certain tardigrades to endure temperatures at the extremes of ‚Äì273¬∞ and 150 ¬∞C at the extremes, tardigrades in their hydrated state are able to withstand temperatures as low as ‚Äì196 ¬∞C. This displayed extremotolerance has led scientists to speculate that tardigrades could theoretically survive on Mars, where temperatures regularly fluctuate between ‚Äì123¬∞ and 25 ¬∞C, as well as even possibly the near absolute zero of interplanetary space. The tardigrade's ability to withstand extremely cold temperatures as a tun is a form of cryptobiosis called cryobiosis. Although the high temperature endurance of tardigrades has been significantly less studied, their cryobiotic response to low temperatures has been well-documented. Tardigrades are able to withstand such cold temperatures not by avoiding freezing using antifreeze proteins as a freeze avoidance organism would, but rather by tolerating ice formation in the extracellular body water, activated by ice nucleating proteins. In addition to other organisms, plants (Plantae) can be either stenothermic or eurythermic. Plants inhabiting the boreal and polar climates generally tend to be cold-eurythermic, enduring temperatures as cold as ‚Äì85¬∞, and as warm as at least 20 ¬∞C, such as boreal deciduous conifers. This is in direct contrast to plants that typically inhabit more tropical or montane regions, where plants may have purely tolerable range between only about 10¬∞ and 25 ¬∞C, such as the banyan tree. The common carp (Cyprinus carpio) has shown higher protein synthesis rates at high temperatures. == Eurythermal Protein Adaptation == The tolerance for extreme body temperatures in a given eurythermic organism is largely due to an increased temperature tolerance by the respective organism's homologous proteins. In particular, the proteins of a warm-adapted species may be inherently more eurythermal than a cold-adapted species, with warm-adapted species' proteins withstanding higher temperatures before beginning to denature, therefore avoiding possible cell death. Eurythermal species also have shown adaptations in protein synthesis rates compared to non-eurythermal similar species. Rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) have shown constant protein synthesis rates \\\\left(Q_{10}\\\\right) over temperatures ranging from 5¬∞ to 20 ¬∞C, after acclimating to any temperature in this range for 1 month. In contrast, carp (Cyprinus carpio') have shown significantly higher protein synthesis rates after acclimating to higher water temperatures (25 ¬∞C) than after acclimating to lower water temperatures (10 ¬∞C). This type of experiment is common throughout fish. A similar example is given by the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis), which, when acclimated to temperatures of 26 ¬∞C, produced a significantly higher amount of taurine, glutamate, GABA and glycine compared to acclimation to 12 ¬∞C. This may mean that the aforementioned compounds aid in antioxidant defense, osmoregulatory processes, or energetic purposes at these temperatures. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Animal physiology Category:Ecology ","title":"Eurytherm"},{"id":"17322944","text":"John Stanley Hilliard (b. Hot Springs, Arkansas, 1947- d. Fishersville, Virginia, 11/15/2019) is an American composer. Born into a family of musical amateurs, John Hilliard began his musical training by studying piano at the age of 6 from his cousin, Barbara Dodson, a local piano teacher and composer. His father, Sherlon Hilliard (of Irish and Anglo-Saxon descent), possessed a fine tenor voice and was a popular gospel-style singer with their county Protestant Church of the Nazarene congregations. While his mother, Laurine H. Hilliard (of Scottish descent), was an amateur accordionist and pianist. Hilliard‚Äôs grandfather, John Milton Hilliard, had also been well known as a congregational song leader (shaped-note tradition) for the rural areas of central Arkansas in the 1930s and 1940s. By age 11 Hilliard showed an interest in composing. At the age of 8, he had begun playing trumpet in the elementary band and was taught by the same elementary music teacher as President Bill Clinton, who was a childhood friend. They later both shared another influential music teacher, Virgil Spurlin, during their years together in the Hot Springs High School Band. In 1964 Hilliard played at all-state band under W. Francis McBeth, who would later become his first composition teacher for four years at Ouachita Baptist University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas. Hilliard would earn his Bachelor of Music degree there in 1969 in horn performance, education and theory-composition. He studied piano, horn, trumpet, cello and conducting during these years at Ouachita. Hilliard later, in 1972, received his Masters of Music degree in composition and conducting at Virginia Commonwealth University. During his years at VCU, Hilliard studied briefly with famed African-American composer William Grant Still.Classical Composers Database, birth date and place, family background, early music training Hilliard's music has had performances in Austria, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, South America, the United Kingdom and the United States including performances at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Merkin Concert Hall and at numerous new music festivals. His orchestral works have been performed by the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra and the Richmond Symphony Orchestra. His piano concerto No. 1, \\"Okeanos\\", was premiered in 2000 by pianist Eric Ruple with the James Madison University Wind Symphony at the College Band Directors National Association Conference. Hilliard's second piano concerto was commissioned by the Staunton Music Festival (Virginia) and had its premiere there at the Blackfriars Playhouse in 2004, with the composer conducting. In 2006, the James Madison University Wind Symphony premiered his \\"Variations on a Theme from 'L'oiseau de feu'\\". Hilliard has composed four symphonies; three piano concerti; a trumpet concerto; sonatas for piano, violin, and cello; works for wind ensemble; and various other chamber works, including two song cycles. In 1973 he studied composition with George B. Wilson, University of Michigan at Interlochen. Hilliard received his Doctor of Musical Arts degree from Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. in 1983. From 1981-1985 he did four years post-doctoral composition study at Southern Methodist University with Donald Erb, and one year of study at the University of Texas, Austin with the American expatriate French composer, Eugene Kurtz, of Jobert publications, Paris, France. In 1973, during his years working at the Interlochen Arts Academy, Interlochen, Michigan, Hilliard was encouraged by Thor Johnson, then conductor of the Nashville Symphony, by his requesting him to compose a work for the Interlochen Arts Academy Orchestra. This was Hilliard's \\"The Grand Traverse: Concerto for Trumpet and Orchestra\\", which was premiered at Interlochen's Corson Auditorium by the orchestra in 1975 with Byron Hanson conducting and John Lindenau on solo trumpet. In 1981 Hilliard was awarded a summer residency position and commission from the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts. His first symphony was chosen in an American Orchestra League competition for premiere by Leonard Slatkin for the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra in 1989. Hilliard has won annual ASCAP Awards, a commission from the International Horn Society and the first-place award in the Virginia Music Teachers Association's commissioned composer contest for 1992. President Bill Clinton requested Hilliard to compose a fanfare for his first inauguration in 1993. The Far East and Asian music have had a profound influence upon his life and composing. Hilliard studied and played in Cornell University's Javanese gamelan under the leadership of Jennifer Lindsay. In 1995, Hilliard was given an Artistic Fellow residency grant by the Japan Foundation in Tokyo, studying shakuhachi with Christopher Yohmei Blasdel and gagaku in Nara at the Kasuga Shrine. He resided in Tokyo, Koto-Ku district, Fukagawa area. In 1996 he studied Indian and Balinese music in California.

He was educated in Kent, Abingdon School in Berkshire, from 1885 to 1890, in Rochester and at Tonbridge School, and for one year at Brasenose College in Oxford University. Although he developed an interest in art during a childhood convalescence period, Gilman did not begin his artistic training until after his non-collegiate year at Oxford University (cut short by ill health) and after working in the Ukraine as a tutor to a British family in Odessa (1895). In 1896 he entered the Hastings School of Art to study painting, but in 1897 transferred to the Slade School of Fine Art in London, where he remained from 1897 to 1901, and where he met Spencer Gore. In 1904 he went to Spain and spent over a year studying Spanish masters. Vel√°zquez and Goya as well as Whistler were major early influences. ==Marriage== At this time he met and married the American painter Grace Cornelia Canedy. The couple settled in London (apart from a visit to her family in Chicago, when Gilman ducked pressure to join the Canedy family business). They had two daughters (one born in London, one in Chicago) and one son David born on 20 September 1908, at Letchworth Garden City in Hertfordshire. The family address at this time was 15 Westholm Green, Letchworth. Harold Gilman was married, for the second time, in the late summer of 1917 to (Dorothy) Sylvia Hardy formerly Meyer (1892‚Äì1971)Arts Council 1981, p.38England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1916‚Äì2005; Dorothy S Hardy, Registration Date: Apr/May/Jun 1918, Registration district: Hampstead, County: London Spouse: Harold J W Gilman, Volume :1a, Page Number: 1456, an artist he had met at Westminster and who had studied with him since 1914. ==Painting career== Meeting Walter Sickert in 1907, Gilman became a founder member of both the Fitzroy Street Group (in 1907) and the Camden Town Group (in 1911). In the meantime he joined the Allied Artists' Association, moved to Letchworth, and began to show influence from work of Vuillard as well as Sickert. Harold Gilman painted by Walter Sickert, 1912. In 1910 he was stimulated by the first post- Impressionist exhibition at the Grafton Galleries, and visited Paris with Ginner. He soon outpaced Sickert's understanding of post-Impressionism and moved out from under his shadow, using ever stronger colour, under the influence of Van Gogh, Gauguin and Signac. In 1913 he exhibited jointly with Gore, and became the first president of the London Group, and identified with Charles Ginner as a 'Neo-Realist', exhibiting with Ginner under that label in 1914. Gilman visited Scandinavia in 1912 and 1913, and may have travelled with the artist William Ratcliffe, who had relations there. Gilman made studies of the environment, and painted Canal Bridge, Flekkefjord, an accurate depiction, whose subject is likely to have been inspired by Van Gogh's depiction of a similar bridge in Provence.\\"Canal Bridge, Flekkefjord circa 1913\\", Tate Etc.. Retrieved 15 September 2008. Gilman had rejected Van Gogh's work when he first encountered it, but later became a strong admirer. According to Wyndham Lewis, he kept postcards of Van Gogh's work on his wall and sometimes hung one of his own works next to them, if he was especially satisfied with it. In 1914 he joined Robert Bevan's short-lived Cumberland Market Group, with Charles Ginner and (later) John Nash. In 1915 the group held their only exhibition. He taught at the Westminster School of Art where he influenced students who included Mary Godwin, Ruth Doggett, and Marjorie Sherlock.\\"Pupils and followers\\" in The Camden Town Group, p. 68, at thefineartsociety.com He then started his own school with Ginner. Canal Bridge, Flekkefjord, c. 1913 In 1918 he was commissioned to travel to Nova Scotia by the Canadian War Records; and painted a picture of Halifax Harbour for the War Memorial at Ottawa. He died in London on 12 February 1919, of the Spanish flu. == Legacy == Exhibitions were devoted to him at the Tate in 1954 and 1981, and he also featured in its 2007‚Äì2008 Camden Town Group retrospective at Tate Britain. ==See also== * List of Old Abingdonians ==Gallery== Image:Gilman-Thames-Chelsea.jpgThe Thames at Chelsea, 1899‚Äì1901 Image:Harold Gilman - Clarissa.jpgClarissa, c. 1911 Image:Gilman-Sylvia-Gosse.jpgSylvia Gosse, c. 1913 Image:Gilman-Eating- House.jpgAn Eating House, 1913/14 Image:Gilman-Portrait-in-Profile.jpgA Portrait in Profile: Mary L.

It is situated just south of the A436 two miles east of Stow-on-the-Wold and five miles west of Chipping Norton. The village is on the north bank of the small River Evenlode. This area falls within the Cotswold Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, so designated in 1966. In the medieval period the manor was held by the Hastings family. Until 1931 Daylesford was a detached part of Worcestershire, but in that year it was transferred to Gloucestershire. It was a separate civil parish until 1935, when it was absorbed into the civil parish of Adlestrop.Vision of Britain website ==Daylesford House== In 1788, Daylesford House was acquired by Warren Hastings, Governor-General of India, a descendant of its medieval owners. In the following years, he remodelled the mansion to the designs of Samuel Pepys Cockerell, modelling it on the grand house he had built at Alipore in India. The interior was replete with magnificent classical and Indian decoration (a style later developed successfully at Sezincote House nearby), with much use of silver and crimson. The drawing room and library had furniture made out of ivory brought back from India The gardens were landscaped by John Davenport (fl. 1774). Warren Hastings also rebuilt the Norman Church of St Peter in 1816, where he was buried two years later. The church was again rebuilt to the designs of J. L. Pearson in 1859-63. It is a Grade I Listed Building, having been designated as such on 25 August 1960. During the 20th century, the house and estate were the property of Charles Edward Baring Young, Viscount Rothermere, who restored the house with the help of the interior decorator John Fowler, and Baron Heinrich Thyssen. It is currently the Gloucestershire home of Sir Anthony and Lady Bamford, major shareholders in the JCB excavator company, and significant donors to the Conservative Party. The Earl of Snowdon and his family rent a cottage on the estate. The lakeside gardens with wooded walks and unusual trees and shrubs are occasionally open to the public in the summer months. There is a farm shop on the estate, which sells organic food under the Daylesford Organic brand. ==References== *Nicholas Mander, Country Houses of the Cotswolds (Aurum Press, 2008) ==External links== * 'Parishes: Daylesford', A History of the County of Worcester: volume 3 (1913) British History Online Category:Villages in Gloucestershire Category:Houses in Gloucestershire Category:Cotswold District ","title":"Daylesford, Gloucestershire"},{"id":"17323068","text":"Samuel \\"Sammy\\" Hoi is the current president of Maryland Institute College of Art.

Notable hockey films include Slap Shot; The Mighty Ducks, successful enough to spawn two sequels, a cartoon series, and an NHL team named the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (now the Anaheim Ducks); and Miracle. The first two are fictional comedies; the last is a drama based on the true story of the 1980 \\"Miracle on Ice\\" USA Olympic gold medal team. Other hockey films include Youngblood, Hockey Night, MVP: Most Valuable Primate, H-E Double Hockey Sticks, Mystery, Alaska, The Rocket: The Maurice Richard Story, The Sweater, ' and the 1937 John Wayne film Idol of the Crowds. One of the earliest commercial films that featured the sport prominently was the 1972 Canadian production Face-Off, starring Art Hindle. Many other films are less hockey-oriented but nonetheless prominently involve the sport. Ice Angel involves a male ice hockey player who dies and comes back to life in the body of a female figure skater. Both Happy Gilmore and The Cutting Edge centre around failed hockey players using their talents for other sports (golf and figure skating, respectively), while Wayne's World contains a number of prominent references to the sport during the film. The movie Big Daddy features actor Adam Sandler watching a hockey game involving the New York Rangers. The Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle Sudden Death is set and shot entirely in the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, the (supposed) stage for the seventh game of the NHL Stanley Cup Final. In the movie The Town, bank robber Doug MacRay (played by Ben Affleck) is a former draft pick of the Boston Bruins whose hockey career derails because of his propensity to get into fights with his teammates. In another Boston-based movie, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Eddie (played by Robert Mitchum) is taken to a Boston Bruins game (against the Chicago Black Hawks during the 1972-1973 season at the old Boston Garden) right before he is killed. Upon watching Bruins great Bobby Orr, he states \\"Can you imagine being a kid like that? What is he, 24 or something? Greatest hockey player in the world. Number four ‚Äì Bobby Orr. Geeze, what a future he‚Äôs got, huh?\\" The Canadian buddy cop film Bon Cop, Bad Cop features a by-the-book English Canadian teamed with a rule-bending French Canadian to investigate a series of murders connected to professional hockey. In Quebec, the movie Les Boys is a cult classic for many hockey fans, enough to spawn three sequels. The fourth installment of Les Boys featured \\"Hockey Legends\\" such as Guy Lafleur, Pierre Bouchard, Martin Brodeur, Yvon Lambert and more. Hockey has also been referenced many times in the series of movies known as the View Askew Movies, which were written and directed by Actor/Director/Writer/Hockey Fan, Kevin Smith. His first movie, Clerks, featured a street hockey game played on the roof of a store, however many of the players in the game wore ice hockey jerseys, including jerseys of the New Jersey Devils, Pittsburgh Penguins and the Soviet Union. Mallrats shows the character Brodie (Jason Lee) playing an ice hockey game on the Sega Genesis game console. Chasing Amy includes a scene in which Joey Lauren Adams and Ben Affleck attending a high school ice hockey game. Dogma did not feature ice hockey but included three street hockey playing teenagers as henchmen for a demon. More recent, Smith's film Zack and Miri Make a Porno features a rec league ice hockey scene, several Pittsburgh Penguins references and a scene outside Mellon Arena. In the animated motion picture A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969), Snoopy skates on the ice rink at Rockefeller Center in New York City, fantasizing about scoring the winning goal in the final game of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Ryan O'Neal's character in the international hit 1970 film Love Story (based on the novel of the same name by Erich Segal) was a hockey player for his college. While National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation was not a hockey movie, Chevy Chase's lead character, Clark Griswold, was famous for wearing a light Chicago Blackhawks jersey with \\"Griswold\\" and the numbers \\"00\\" on it during certain scenes. It also plays a part in Disney Channel original movies Go Figure and Genius, and romantic comedy Just Friends. The movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off features Ferris's best friend Cameron wearing a vintage Detroit Red Wings Gordie Howe jersey through most of the movie. In the 1996 cult favorite Swingers, Trent (played by Vince Vaughn) is playing a NHL 93 videogame with his friends and extolling the toughness of Jeremy Roenick (then of the Chicago Blackhawks) and takes delight in bashing Wayne Gretzky (then of the Los Angeles Kings) in the game. In the film, The Love Guru, Mike Myers is hired by the Toronto Maple Leafs as a counsel to their star player. Dwayne Johnson starred in a film, The Tooth Fairy, where he played an ice hockey player forced to moonlight as a tooth fairy. The 2012 film Goon starred Seann William Scott as a bouncer from Boston who becomes an enforcer in a Canadian hockey league. The 2013 Russian film Legend ‚Ññ 17, a biopic of Russian ice hockey legend Valeri Kharlamov from early childhood, rising to the pinnacle of the sport and his untimely death. ==Television== ===United States=== Hockey also frequently shows up in American television, particularly in shows set in the colder regions of the US, such as the Northeast and Midwest. One of the recurring characters on Cheers was Eddie LeBec, a French-Canadian Boston Bruins goalie who married regular character Carla Tortelli. LeBec later was cut from the team and joined a traveling ice show; the character was eventually killed off. One memorable episode of Seinfeld, \\"The Face Painter\\", involves the antics of Elaine's face-painting boyfriend Puddy, a rabid New Jersey Devils fan, and Jerry's stubborn refusal to thank an acquaintance for New York Rangers playoff tickets after the game when he had already thanked him numerous times beforehand. In NYPD Blue, the character of PA Donna Abandando, played by Gail O'Grady and a love interest of Detective Greg Medavoy in season 3, was a noted New York Rangers fan, having previously dated one of the players. Her Rangers pennant famously hung over her desk at the front of the squad room. Many episodes of Home Improvement included references to the Detroit Red Wings and in one episode, Tim and his neighbour Wilson are at a game when Wilson wins the door prize. Many Friends episodes also involve Joey, Chandler, and Ross attending New York Rangers games. While it is true they are Ranger fans, a Detroit Red Wings jersey can also be seen hanging below a goalie mask in Joey and Chandler's apartment in season two. In an episode of The Simpsons, \\"Lisa on Ice\\", Bart is the star of his peewee hockey team, the Mighty Pigs, coached by Chief Wiggum. Lisa is eventually forced to become a goaltender on an opposing team‚Äîthe Kwik-E-Mart Gougers, coached by Apu‚Äîto avoid a failing grade in gym, and she blossoms from a nervous wreck to an intimidating star. Eventually, the two teams play each other. Towards the end of the game, Bart is awarded a penalty shot, but before he shoots, he thinks of all his memories with Lisa. Lisa does this as well, and the two embrace each other. The episode finishes with the two teams tying each other and furious fans destroying the hockey arena. In another episode, Bart answers his teacher's personal ad and uses the picture of hockey great Gordie Howe. The South Park episode \\"Stanley's Cup\\" centres around ice hockey; it features the Detroit Red Wings playing the Colorado Avalanche in Stanley's Cup final, where before third intermission score is 2-2. Then Avalanche team is replaced (on their suggestion) by 2- and 3-year-old kids due to \\"mental hell they had\\" (kids were meant to play with other kids between intermissions and they promised to their friend suffering leukemia that they will win for him). Kids obviously cannot rivalize with professional hockey players and they lose 31-2 and in addition all kids are getting injured due to extremely brutal play from Red Wings including intentional skate kicks and punching. Red Wings are celebrating win and kid with leukemia dies just because they lost match, so he lost with sickness. Also in the episode \\"It's Christmas in Canada\\", when the boys are in Canada, one of the members of the Canadian crowd is an ice hockey player, no doubt a reference to the popularity of the sport in Canada. The FX show Rescue Me, starring Denis Leary, featured hockey games as an integral part of several episodes. Hockey Hall of Famers and former Boston Bruins forwards Cam Neely and Phil Esposito both appeared, with Esposito playing a recurring role. Leary's character plays for the FDNY hockey team. The Fox TV series Bones incorporated ice-hockey into the show by guest-starring none other than Luc Robitaille himself. \\"Lucky Luc\\" appears in a dream that Special Agent Seeley Booth has after being knocked out during a hockey game, and tells Booth to look at what \\"brings the team together.\\" The show, titled \\"Fire in the Ice\\", had several elements of ice hockey, including a firefighters‚Äìfederal agents hockey game, the murder victim a hockey player, and of course, \\"Lucky Luc\\". At the end of one episode of Who's the Boss?, Tony and Angela are at a hockey game. Angela asks Tony what the red circle on the ice is for, and Tony indicates that it is blood (humorously furthering the stereotype of hockey violence). In Scrubs, Dr. Cox frequently wears a Detroit Red Wings jersey while not at the hospital; this is because of John C. McGinley's real-life friendship with Red Wings defenceman Chris Chelios. Joey from Full House also frequently wears Detroit Red Wings jerseys on the show, while his room is also decorated with several pieces of Detroit Red Wings decorations. House M.D. is filled with reference to the sport. In the episode Distractions, the main character is described as not wanting to think of \\"the Flyers sucking\\", the series being set in New Jersey. No More Mr. Nice Guy has a scene in which House and Wilson drink in a bar, with a hockey game on TV in the background. In Painless both the patient and his son are hockey players. At the beginning of the episode Unfaithful a homeless man is offered a New York Rangers sweatshirt to which he jokingly responds \\"Are you crazy? We're here in Jersey\\". The cold opener of the season 8 episode Perils of Paranoia features an attorney knocking down an alibi by demonstrating that the defendant read about a New Jersey Devils game in the paper rather than watching it on TV. The same season has the episode Transplant in which House and Chi Park visit the room of a deceased patient, filled with Devils memorabilia. The patient of the episode Gut Check is a minor league hockey Enforcer. In How I Met Your Mother, hockey is referenced several times to accentuate Robin Scherbatsky's Canadian side. In one episode, Robin goes on a date with Brad at a Canucks-Rangers game. Actor Richard Dean Anderson has incorporated his personal love of hockey into two of his lead characters: the eponymous character in MacGyver, and Stargate SG-1's Jack O'Neill. The Nickelodeon TV show, Big Time Rush, features four hockey players who leave Minnesota to go to L.A to become a pop band. On one episode of Star Trek: Voyager, the character Tom Paris played by Robert Duncan McNeill watches a hockey game on an old black & white TV set his wife replicated. He also had a hockey Holodeck program. The Benders on International Film Channel. ===Canada=== Because of hockey's huge popularity in Canada, it is considered one of the most important elements of Canadian pop culture. Hockey is central in homegrown television and movies such as the CBC Television series Hockey: A People's History and Hockeyville, the Global TV reality show Making The Cut: Last Man Standing, as well as scripted shows like CTV's Power Play (1998‚Äì2000) and Showcase's Rent-a-Goalie (2006‚Äì2008). In the popular Canadian animated series The Raccoons, ice hockey played a big role in the 1981 special 'The Raccoons on Ice'. CBC and its French language division, SRC, have made several entries into the He Shoots, He Scores/Lance et Compte franchise. The original series was filmed in both French and English, while subsequent series and movies have just been in French. The CBC premiered the hockeydrama MVP in January 2008. Long running Canadian comedy series, The Red Green Show, incorporated a hockey reference on each program as Red Green would end each show by saying: \\"Keep your stick on the ice.\\" ===Japan=== The Fuji TV-produced drama Pride (2004) centred on Satonaka Haru, played by Takuya Kimura, whose life revolves around ice hockey and dreams of moving to Canada to play in the NHL. ===United Kingdom=== In the UK there was a Pingu episodes called Pingu Plays Ice Hockey produced in 1989 and features Pingu, Robby, Pongi, and various hockey players. ==Comics== Charles Schulz's character Snoopy is well known for his love of ice hockey. Snoopy's Home Ice (Redwood Empire Ice Arena in Santa Rosa, California) continues to host the annual Snoopy's Senior World Hockey Tournament each year. In the Peanuts comic strip, the gang would play ice hockey during the winter months, usually on outdoor ponds. Snoopy would occasionally join his human friends on the ice (once drawing a two-minute penalty for kissing Lucy on the nose during the face- off). In the off-season, Snoopy would sometimes ‚Äúskate‚Äù barefooted atop his doghouse, wielding his hockey stick, and fantasizing about winning the Stanley Cup. Linus, watching from below, would be the ‚Äúhockey fans‚Äù. In one strip, Linus challenges Snoopy: \\"Prove to me that you're a real hockey player.\\" Snoopy grins, revealing that several of his front teeth have been knocked out. Linus walks away, convinced. In later years, Snoopy would play ice hockey with his bird pal Woodstock and his bird friends, using a frozen birdbath as the skating rink. Youth hockey is celebrated in cartoons and comic strips such as Small Saves. Canadian comic book artist Jeff Lemire created the series Essex County, set in his hometown. The series frequently makes reference to ice hockey and features several characters who play the game. Two major manga series have been published with ice hockey as their central focus: Go!! Southern Ice Hockey Club by K≈çji Kumeta and Go Ahead by Daisuke Higuchi. The webcomic called \\"The Downward Spirals\\" stars a team of anonymous hockey- playing opossums as they compete in the Meadow Hockey League. The webcomic called \\"Check Please!\\" stars former junior figure skating champion Eric \\"Bitty\\" Bittle starting his freshman year playing hockey at the prestigious Samwell University in Samwell, Massachusetts. The comic follows all four of his years at Samwell University and in later comics also features the fictional NHL team the Providence Falconers due to Bitty's romantic relationship with Jack Zimmermann who signs to the team after graduating college. In issue 6 of Wolverine: First Class, Wolverine is shown to be a Calgary Flames fan. ==Music== Among the more famous hockey references in music is \\"The Hockey Song\\" by Canadian folk singer Stompin' Tom Connors. Warren Zevon is known for a hockey song called \\"Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)\\" from his 2002 album My Ride's Here. The song's title is in reference to the commonplace fights that tend to break out between players during games and tells the tale of Buddy, a Canadian farmboy turned hockey goon. \\"The Hockey Theme\\", the long-time theme music of Hockey Night in Canada (now the theme song for the NHL on TSN), has been described as \\"Canada's second national anthem\\". There are several less well-known songs which either directly or indirectly feature hockey references and hockey teams, such as \\"Zamboni\\" (a reference to the machine used to resurface the ice between periods and after games) by the Gear Daddies; \\"Helmethead\\" by Great Big Sea, which details the romantic exploits of an AHL player; and \\"Time to Go\\" by the Dropkick Murphys, which references hockey directly, as well as the colours of Boston's NHL team, the Boston Bruins (black and gold). Instrumental-only songs that have become associated with ice hockey include \\"Nutty\\" by The Ventures, itself likely based on the B. Bumble and the Stingers' earlier, and similar work Nut Rocker, as \\"Nutty\\" was used by television station WSBK-TV for their Boston Bruins telecast theme for over twenty years, and was used later for some years by NESN for their Bruins telecasts, and \\"Brass Bonanza\\", used for the now-defunct Hartford Whalers NHL team's games at the start of a home game. Canadian band The Tragically Hip has a number of songs that with hockey references, including \\"Fifty Mission Cap\\", about former Toronto Maple Leaf Bill Barilko, \\"Fireworks\\", and \\"Lonely End of the Rink\\". Their song \\"Wheat Kings\\" is not about hockey, but the Wheat Kings is the name of a hockey team in Brandon, Manitoba. In addition, \\"Heaven Is a Better Place Today\\" is a tribute to the late hockey player Dan Snyder. The American rock group Five for Fighting's name is a hockey penalty reference chosen by singer John Ondrasik, who is an ice hockey fan. Also, L.A. hardcore band Donnybrook takes its name form a slang term referring to a fight between players during a hockey game. The name of the Boston hardcore band Slapshot is an ice hockey reference, and they have taken this concept further with the album titles Sudden Death Overtime and Greatest Hits, Slashes and Crosschecks. Jerry Only of New Jersey punk band The Misfits is a huge fan of the New York Rangers. His Misfits have recorded the song \\"I Wanna Be a New York Ranger\\". Swedish hardcore band 59 Times the Pain have recorded the song \\"2 Minutes remaining in the 3rd\\" on their album More Out of Today, a song explicitly talking about ice hockey; in their video clip for the song \\"More Out of Today\\", the singer of the band wears a Chicago Blackhawks jersey. Canadian punk rock band Propagandhi have made numerous references to the sport in their lyrics, with ice hockey often being used as a political metaphor. The song \\"Dear Coaches Corner\\" on the album Supporting Caste urges Ron MacLean to offer an alternative political perspective for young hockey fans on Hockey Night in Canada as opposed to the militarism and patriotism encouraged by Don Cherry. Canadian heavy metal band Anvil from Toronto, Ontario recorded the song \\"Blood On The Ice\\" in 1988, which first appeared on their studio 1988 album Pound For Pound and a year later on their live album Past and Present ‚Äì Live in Concert. The song explicitly describes the aggressiveness and power of the game. American power metal band Jag Panzer from Colorado Springs in 2001 recorded a song called \\"We've Got Another Cup Coming\\" in honor of then Stanley Cup winners Colorado Avalanche. The song was a cover of Judas Priest's \\"(You've Got) Another Thing Coming\\" with new lyrics about hockey. Tom Waits, towards the end of his live 1975 album Nighthawks at the Diner, banters with the audience that it is time for him to ‚Äúmake like a hockey player and get the puck outta here‚Äù. The rapper Snoop Dogg, a noted hockey fan, wears jerseys from the AHL's Springfield Indians and the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins on the music video for his 1994 single Gin and Juice. ==See also== * Toronto Maple Leafs in popular culture ==References== ===Sources=== * * * ===Inline=== ==External links== *Slapp Leghorn Hockey School *The Downward Spirals webcomic *Check, Please! webcomic Category:Ice hockey Category:Sport in popular culture Category:Ice hockey mass media ","title":"Ice hockey in popular culture"},{"id":"17323090","text":"Bati√© is a department or commune of Noumbiel Province in southeastern Burkina Faso.

Before the season began, six-time NBA All-Star and center Jermaine O'Neal was acquired to complement Chris Bosh in the frontcourt. 17 games into the season, head coach Sam Mitchell was fired and replaced by Jay Triano. The Raptors went into the All-Star break 13 games under .500, and O'Neal was traded to Miami for Shawn Marion. The Raptors continued to struggle, and were eliminated from the playoff race with seven games of the regular season remaining. ==Roster== ===Roster Notes=== * C Patrick O'Bryant was born and raised in the U.S., but is also a Central African citizen. ==Summary== ===Preseason=== Jermaine O'Neal, six-time NBA All-Star, was acquired from Indiana before the season began Seeking to improve its rebounding and interior defence, Toronto traded T. J. Ford, Radoslav Nesteroviƒá, Maceo Baston, and the draft rights to Roy Hibbert to the Indiana Pacers in return for six-time NBA All-Star Jermaine O'Neal and the draft rights to Nathan Jawai.Sources: Pacers agree to O'Neal-for-Ford swap with Raptors, sports.espn.go.com, accessed 4 August 2008. With Ford gone, virtually all the point guard responsibilities rested on Jos√© Calder√≥n's shoulders, who re-signed to a multi-year contract. The Raptors then signed free agents Hassan Adams, Will Solomon and Jamal Sampson, but Sampson was waived at the end of the pre-season. The Raptors also signed Roko Ukiƒá who was drafted in the 2005 NBA draft, and lost Carlos Delfino and Primo≈æ Brezec to free agency. O'Neal's arrival, however, was dwarfed by the Elton Brand signing pulled off by division rivals Philadelphia. In a pre-season poll, more than half of the general managers predicted the acquisition of Brand to be the most significant one in the league,Schuhmann, John, \\"Raptors' dynamic duo trumps Brand's Philly debut\\", nba.com, 29 October 2008, accessed 31 October 2008. whereas the 30-year-old O'Neal was perceived to be past his prime.Smith, Doug, \\"Hard times made Raptor O'Neal a family man\\", Toronto Star, 29 October 2008. Nevertheless, the prospect of Toronto deploying two proven big men at the post with some of the league's best three-point shooters waiting at the perimeter signalled a change in game plan from the previous campaign. ===Regular season=== The Raptors in a home game against the Houston Rockets The Raptors began their campaign with a 95‚Äì84 road win against Philadelphia. The match featured the new All-Star acquisitions of both teams: O'Neal for the Raptors and Brand for the 76ers. Chris Bosh and O'Neal combined for 44 points and 19 rebounds in the win.Raptors at 76ers Boxscore, nba.com, 29 October 2008, accessed 4 November 2008. The team notched another victory in their second game‚Äîa home fixture against the Golden State Warriors‚Äîthus opening with the same 2‚Äì0 record as the season before. Andrea Bargnani, who had spent the summer buffing up his frame and working on his interior game, chalked up 5 rebounds and 3 blocks in the game that went into overtime.Warriors at Raptors Boxscore, nba.com, 31 October 2008, accessed 4 November 2008. The Raptors then got off to their best start in four seasons when they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the third game,Feschuk, Dave, \\"Perfect Raptors stave off Bucks\\", Toronto Star, 2 November 2008. with Calder√≥n scoring a career-high 25 points in the 91‚Äì87 win.Raptors at Bucks Boxscore, nba.com, 1 November 2008, accessed 4 November 2008. Meanwhile, O'Neal wasted no time in imposing his style on his new team: in the season opener at Philadelphia, he pointed to hecklers in the home crowd after making a dunk;Feschuk, Dave, \\"Raptors' O'Neal silences the hecklers\\", Toronto Star, 30 October 2008. in the team's second game, he blocked a dunk from Golden State's Brandan Wright and thereafter waved a finger, as though to say \\"Don't come back here again.\\"Grange, Michael, \\"Raptors rolling after OT win\\", Globe and Mail, 1 November 2008. However, the Raptors could not keep up their new game plan of solid defence and lost four of their next five games, including a blowout loss to the Atlanta Hawks and another to the Boston Celtics after relinquishing a 17-point lead.Raptors at Celtics Boxscore, nba.com, 10 November 2008, accessed 17 November 2008. While Bosh posted impressive numbers in nearly every game, his teammates were not as consistent. Toronto's depth at the point was soon put to the test when Calder√≥n was injured and unable to play against the rising Miami Heat. Solomon took over the reins with ease in that game and coupled with the Raptors' domination in the frontcourt led by O'Neal, Toronto secured a much needed win.Macleod, Robert, \\"O'Neal leads Raptors' charge\\", Globe and Mail, 16 November 2008. Moon was also dropped to the bench, with Bargnani made the starting small forward. This performance came to naught in the next game against the Orlando Magic, where although Bosh and O'Neal combined for 54 points and 28 boards, the lack of production and defence from the wing, coupled with the inability to protect possession, brought Toronto back to .500.Feschuk, Dave, \\"Giveaways gut Bosh's big night\\", thestar.com, 19 November 2008, accessed 20 November 2008. As though to prove a point, Bargnani and Anthony Parker combined for 44 points the next day in the win against Miami, while the tandem of Bosh and O'Neal secured 28 rebounds.Raptors at Heat Boxscore, nba.com, 19 November 2008, accessed 20 November 2008. This run was not sustained yet again, as Toronto lost a further two games on the trot: an overtime loss to New Jersey and another blowout loss to Boston, where the Raptors set a franchise record for highest field goal percentage (62%) conceded at home.Smith, Doug, \\"Frustrated Bosh fumes after setback\\", thestar.com, 24 November 2008, accessed 25 November 2008. That game also saw Bosh unleash a bout of angry frustration at his team as the Raptors plummeted to the bottom of the division standings. O'Neal was traded for four-time NBA All-Star Marion after the All-Star break On 3 December 2008, with the Raptors posting an 8‚Äì9 record 17 games into the season, Raptors' head coach Sam Mitchell was fired and replaced by longtime assistant Jay Triano on an interim basis.Mitchell Relieved Of Duties, Jay Triano Takes Over On Interim Basis, nba.com/raptors, 3 December 2008, accessed 3 December 2008. Triano‚Äîthe first Canadian head coach in NBA history‚Äîimmediately pointed to Toronto's bottom-of-the-league in fast break points as a major deficiency he wanted to overcome.Becker, Matt, \\"Raptors-Jazz Preview\\", nba.com, 4 December 2008, accessed 6 December 2008. However, the Raptors slipped a further three games to go 8‚Äì12 before it recovered with a two-game turnaround. In those two games, Triano attempted to introduce a new style of play: maximum protection of the paint.Feschuk, Dave, \\"Defence derails Vinsanity\\", thestar.com, 13 December 2008, accessed 14 December 2008. He also brought Kapono and Moon into the starting line-up and this seemed to work for a while before Toronto lost the next five games to go seven under .500, including a loss to the 2‚Äì24 Oklahoma City Thunder.Raps Drop Hard Fought Battle To Spurs, nba.com/raptors, accessed 7 January 2009. Toronto ended up 4‚Äì11 in December under Triano, but got off to a good start in January with wins over Houston and Orlando before going down in a crucial game against Milwaukee.Raptors Win Streak Ends At Two, nba.com/raptors, accessed 7 January 2009. January also saw Bargnani emerging as a legitimate starting center with him averaging over 21 points and 6.6 rebounds over a 16-game stretch and Ukiƒá showing good signs of adaptation to the NBA, but all this was overshadowed by the injuries that O'Neal and Calder√≥n sustained and the resulting mounting losses. Given the Raptors' perpetual inability to win close games and hold on to leads, the team went on a seven-game losing streakSmith, Doug, \\"Two victories this week crucial to Raptors' hopes\\", thestar.com, 28 January 2009, accessed 29 January 2009. before the return of O'Neal and Calder√≥n saw them move to 19‚Äì28. Toronto then went on a six-game losing streak and dropped further down the pecking order with a 21‚Äì34 record going into the All-Star break. With Toronto looking to bring in a wing player and free up the salary space, O'Neal and Moon were traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks on 13 February 2009.Aldridge, David, \\"Raptors trade O'Neal, Moon to Heat for Marion, Banks\\" , nba.com, 13 February 2009, accessed 14 February 2009. Six days later, Solomon was moved in a three-way deal, resulting in Toronto acquiring a big man in centre Patrick O'Bryant from Boston. Pops Mensah-Bonsu and Quincy Douby were also signed on 6 March and 24 March 2009 respectively. Even with the new acquisitions, Toronto continued losing games, one of which was a blowout 97‚Äì127 loss to New York. Combined with a seven-game losing streak leading up to mid-March, this evaporated any hopes of making the playoffs. The only improvement came in the form of more fastbreak points and points scored in the paint, and the team even kickstarted a six-game winning streak in the last week of March, their longest winning streak in seven seasons.Chandler scores 17, Knicks beat Raptors 112-103 , nba.com, 5 April 2009, accessed 11 April 2009. The Raptors were also eliminated from playoffs contention at the same time when the streak ended, with seven games of the regular season to go. They ended the season with a three-game winning streak, an overall record of 33‚Äì49, and were ranked 13th in the Conference.2008‚Äì09 NBA season summary, basketball-reference.com, accessed 16 April 2009. ==Standings== ==Game log== ===Regular season=== - bgcolor=\\"#bbffbb\\"  1  October 29  @ Philadelphia   Chris Bosh (27)  Chris Bosh (11)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (7)  Wachovia Center 15,750  1‚Äì0 - bgcolor=\\"#bbffbb\\"  2  October 31  Golden State   Chris Bosh (31)  Chris Bosh (9)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (13)  Air Canada Centre 19,800  2‚Äì0 - bgcolor=\\"#bbffbb\\"  3  November 1  @ Milwaukee   Jos√© Calder√≥n (25)  Chris Bosh (10)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (9)  Bradley Center 17,036  3‚Äì0 - bgcolor=\\"#ffcccc\\"  4  November 5  Detroit   Chris Bosh (26)  Chris Bosh (13)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (8)  Air Canada Centre 18,602  3‚Äì1 - bgcolor=\\"#ffcccc\\"  5  November 7  @ Atlanta   Chris Bosh (26)  Chris Bosh (8)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (12)  Philips Arena 18,290  3‚Äì2 - bgcolor=\\"#bbffbb\\"  6  November 9  @ Charlotte   Chris Bosh (30)  Chris Bosh (15)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (7)  Time Warner Cable Arena 12,111  4‚Äì2 - bgcolor=\\"#ffcccc\\"  7  November 10  @ Boston   Jermaine O'Neal (23)  Jermaine O'Neal (11)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (10)  TD Banknorth Garden 18,624  4‚Äì3 - bgcolor=\\"#ffcccc\\"  8  November 12  Philadelphia   Chris Bosh (30)  Chris Bosh (12)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (6)  Air Canada Centre 18,093  4‚Äì4 - bgcolor=\\"#bbffbb\\"  9  November 16  Miami   Chris Bosh (27)  Jermaine O'Neal (18)  Will Solomon (11)  Air Canada Centre 19,800  5‚Äì4 - bgcolor=\\"#ffcccc\\"  10  November 18  @ Orlando   Chris Bosh (40)  Chris Bosh (18)  Chris Bosh, Will Solomon (4)  Amway Arena 16,353  5‚Äì5 - bgcolor=\\"#bbffbb\\"  11  November 19  @ Miami   Andrea Bargnani (25)  Jermaine O'Neal (17)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (7)  American Airlines Arena 15,014  6‚Äì5 - bgcolor=\\"#ffcccc\\"  12  November 21  New Jersey   Chris Bosh (42)  Andrea Bargnani (10)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (15)  Air Canada Centre 19,800  6‚Äì6 - bgcolor=\\"#ffcccc\\"  13  November 23  Boston   Chris Bosh (24)  Andrea Bargnani (7)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (9)  Air Canada Centre 19,800  6‚Äì7 - bgcolor=\\"#bbffbb\\"  14  November 26  Charlotte   Chris Bosh (39)  Chris Bosh (11)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (9)  Air Canada Centre 17,414  7‚Äì7 - bgcolor=\\"#bbffbb\\"  15  November 28  Atlanta   Chris Bosh (30)  Chris Bosh (10)  Jos√© Calder√≥n (11)  Air Canada Centre 19,200  8‚Äì7 - bgcolor=\\"#ffcccc\\"  16  November 30  @ L.A.

The cap is cylinder-shaped with a flat top in red colour and the sides are black, and a black tassels often hangs down the back. ==Origins== According to Supiƒçiƒá and Ivanƒçeviƒá the Lika cap is a derivation of the Iapode headgear; During the Bronze Age, the Iapodes used a bronze sheet as the base of their cap, which was lined with textile or leather, and attached with a bronze fringe. Of all short round caps, the Lika cap is the nearest to the caps seen on Illyrian bronze fragments. The Slavic settlers adopted part of native Iapode culture, and part of their dress, such as the cap. ==History== A Licaner with the cap, 19th century. During Habsburg rule over Croatia, the Austrians created buffer territories against the Ottoman Turks called the Croatian Military Frontier. Here they created a military police unit who were called the Seressaner (from the Latin meaning \\"tent dwellers\\"), made up of men from prosperous Lika families. In Kordun, part of the Military Frontier, the Austrian military dress subsequently became part of the folk costume, however, the Lika cap was later adopted instead of the Austrian military cap. The Serbs of White Carniola adopted the cap. The hajduks of Lika are said to have used this cap when fighting the Ottoman Turks. The regional origins of the cap demonstrates its affinity with other Dinaric styles, such as the Montenegrin cap and ≈†ibenik cap. The Coat of arms of Croatia (≈°ahovnica) is often adorned on the cap, while some older versions have repouss√© designs on them. They are now worn mainly at festivals in full costume as well as national dances. ==Traditions== When younger men are buried they wear a red Lika cap, while older men wear a black textile cap. ==See also== *Croatian national costume *Serbian national costume *Flat cap *List of headgear *Cap ==References== ==External links== * Narodne Nosnje Hrvatske; Liƒçka Narodna Nosnja * Najmanja liƒçka kapa Category:Croatian clothing Category:Caps Category:Hats Category:Lika ","title":"Lika cap"},{"id":"17323164","text":"Absouya is a department or commune of Oubritenga Province in western Burkina Faso.

He was the first European artist to paint landscapes of the Americas, during and after the period of Dutch Brazil In 1636 he traveled to Dutch Brazil in northeast of South America at the invitation of the governor Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen. His works were widely collected in The Netherlands, Europe, and Brazil, with the works showing an idealized vision of Dutch colonial rule.Rebecca Parker Briennen, \\"Who Owns Frans Post? Collecting Frans Post's Brazilian Landscapes\\" in Michiel van Groesen, ed. The Legacy of Dutch Brazil. New York: Cambridge University Press 2014, pp. 229‚Äì247. ==Biography== Post was born in Haarlem and was the son of Jan Janszoon Post, a highly regarded glass painter trained in Leiden, and Francijntje Verbraken of Haarlem.RKD entry on Frans Post His elder brother was Pieter Post, one of the most important architects of Dutch classicism.Frans Post biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literaturePaul H. Rem and Frederik J. Duparc. \\"Post\\". In Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online, http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T068936pg2. Little is known of his life before his trip to Brazil. He was born in Haarlem circa 1612 and he most likely received his early training from his father and his elder brother. He was a contemporary of Frans Hals, who painted his portrait, and prominent Haarlem landscape painters such as the brothers Jacob and Salomon van Ruysdael, Adriaen and Isaac van Ostade, and in particular Pieter de Molijn. It is likely that a Dutch master also taught him before he left for Brazil, though he was not registered in the guild until after his return. Although it is not universally accepted, Post scholar Erik Larsen believes De Molijn was the master under whom Post studied, because Molyn is mentioned in Houbraken as the teacher of several other landscape painters, such as Allart van Everdingen.Larsen, Erik. \\"Supplements to the Catalogue of Frans Post\\". In The Burlington Magazine, Volume 124, Number 951. The Burlington Magazine Publications, Ltd., June, 1982. Page 340. View of Pernambuco, Brazil, c. 1637‚Äì44, Museu Nacional de Belas Artes Post won a commission at court likely through the connections of his older brother and was encouraged to travel abroad by John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen. At the time, Haarlem experienced an outbreak of the plague, so that his going to Brazil may have seemed a good option.Briennen, \\"Who Owns Frans Post?\\", p. 229, fn. 2 Post lived in Brazil from 1637 to 1644. He received 800 guilders for a landscape painting in the West Indies commissioned by Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, leading Larsen to believe that Post set out for The Netherlands via Africa shortly before Nassau departed Brazil. After he returned to The Netherlands, he joined the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1646, and was appointed officer in 1656‚Äì7 and 1658.Rem and Duparc In 1650, he married Jannetje Bogaert, the daughter of Professor Salomon Bogaert of the Haarlem ‚ÄòLatijnsche School‚Äô.Sousa-Le√£o, Joaquim de. Frans Post. (Amsterdam: A.L. Van Gendt & Company, 1973), 18. He had two sons, who died before his death and one daughter that did survive him, but died shortly thereafter. Post continued to paint Brazilian scenes until 1669, and the lack of dated paintings in the 1670s suggests he stopped ten years before his death. Whitehead and Boeseman claim that Post developed an alcohol problem, which may be the reason so little is known of the last decade of his life. He died in Haarlem and was buried in the St. Bavochurch on February 17, 1680. ==Work== Post produced approximately 140 paintings during his lifetime. Of these, nearly half are dated, making it possible to track the evolution of his work between 1637, the day he landed in Brazil, and 1669, the date of his last letter. The paintings Post produced while he was in Brazil drastically differ from those he painted after he left Brazil. While he was in Brazil, he produced a large number of sketches and etchings, but only completed six paintings. They are the paintings dated from 1637‚Äì1640, and later presented by Nassau to Louis XIV in 1679. His Brazilian works strongly resemble the landscapes by his Haarlem contemporaries in terms of composition, style, and technique. Wolfgang Stechow describes Post‚Äôs landscapes as ‚Äòthe old bottle filled with new wine‚Äô. These works depict specific locations in Dutch Brazil, identifiable because of the representation of recognizable topography and buildings; most also include water. Post includes a selection of Brazilian vegetation, and occasionally features birds and other small animals in the foreground. These may have been inspired by his traveling companion, the naturalist Georg Marcgraf. The skies are a curious gray, seemingly heavy with rain, an aspect that is emphasized by the fact that they take up at least half the canvas. The subdued color scheme, especially when compared to his post-Brazilian production, lends them a somber almost reverential quality characteristic of Dutch tonal landscapes from the 1620s to the 1640s. ==Brazilian landscapes from Haarlem== View of Pernambuco in 1649, which looks very much like the dunes of Kennemerland Post continued to paint images of Brazil upon his return to The Netherlands in 1642; however, his work undergoes a radical transformation. In addition to Post‚Äôs wonderful imagination, the evolution of his work may also be consequent of a change in popular style. The further he was from Brazil, in both time and space, the more imaginary his paintings became as he incorporated bright colors and exotic elements. Those paintings executed in The Netherlands have brighter colors with dark foliage framing an idealized baroque composition. These works are in striking contrast to the stark, realistic qualities of his early work. The landscapes are open, full of resources, and most important, conquered. They evolve to show a more condensed view and desired depth with greener flora, bluer skies, and brighter horizons. However, the horizontal blues advancing towards the middle distance accentuate the difference in color. This deep blue may be a disintegration of the green pigment, which results from the disappearance of yellows, while the blues remain. Upon Post‚Äôs return to The Netherlands, he also increased the number of figures and incorporated greater diversity into his work. Nearly every painting he completed in The Netherlands includes a large group of people interacting in some way, whether they are dancing or working in the sugar mills. Typically, these figures are slaves.See the articles by Ernst van den Boogaart and by Elmer Kolfin in The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem, ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012. Unlike his Brazilian work, the figures are no longer subjects placed in the foreground; instead, they seem to become part of the landscape. Four of the six paintings completed in Brazil only have a few figures, with the exception of Porto Calvo (1639) depicting more, and The River of S√£o Francisco (1638), which does not have any figures. While Post was in charge of documenting the land, Albert Eckhout, another one of Nassau‚Äôs artists, was in charge of documenting the native people. ==See also== *Albert Eckhout *Dutch Golden Age painting *List of paintings by Frans Post *Gillis Peeters the Elder *Zacharias Wagenaer *Ricardo Brennand Institute ==Further reading== *Brienen, Rebecca Parker, \\"Albert Eckhout and Frans Post: Two Dutch Artists in Colonial Brazil\\" in Edward Sullivan, ed.

Much of the transportation was conducted via waterways; Finland being a country of many lakes. However connecting the waterways system to the coast was problematic. The use of a railway had already been considered in the 1840s; In 1849 Claes Alfred StjernvallYlioppilasmatrikkeli 1640-1852 Claes Alfred Stjernvall www.helsinki.fi had suggested constructing a horse-drawn railway from Helsinki to Turkhauta\\"MIKSI TIKKURILAN ASEMASTA TULI NIIN KOMEA? : HELSINGIN- H√ÑMEENLINNAN RADAN ASEMIEN SYNTY osa I\\", JORMA UIMONEN, Helsingin Pit√§j√§, 1994, 66-79 www.valt.helsinki.fi (in the municipality of Janakkala) ===H√§meenlinna to Helsinki line (1862)=== At that time in its history Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire (see Grand Duchy of Finland) and subject to Russian influence, thus in 1849 Governor General Menshikov ordered the board of transportation (road and waterways) to investigate the construction of a railway connecting Helsinki and H√§meenlinna.A concise history of Finland, D. G. Kirby, p109 Google books The investigations took two years and it was decided use locomotive traction, however construction was delayed due to the Crimean war. The project was restarted in 1856 by Tsar Alexander II's initiative.Rautatie H√§meeseen 'Hameenlinna railway' kirjastohameelinna.fi Some opposed the very idea of the railways, in the Finnish senate responses to the proposed line reflected differing views in Finland at the time towards Finlands relationship with Russia: Finnish nationalists such as Johan Vilhelm Snellman favoured the line since it would aid development in Finland, more pro-Russian figures such as Lars Gabriel von Haartman favoured the idea of a line between Helsinki and St. Petersburg. After discussions it happened that the Helsinki to H√§meenlinna line was the first to be built. The decision to build the line finalised in 1857, the line based on a revised version of the plan made in 1851. Knut Adolf Ludvig Stjernvall was construction manager, and came under criticism for the project cost, resigning in 1861.Stjernvall, Knut Adolf Ludvig www.kansallisbiografia.fi The line was opened in 1862. The track was 96 km long, singled tracked and expected to carry one train a day. For more frequent services passing loops could be used. After Helsinki intermediate stations were found at Pasila, Kerava, Hyvink√§√§ and Riihim√§ki before reaching H√§meenlinna. Following the opening of the first railway line in Finland further lines were built, being constructed on the relative needs of industrial growth, populations, the interests of the Russian empire also being a guiding factor. The construction of early lines was primarily state controlled and financed. ===Riihim√§ki ‚Äì Saint Petersburg Railway (1868‚Äì70)=== A rail link between the capitals of the grand Duchy of Finland and of Russia had been considered for some time; surveys for a railway had been made in 1857, and some time after merchants of Vyborg had proposed to pay for the construction of a link between the Russian capital and Vyborg.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è. 1870 - 1918 –≥–æ–¥—ã.

The main opening ceremony was held in February 1870 when the St. Petersburg‚ÄìVyborg section was complete, at the famous Finlyandsky Rail Terminal; itself being built specifically for the new line.

The first proposals for a line were made in 1863 with local grandees and businessmen supporting the project on the understanding that it would stimulate trade, as well as the wish not to become a backwater compared to other ports that had a rail connection.Porvoo- Kerava-rautatie vuodesta 1874 Porvoo Kerava Railway (1874-) www.helsinkiww.net (information from article by Mikko Alameren in publication \\"Resiina\\" Issue 3/4 (1974) ) However the Finnish state gave priority to lines to Tampere and Lahti. Another attempt to gain funding was made in 1866, but this time the St. Petersburg line was given priorityThe state was unwilling to fund the project, and the St. Petersburg line was paid in part by an alcohol tax, and in part through a lone from Russian state funds.

By 1893 an extension 139 km long from Antrea through Hiitola, Elisenvaara, Jaakkima, and Sortavala was complete. The final part of the line was from Sortavala though Matkaselk√§, V√§rtsil√§, Onkamo and Sulkuniemi to Joensuu was complete in 1894 adding another 133 km. Additionally in 1895 a short 6.75 km line from Imatra via Tainionkoski to Vuoksenniska (both suburbs of Imatra) was added. ===Tampere to Pori line (1895, 1899)=== By 1895 Pori (on the western coast) had been connected to Tampere via Peipohja (near Kokem√§ki). By 1899 a short line from Pori of 20 km was built to the coast at M√§ntyluoto via Yyteri. ===The Rauma Railway (1897, 1914)=== The Rauman railway (Finnish: Rauman rataPieni Tietosanakirja, 4 volumes, 1925-1928, page 1156 \\"Rauman rata\\" \\"The small encyclopedia\\", finnish encyclopedia, web archive, via runeberg.org) was opened in 1897, with a line connecting Peipohja via Kiukainen to Rauma Later in 1914 another line was opened branching west and southward from Kuikainen to Kauttua (in the municipality of Eura).

Additionally a 42 km line northwards from Jyv√§skyl√§ to Suolahti was complete by 1898. ===Hamina railway (1899)=== In 1898 the Hamina railway (Finnish: Haminan Rautatie, Swedish: Fredrikshamns j√§rnv√§g) was founded as a privately funded enterprise; a single 27.5 km line ran to Inkeroinen. The line was opened in 1899 and used two Baldwin 2-6-2T locomotives from the USA. In 1916 the line and company was absorbed into the state railways.J√ÑRNV√ÑGS AB FREDRIKSHAMN Fredicksman railway company www.filatelia.fi ===Finnish coastal railway (1899,1903)=== By 1899 a line from Karis near Helsinki to Turku was constructed roughly following the south- western coast of Finland; this linked with Helsinki by 1903 once a railway between Karis and Pasila had been constructed. The whole line is named Rantarata (Finnish) or Kustbanan (Swedish) meaning \\"coastal railway\\". ===Other lines (1900‚Äì17)=== In 1900 Finland had 3,300 km of railway lines.Rautatieliikenne Rail transport www.compuline.fi The network continued to expand; in addition to extensions to the Savonian line and the completion of the rantarata by extension 83 km from Karjaa to Pasila, the Ostrobothnian line was extended by 1903 131 km from Tuira northwards to Tornio,–ó–ê–ú–ï–¢–ö–ò –û –§–ò–ù–õ–Ø–ù–î–°–ö–ò–•–™ –ñ–ï–õ–ï–ó–ù–´–•–™ –î–û–†–û–ì–ê–•–™, 1914 –≥.

In September he returned to Russia again in another disguise; this time he was more successful: As a consequence of the Russian revolution Finland was able to gain its independence in peace from Russia, and on 6 December 1917 Finland's Declaration of Independence was made. During the Finnish Civil War the rail network was sufficiently well developed to play a significant role in the conflict;Armoured Trains and Railways of Finnish Civil War www.jaegerplatoon.net a train from Russia, the so-called \\"weapons train\\" arrived in January 1918 bringing 15,000 rifles, 30 machine guns, 76mm guns, two armoured cars and ammunition. Much of the fighting took place on or around the railways, or for control of vital railway points. Armoured trains were also used during the war, and were effective. ==Rail transport in the republic of Finland (1919‚Äì95)== ===1919‚Äì39=== Dual gauge bridge connecting Finland and Sweden, built 1919 In 1919 a rail bridge was built across the river Torne between Tornio and Haparanda connecting by rail Finland and Sweden.Valtakunnallisesti merkitt√§v√§t kulttuurihistorialliset ymp√§rist√∂t 1993 -luettelo.

In finnish it is known as the Kolarin rata In 1924 a line from Matkaselk√§ (on the Vyborg‚ÄìJoensuu) line to Suoj√§rvi opened, by 1927 it had been extended to Naistenj√§rvi. Various other lines expanded the network through the 1920s and 1930s including an east‚Äìwest connection of 154 km between Iisalmi and Ylivieska; this connected the Ostrobothnian line on the west coast with the Savonia line in the east of the country. Another important east‚Äìwest connection was made in 1930 with Oulu and Kontiom√§ki being joined by a 166 km railway. Outokumpu was connected in 1928 from Joensuu, and Vuokatti to Nurmes in 1929. A line in Lapland eastward from Rovaniemi to Kemij√§rvi was built in 1934, this was extended further east to Salla in 1942, and Pori connected to Haapam√§ki by a 193 km line in 1938. The 1930s as in other countries were considered the heyday of rail transportVR respects the past in its operations www.vrgroup.fi ===Second World War=== During the Winter War the Finnish forces again used armoured trains. Two trains were fielded, both dating to the World War I era.Finnish Artillery Arm in the Winter War: The armoured trains www.winterwar.com The Armoured Train No.1 (Finnish: Ps.Juna 1 : abbr. from Panssarijuna) was used mostly to support the fighting in the Kollaa River area, found to be effective in supporting infantry. The opposing Soviet forces recognised this and it was repeatedly targeted by artillery and attacked from the air; as a result hiding places had to be found for the armoured train, and modifications made‚Äîsuch as smokestack extension pipes that directed the exhaust smoke under the train, to reduce the risk of it being spotted. More often than not bombardments and aerial attack damaged the track rather than the train directly.Armoured Train 1 in Winter War Part 2.1, Armoured train 1 in the Winter War, jaegerplatoon.net Ps.Juna 2 was used in both the Kollaa River battles and other battles around the Karelian Isthmus. During the interim period before the Continuation War the trains were re-armed with anti-aircraft weapons to counter the constant bombing they had experienced. The Russian forces also used armoured trains, some of which were captured or destroyed.Finnish Armoured Trains 1941 - 1944 Part 3, Interim peace - time of modifications, www.jaegerplatoon.net Armoured Train No.1 became a permanent exhibit at the Finnish Armour Museum (Finnish: Panssarimuseo) in Parola.Panssarimuseo: Perusnayttely Armour museum : permanent exhibits www.panssarimuseo Additionally railway guns were used by both sides, the finns constructed a battery of 152 mm rail mounted artillery pieces from coastal artillery guns,Finnish Artillery Arm in the Winter War: The railway guns www.winterwar.com the Russians had access to far larger pieces of rail mounted artillery including 12\\" guns,LIFE magazine, 11 November 1940 Page 72 (via books.google.co.uk) one of which became known as the \\"ghost gun\\" (Finnish: aavetykki) during its shelling of Vyborg. ===1944‚Äìpresent=== As a result of the unfavourable terms of peace of the Moscow Armistice of September 1944, the Finnish state lost large amounts of land, including parts of Karelia in southeastern Finland; in addition to the ceding of the large town of Vyborg important parts of the rail network were lost including the Saint Petersburg ‚Äì Hiitola railroad and most of the Vyborg‚ÄìJoensuu railroad (Karelian railroad)‚Äîas a consequence a new Karelian line had to be built. ==History of urban railways, trams, metros and mass transit== In 1890 trams started to operate in Helsinki.

The Champions Series consists of tournaments played in select markets where top players of the sport compete in one-night, four-player events with two one-set semifinal matches and a one-set championship match played in one evening. Eligible players competing on the Champions Series have either held a Top 5 singles ranking; been a Grand-Slam singles finalist, or a singles player on a championship Davis Cup team during their ATP tour playing careers. The Champions Series allows one wild card of their choice at each event. The series is produced by Inside Out Sports & Entertainment. The minimum age to participate in a tournament is 30. ==Sponsorship== In October, 2011, PowerShares QQQ signed a multi-year agreement with the Champions Series to become the title sponsor of this national tennis league of erstwhile ATP professionals.http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/powershares-qqq-signs- multi-year-deal-to-become-title-sponsor-of-champions-series-132303038.html A new match format was introduced to complete all play on a single evening, with only four players involved. The new format is two semi-final matches consisting of a best-of-one-tiebreak set, followed by a one-set final for the championship.

The film stars Kate Hudson, Anne Hathaway, Kristen Johnston, Bryan Greenberg, and Candice Bergen. In the film; two childhood best friends, who have made many plans together for their respective weddings, turn into sworn enemies in a race to get married before the other. Bride Wars was theatrically released on January 9, 2009 by 20th Century Fox. The film was panned by the critics but became a box office success grossing $114.7 million on a $30 million budget. A Chinese remake of the same name was released in 2015. ==Plot== Emma Allan and Olivia \\"Liv\\" Lerner are best friends who have planned every detail of their weddings, since first witnessing a wedding 20 years ago at the Plaza Hotel. They both have made it a priority to be married in the same location in June. While hanging out at Liv's place in the present day they find a Tiffany box hidden in the closet. Both friends are excited knowing that Liv will soon get a proposal from her boyfriend. That same night Emma's boyfriend proposes to her. Liv gets restless waiting for her boyfriend to pop the question and eventually confronts him. He replies he was planning on doing it that night but then asks her on the spot. Both girls start planning and are expected to be each other's maid of honor. They schedule a meeting with New York's most famous wedding planner, Marion St. Claire, who tells them there are three spots open in the plaza. Two on the same day and one a few weeks later. They each chose a different day but due to a clerical error they are scheduled to have a wedding on the same day, June 6 (three and a half months later). The two of them ask the 3rd bride, Stacey, to switch her date with Emma but Stacey immediately refuses, resulting in Liv getting in a fight with Stacey while the latter is registering for gifts, for which Liv and Emma are escorted out of the store. A week of passive-aggressive hostility passes before the two women make it clear that neither will compromise, especially after the headstrong Liv hopes that Emma's passive nature would end their wait of who will surrender their date while Emma rejects the suggestion of a double wedding as she wants a day that is all about herself rather than sharing everything with Liv. Emma's fianc√©, Fletcher, begins to show signs of being controlling. The two women declare war after a slight misunderstanding that Liv already set her wedding date, outraging Emma who sets her date as well, which Liv becomes aware of at their shared shower party. The two exchange threats and insults in front of their friends who decide not to take sides. Both women attempt to sabotage each other's wedding, including Liv changing Emma's dance instructor, Emma secretly sending Liv candy to make her too fat to fit into her dress, Liv making Emma's tan turn bright orange, Emma tampering with Liv's hair dye to turn Liv's hair a shocking blue-white color, Liv registering Emma on Babies R Us as pregnant, and Emma showing up to Liv's bachelorette party to out-dance her. Emma and Fletcher get into an argument regarding Emma's maniac behavior of sabotaging Liv's wedding and their friendship, including how Emma has changed since they first met. Emma and Fletcher are shown to undergo strains in their relationship because of Emma's new found opinionated and confident trait, a departure from her usual people-pleasing characteristics. Liv has learned to be more sensitive and expressive, which gives her a sense of relief to finally have the luxury of being able to let go and be less controlling. However, due to her stress about the wedding and strained friendship with Emma, she ends up being demoted at her job as an attorney. Both brides-to-be are shown to be in the Plaza very shortly before they are due to be wed, separately. Right before Liv leaves to begin her march to the altar, she encounters Emma's father and receives his blessing; immediately she regrets setting up a wild spring break DVD to play at Emma's wedding. She sends her assistant Kevin to replace the DVD with the right one, filled with childhood memories. Thinking that the DVD is for a prank, he does not do so. Before the brides enter their respective venues, they share a moment of reconciliation as they both smile at each other. Emma begins her walk down the aisle but stops when the footage of her spring break is shown. She loses her temper and tackles Liv after sprinting to the other section of the Plaza. The two brides wrestle in their dresses on the floor while the people closest to the brides having decided to let the brides resolve the problem. After tussling, Emma and Liv lie on the ground panting, and then make up. Emma stands up and walks over to Fletcher who is upset at Emma's behavior. Emma tells him that she is not the same person he fell in love with ten years ago and that she has now changed, as it has been apparent that she learned to be more assertive. With that, the two tearfully call off their wedding. Liv's wedding resumes with Emma participating and dancing with Nate, Liv's brother and a well known magazine journalist. The movie picks up a year later when Liv and Emma meet up for drinks, where it's revealed that Emma married Nate. Emma and Liv also reveal to each other that they are pregnant and that their due dates are the same, March 3, and both friends get excited. ==Cast== * Kate Hudson as Olivia \\"Liv\\" Lerner, a successful attorney at Ropes & Gray who is used to getting her way, and won't settle for anything else.

It was shown that she is protective and extremely caring of Emma. ** Zoe O'Grady as Young Liv * Anne Hathaway as Emma Allan, a middle school teacher who takes care of everyone, but forgets about having some time for herself due to her sweet but slightly meek nature. Liv remarked that she is the one who always \\"gives in\\" when they both have conflicts with each other. ** Shannon Ferber as Young Emma * Chris Pratt as Fletcher Flemson, Emma's fianc√©. Fletcher is an accountant and the two of them met ten years prior to the film's events. Throughout the film, he is shown to be very controlling, becoming aggravated by Emma's assertive behavior, and begins to have a lot of differences with her. * Steve Howey as Daniel Williams, Liv's fianc√© and a hedge fund manager. Unlike Fletcher and Emma, he became closer with Liv during the wedding planning process and embraced his fianc√©'s changes in her attitude particularly her newly discovered vulnerability. * Bryan Greenberg as Nathan \\"Nate\\" Lerner, Liv's brother who is in love with Emma. * Candice Bergen as Marion St. Claire, New York's most sought-after wedding planner, to whom both girls turn when planning their wedding.

She eventually becomes Emma's maid of honor. She is the one who suggested to Emma that she should fatten Liv with expensive chocolates. * Michael Arden as Kevin, Liv's assistant at work, whom she recruits to be her \\"Mister of Honor.\\" He gave Liv the suggestion that she should mess up with Emma's dance lessons by replacing her instructor with an eccentric one. He is seen getting romantically involved with Amie near the end of the film. * June Diane Raphael as Amanda, a friend of Emma and Liv's who gets married at the start of the film.

Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith also contributed to the screenplay. Some principal photography took place at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts. Most filming occurred in Boston, New York City, and in Salem, Massachusetts. ===Music=== The score to Bride Wars was composed by Edward Shearmur, who recorded his score with a 77-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox. In the beginning of the film, the song \\"Somethin' Special\\" by Colbie Caillat was played, however this version had different lyrics than the Beijing Olympic Mix, suggesting that it was the original mix. As the film did not have a soundtrack, the original version remained unreleased until Caillat's album Breakthrough was released, where the song appears as a bonus track on the Rhapsody edition. There is also the song \\"Dream\\" by Priscilla Ahn. And \\"Scared\\" by Duffy. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== Bride Wars was almost universally panned by critics. The film received an 11% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 144 collected reviews, along with an average rating of 3.35/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Bride Wars takes the already wearisome concept of battling bridezillas, and makes it thoroughly insufferable via a lazy script and wholly detestable characters.\\" Time named it one of the top 10 worst chick flicks. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film \\"dopey if largely painless\\". She said that Hathaway's presence meant \\"that there's a little acting in it, along with a few human emotions\\" and wondered what the film might have been if the writers had explored a potential lesbian subtext suggested by the opening scenes. Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, \\"How bad can a movie be, with Goldilocks Hudson and Cinderella Hathaway? So excruciating that Hudson's sunshine can't warm it and Hathaway's rose redolence can't mask its stink.\\" Ty Burr of The Boston Globe was disturbed by the film, claiming that it was \\"...a chick flick that makes its chick characters ‚Äî and by extension its chick audience ‚Äî look like hateful, backward toddlers, and there is something wrong with that.\\" Longtime BBC Radio 5 Live critic Mark Kermode was notably harsh toward the film on his Kermode and Mayo's Film Review show, going so far as to say that he would quit film criticism if Bride Wars did not end up in his list of 10 worst films of 2009. By the end of the year, even when Kermode included Terminator Salvation and Couples Retreat on his list by popular demand, Bride Wars still finished eighth, allowing him to keep his job. In one of the few positive reviews of the film, Time critic Mary Pols wrote, \\"At least, and this is something to be grateful for, Bride Wars deviates from the usual wedding- flick routine of maids of honor who should be the bride (or groom). And even though the catfighting goes over the top, the notion that a passionate female friendship can turn ugly in a heartbeat is, sadly, realistic.\\" Apart from negative reviews, the film was nominated for 2 awards at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards: Best Fight (Anne Hathaway vs. Kate Hudson) and Anne Hathaway for Best Female Performance. It also had several Teen Choice Award nominations. Candice Bergen was nominated for a Razzie Award as Worst Supporting Actress for her performance in the film. ===Box office performance=== In its opening weekend, the film grossed $21,058,173, ranking at number 2 at the box office. As of May 26, 2009, it has made $58,715,510 in the United States and Canada, $55,982,521 in foreign countries and a total of $115,049,554 worldwide ‚Äî a financial success despite its largely negative reviews. ==Awards== ===Won=== * 2009 - Teen Choice Awards for Choice Comedy Movie Actress (Anne Hathaway) ===Nominated=== * 2009 - Teen Choice Awards for Choice Comedy Movie Actress (Kate Hudson) * 2009 - Teen Choice Awards for Choice Movie Hissy Fit (Kate Hudson) * 2009 - Teen Choice Awards for Choice Movie Rockstar Moment (Anne Hathaway) * 2009 - Teen Choice Awards for Choice Movie Rumble (Anne Hathaway) & (Kate Hudson) * 2009 - MTV Movie Awards for Best Female Performance (Anne Hathaway) * 2009 - MTV Movie Awards for Best Fight (Anne Hathaway) & (Kate Hudson) * 2010 - Razzie Awards for Worst Supporting Actress (Candice Bergen) * 2010 - People's Choice Awards for Favourite Comedy Movie ==References* Category:2000s buddy comedy films Category:2000s female buddy films Category:2009 romantic comedy films Category:2009 films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American buddy comedy films Category:American female buddy films Category:American films Category:American films about revenge Category:American romantic comedy films Category:English- language films Category:Films about weddings Category:Films directed by Gary Winick Category:Films set in Manhattan Category:Films shot in Boston Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Regency Enterprises films Category:2009 comedy films ","title":"Bride Wars"},{"id":"17323433","text":"The Duval County Courthouse is the local courthouse for Duval County, Florida. It houses courtrooms and judges from the Duval County and Fourth Judicial Circuit Courts. The new facility is located Downtown Jacksonville, Florida; it was built starting in 2009 and opened in 2012. Duval County was created on August 12, 1822 and was formerly part of St. Johns County. Although the county's area was huge, it took more than twenty years before the first courthouse was constructed during the 1840s. A second courthouse was constructed in 1886, but was burned in the Great Fire of 1901. The third courthouse was constructed in 1902 and closed in 1958. A new courthouse funded by the Better Jacksonville Plan was planned in 2000, but budget issues and rising costs delayed its construction until 2009. ==Previous courthouses== File:Courthouse1894JAX.jpgSecond courthouse File:duvalctycthse1920.jpgThird courthouse File:Duval Courthouse Jacksonville.jpgFourth courthouse File:Jax FL Duval cty crths01.jpgFifth courthouse ===First=== The first courthouse erected in Duval County was constructed of wood during the 1840s where Forsyth and Market Street intersect. It was burned to the ground during the Civil War. ===Second=== It took another twenty years before it was replaced with a brick building, constructed in 1886, which lasted until the Great Fire of 1901, which destroyed most of downtown Jacksonville. After the fire, the courthouse was one of the first buildings reconstructed, across the street from the old one. The exterior brick walls of the old courthouse remained mostly intact and were utilized in the creation of a new armory building. That structure became part of the Lanier Building, which was demolished in 2003. ===Third=== Rutledge Holmes designed the 1902 courthouse, which had a stone exterior. The architect incorporated up to seven additional floors in the design, but the original building was never expanded. Instead, when additional space was required, an annex was added in 1914, nearly doubling the usable courthouse space. ===Fourth=== An architecturally modern courthouse was constructed on East Bay Street and dedicated in 1958, ten years before consolidation and at a time when the entire county's population was just over 450,000. During that same time, Jacksonville built the Haydon Burns Library, Friendship Fountain, Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum, the current Courthouse Annex and the CSX Transportation Building, making the city, ‚Äúthoroughly modern‚Äù. The 1902 courthouse was demolished; the 1914 annex was preserved and later expanded to include the site of the 1902 courthouse and still functions as a county office building. Luce, Ann (November 12, 2004). Architects seeks to clear the air about courthouse project\\". Jacksonville Business Journal. Retrieved July 13, 2011. ==New courthouse== The 2000 Census counted over three-quarters of a million people in Duval County, an increase of 67% since the prior courthouse opened. The Bay Street facility had been overcrowded for many years and additional space was desperately needed. State law required the local government to construct a new facility. Mayor John Delaney proposed the Better Jacksonville Plan, a $2.25 billion package of projects, including a new courthouse. The referendum on the Better Jacksonville Plan passed on September 5, 2000, and planning for the courthouse commenced. Costs were estimated at $190 million, with another $20 million built into the budget for contingency. Construction was awarded to Cannon Design. In 2003 Delaney left office and was succeeded by John Peyton. Construction continued under Cannon, but budget and size estimates fluctuated. Peyton stopped work on the courthouse complex on October 28, 2004, and fired Cannon and construction managers Skanska Dynamic Partners. At the time, the project had not broken ground, but project design, property acquisition, site work and utility relocation had been completed, at a cost of $64.3 million. Peyton's office cited rising construction costs as part of the reason for the budget deficit.http://origin.firstcoastnews.com/news/local/news- article.aspx?storyid=35492&catid;=3 The newly completed Duval County Courthouse Peyton decided to throw out Cannon's original designs, including completed work, and proposed a new plan. The Jacksonville City Council approved increasing the courthouse budget to $263.5 million in 2006. The project was re-bid, and the team of Perry-McCall Construction and The Auchter Company were initially awarded the contract. When it was discovered that the Auchter Company had financial troubles, the contract was withdrawn. In an attempt to retain the contract, Perry-McCall and Auchter merged to form a new company, but Jacksonville's General Counsel rejected their plan because the new company had not bid on the project.\\"Design firm gets new shot at courthouse\\" Florida Times-Union, July 20, 2007 Second place bidder, Turner Construction Company, which partnered with Technical Construction Services Group and KBJ Architects, was given an opportunity to negotiate a contract with the city in July 2007, by approval of the Competitive Sealed Proposal Evaluation Committee. On November 16, 2007, the Courthouse Architectural Review Committee (CARC) convened to review the new options under consideration by the administration and voted 4-1 to pursue the mayor's recommendation to build one 800,000 square foot facility on the existing LaVilla site using the design from KBJ Architects. Turner Construction was chosen as contractor. Turner Construction is also the company that built VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville. Based on that recommendation and after intensive study, the Jacksonville City Council approved a $350 million county courthouse complex in April, 2008 that was supported by Mayor Peyton and Chief Circuit Judge Donald Moran. The council also agreed that any proceeds from the sale of the current riverfront courthouse and the City Hall annex be used to pay for the increased costs of the new courthouse construction.Kormanik, Beth: \\"Courthouse project approved\\" Florida Times-Union, April 23, 2008 ===Financial history of the new courthouse=== { -  Original 2000 BJP budget  $190,000,000  -  ‚Äúvertical contingency‚Äù  $ 21,000,000  added by John Delaney -  Total BJP funding  $211,000,000 -  ** New Funding **   -  Court Facilities Trust Fund:  $ 811,000  -  Court Documents Facility:  $ 3,397,000  -  Traffic Fine Surcharge:  $ 48,292,000  -  2nd Approved Budget:  $263,500,000  (2004-1339) -  ** AdditionalFunding **   -  COJ Capital Projects:  $ 86,500,000 -  TOTAL BUDGET APPROVED^:  $350,000,000  (2008-1111) } ^$64.3 million already spent to-date for land acquisition, utility relocation and previous design efforts ===Progress=== Construction began in May 2009, with more than 400 workers engaged for over a year.

The league went from 17 teams to 11 before the 1950-1951 season started. Midway through the 1950-1951 season, the Washington Capitols folded as well, bringing the number of teams in the league down to ten. The National Professional Basketball League was formed around the former NBA teams, with teams added in new larger markets. The charter teams were the East Division: Sheboygan Redskins (Former NBA), Anderson Packers (Former NBA), Louisville Alumnites and Grand Rapids Hornets. West Division: Denver Refiners/Evansville Agogans, Saint Paul Lights, Kansas City Hi-Spots and Waterloo Hawks (Former NBA). The Agogans were formerly known as the Denver Refiners and moved to Evansville, Indiana in January 1951, due to the Denver franchise having difficulty in financing the team's long trips to all its eastern and midwestern counterparts. Bill Butterfield, an office supply store manager in Evansville, bought the franchise midway through the season and moved it to Indiana. Butterfield named the new team the Agogans, which meant \\"those with intense interest and excitement.\\" The Agogans roster featured former local high school athletes, including Butterfield's son and other individuals from the local Evansville Bosse High School state championship team. Also on the team were various other players with professional experience. The team finished the last six games of the regular season and were 0-6. Gene Latham Coached the Agogans. The highlight of the short lived team was when the Agogans beat the Harlem Globetrotters 66-59 in 1951. The team and league folded after 1951.

The method divides the interval over which a solution is sought into several smaller intervals, solves an initial value problem in each of the smaller intervals, and imposes additional matching conditions to form a solution on the whole interval. The method constitutes a significant improvement in distribution of nonlinearity and numerical stability over single shooting methods. == Single shooting methods == Shooting methods can be used to solve boundary value problems (BVP) like : y(t) = f(t, y(t), y'(t)), \\\\quad y(t_a) = y_a, \\\\quad y(t_b) = y_b, in which the time points ta and tb are known and we seek :y(t),\\\\quad t \\\\in (t_a,t_b). Single shooting methods proceed as follows. Let y(t; t0, y0) denote the solution of the initial value problem (IVP) : y(t) = f(t, y(t), y'(t)), \\\\quad y(t_0) = y_0, \\\\quad y'(t_0) = p Define the function F(p) as the difference between y(tb; p) and the specified boundary value yb: F(p) = y(tb; p) ‚àí yb. Then for every solution (ya, yb) of the boundary value problem we have ya=y0 while yb corresponds to a root of F. This root can be solved by any root-finding method given that certain method-dependent prerequisites are satisfied. This often will require initial guesses to ya and yb. Typically, analytic root finding is impossible and iterative methods such as Newton's method are used for this task. The application of single shooting for the numerical solution of boundary value problems suffers from several drawbacks. * For a given initial value y0 the solution of the IVP obviously must exist on the interval [ta,tb] so that we can evaluate the function F whose root is sought. For highly nonlinear or unstable ODEs, this requires the initial guess y0 to be extremely close to an actual but unknown solution ya. Initial values that are chosen slightly off the true solution may lead to singularities or breakdown of the ODE solver method. Choosing such solutions is inevitable in an iterative root-finding method, however. * Finite precision numerics may make it impossible at all to find initial values that allow for the solution of the ODE on the whole time interval. * The nonlinearity of the ODE effectively becomes a nonlinearity of F, and requires a root-finding technique capable of solving nonlinear systems. Such methods typically converge slower as nonlinearities become more severe. The boundary value problem solver's performance suffers from this. * Even stable and well-conditioned ODEs may make for unstable and ill-conditioned BVPs. A slight alteration of the initial value guess y0 may generate an extremely large step in the ODEs solution y(tb; ta, y0) and thus in the values of the function F whose root is sought. Non-analytic root-finding methods can seldom cope with this behaviour. == Multiple shooting == A direct multiple shooting method partitions the interval [ta, tb] by introducing additional grid points : t_a = t_0 < t_1 < \\\\cdots < t_N = t_b . The method starts by guessing somehow the values of y at all grid points tk with 0 ‚â§ k ‚â§ N ‚àí 1\\\\. Denote these guesses by yk. Let y(t; tk, yk) denote the solution emanating from the kth grid point, that is, the solution of the initial value problem : y'(t) = f(t, y(t)), \\\\quad y(t_k) = y_k. All these solutions can be pieced together to form a continuous trajectory if the values y match at the grid points. Thus, solutions of the boundary value problem correspond to solutions of the following system of N equations: : \\\\begin{align} & y(t_1; t_0, y_0) = y_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ & y(t_{N-1}; t_{N-2}, y_{N-2}) = y_{N-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & y(t_N; t_{N-1}, y_{N-1}) = y_b. \\\\end{align} The central N‚àí2 equations are the matching conditions, and the first and last equations are the conditions y(ta) = ya and y(tb) = yb from the boundary value problem. The multiple shooting method solves the boundary value problem by solving this system of equations. Typically, a modification of the Newton's method is used for the latter task. === Multiple shooting and parallel-in-time methods === Multiple shooting has been adopted to derive parallel solvers for initial value problems. For example, the Parareal parallel-in-time integration method can be derived as a multiple shooting algorithm with a special approximation of the Jacobian. == References == * .

Typical sensors acquire air pressure, sea surface temperature, irradiance and salinity. A drifter (not to be confused with a float) is an oceanographic device floating on the surface to investigate ocean currents and other parameters like temperature or salinity.\\"What's a drifter?\\" Modern drifters are typically tracked by satellite,Global Drifter Program often GPS. They are sometimes called Lagrangian drifters since the location of the measurements they make moves with the flow. A major user of drifters is the Global Drifter Program. Drifting Buoy (DBi) ==Construction principle== The major components of a drifter include surface floats for buoyancy, underwater drogues to ensure the drifter follows the movements of the water and is unaffected by wind, instruments (e.g., data collecting instruments, transmitters to transmit the collected data, and GPS devices), and waterproof containers for instruments.\\"Drifters\\"\\"Dissect a Drifter\\" Drifters are a technological evolution of ocean current analysis historically performed through drift bottle experiments, which in turn were built on the principle of a message in a bottle. ==Applications== ===Physical oceanography=== Drifters provide real- time information about ocean circulation. They make more accurate and frequent observations of surface current velocity than is possible from remote sensing measurements. A drifter neatly compressed for deployment (left) and with the nylon drogue fully extended (right). ===Biological oceanography=== Drifters are frequently used to collect information on biological oceanography, such as transport of organisms. Lagrangian drifters may be chosen over more Eulerian- type seagliders for biological research when the advective effects, or influence of mixing water, is to be minimized. See Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field. Drifters are meant to follow a water parcel as it moves rather than measuring water properties in a specific area. They are generally sent to depth at a specific isopycnal, or line of constant density, before beginning measurements. This depth is usually below the influence of surface winds and mixing. Drifters are used to show the specific water parcel changed over time while gliders which move independently over the water can give larger spatial context. An example of drifters being used is the North Atlantic Bloom (NAB) experiment looking at physical and biological process in phytoplankton blooms. Dissolved compounds and nutrients, such as O2, NO3, and particulate organic carbon (POC), change within a bloom on various temporal and spatial scales. The drifter measured these compounds, and because drifters are ‚Äúpatch-following‚Äù, the influence of water mixing was minimized. Any changes to these oxygen and nutrient levels can be considered ‚Äòinternal‚Äô to the water parcel and likely a result of processes such as photosynthesis or respiration that occurred within the parcel itself. ==Types== *CODE drifter\\"Nearshore Circulation in the Bering Sea\\" *SVP drifter ==See also== *Ice rafting, another means to investigate ocean circulation *Swallow float *Pearn P.

Hunt during 1810‚Äì1812, he is also the first American to semi-circumnavigate the world traveling by foot from Fort Astoria (now Astoria, Oregon) to St. Petersburg, Russia, to New York City. == Early life == Russel Farnham was born in Massachusetts in 1784 and left home to join one of two expeditions organized by John Jacob Astor to establish the Pacific Fur Company at the mouth of the Columbia River. Farnham, hired as a clerk, was part of the Tonquin party under Captain Jonathan Thorn who were to travel by sea around Cape Horn arriving on the Pacific coast. However, the party soon met with disaster with the death of Thorn and the destruction of their ship soon after their arrival. == Fur trader == In November 1811, he was one of several men who pursued and captured a group of deserters. He also took part in fighting Indians at The Dalles, building a trading post near Spokane and lived among the Flatheads during the winter of 1812-13. According to Washington Irving, Farnham was ordered by Clark to execute a local Indian who had been caught stealing a silver cup from one of the hunting and trapping camps. He hung the Indian from a sapling on June 1, 1813; this incident caused a great deal of hostility between Farnham's party and the local tribes. In the spring of 1814, he was entrusted with ¬£40,000 in sterling bills as well as papers relating the sale of the Astoria trading post to the British North-West Company and ordered by Wilson P. Hunt, commander of the second expedition, to deliver them to John Jacob Astor via St. Petersburg. Farnham traveled on foot crossing the ice sheet across the Bering Straits and into Kamchatka. He suffered from exposure against the severe and inhospitable Siberian climate and, although leaving Astoria with a small backpack of provisions, suffered from malnutrition having been forced to cut and eat the tops of his own boots to survive. However, he was able to make his way to St. Petersburg and, from Paris eventually arrived in New York City. He was the first American to make the journey, John Ledyard having twice failed to do so. Another account claims Farnham left with Hunt on the Pedler and was dropped off on the coast of Kamchatka on April 3, 1814 and, after arriving in St. Petersburg, instead left from Hamburg, Germany, whereupon he arrived to meet Astor in New York.Shambaugh, Benjamin F. Iowa Journal of History and Politics. Vol. XII. Iowa City: State Historical Society of Iowa, 1914. (pg. 542)Smith, Arthur Howden. John Jacob Astor: Landlord of New York. New York: Cosimo, Inc., 2005. (pg. 184) Employed by Astor to oversee the business interests of American Fur Company in the Great Lakes region, he was arrested by the British as a spy during the War of 1812. Transported for trial to Prairie du Chien, several of his friends appealed to British authorities of his innocence and the charges were eventually dropped. He made one of the first trips into the Midwest United States on behalf of the American Fur Company in 1817, and later formed a partnership with George Davenport trading with the Sauk and Fox in the Missouri Valley. During this time he took a wife from the Menominee tribe named Agathe Wood and had a daughter.Bunnell, Lafayette Houghton. Winona and its environs on the Mississippi in ancient and modern days.

That same year, while trading at Fort Armstrong, he and Davenport founded a settlement along the Mississippi River known as Stephenson. Along with the town of Farnhamsburg, the two settlements would eventually become the site of Rock Island, Illinois.

He was known as the Shem Mishmuel by the title of his nine-volume work of Torah and Hasidic thought. He was a leading Hasidic thinker in early 20th-century Europe and a Rebbe to thousands of Hasidim in the Polish cities of Sochaczew (Sochatchov) and ≈Å√≥d≈∫. ==Early life== Shmuel Bornsztain was the only son of Rabbi Avrohom Bornsztain, author of Avnei Nezer and the first Sochatchover Rebbe. He had one younger sister, Esther. Through his father's line, he was a descendant of the Rema and the Shach. His grandfather was Rabbi Ze'ev (Wolf) Nachum Bornsztain, Rav of Biala and a Hasid of the Kotzker Rebbe. His mother, Sara Tzina Morgenstern, was the daughter of the Kotzker Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Morgenstern. Bornsztain was born in the home of his maternal grandfather, the Kotzker Rebbe, in Kotzk during the time that his father was being supported by his father-in-law, as was the custom in those days. He spent his childhood in the towns of Parczew and Kro≈õniewice, where his father held positions as Rav. Rabbi Avrohom Bornsztain was his son's primary Torah teacher throughout his childhood, and a close and long-lasting bond developed between the two. Even later in life, as the father of a large family, Shmuel regarded himself as his father's talmid (student) and learned with him every day. In his writings, Shmuel synthesized the values and insights of Kotzker Hasidut--as taught by his grandfather, the Kotzker Rebbe--and Peshischa Hasidut, synthesizing them into the unique style that became Sochatchover Hasidut. In 1874 Bornsztain married Yuta Leah Litmanowicz, the daughter of Rabbi Eliezer Lipman Litmanowicz, who was the son-in-law of the first Radomsker Rebbe, Rabbi Shlomo Rabinowicz (the Tiferes Shlomo), and a dedicated Kotzker Hasid. Unlike the prevailing custom of moving in with or near his father-in-law, the newlywed Bornsztain chose to live near his father, Rabbi Avrohom, in Kro≈õniewice, and followed him to the towns of Nasielsk and Sochaczew (Sochatchov) when the latter assumed the leadership of those communities. In Sochatchov, Bornsztain and his family lived in a separate house in the center of the city and earned a living from a wine store run by an associate. Bornsztain and his wife had two sons, Dovid and Chanoch Henoch. In 1891, Rabbi Avrohom sent his son to Palestine to purchase land for a Hasidic colony. However, the Turkish ban on selling land to foreigners prevented him from accomplishing this goal. Bornsztain's wife died on 24 November 1901 (13 Kislev 5662). He remarried to Mirel Shapiro, daughter of Rabbi Moshe Nathan Kahana-Shapiro, Rav of Kshoynz, in 1903. ==As Rebbe== Shmuel Bornsztain was crowned second Sochatchover Rebbe following the death of his father in 1910. He was accepted by all the elder Hasidim of his father's court, including Rabbi Yoav Yehoshua of Kinczek and Rabbi Yitzchak Feigenbaum, the av beit din of Warsaw. On his father's first yahrzeit, Bornsztain established Yeshivat Beit Avrohom in Sochaczew and appointed Rabbi Aryeh Tzvi Frumer, av beit din of Kozieg≈Çowy, as rosh yeshiva. This yeshiva taught hundreds of boys and operated until the outbreak of World War I. Bornsztain also labored over the compilation and publication of his father's manuscripts. He published his father's voluminous responsa on every section of Shulchan Aruch in seven volumes, under the title Avnei Nezer (\\"Stones of the Crown\\"). In his own lessons and writings, Bornsztain was seen as less of an innovator than an interpreter of his father's teachings. ==World War I== At the outbreak of World War I, Bornsztain was visiting a spa in Germany and was arrested as a Russian citizen. Only after much effort did he succeed in returning to Poland with other Rebbes who had been similarly detained. Due to persecution of Jews by the Tsarist government, he could not return to Sochaczew, but resettled in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ with his family. Here he acted as a guide and advisor to his own Hasidim as well as Hasidim of other dynasties and non-Hasidim seeking encouragement and support. In 1915, the town of Sochaczew was overrun and destroyed by the German army. In 1919, Bornsztain chose to leave the tumult of the big city, which was taking its toll on his health as well as his ability to concentrate on his holy work, and relocated to Zgierz, a small town near ≈Å√≥d≈∫ . Here he established his yeshiva and led his Hasidic court. His health worsened in 1926 and, upon the advice of his doctors, he moved to Otwock, a resort near Warsaw. There he died at the age of 70 on 8 January. He was brought to burial in the same ohel (covered grave) as his father, the Avnei Nezer, in Sochaczew.Gulden, Yisrael.

These operations were conducted in 1936‚Äì1939, when operations were undertaken against followers of the Pashtun nationalist Mirzali Khan, also known by the British as the \\"Faqir of Ipi\\", a religious and political agitator who was spreading anti-British sentiment in the region and undermining the prestige of the Indian government in Waziristan at the time. ==Background== August 1938, Waziristan. Razani Military Camp. Taken from the Razmak side In 1919‚Äì1920, the British had fought a campaign against the Wazir tribes. Minor skirmishes had continued into 1921, but after the establishment of a permanent garrison at Razmak there had been a period of relative peace in the region.Barthorp, p. 158. Throughout 1921‚Äì1924 the British undertook a road construction effort in the region that led to further conflict during the 1921‚Äì1924 campaign.Beattie, Chapter 7 In 1936, trouble again flared up in Waziristan in the form of a political and religious agitation by Mirzali Khan. For some time, there had been growing unrest in the region, fueled by a perception of a weakening of British resolve to govern following a number of constitutional changes in India; however, following a trial of a Muslim student on a charge of abducting a Hindu girl, Mirzali Khan began spreading anti-British sentiment in earnest, claiming that the government was interfering in a religious matter.Wilkinson-Latham, p. 28. ==Operations== Souvenir presented by British Officers depicting Tribal Marksman in an ambush against invading British Indian Forces. In late November 1936, in order to reassert the perception of control over the region, with the approval of the Tori Khel maliks, the government of India decided to move troops through the Khaisora Valley. This would be achieved by marching a column from the garrison at Razmak to the east, to join up at the village of Bichhe Kashkai with a column from the Bannu Brigade, which would advance from the south from Mirali.Barthorp, p. 170. By this stage of British rule in India there were strict rules governing such expeditions on the North West Frontier, and as the purpose of the expedition was only as a demonstration to the tribesmen of government resolve, the decision was made that no offensive action was to be taken unless troops were fired upon. The Razmak column,Consisting of the 1st Northamptonshire Regiment, 5th/12th Frontier Force Regiment, 6th/13th Frontier Force Rifles, 1st/9th Gurkhas and three mountain batteries known as Razcol, began the march without incident, but after three days came under fire while traversing a narrow valley about short of Bichhe Kashkai. Intense fighting ensued as the column had to fight its way through to the village, while the two Indian battalions that made up Tocol from Mirali ran into even tougher opposition and were delayed until the following day. The supply situation was desperate and casualties numbered around 100, so it was decided to withdraw both columns back to Mirali. This was achieved, but the picquets and rearguard were heavily engaged on numerous occasions before they arrived.Barthorp, p. 171. An RAF Hawker Hart and an Indian Army Crossley armoured car, c. late 1930s The outcome of the expedition was the reverse of the desired outcome, as, instead of demonstrating government resolve and strength, it had in fact highlighted their weakness and Mirzali Khan's support rose dramatically. For the next year, trouble and insurrection spread throughout Waziristan, as Wazirs, Mahsuds, Bettanis, and even Afghans from across the border rallied to support the Mirzali Khan's cause.Barthorp, p. 172 By April 1937, four extra brigades had been brought in to reinforce the garrisons at Razmak, Bannu and Wanna and at the height of the campaign in 1937, some 60,000 regular and irregular troops were employed by the British in an effort to bring to battle an estimated 4,000 hostile tribesmen. While the British attempted to stamp out the insurrection by drawing the tribesmen into decisive engagement, Mirzali Khan remained at large (and indeed was never caught), and on the main, the tribesmen managed to avoid being drawn into battle using guerrilla tactics of ambush in order to keep the initiative. In doing so, they inflicted considerable casualties upon the British and Indian troops. An example of this occurred in April 1937, when a convoy from Wanna was ambushed in the Shahur Tangi defile. Using captured mountain guns and modern rifles, the vehicles were destroyed and the exits blocked, and in the ensuing battle seven officers and 45 men were killed, while another 47 were wounded.Barthorp, p. 173. The tribesmen did not have everything their way, however, as the British began quartering the troubled areas and destroying hostile villages with both airBritish airpower was again to prove a decisive asset in this campaign, as the use of aerial reconnaissance and close air support at the tactical level was refined and put to great effect.

By December 1937, the Mirzali Khan's support began to wane and following this, the decision was made to withdraw most of the additional brigades that had been brought up to bolster the garrisons at Razmak, Bannu and Wanna as it was decided that their presence would only serve to inflame the situation.Barthorp, p. 175. Trouble flared up again in 1938‚Äì39, although to a much lesser extent. On 23 July 1938, a tribal force launched an attack on the town of Bannu, killing up to 200 civilians and damaging a considerable amount of property.Wilkinson-Latham, p. 29. As a result of this, British prestige was again weakened and support for Mirzali Khan grew once again. ==Aftermath== After 1939, the North West Frontier quieted down, and remained reasonably peaceful. Apart from the occasional raid on a village or attack on a garrison, things would remain this way until the end of British rule in 1947. ==See also== * No. 31 Squadron RAF * Waziristan campaign (1919‚Äì20) * North-West Frontier ‚Äì Geography, economy, political situation, etc. * North-West Frontier (military history) ==Notes== ==References== * Barthorp, Michael.

The Trio consists of two perpendicularly arranged skyscrapers, the Florida Life Building and the Bisbee Building, plus a third structure, the Old Florida National Bank (or Marble Bank), which is framed by the other two in a unique pattern. The three buildings, constructed in the wake of the Great Fire of 1901, are architecturally significant, but are currently endangered.http://www.jaxhistory.org/endangered-properties/ ==Structures== ===Old Florida National Bank=== The Old Florida National Bank, also known as the Marble Bank The oldest of the three, the Old Florida National Bank, also known as the Marble Bank, sits on the corner of Forsyth and Laura Streets. It was originally built as the Mercantile Exchange Bank in 1902, just after the Great Fire of 1901 had destroyed nearly all of downtown Jacksonville. Architect Edward H. Glidden designed it in the Classical Revival style. In 1905 it was bought by Florida Bank & Trust, predecessors to the modern Florida National Bank, who renovated and expanded it. It was renovated again in 1916 to include a large banking room with a skylight, plaster detailing, and a coffered ceiling. Another refurbishing in the 1950s added dropped ceilings that covered the skylight and detail work; these were removed in 1976 by the building's then owners, the Jacksonville National Bank, who undertook a substantial restoration to its original appearance. By the 1990s, however, the building had been sold, and its subsequent owners allowed it to deteriorate dramatically. ===Bisbee Building=== The Bisbee Building The second of the three buildings to be built, the Bisbee Building was constructed between 1908 and 1909, adjacent to the Marble Bank on Forsyth Street. It was designed by prominent Jacksonville architect Henry J. Klutho in a Chicago School-influenced Prairie Style. It was constructed amid a race against two other ten-story projects, 121 Atlantic Place and the Seminole Hotel, to build Jacksonville's first ever skyscraper. The Bisbee won the race, but 121 Atlantic Place was slightly taller, making it Florida's tallest building at the time. The Bisbee Building was the first reinforced concrete highrise anywhere in the Southern United States, and was originally designed to be only 26 feet wide, about half its present width, but demand for office space in the trendy new edifice led the owner to have Klutho add on. As with the other buildings, the Bisbee Building was eventually left empty and rapidly deteriorated. ===Florida Life Building=== The Florida Life Building (background) The Florida Life Building was also designed by Klutho, between 1911 and 1912. It stands next to the Marble Bank's back wall, and is the only one of the Trio that actually faces Laura Street. It was constructed at the same time as Klutho's St. James Building (now Jacksonville City Hall). Standing 45 meters and 11 floors high, it was Jacksonville's ‚Äì and Florida's ‚Äì tallest building when it was built, though it was superseded less than a year later by the Heard National Bank Building. Still, Wayne Wood of the Jacksonville Historic Landmarks Commission writes that with its narrow and well-proportioned tower, the building \\"was and perhaps still is Jacksonville's purest statement of a 'skyscraper.'\\" Like the Bisbee Buildings, it is an example of Klutho's Chicago-influenced Prairie Style. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed the Florida Life Building on its list of Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places.Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places The building was constructed for the Florida Life Insurance Company, but the firm folded in 1915, and the structure changed hands a number of times over the years. In 1994, its then owners, Nations Bank, removed the original capitals on the top floor, doing structural damage in the process. Like the other buildings, the Florida Life building fell into disrepair. ==Restoration plans== In the 2000s the Laura Street Trio were recognized as some of Jacksonville's most significant ‚Äì and endangered ‚Äì historic buildings. In 2002, under Mayor John Delaney, the City of Jacksonville purchased all three buildings to transfer them to a developer who could restore them. Orlando developer Cameron Kuhn purchased the Laura Street Trio, as well as the nearby Barnett National Bank Building, but went bankrupt in the 2008 housing market crash before restoring them. The project subsequently sat idle. In 2010 Jacksonville investment group Atkins Group, together with the Tallahassee- based Capital City Partners, presented a new, $70 million plan to restore the Laura Street Trio and the Barnett National Bank Building, as well as construct a fifth building. In June 2011 Atkins Group requested $5 million in historic tax credits to move forward with Phase I of the project. The Trio is currently being renovated into a Courtyard Marriot Hotel. ==Gallery== File:Bisbee1910s.jpgBisbee building in 1910s File:LauraStreetTriominusFLB.jpgFlorida National Bank and Bisbee Building in 1910.

It was built in 1909 as the headquarters for the Atlantic National Bank, and is located at 121 West Forsyth Street. It was the tallest building in Jacksonville and in Florida from 1909 to 1912, and remains an office building today. ==History== The building was designed by New York City architects Mowbray and Uffinger and built between 1908 and 1909 by the James Stewart Company for the Atlantic National Bank. The steel frame structure stands at 10 stories and high, and includes a white Sylacauga marble covering on the bottom two floors and white terra cotta on the upper eight. The facade includes ornate detailing, two-story columns around the entrance, and other decorative elements. The building was constructed amid a three-way race with the Bisbee Building and the Seminole Hotel to become Jacksonville's first skyscraper. All three buildings were located on Forsyth Street within a block of each other, and all three were ten stories tall. The Atlantic National Bank Building broke ground in August 1908, shortly after the Bisbee Building but before the Seminole Hotel. The Bisbee opened just before the Atlantic National Bank Building the following year, winning the race. However, at 41 meters the Atlantic Bank Building was taller than the others, making it the tallest building in Jacksonville and the tallest in Florida at the time. It held that position until the Florida Life Building was completed in 1912. The Atlantic National Bank, founded by Edward W. Lane, Thomas P. Denham, and Fred W. Hoyt in 1903, relocated its bank room from the nearby Dyal-Upchurch Building to the new headquarters. In 1926 the bank opened the Atlantic National Bank Annex directly behind the Bank Building on West Adams Street. This building, now known as the Schultz Building, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. In 1985 Atlantic National Bank merged with First Union, which was in turn acquired by Wachovia (and subsequently Wells Fargo). The Atlantic National Bank Building changed hands over the years, becoming known as 121 Atlantic Place, but is still in use as an office building. It was renovated in the 2000s, with a five-story addition added to the west. One unique feature of the structure is its pedestrian tunnel connecting to the BB&T; Bank Building, the only such tunnel in Downtown Jacksonville still in use. This tunnel, originally created to facilitate secure travel between buildings, has been home to a small restaurant, Benny's, since 1985. ==See also== *Architecture of Jacksonville ==References== Category:Office buildings completed in 1909 Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Jacksonville, Florida Category:Downtown Jacksonville Category:Northbank, Jacksonville Category:Laura Street Category:1909 establishments in Florida Category:Bank buildings in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"121 Atlantic Place"},{"id":"17324073","text":"Vincent Stewart, codenamed Redneck and later Skybolt is a fictional mutant character in the Marvel Comics Universe. ==Publication history== His first appearance was in New X-Men #126 by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely. ==Fictional character biography== Vincent Stewart, the young mutant called Redneck, was a student of the Xavier Institute. He came from a large family in Arkansas, experienced first-hand violence against mutants and became friends with fellow student Radian. Redneck was ready to fight Cassandra Nova as she made her second assault. Instead, Redneck became mentally controlled by Nova and was forced to fight the X-Men on her behalf. Redneck and the other students were freed soon after by the Stepford Cuckoos. Sometime after, Redneck joined Quentin Quire, also known as Kid Omega, and his group. This small team of mutants was dubbed the Omega Gang. As the Omega Gang later attacked a small group of humans to avenge the mutant fashion designer Jumbo Carnation, Redneck used his powers to burn one of the humans. When Kid Omega and his gang started a riot at the Xavier Institute, Redneck was stopped by Cyclops, whose optic blasts broke his nose. As his punishment for his involvement in the riot, Redneck was sent to a prison run by humans. As informed by Wolverine, once his sentence would be up, he would be sent overseas to do charity work. He was later questioned about the drug Kick by Bishop. Redneck lost his mutant powers after the event called M-Day. He would later be offered membership in the newest incarnation of the New Warriors.

The LDS Church, which issued manifestos in 1890 and 1904 to terminate the practice of plural marriage, does not accept the 1886 revelation as authentic.In an ‚ÄúOfficial Statement‚Äù from the First Presidency of the LDS Church, signed by Heber J. Grant, A.W. Ivins and J. Reuben Clark, Jr., it states: ‚ÄúIt is alleged that on September 26-27, 1886, President John Taylor received a revelation from the Lord, the purported text is given in publications circulated apparently by or at the instance of this organization (Fundamentalists). As to this pretended revelation it should be said that the archives of the Church contain no such a revelation; the archives contain no record of any such a revelation, nor any evidence justifying a belief that any such a revelation was ever given. From the personal knowledge of some of us, from the uniform and common recollection of the presiding quorums of the Church, from the absence in the Church archives of any evidence whatsoever justifying any belief that such a revelation was given, we are justified in affirming that no such a revelation exists.‚Äù Others have questioned whether the revelation, if authentic, even refers to plural marriage or its continuance. In 1911, John W. Taylor, Taylor's son and an apostle claimed that he had discovered the revelation among his father's papers after his death in 1887. Unfortunately, his was a copy written in his own hand.Questions concerning the 1886 revelation , mormonfundamentalism.com, accessed 2008-05-22. Photographs of the original document exist,http://www.artbulla.com/images/1886.jpg but the document itself is not extant. Examinations of the photographs have suggested that the document is in John Taylor's handwriting. In 1912, Lorin C. Woolley, a Mormon fundamentalist leader, published a claim that five copies of the revelation had been made and entrusted to LDS Church apostle George Q. Cannon (and four other men who were not LDS Church officials) with the intent of preserving it for posterity. The text of the revelation is as follows: ::1886 Revelation ::Given to President John Taylor September 27, 1886 ::My son John, you have asked me concerning the New and Everlasting Covenant how far it is binding upon my people. ::Thus saith the Lord: All commandments that I give must be obeyed by those calling themselves by my name unless they are revoked by me or by my authority, and how can I revoke an everlasting covenant, for I the Lord am everlasting and my everlasting covenants cannot be abrogated nor done away with, but they stand forever. ::Have I not given my word in great plainness on this subject? Yet have not great numbers of my people been negligent in the observance of my law and the keeping of my commandments, and yet have I borne with them these many years; and this because of their weakness‚Äîbecause of the perilous times, and furthermore, it is more pleasing to me that men should use their free agency in regard to these matters. Nevertheless, I the Lord do not change and my word and my covenants and my law do not, and as I have heretofore said by my servant Joseph: All those who would enter into my glory must and shall obey my law. And have I not commanded men that if they were Abraham‚Äôs seed and would enter into my glory, they must do the works of Abraham. I have not revoked this law, nor will I, for it is everlasting, and those who will enter into my glory must obey the conditions thereof; even so, Amen.1886 Revelation , fldstruth.com, accessed 2008-05-09. ==See Also== * List of non-canonical revelations in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ==References== Category:Mormon fundamentalism Category:History of the Latter Day Saint movement Revelation, 1886 Revelation Category:19th-century Mormonism Category:Works about polygamy in Mormonism Category:Revelation ","title":"1886 Revelation"},{"id":"17324174","text":"The Nordische Gesellschaft (\\"Nordic Society\\") was an association founded in 1921, with the objective of strengthening German-Nordic cultural and political cooperation. It was based in L√ºbeck, Germany. The association had both German and Scandinavian members. After the National Socialist takeover of Germany in 1933, the Nordische Gesellschaft came under the control of Alfred Rosenberg. A new board was formed. Rosenberg's ambition was that the organization could be utilized for the National Socialist cause. Heinrich Himmler became a member of the board. As of 1940, the association had 40 local branches in different parts of Germany. The association published a notable amount of books and brochures which were distributed in Scandinavia. During the Second World War, it ran two publications, Pressedienst Nord and Der Norden, directed towards influencing the political debate in the Scandinavian countries towards a pro- German position. ==Der Norden== Der Norden ('The North') was the flagship of the publishing activities of Nordische Gesellschaft. Initially known as Der Nordische Aufseher, it got the name Der Norden in 1935. It dealt mainly with Nordic issues and actively tried to foster a concept of a common Baltic Sea historical and cultural heritage, based on the legacy of the Hanseatic league. The publication presented the Hanseatic period as a golden era of the region. Several Scandinavian writers had their articles published in Der Norden. Der Norden had a monthly edition of around 6-7000. It is assumed that the last issue was published in October 1944. ==Pressedienst Nord== Pressedienst Nord ('Press Service North') was published weekly. In the summer of 1940 it had an edition of 3000 weekly. Its edition gradually increased until the spring of 1941. From that point until February 1945, its edition was 10 000 weekly. Its articles were mainly in German language but some were in Scandinavian languages, especially in Norwegian. The articles dealt mainly with Nordic issues. The publishing house did a conscious effort to include Scandinavian writers, such as Knut Hamsun, Erling Bj√∏rnson and Karl Olivecrona. The publication was rather thin, and printed on cheap paper. Images were rare, and generally limited to political caricatures. ==Wirtschaftswart Nord== A third publication issued by the association, with much smaller edition, was Wirtschaftswart Nord ('Economy Warden North'). The publication was dedicated to economics, and was not used for political purposes like the other two main publications of the association. ==Brochures== A sizeable amount of brochures were published by the association; most of them were part of the series Ver√∂ffentlichungen der Nordische Gesellschaft zum Zeitgeschehen. One brochure in the series England oder Deutschland? ('England or Germany?'), written by Karl Olivecrona, had an edition of 80 000. Published in 1941, was a translation from its Swedish original, England eller Tyskland?. ==Cultural branch== A special 'cultural branch' was set up under the leadership of Dr. Heinrich Jessen, to facilitate contacts with the cultural and academic sphere in the Scandinavian countries. The cultural branch arranged yearly summer congresses in L√ºbeck, Reichstagung zur Sommersonnenwende. ==Activities in Sweden== The cultural branch worked actively throughout the war years to foster contacts with Swedish academics and artists. This work was often done in close cooperation with the cultural section of the German diplomatic representation in Stockholm. The activities included study visits, lectures and concerts in Germany and tours of German scholars and artists in Sweden. The branch also maintained correspondence with a large number of Swedish individual scholars, painters, musicians and artists. The branch sent large amounts of pro-German literature to these people, whom in turn distributed this literature amongst friends and colleagues. According to a Swedish state survey conducted directly after the war, the work of Nordische Gesellschaft played an important role in the German cultural propaganda work during the war. ==Activities in Norway== Johan Bojer and Barbra Ring played key roles in the Norwegian activities of Nordische Gesellschaft during the 1930s. Other important individuals in the networks of the association were Ronald Fangen, Tore √òrjas√¶ter and Mikkjel F√∏nhus. During the first six months of the German occupation of Norway, the organization was very active in trying to utilize the bonds forged with Norwegian writers during the 1930s. This endeavour was however largely unsuccessful. The most prominent writer who retained contacts with the association was √Ösmund Sveen. Vidkun Quisling's Nasjonal Samling party never had any formal contacts with Nordische Gesellschaft. ==Other organizations== Nordische Gesellschaft was however not the sole organization dedicated to Nordic-German cultural exchange at the time. It faced competition from the Hamburg-based Deutsch-Nordische Gesellschaft and, to a lesser extent, Kulturabteilung des Ausw√§rtigen Amtes in Berlin. ==References== ==External links== * Category:History of L√ºbeck Category:Nazi culture Category:Publishing companies of Germany Category:Sweden in World War II Category:Mass media in L√ºbeck Category:Pan-Germanism Category:Organizations established in 1921 Category:1921 establishments in Germany ","title":"Nordische Gesellschaft"},{"id":"17324177","text":"Sead Kajtaz (born 14 February 1963) is a Bosnian retired footballer and manager.

In Copenhagen he founded Teologisk Oratorium as a religious society for theological students of the University of Copenhagen, which would combine a common liturgical life with mutual pastoral care and studying. The circle of founding brothers included Regin Prenter, Richard Fangel, and Dag Monrad M√∏ller. In 1936 Viggo Lissner, a parish priest, formed the initial \\"priest group\\" of the Oratory, so that student members could continue in Theologisk Oratorium after their graduation. ==Organisation and leadership== The Oratory is divided into regional conventions, which meet twice a year. The General Convention is held annually in June. The organisation of the Theologisk Oratorium is simple; there is no corporate Chapter, but only a Leader of the Brotherhood, and local superiors of the regional conventions. Its Leader since 1999 has been Steen Skovsgaard, formerly the Bishop of Lolland‚ÄìFalster. ==Common life== The daily office, private confession, the Eucharist, and reading of theology are important parts of the common life of the members. The Oratorium has published many books, on subjects including the daily offices and gregorian chant.

Travelers' Insurance Company, 113 U.S. 316 (1885), was a case where after close of testimony in a trial, the defendant moved to dismiss on the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain a verdict. This motion was denied and the plaintiff asked that the case be submitted to the jury to determine the facts on the evidence. The court refused this, and plaintiff excepted. The court then ordered a verdict for plaintiff, subject to its opinion, whether the facts proved were sufficient to render defendant liable to plaintiff on the cause of action stated. Plaintiff moved for judgment on the verdict, and defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings and minutes of trial. Judgment was rendered for defendant upon an opinion of the court as to the effect of the evidence and as to the law on the facts as deduced from it by the court. Held that the plaintiff was thereby deprived of his constitutional right to a trial by jury, which he had not waived, and to which he was entitled.. ==Background== The case was an action brought by the plaintiff in error to recover upon a policy of insurance issued by the defendant, whereby it insured William Edward Parker Baylis, the father of the plaintiff, in the sum of $10,000, owed the plaintiff in case said assured should accidentally sustain bodily injuries which should produce death within ninety days. The complaint alleged that the assured \\"on or about the 20th day of November 1872, did sustain bodily injuries accidentally, to-wit, in that wholly by accident he took certain drugs and medicines, which, as taken by him, were poisonous and deadly, when, in fact he intended to take wholly a different thing and in a different manner, and that, in consequence of said accident solely, said assured died on said 20th day of November 1872.\\" An issue was made by a denial in the answer of this allegation, so far as it alleged that the poisonous and deadly drugs were taken \\"accidentally, or by accident, or with the intent, or under the circumstances stated or mentioned in the complaint\\" to commit suicide. ==Opinion== Justice Matthews delivered the opinion of the Court. He recited the facts and then continued: In this particular, the court thought error was well assigned. The right of trial by jury in the courts of the United States is expressly secured by the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Congress has, by statute, provided for the trial of issues of fact in civil cases by the court without the intervention of a jury, only when the parties waive their right to a jury by a stipulation in writing.

Dibba attended the Gambian Methodist high school and was an exceptionally bright student ‚Äî the first Gambian to earn three A-levels. He won a scholarship to University College, Cardiff, in the late 1960s, \\"at a time when Neil Kinnock was president of the students' union\\", as Kaye Whiteman notes.Kaye Whiteman, \\"Ebou Dibba\\" (obituary), The Guardian, 3 April 2001. Dibba studied French classical literature, and took a year out teaching English in Toulon, France, before graduating with a B.A. in French Literature. He earned his M.A. from King's College London, and subsequently worked as a teacher as a teacher at an adult education centre in Muswell Hill, north London, in the early 1970s, and at a drug clinic, as well as helping at a youth club in Kilburn. In 1974 he moved to the adult education center at Bletchingley, Surrey, initially to teach modern languages and organise classes for the disadvantaged; then from 1975 he served as the centre's director for much of the next two decades, during which period he also wrote two novels, published in the 1980s. Engaging wholeheartedly with the home counties community, \\"he saw his role as that of a missionary for African culture\\" and seemed to take it as a personal blow when the job came to an end in 1993. That same year, Dibba was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). Dibba moved on to a life nearby Edenbridge, Kent, but died in 2000, aged 57. ==Writing== Dibba was the first Gambian author to have used the Gambian setting in his writing. Cherno Omar Barry, \\"Tribute to the late Ebou Dibba\\", 24 January 2005. His literary career was marked by the publication in 1980 by Longmans of his 40-page novella for young adults, Olu and the Smugglers. His first novel, Chaff on the Wind, was published in 1986. Set in the Gambia in the 1930s, as World War 2 approaches, it has been called \\"a tenderly written portrait of a time and a place hardly ever represented in African literature\\".Stewart Brown, Writers From Africa, London: Book Trust, 1989, p. 18.

They lived in the Hanse district of Hamburg, Germany on the estuary of the Elbe River in Schleswig-Holstein, about northwest of Berlin. Meyer graduated from the local Hochschule (technical school) city as a civil engineer specializing in hydraulics and survey work; and he became an employee of the Water Works Department of Hamburg. He left behind a sister named Bertha and two half brothers. Because of an argument with his stepmother, he intended to join the California Gold Rush in 1848, but was delayed on a stopover in Sydney, Australia, and again in Tahiti. He landed at the port of Lahaina on the island of Maui in the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 20, 1850 on the British Brigantine Cheerful, along with three others: Theodore Christopher Heuch, age 20, a German carpenter, Fredrich Sockyer, age 25 a British grazier and also Edmund Sockyer, age 34, a British grazier. Rudolph Meyer listed his occupation as a surveyor. Meyer spoke German, French, and English and soon wrote and spoke the Hawaiian language. He found his way to the island of Molokai instead of continuing to California. On Molokai he met Reverend Harvey Rexford Hitchcock, who accepted him as a house guest at his missionary station known as Kalua'aha on the east coast of Molokai. While living with Reverend Hitchcock he met High Chiefess Kalama Waha (1832‚Äì1899). She was a student of the Hitchcocks at the time. Kalama's father was Apahu Waha and her mother was Akela Hu'a. She was named after Kalama-A-Kuakini, an alii (member of the royal family) from Maui related to High Chief Kalanimoku. Kalama also had a sister, Maraea Apahu and two brothers, one named William and the other, Ka-Waha O Kalola. The two boys were interested in Christianity and became missionaries and went to Tahiti as young men to do missionary work. Meyer married Kalama Waha on March 20, 1851 when she was 18 years old. As a foreigner marrying a citizen of the kingdom of Hawaii, Meyer was required to post a $1000 bond before he could obtain permission to marry Kalama Dorcas Waha. He also became a citizen of the kingdom on July 21, 1851. Meyer and Kalama lived for a while with the Hitchcocks where they had their first child, Emma Amalia (Meyer) Duncan (November 20, 1851 ‚Äì August 5, 1932), and then they moved to another location in Kaluaaha. Sometime later he moved his family to Honolulu where he worked for Austin and Becker at an office located on Maunakea Street. ==The family business== Three-roller sugar mill Meyer returned to Molokai in 1853 to establish a family homestead in the remote north central area known as Kalae which means \\"the clearness\\" in the Hawaiian language. In 1866 he became the surveyor for the island, with the titles Commissioner of Fences and Road Supervisor. About this time, the Kalaupapa peninsula just to the north of the Meyer homestead and below a steep cliff, was converted into a leper colony. He acted as supply agent to the colony, and liaison to the few healthy people willing to work there, such as Father Damien (1840‚Äì1889). Meyer and his sons established and grew a business. Crops included corn, wheat, Brynn, and beans as well as traditional Hawaiian taro. After the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 removed tariffs on sugar exports to the United States, he operated a sugar mill from 1876 to 1889. Since he did not have the large cash investments of planters on other islands, only about of sugarcane were cultivated, and the mill was built with older 1850s technology. The mill used animal power instead of steam. About of sugar were produced a year. He was the first on Molokai to grow and mill sugar and coffee commercially and he exported these to Honolulu and California. King Kamehameha V hired the family to manage a vast ranch on the western end of the island called Molokai Ranch. He operated a dairy which produced butter sold locally and sent to California. ==Legacy== The Meyers had six sons and five daughters. The oldest son Otto Samuel Meyer was born on March 2, 1854, and married Maggie Ann McCorriston in December 1889. He served as accountant of the business, took over leadership after his father died in 1897, and died February 26, 1931. His sixth child, daughter Bertha Amalia Meyer was born December 9, 1860 and died young May 7, 1866. His tenth child, also named Bertha Amalia, was born June 20, 1868, married Authur Aubrey, and died April 15, 1965. His third daughter Hannah Julia Meyer (1866‚Äì1912), married another Harvey Rexford Hitchcock (1864‚Äì1931) who was son of Edward Griffin Hitchcock (1837‚Äì1898), who in turn was son of the original missionary Harvey Rexford Hitchcock (1800‚Äì1855). They named their son (Meyer's grandson) Harvey Rexford Hitchcock, Jr. His sugar mill has been restored into a museum, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hawaii as site 79000762 on September 4, 1979. It is the only 19th century sugar mill in Hawaii with its original processing equipment in place. It is located on Hawaii Route 470, at . In the 1999 film Molokai: The Story of Father Damien, the role of Meyer was played by Kris Kristofferson. A nearby reservoir at is called Meyer Lake after the family. The Meyer estate still owns land on the island, although some has been converted into a forest reserve after litigation. ==See also== * Sugar plantations in Hawaii * Coffee production in Hawaii * Hawaii Hitchcock family tree ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * * Category:1826 births Category:1897 deaths Category:German surveyors Category:People from Hawaii Category:Superintendents of Kalaupapa Category:German emigrants to the Hawaiian Kingdom ","title":"Rudolph Wilhelm Meyer"},{"id":"17324598","text":"\\"Note on Commercial Theatre\\" is a poem by Langston Hughes written in 1940 and republished in 2008. == Background and analysis == Langston Hughes was a prominent writer during the Harlem Renaissance, which is obvious in most of his poetry. Hughes writes about the issues of the day, and \\"Note on Commercial Theatre\\" is no different. === Roots vs. novelty === During the Harlem Renaissance, one of the main controversies was that African American culture became the \\"vogue\\" of the day. This included interest not only in black writing and art, but in the rising jazz and theatre scenes as well. Harlem became the hot spot for this new black culture; both black and whites explored and became immersed in it. Because it was so popular, many white people attempted to infuse their own art with the new African American styles, resulting in hybrid music and theatre (for example, a swing version of The Mikado, a comic opera). Hughes was a huge proponent of creating a separate black identity and art, hence the extreme antipathy within \\"Note on Commercial Theatre\\" to black culture being absorbed by whites. This is reflected in his use of an experimental form for his poem; there is a lack of rhyme scheme and no discernible rhythm to the lines. Other black writers of the time, such as Countee Cullen, experimented within specific forms, but Hughes rejects form in this poem; he rejects the absorption into any other style but his own. === Dependence vs. independence === This vogue of African American culture became a controversy because not only was it becoming meshed with white culture in a time when the Pan-African movement was strong and blacks were trying to create a separate identity, but \\"Note on Commercial Theatre\\" also shows an anxiety over the dependence of black culture on white patronage. It was hard for African Americans to become published or find an audience outside of Harlem without going through white publishing houses. The final lines of the poem reflect the idea that for a truly African American culture to persist, it would have to be founded from within its own community: > But someday somebody'll Stand up and talk about me, And write about me- > Black and beautiful- And sing about me, And put on plays about me! I reckon > it'll be Me myself! Yes, it'll be me. == Sources == * https://web.archive.org/web/20080513083425/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566483/Harlem_Renaissance.html * Harlem renaissance#An Explosion of Culture in Harlem * Huggins, Nathan Irvin.
