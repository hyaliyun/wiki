She was the first woman and transgender person to compete in the NA LCS, debuting in the 2016 Spring Split as the support for Renegades. However, she took a sudden hiatus from professional play a few weeks into her debut season due to on- stage pressure and online harassment. During her career she was particularly known for her mastery of the champion Thresh, which earned her the nicknames \\"Madwife\\" and \\"Thresh Queen\\". == Early life == Creveling was born and raised in Portland, Maine. Prior to League of Legends, she was an avid player of Age of Mythology and GunZ: The Duel. == Career == Creveling joined her first semi- professional League of Legends team in July 2013, when she was scouted and signed by Curse Academy. She initially adopted the in-game name Yuno and, after leaving Curse Academy, played as a support for several other teams attempting to qualify for the NA CS, the NA LCS' secondary league. In March 2015 she joined Misfits NA's inaugural roster and changed her in-game name to Remilia, after the Touhou Project character Remilia Scarlet. Creveling finally qualified for the NA CS on June 16, 2015, after she and her teammates defeated Magnetic at the 2015 NA CS Summer Qualifier. Misfits NA rebranded to Renegades shortly afterwards, and the team went on to defeat Team Coast in the 2015 NA CS Summer Finals, qualifying for the 2016 NA LCS Spring Split. Following Renegades' promotion, Creveling once again changed her in-game name, adopting the shortened alias of Remi. On January 16, 2016, she debuted as the NA LCS' first female player, as well as its first transgender player. However, she abruptly stepped down from the starting roster after playing a third of the season's games, citing on-stage pressure and online harassment. Two years later, she clarified her reasons for leaving in a series of tweets, revealing that a botched sex reassignment surgery had left her with severe and permanent nerve damage to her pelvic area, which caused her to suffer excruciating pain while playing onstage. After an eight-month hiatus from professional play, Creveling joined Latin American team Kaos Latin Gamers under the in-game name Sakuya, and played for the team from October 2016 to January 2017. Following her departure from Kaos Latin Gamers, she shifted her focus to streaming full- time, but also played for a few amateur teams in the United States before her sudden passing in late 2019. == Death == Creveling died in her sleep on December 27, 2019, at the age of 24. == Notes == == References == == External links == * Category:1995 births Category:2019 deaths Category:League of Legends support players Category:Renegades (esports) players Category:Team Dragon Knights players Category:American esports players Category:Women esports players Category:Transgender and transsexual sportspeople Category:Transgender and transsexual women Category:LGBT people from Maine Category:LGBT esports players Category:LGBT sportspeople from the United States Category:Sportspeople from Portland, Maine ","title":"Remilia"},{"id":"61712935","text":"Kalshali () is a rural locality (a selo) in Karamaly-Gubeyevsky Selsoviet, Tuymazinsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

He initially rose to fame as the producer of the 2013 Rocko single, \\"U.O.E.N.O.\\", which peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. He has since shifted into a career as a solo recording artist with his debut mixtape, Woo$ah, being released in 2017 by Empire Distribution. A single off that project (\\"Supply Luh\\") was produced by J. Cole and was featured on an episode of the HBO series, Insecure. In September 2019, he released his debut studio album, Dirt Road Diamond. Childish Major transitioned to becoming a standalone rapper around 2015, before he released his debut studio album, Woo$Ah, in 2017. He is closely affiliated with Atlanta-Baltimore music collective Spillage Village and American record label Dreamville Records, both of which house frequent collaborators JID and EarthGang. Major is an independent artist, releasing music under his own record label Humility City Records. ==Early life== Markus Randle was born on July 4, 1991 in Minnesota. He was raised in Edgefield, South Carolina. He grew up as part of a musical family and his mother would sing in his grandfather's church. His father was also a rapper and producer. Randle began producing beats in middle school using a program called FL Studios. He continued making beats into high school and college, eventually dropping out of college to focus on music production. ==Career== Childish Major moved from South Carolina to Atlanta, Georgia in 2011 to pursue a career as a record producer. Early on in his time in Atlanta, he worked with acts like Two-9, Rome Fortune, and Spillage Village. Major was also friends with Atlanta-based producer, DJ Spinz, who signed him to his DJ and artist collective, Hood Rich. Hood Rich helped him get his first placement providing the production work for the Rocko song, \\"U.O.E.N.O.\\", in 2013. The song featured Future and Rick Ross and peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. Various remixes of the song were released with a range of artists providing additional verses, including Kendrick Lamar, ASAP Rocky, 2 Chainz, Wiz Khalifa, Trinidad James, and others. Major also produced songs by Young Jeezy (\\"Talk That\\") and Juicy J (\\"Ain't No Coming Down\\") among others in 2013. In 2014, Major began releasing collaborative tracks with rapper Matik Estrada, including \\"Family Matters.\\" This would culminate in the release of their joint EP, Community Service, in March 2015. That collection featured the song \\"Keep Running\\" with a guest appearance from Big K.R.I.T. During this time, Major also provided production work for artists like SZA (\\"Green Mile\\"), Big K.R.I.T. (\\"Wolf on Wall Street\\"), EarthGang (\\"Wednesday\\", \\"Thursday\\"), and others. In July 2016, Major commemorated his 25th birthday with the release of the song \\"Happy Birthday\\" featuring Isaiah Rashad and SZA. He later co- produced the title track off of J. Cole's album, 4 Your Eyez Only, which was released in December 2016. In July 2017, Major released the single, \\"Woo$ah\\", and followed that with another single, \\"Supply Luh\\", in September. The latter song was produced by J. Cole and was featured on a season 2 episode of the HBO series, Insecure. Those two songs (along with \\"Happy Birthday\\") were featured on Childish Major's debut mixtape, Woo$ah, released in December 2017 by EMPIRE. In addition to Isaiah Rashad and SZA, the project featured guest appearances from 6lack, DRAM, and Hero the Band. In 2018, Major appeared on select dates for Big K.R.I.T.'s \\"Heavy is the Crown\\" tour and Billie Eilish's \\"1 By 1\\" tour. In August of that year, Major released the single, \\"Know Nothing\\", which would be featured on the third season of Insecure. In December 2018, he released the song, \\"Shine\\". In January 2019, he was one of numerous artists to attend the studio sessions for the compilation album, Revenge of the Dreamers III, which was released in July 2019 by Dreamville Records. The following month, Major began appearing as part of Reebok's \\"Alter the Icons\\" advertising campaign, a role he continues to have as of August 2019. Beginning in February 2019, Major began releasing several songs, including \\"Naan\\", \\"Diet\\", \\"Good Luh\\" (featuring Kota the Friend), and \\"Framed Checks\\", among others. In August 2019, Major released three singles, \\"For You\\", \\"Feelings Hurt\\", and \\"No Sweat\\" (featuring Ludacris). Those songs served as the lead singles for his studio album, Dirt Road Diamond, which was released on September 5, 2019. In addition to Ludacris, the album featured guest appearances from Olu (of EarthGang), Tish Hyman, and Buddy. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" + List of studio albums with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:20em\\" Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" Dirt Road Diamond  * Released: September 5, 2019 * Label: EMPIRE, Humility City * Formats: Digital download - } ===Mixtapes=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  + List of mixtapes with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:20em\\" Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" Woo$ah  * Released: December 15, 2017 * Label: EMPIRE, Humility City * Formats: Digital download - } ===EPs=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  + List of EPs with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:20em\\" Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" Community Service (with Matik Estrada)  * Released: March 15, 2015 * Label: Independent * Formats: Digital download } ===Singles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of singles as a lead artist with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Album - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Family Matters\\"  2015  Community Service - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Happy Birthday\\"  2016  rowspan=\\"3\\" Woo$ah - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Woo$ah\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2017 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Supply Luh\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Know Nothing\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2018  rowspan=\\"4\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Shine\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Naan\\"  rowspan=\\"5\\" 2019 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Diet\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"For You\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" Dirt Road Diamond - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Feelings Hurt\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"No Sweat\\" (feat.

The character is a member of \\"The Loser's Club\\" and is seen to be the comic relief of the group; however, his loudmouthed antics often get him in trouble, leading to him being called \\"Richie 'Trashmouth' Tozier\\" and his friends often using the phrase \\"Beep Beep Richie\\" when they want him to be quiet. He was portrayed by Seth Green as a child and Harry Anderson as an adult in the 1990 miniseries adaptation of the novel, and by Ankur Javeri as a child and Nasirr Khan as an adult in the novel's 1998 television series adaptation. He was later portrayed by Finn Wolfhard as a child and Bill Hader as an adult in the 2017 remake and its 2019 sequel. ==Fictional character biography== Richard (Richie) Tozier was born on March 7, 1946 (novel), 1950 (miniseries), or 1976 (films) and is the son of Maggie and Wentworth Tozier. Richie is known for his loudmouthed and sarcastic personality, which led to him being called \\"Richie 'Trashmouth' Tozier\\" by his peers. Richie is good friends with Bill Denbrough and the other members of The Losers Club Stanley Uris, Eddie Kaspbrak, Ben Hanscom, Beverly Marsh, and Mike Hanlon. After Bill's younger brother Georgie is killed by Pennywise the Dancing Clown, Richie and his friends each have individual encounters with Pennywise before facing It collectively at Neibolt Street. After this encounter, they believe they have killed It, but they take an oath that if they have not succeeded, they will one day return to Derry to finish the job. 27 years later, Richie is a disc-jockey in Beverly Hills and one of the only members of The Losers Club to have never married. Richie receives a call from Mike ‚Äì who remained behind in Derry ‚Äì that It has returned, causing the death of Adrian Mellon. Richie returns to Derry and reunites with The Losers Club, with whom he encounters It once again. Eventually, the group descends into the sewers to kill It by performing the Ritual of Chud. During the ritual, It mortally wounds and kills Eddie, leaving Richie devastated. ==Adaptations== Richie was portrayed by Seth Green as a child, and by Harry Anderson as an adult in the 1990 miniseries, and by Ankur Javeri as a child and Nasir Khan as an adult (named \\"Raja\\") in the 1998 television series. The adult portrayal is well known for a scene where Pennywise taunts him in a public library, which has become iconic for Tim Curry's over-the-top performance. Richie was portrayed again by Finn Wolfhard in the 2017 remake and as an adult by Bill Hader in the 2019 sequel. This interpretation of Richie tends to make more pop-culture references and becomes a stand-up comedian as an adult rather than a DJ. A popular fan theory of Wolfhard's interpretation of the character is that his family has a tendency to neglect Richie and that he struggles with ADHD. ==Analysis== Richie Tozier has been subject to analysis due to his personality traits and different adaptations. In the book, 1990's miniseries and even the 2017 adaptation, it is generally agreed that Richie suffers from ADHD, that had gone without being diagnosed. He has a genuine love for music and comedy, and aspires to be famous when he grows up, a status of which he receives for doing impressions and other voices. ===Speculations on Richie's sexuality=== Strictly in the adaptation of It Chapter Two, Richie was interpreted as a closeted gay or bisexual man by director Andy Muschietti. A few scenes suggest that Richie was secretly in love with Eddie Kaspbrak until the latter's death, and Eddie remained unaware of these feelings. It is implied but unconfirmed that Richie's reason for making jokes are just in part of a defense mechanism to hide his feelings for Eddie, as most of his jokes target him, as opposed to just trying to be humorous as in the book or other adaptation of IT. This film incorporates a scene where, when Eddie is killed by Pennywise, Richie is visibly more upset than the rest of the Losers' Club. It is revealed in one of the final scenes of the film that Richie carves his and Eddie's initials into a bridge. Some fans have interpreted Richie and Eddie as having feelings for each other in the novel. Muschietti has stated that the decision to depict Richie as gay in It Chapter Two was based on this interpretation of the book. Stephen King said that while he didn't intend for there to be an unrequited romance between the two characters, he approved of the storyline, saying \\"it‚Äôs one of those things that‚Äôs kind of genius, because it echoes the beginning [with Adrian Mellon's gay bashing]. It comes full circle. At least there‚Äôs love involved. Somebody cares for [Eddie,] and that echoes the love that Adrian‚Äôs partner has for him. So that was cool.‚Äù ===Comedy=== Richie is known as being the comedian of The Loser's Club, often telling jokes at inappropriate times, which leads to his friends often saying \\"Beep Beep Richie\\" when they want him to stop talking. Richie's humor has been viewed as being either a defense mechanism, or a call for attention. It has been speculated that Richie uses his comedy as a defense mechanism, to hide his fear of not only Pennywise, but his fear of not being accepted by The Loser's Club. Once Richie has his first encounter with Pennywise, his comedy turns into a coping mechanism as well, hiding his fears of the supernatural being and the possibility of his death at the hands of the creature. Strictly in It Chapter Two, it has been interpreted by some fans that Richie's comedic defense mechanism also doubles as him hiding his romantic feelings for Eddie Kaspbrak. It has also been speculated that Richie's comedy derives from a feeling of neglect by his parents, and as a cry for attention from his friends. He wants to have the attention and love from his friends that he doesn't receive at home from his parents. ==Appearances in other King stories== Richie briefly appears in a cameo appearance in King's novel 11/22/63. In the novel, after the events of Pennywise, Richie is seen dancing with Beverly preparing for a talent show. The two are approached by time traveler Jake Epping, who enquires about the Dunning family. Afterwards, Epping teaches the two how to dance properly. However, this meeting is erased by the end of the novel as Epping removes his mark on history. In King's novel Duma Key, the song excerpt in the beginning is by a band called Shark Puppy. In the credits page of the book, the song is written by R. Tozier and W. Denbrough. ==Reception== The portrayals of Richie in the 2017 remake by Wolfhard and the 2019 sequel by Hader were both highly praised and considered to be \\"show-stealers\\". Both portrayals were noted for their comedic relief and chemistry with their fellow cast members, in particular between Wolfhard and Jack Dylan Grazer for the first film and Hader and James Ransone in the second. Hader's portrayal was noted for its blend of comedy and drama when required, as well as the subtle references to Richie's sexuality and his implicated love for Eddie, referred to by Pennywise as his \\"dirty little secret.\\" ==References== Category:Characters in American novels of the 20th century Category:Drama television characters Category:Literary characters introduced in 1986 Category:Fictional characters from Maine Category:Fictional comedians Category:Fictional LGBT characters in film Category:Fictional gay males Category:Horror television characters Category:Stephen King characters Category:It (novel) Category:Fictional DJs Category:Male characters in literature Category:Male characters in film Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Richie Tozier"},{"id":"61713028","text":"Sajik Tampak is a small village situated in Chandel district of Manipur, India.https://www.census.com.in/2011/data/village/270921-sajik-tampak-manipur It is located in Chakpikarong sub district of Chandel district in the state Manipur. == Demographics == The village has population about 1562 people, among them 1171 are males and 391 are females.

Within just under a month, the Central Powers had managed to conquer the -long Olt Valley from its Romanian defenders. ==Background== From the Turnu Ro»ôu Pass (Rotherthurm Pass) the Olt River flows for around in a narrow gorge, which has its southern end at R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea. An initial Central Powers attack in the region was defeated by the Romanian Army at SƒÉlƒÉtrucu, causing a one week-long pause in operations. The Central Powers renewed their offensive at the end of October. Initially, the Central Powers forces in the region consisted in a mixed division with mostly German leadership, but mainly Austro-Hungarian troops. After being defeated at SƒÉlƒÉtrucu, this force was strengthened. The Central Powers forces in the region were under the command of General Konrad Krafft von Dellmensingen. Romanian forces in the region consisted in elements of the 1st Army.John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, pp. 246-247Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, pp. 363-364 Commanded by General starting with 25 October, the 1st Army was placed under the command of General by early November. Vasilescu became the fourth general to command the 1st Army in two weeks.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 172 and 182 ==Overall course of operations== Krafft's forces consisted of one Alpine Corps division, the 73rd Austro-Hungarian Division and 2nd and 10th Austro-Hungarian Mountain Brigades. On 7 November, the 216th German Infantry Division joined this group. Opposed to this force was the I Corps of the Romanian 1st Army, consisting in the 13th and 23rd Divisions. The Alpine Corps found the going slow. The Romanian troops fought tenaciously, taking advantage of the positions they had constructed along the border before the war to slow the German progress. Troubling for Krafft was his men's tendency to rely on artillery and feel pleased with seizing one enemy position per day. In an admonition to all the forces under his command, the frustrated Krafft acknowledged that the Romanian positions were challenging, but reminded his troops that they were not fighting against French fortifications on the Western Front, urging his commanders to rely less on long artillery bombardments and more on swift infantry assaults. Moreover, the Central Powers encountered nightmarish logistical problems regarding their supplies. Although the Alpine Corps' rate of advance remained sluggish, during the first two weeks of November Krafft's units captured 80 officers and 7,000 soldiers, 12 artillery pieces and 20 machine guns. On 10 November, the Romanians dispatched the 14th Division to the region as reinforcements. Subsequently, the 13th and 23rd Divisions were merged. The struggle finally ended on 25 November, when Krafft stated that the enemy resistance in front of his corps was broken.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 258-259 ==Individual engagements== 305 mm mortar at Tite»ôti ===ZƒÉnoaga=== On 28 October, a fresh German division took Mount Mormonta, enabling the Bavarian Guard Regiment to take ZƒÉnoaga. The Romanians had incurred over 700 combat casualties, including 15 officers and 400 soldiers captured, as well as 3 machine guns. By 1 November, the Germans had reached Tite»ôti Valley.Michael B.

His final words were: \\"Noblesse oblige. I do not mean that with respect to my family but rather my duty as an officer.\\".Michael B.

These were conquered between 6 and 9 November. The Romanians promptly counterattacked and, by 11 November, had reconquered Mount Fruntu, but it proved impossible to exploit this initial success. While the Central Powers had received reinforcements exceeding a division, the Romanians had a considerable force shifted to another sector of the front. Thus weakened, the Romanian forces had to give ground.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 449Michael B.

By 15 November, the German front on the western side of the Olt Valley ran just south of the village of Galotreni, and on the eastern side of the valley the front ran through the southern end of the Cozia Massif and just south of SƒÉlƒÉtrucu, with a notable salient to the south coming from the direction of SƒÉlƒÉtrucu itself.Michael B.

By 21 November, the German front ran just south of the village of DƒÉe»ôti, with a wide salient of little depth to the immediate east of the village. This would not last, however. On 25 November, Krafft stated that the enemy resistance in front of his corps was broken. On that very day, R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea was finally taken. This was the southern end of the Olt Valley. The Central Powers forces in the sector had finally broken through the mountains. On 27 November, the line of the Olt River was abandoned by the Romanians, and on that same day, Krafft's forces took Curtea de Arge»ô.Michael B.

The river and its tributaries flow west from the Olympic Mountains and empty into the Pacific Ocean. It is situated a few miles north of the Quinault River and a few miles south of the Queets River. ==Course== The Raft River originates at the confluence of Crane Creek and Lunch Creek, which flow southwest from the Olympic Mountains. The Raft River flows west for about , gathering tributaries such as the South Fork and North Fork Raft River, until emptying into the Pacific Ocean. Crane Creek is the longer of the two source tributaries, which at about brings the total to about .USGS topographic maps accessed via https://mapper.acme.com Crane Creek is joined by Cedar Creek just before Crane and Lunch Creek join, forming the main stem Raft River. Crane, Cedar, and Lunch Creek all flow southwest from the Olympic Mountains. Lunch Creek is joined by Meadow Creek shortly before meeting the Raft River. Less than a mile below Lunch Creek the Raft River is joined from the south by the South Fork Raft River. The South Fork begins a few miles to the south in a wetland called O'Took Prairie. Continuing west the Raft River is joined by a couple small streams and then, from the south, Hoh Creek. After a few more miles the Raft River is joined, from the north, by the North Fork Raft River. The North Fork Raft River originates in the Olympic Mountains very near the Quinault Reservation boundary. It is the longest tributary at about . The total length of the North Fork and the mainstem Raft River below the confluence is about . The North Fork Raft River collects various tributaries including Wolf Creek and its tributaries Trail Creek and Swede Creek. Below the North Fork confluence the Raft River is joined by Red Creek and then Rainy Creek. In this reach the river meanders through a floodplain about wide. The river channel is about wide, expanding to over at river bends. The Raft River empties emptying into the Pacific Ocean at a sea stack called Tunnel Island and a cluster of smaller stacks, one of which is called Elephant Rock. Elephant Rock was named for its arch which gave it the appearance of an elephant. However the \\"trunk\\" part of the arch collapsed in 2016. The lowermost of the Raft River is a tidally-influenced estuary. ==Environment== Most of the Raft River's drainage basin consists of low hills and plateaus. Much of it has been clear-cut in recent decades. The Raft River and its tributaries support chum salmon and coho salmon spawning. Limited Chinook salmon spawning occurs in the main stem Raft River. The river also supports salmonid populations of bull trout and steelhead trout. Other fauna found in the Raft River watershed include bald eagles, peregrine falcons, spotted owls, and many others. The Raft River's estuary, where tides mix salt and fresh water, is a unique area that is culturally important to the Quinault Indian Nation. Although not as large or complex as the nearby Queets River estuary, the Raft River's estuary is extensive and supports varied habitats. Being accessible mainly by foot it remains relatively pristine, although there is some evidence of access by ATVs and there is some non-native European beach grass. Access to the estuary and beaches is not allowed to non-tribal members unless accompanied by a Tribal representative. The surficial geology of most of the Raft River's drainage basin is glacial outwash, with the estuary being more recent alluvium. The river's estuary and lower reach, up to the North Fork, is in a tsunami hazard zone. ==Tributaries== In upstream hierarchical order the main tributaries of the Raft River are: * Rainy Creek * Red Creek * North Fork Raft River ** Wolf Creek *** Trail Creek **** Swede Creek * Hoh Creek * South Fork Raft River * Lunch Creek ** Meadow Creek * Crane Creek ** Cedar Creek ==See also== * List of rivers of Washington ==References== Category:Rivers of Washington (state) Category:Rivers of Grays Harbor County, Washington Category:Quinault places ","title":"Raft River (Washington)"},{"id":"61713132","text":"Whitehorse North Centre was a territorial electoral district in the Canadian territory of Yukon, which was represented on the Yukon Territorial Council from 1974 to 1978 and in the Legislative Assembly of Yukon from 1978 to 1992. ==Representatives== { border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" !

King Edward III of England captured the town and castle after a siege in 1347. The English foiled by ambushing an unsuspecting French force which was attempting to take the city by stealth in 1349. The French commander, Geoffrey de Charny, had attempted to bribe Amerigo of Pavia, an officer of the garrison, to open a tower gate for them. Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, uncle of Richard II of England was imprisoned in Calais in 1397 and was assassinated. Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy laid siege to Calais between June and July 1436 with a force of Flemish militia, that was unsuccessful. After recovering the region of Calais from the English in 1558, led by Francis, Duke of Guise, the French razed the castle.

After first working as a contact for the resistance worker Ebbe Munck in Stockholm, she became so deeply involved in illegal activities that she had to move to Stockholm herself in September 1943. In 1944, she moved to London where from January 1945 she joined the Special Operations Executive. After the war, she continued to work for Danish intelligence, becoming chief archivist for the Danish Defence Intelligence Service in 1956 until her retirement in 1960. ==Early life== Born on 28 April 1906 in Hiller√∏d, Jutta Regitse Pilegaard Graae was the daughter of Julius Constantin Pilegaard Graae (1876‚Äì1914) and Sigrid Christiane Sibbern K√∏hler (1878‚Äì1966). After completing realskole, she became an assistant at the Invalid Insurance Court. She then spent a year in London before taking up employment at Copenhagen's Sparekassen for Kj√∏benhavn og Omegn. ==Resistance work== Under the German occupation of Denmark in World War II, as the sister in law of the journalist Ebbe Munck who was involved in clandestine activities for British intelligence, Graae was able to collect information in her position at the savings bank. It was then forwarded by courier to Munck who was stationed in Stockholm, Sweden. Graee's home on Rosenstandsvej in Ordrup was also used by resistance members to deposit items to be sent to Stockholm. It was here in May 1943 that a key meeting took place between Mogens Fog, Erling Foss and Frode Jakobsen where they discussed how best to coordinate resistance work. When the Germans disbanded the Danish army and navy in August 1943, key members of the resistance had to go underground. As a result, together with Volmer Gyth and P.A. M√∏rch of the intelligence service, Graae moved to Stockholm where she acted as secretary and hostess. She became so knowledgeable of resistance activities that in October 1944 she was invited to London to advise Major-General R.H. Dewing who was planning operations in Denmark. The following January she was transferred to the Special Operations Executive which was responsible for coordinating illegal contacts with Denmark. She published her memoirs of her involvement in the Danish resistance in V√¶rnepligt (1995). ==Post-war activities== After the war, Graae moved to Washington, D.C., where she worked at the Danish embassy under Henrik Kauffmann. In 1947, she returned to Denmark to join the Defence Intelligence Service, where she became chief archivist in 1956 until her retirement in 1960. In December 1960, she married the estate owner Flemming Juncker (1904‚Äì2002) whom she had met while working in London. On 25 March 1997, Jutta Graae died in Havndal in the east of Jutland where she is buried in the local cemetery. ==Awards and honours== In 1947, Graae was awarded the Order of the British Empire.

Finn Devold (1902 - 1977), Hallvard Devold's brother, on ship Heimen from Troms√∏, led the bigger party of six hunters to establish a Norwegian station. Initially Devold went to Timmiarmiut Fjord, but then he moved north to Skjoldungen District and built the hut by a good harbor in southern Thorland, naming it Finnsbu after his own name. Devold's team built two other main stations, as well as a number of smaller huts in the same region.Recent Norwegian Expeditions to Southeast-Greenland, Gunnar Horn The other expedition, led by Ole Mortensen, went initially to Storfjord (Kangerlussuaq Fjord) on ship Signalhorn and built a hut there. Since hunting there was poor, Mortensen moved with his men south to Lindenow Fjord, where a station named Moreton was built which was later moved by Gunnar Horn to neighboring Nanuuseq Fjord and renamed Torgilsbu.Norwegian Expedition to South-East Greenland, 1932 On 12 July 1932 Devold was required by the Norwegian government to formally hoist the Norwegian flag at Finnsbu.

A total of eight people died during the initial fire, and an additional four succumbed to injuries in the subsequent weeks and months, making it the deadliest fire in the city's history. A total of 26 others were injured in the fire. ==Fire== At approximately 11:00 p.m. on July 7, 1975, a fire broke out inside the Pomona Hotel (located within the former Erickson Saloon Building) on Burnside Street in northwest Portland, Oregon, in what was at the time considered \\"one of the toughest, largest skid rows on the U.S. West coast. At this time, the hotel catered mainly to the impoverished, with rooms for 80 cents per night. Firefighters arrived after being notified of the fire shortly after 11:00 p.m., and trapped men were visible from the hotel's third floor screaming for help. One firefighter recalled men \\"hanging by their fingertips\\" from third floor ledges of the building. The fire, which charred the majority of the 100-room hotel's hallways and doors, was put out, and the majority of the bodies recovered were discovered in the halls, where residents and guests had collapsed while trying to escape. Firefighters estimated the blaze reached a maximum of on the building's third floor, and it caused approximately $135,000 in damage. It was determined by firefighters that the fire had begun on the hotel's second floor, where gasoline had been poured to ignite the blaze, and that the building did not have proper sprinkler systems installed. ===Victims=== A total of eight decedents were recovered from the hotel after the fire, all of whom perished from asphyxiation via carbon monoxide poisoning; an additional 26 individuals sustained significant injuries (eight of whom were listed as being in critical condition per a July 9 report). Of these 26 individuals, a further four would succumb to their injuries in the subsequent weeks and months, making the total death count 12. Publicly identified victims: ==Arrest== ===John Joseph Newvine=== In the early morning hours of July 8, law enforcement arrested 61-year-old John Joseph Newvine, a skid row resident, on eight charges of arson and murder, respectively. Law enforcement was led to Newvine after an attendant from a nearby gas station informed them that a suspicious man had purchased two gallons of gasoline shortly before the fire broke out. An empty gasoline canister was discovered lying in an intersection adjacent to the hotel. Newvine was described as an \\"unemployed loner\\" who had been through local \\"alcohol detoxication program[s]\\" a total of 22 times. At the time of the fire, he was a resident of another hotel, the Home Hotel, also located on skid row. However, on July 10, the charges against Newvine were dropped after the gas station attendant retracted his identification, claiming he misidentified Newvine. ===Roy Jennings Beard=== Roy Jennings Beard, 57, was subsequently arrested and charged in the fire. On July 15, Beard was sent to Oregon State Hospital for psychiatric evaluation, after investigators deduced that he was not \\"in a position to appreciate what he has been charged with.\\" After evaluation, a tentative trial date of September 15, 1975, was set for Jennings, at that time for 11 counts of murder. ==See also== *List of hotel fires in the United States ==References== Category:Arson in the United States Category:Hotel fires in the United States Category:Mass murder in the United States Category:1975 in Portland, Oregon Category:July 1975 events in the United States ","title":"Pomona Hotel fire"},{"id":"61713371","text":"Bhram is a psychological horror/thriller wherein the protagonist suffers from PTSD and traverses all kinds of extremes (paranormal, mythical, psychological) in order to unearth a long-forgotten truth.

For the purpose of simplification they will henceforth be referred to as pƒÅ ªani. Most pƒÅ ªani Hawai ªi place pertinence on language and chanting as part of the pƒÅ ªani with the single exception being lele koali (kowali), a Hawaiian Swinging game based around either a koali vine or a koali hao (metal chain). Manaleo ‚ÄúAunty‚Äù Alice in her Ka Leo Hawai ªi Interview states that there is an exchange of words and play which span either a few days or a whole week during lele koali.‚ÄúKa Leo Hawai ªi.‚Äù HV24.145B1. University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa, April 4, 1976. Interview with Aunty Alice NƒÅmakelua. During this time though everybody is convened in an area, having fun, talking story, playing music, and eating together. This page doesn‚Äôt seek to compare or contrast pƒÅ ªani Hawai ªi with the games of other nations. There is however a Masters Thesis by Yasuko Chiba which features this approach and methodology of comparing and contrasting PƒÅ ªani Hawai ªi Kahiko to Japanese games. == Recent History == === Declination === Early 20th century scholars affiliate the decline of ‚ÄúpƒÅ ªani kahiko‚Äù, or traditional games to the decline in Hawaiian cultural practice. This isn‚Äôt too farfetched, given that there was a synonymity of loss in Hawai ªi related to people passing away at the turn of century. In addition to this problem, there is also the issue of religious difference which occurred between the early 19th and 20th century. Some Hawai ªi were converting over to Christianity and struggled with doing some traditional cultural practices in the face of this new religion. The overthrow of Ka LƒÅhui Hawai ªi K≈´ ªoko ªa, and the provisional government, which outlawed Hawaiian Language as a medium of education also led to the declination of pƒÅ ªani. Many of the pƒÅ ªani, which were sometimes embodiments of akua, or elements (gods and goddesses) were relegated to the background. === Resurgences ===  The first resurgence  During the 1950s though one could argue that there was a ‚Äúresurgence‚Äù of pƒÅ ªani Hawai ªi. Some argued that this resurgence happened because of a pageantry (play) held by Parks and Recreation of Honolulu in 1921. In this time, President Woodrow Wilson was visiting and saw this pageantry then exclaimed that there should be more investment in PƒÅ ªani Hawai ªi KƒÅhiko. Henceforth, there was a larger investment in this ‚Äúpageantry‚Äù which was enacted competitively at the Kennedy Theatre in the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa. It could be asserted that this resurgence though was only the first of two.  The second resurgence  The next resurgence occurred during the establishment of  ªAha P≈´nana Leo. The  ªAha P≈´nana Leo, a system of networks based around  ª≈çlelo Hawai ªi, or Hawaiian Language became a charter public school which enabled a space for Hawai ªi practices to be normal again. In many Kaiapuni Schools, at least during the 1990s students committed themselves to playing many pƒÅ ªani Hawai ªi. Pala  ªIe, a game similar to the kendama, but was ‚Äúa flexible stick made of braided coconut leaflets with a loop at one end and a tapa ball on a string attached below the loop, the object being to catch the ball in the loop‚Äù. Pe ªepe ªe akua, the Hawai ªi equivalent of hide ‚Äòn‚Äô seek, but was done to a chant for Pele, an akua Hawai ªi. Lono, mauli, pau, the closest relative being Rock, Paper, Scissors, but this pƒÅ ªani was meant to memorize a few moon phases. Along with the majority of Makahiki games which took place during  ªaha wehena (the opening ceremonies). A category which should have its own section though are the pƒÅ ªani Hawai ªi related to Makahiki and therefore related to Lonoikamakahiki. There could even be many different categorizations based on different akua, however, it would be a disservice to attempt to quantify the innumerable amount of akua at play during pƒÅ ªani Hawai ªi. Hawai ªi believed there were ‚Äúkini‚Äù akua or more than four hundred thousand akua. == PƒÅ ªani Makahiki == Makahiki Games are the most common place today in Hawai ªi, the time for these games to be played is marked by the rising of Makali ªi (Pleiades) during the month of Welehu, a space currently between October and November.  ªUlu maika is a game where the contestants bowl a rounded stone between two sticks. Mokomoko also known as ku ªiku ªi, a boxing contest, done with chants specific to place. HƒÅk≈çk≈ç (wrestling),  ª≈å ª≈ç  ªIhe, spear throwing into a banana stump, Honuhonu, hand pulling, Ke ªa Pua, dart throwing, (PƒÅ) Uma, wrist wrestling, P≈´henehene, concealing stones, KƒÅkƒÅlƒÅ ªau, spear fencing, Loulou, interlocked finger pulling and Kulakula ªi, a pushing contest. Some mo ªolelo (stories) suggest that mokomoko (boxing) is the opening pƒÅ ªani during makahiki and is a clash which requires blood to be drawn. Henceforth, the ceremonies commencing will uphold pono. During pƒÅ ªani Makahiki, the pƒÅ ªani champion of each ahupua ªa tenure system is allowed to traverse with an elite company of champions in a circuit around the island. During this island circuit, the akua pƒÅ ªani, an idol related to play, traverses the pƒÅ ªani and watches over participants, sometimes they are for one specific person, other times they watch over many. The akua pƒÅ ªani is typically held by a court, whom collect the ancestral taxes of each ahupua ªa, along side an ali ªi (a chief or chiefess) and a mo ªƒ´ (paramount chief or chiefess). This is an exceptional act though; it is not often that maka ªainana or citizens are allowed to interact with their ali ªi in this manner. == Kekahi Le ªale ªa == Some pƒÅ ªani are for the purpose of le ªale ªa and ho ªoipoipo. These are perhaps the most intricate of all the games: Kilu is a pƒÅ ªani of courting which relies on hula, mele, and is specific for ali ªi which also suggests a need for establishing genealogy.  ªUme, is a pƒÅ ªani similar to Kilu, however it is for the commoners and was called  ªume because the participants would be drawn to each other. P≈´hene is a game of concealing a rock on the body of a person, the specific instance of Hi ªiaka‚Äôs experiences with Kilu, and P≈´henehene may reveal to the players the intricacy of language and movement necessary for these pƒÅ ªani. == Other PƒÅ ªani == Many other PƒÅ ªani exist in Hawai ªi and language tends to be the biggest feature. Some games such as ho ªolele kƒ´, are specific to one place (Kƒ´lauea). Various others take place only in certain regions, such as kaupua, a race done in the ocean, or ke ªa pua, which requires a sugar cane stock and sugar cane flower, a dirt mound, and rope to be played. One of the most well known games, k≈çnane, is a game of wits which requires  ªili ªili from the ocean region and p≈çhaku (rocks) from either the plains or mountain regions. It is possible to read English interpretations of these pƒÅ ªani and how to participate in them in books such as Donald D. Kilolani Mitchell's books Resource Units in Hawaiian Culture as well as Hawaiian games for today, and Pukui's Hawaiian Dictionary. == References == Category:Sports in Hawaii Category:Native Hawaiian culture Category:American games ","title":"Traditional Hawaiian Games (PƒÅ ªani Hawai ªi Kahiko)"},{"id":"61713413","text":"Victoriano Gregorio de Ysasi J√°uregui (c. 1816 ‚Äì 8 August 1881) was a Spanish wine merchant and philatelist resident in London.

Born in Tigveni, Arge»ô County, he was the son of a teacher. He attended Saint Sava National College in Bucharest, the school for soldiers‚Äô sons in Ia»ôi and the Bucharest military school, from which he graduated in 1907 as head of his class, with the rank of second lieutenant. After being promoted to lieutenant (1910) and then captain (1915), Marinescu served during the Romanian Campaign of World War I in a V√¢nƒÉtori de munte regiment. Promoted to major in April 1917, he distinguished himself at the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôti. For his valor, on 11 August 1917 he was awarded the Order of Michael the Brave, 3rd class. In 1918 he became commanding officer of the 9th Mountain Troops Regiment. After the war, he joined the staff of the rural gendarmerie, becoming lieutenant colonel in 1921 and colonel in 1927.Grigore and »òerbu, p. 267 In June 1930, soon after assuming the throne, King Carol II dismissed Bucharest's incumbent prefect of police, naming Marinescu, who held the office until November 1939. The deed was accomplished by royal decree without cabinet approval, signaling Carol's authoritarian tendencies. Marinescu thus became a founding member of the royal camarilla. As part of his duties, the general selected prostitutes appealing to the king. In 1935, the building of a new police headquarters began; it was completed two years later. This was initiated by Marinescu and financed by Max Auschnitt. The same year, Marinescu co-authored a hagiographic volume on the king, and delivered a radio address attacking his opponent Iuliu Maniu. In February 1937, he was named state secretary at the Interior Ministry. As such, he took a number of harsh but unsuccessful measures against the Iron Guard, which in 1936 had already marked him for execution.Grigore and »òerbu, p. 268 On 10 May 1937 he was promoted to brigadier general. In January 1938, shortly before the National Renaissance Front regime was established, Marinescu returned to his Interior position. Following the assassination of Prime Minister Armand CƒÉlinescu, he was named Interior Minister. During the week he served (21‚Äì28 September 1939), his agents killed some 250 Guard members in reprisal. He was then named head of a new Public Order Ministry, where he was responsible for the police and gendarmerie. This was dissolved on October 3. In November, Marinescu was dismissed as prefect of police.Grigore and »òerbu, p. 269 In October 1940, during the National Legionary State, Marinescu was arrested. He was assassinated the next month as part of the Jilava massacre.

His trial lasted ten minutes. He was executed/murdered at the Brandenburg-G√∂rden penitentiary, a short distance outside Berlin, to the west of the city. ==Life== ===Provenance and early years=== Wilhelm Kn√∂chel was born into a Social Democratic working class family in Offenbach, a short distance upriver from Frankfurt. He qualified and worked as a factory machine operator (\\"Dreher\\"). In 1917 he was conscripted into the Imperial Army, shortly after which he was badly wounded. There are also references to his having worked as a mines maintenance engineer (\\"Grubenschlosser\\"). In 1919, with Germany affected by acute economic hardship and, especially in the cities, a succession of revolutionary uprisings, Kn√∂chel joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). By 1920 he had relocated in search of work to the industrially vital and internationally critical Ruhr region. Sources differ over whether it was in 1920 or 1923 that he switched to the recently created Communist Party. Between 1924 and 1930 he was a member of the party leadership team for the Dortmund region (\\"...des Unterbezirk Dortmund\\"). In 1930, following the death of his first wife, he returned to Offenbach, where it was arranged that his daughter should be brought up by relatives. Kn√∂chel was now employed as a party official. ===National Socialist years=== During the later part of 1931 or early in 1932 Wilhelm Kn√∂chel relocated via Czechoslovakia to the Soviet Union where he worked as a miner. Between 1932 and 1934 he studied at the International Lenin School (\\"–ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –ª–µ–Ω–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è —à–∫–æ–ª–∞\\") run by the Comintern in Moscow. While he was away, in January 1933 the National Socialists took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. This meant that by the time he returned to Germany membership of the Communist Party had become illegal. Kn√∂chel nevertheless remained an active member, working from 1934 as a senior advisor (\\"Oberberater\\") for the underground party team in the \\"Wasserkante\\" (Hamburg) district in which, before the ban, the Communist Party had been particularly strong. Kn√∂chel attended the party's so-called \\"Brussels Conference\\" in Moscow in October 1935. (It had been misleadingly identified in party communications as the \\"Brussels Conference\\" during the planning process in order to confuse the German security Services.) He was elected a candidate for Central Committee membership. By this time most of the active members of the German Communist Party had either been arrested or had fled into exile, and in 1936 he was sent to Amsterdam where he teamed up with Wilhelm Beuttel to set up a \\"western leadership team\\" for the exiled party: most of the political activity in question was nevertheless undertaken, under conditions of extreme and growing danger, by comrades operating \\"underground\\" in the Rhineland, and most particularly in the Ruhr region where the focus was on communist resistance, organised through the (illegal) trades union movement in the economically important coal mines. He was a co-founder and secretary of the \\"Communist Committee for German Free Trades Union Miners\\" (\\"...kommunistische Ausschuss freigewerkschaftlicher Bergarbeiter Deutschlands\\"). In 1938 he was elected to membership of the executive of \\"The Miners' International\\" (\\"Bergarbeiterinternationale\\"). Sources also refer to widespread education and propaganda work in the Rhine region. ===War years=== In January 1939 he attended the party's so-called \\"Bern Conference\\", which was held not in Switzerland but at Draveil, just outside Paris. He was elected to full Central Committee membership. Later that year, in August 1939, the Nazi- Soviet non-aggression agreement opened the way for a new partition of Poland. The next month Poland was invaded from the west and, two weeks later, from the east. This marked the outbreak of the Second World War. The party's \\"western leadership team\\" in Amsterdam was given responsibility not just for activities in the Netherlands, but also in Belgium and Switzerland. However, wartime conditions mean that communications channels between Amsterdam, where Kn√∂chel had been living since 1936, and the remaining network of party activists across the border in Germany, were degraded or broken. Sources are silent concerning his activities during 1940 and 1941. On 8 January 1942 Wilhelm Kn√∂chel re-entered Germany and, disguised as an itinerant specialist silver polisher, travelled illegally via D√ºsseldorf to the Ruhr region. Here he was unable to find a safe location in which to set himself up. He therefore moved on to Berlin, where he was supported by Alfred Kowalke. During 1942 he undertook several trips to D√ºsseldorf, Essen and Wuppertal which enabled him to engage directly in political discussions with workers in a number of different factories. In addition, three of his contacts from his time in Amsterdam were still active in the Ruhr region. From his base in Berlin, where he teamed up with Willi Seng to establish what became identified in some sources as the \\"Kn√∂chel-Seng [resistance] group\\" (\\"Kn√∂chel-Seng-Gruppe\\"), he was also able to retain far-reaching contacts with exiled party leaders in Stockholm, Amsterdam and, on a much more restricted basis, by radio, with fellow members of the party Central Committee in Moscow. Relations with the leadership team in Moscow were always tense, however, and Kn√∂chel moved from being critical of the directives received from the Moscow-based team. As he wrote at one stage to his partner Cilly Hansmann (1908 ‚Äì 1984), who undertook courier work for him, \\"Are those guys in Moscow sitting on the moon?\\". Sources are vague about what communist political activism inside Nazi Germany actually involved, but it certainly included producing and distributing political leaflets and more substantial publications, left casually on park benches, in public toilets or on trains and trams. According to at least one source, exiled leaders of the German Communist Party had reacted to the outbreak of war at the end of 1939 with a resolution that comrades abroad should infiltrate themselves back into Germany and engage in political activism, following instructions from the exiled party central committee team in Moscow. It seems, however, that Wilhelm Kn√∂chel and a relatively small number of his associates were the only ones who successfully made the attempt to establish a communist resistance group in Germany during this period. There were reasons. During January several members of the group were captured, starting on 12 January 1943 with Alfons Kaps. Kaps was interrogated and severely tortured and, it is inferred, provided information that led his interrogators to other resistance group members. On 30 January 1943 Wilhelm Kn√∂chel was also arrested, in the Berlin apartment of comrades Charlotte and Erich Garske. The arrest of this exceptionally productive anti-Nazi activist represented seen a major triumph for the security services. An attempt to lure him to a meeting, set up by his senior comrade Willi Seng a few days earlier, had failed because he had been ill in bed, too ill to attend. It turned out that several comrades, including Seng, had been arrested on 20 January and subjected to \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\" (torture) in order to persuade him to set up that meeting. It seems that when the meeting had failed to take place Seng had also been persuaded to disclose Kn√∂chel's Berlin hiding place. Following his arrested it is likely that Wilhelm Kn√∂chel was subjected to the same levels of extreme torture as Seng (and others arrested at the same time). It is known that on 17 February 1943 he offered his Gestapo interrogators a deal that would involve his working for them as a \\"V-Mann\\" (collaborator / informant). Subsequent speculation on why he did this has been inconclusive, although there is no shortage of theories. Following interrogation he was taken to the concentration camp (identified in some sources as a prison and in others as a camp) at Scheveningen on the Dutch coast. During the summer of 1944 he was taken back to Berlin where, on 12 June 1944, he faced the special \\"People's Court\\". Kn√∂chel's \\"trial\\" was conducted by the court president, Dr. Roland Freisler, himself. The hearing lasted just ten minutes, and ended with Kn√∂chel being sentenced to death, found guilty under the all too familiar charge, in those times, of \\"Preparing to commit high treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hoch- und Landesverrat\\"). Other members of the group, including Willi Seng, Alfons Kaps, Alfred Kowalke, and Wilhelm Beuttel were sentenced to death at the same time. Wilhelm Kn√∂chel was executed/murdered at the Brandenburg- G√∂rden penitentiary on 24 July 1944. ==Personal== During his time in the Ruhr region, in 1922, Wilhelm Kn√∂chel married a war widow who came to the marriage with two children. The couple's third child, Inge, was born in 1921. His wife died young in 1930, however. ==Notes== ==References== Category:People from Offenbach am Main Category:Executed communists in the German Resistance Category:Communists in the German Resistance Category:Prisoners of Nazi concentration camps Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians Category:Communist Party of Germany members Category:Stolpersteine Category:1899 births Category:1944 deaths ","title":"Wilhelm Kn√∂chel"},{"id":"61713538","text":"Kamal Patel may refer to: *Kamal Patel (politician) (born 1961), politician of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from Madhya Pradesh, India. *Kamal Patel (researcher), nutrition researcher and the director of Examine.com ","title":"Kamal Patel"},{"id":"61713573","text":"Wynand Johannes Boshoff (born 26 May 1970) is a South African academic and politician from the Northern Cape serving as a Member of the National Assembly of South Africa for the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) since 2019.

Nusach Ashkenaz may be subdivided into the German or Western branch (\\"Minhag Ashkenaz\\"), used in Western and Central Europe, and the Polish/Lithuanian or Eastern branch (\\"Minhag Polin\\"), used in Eastern Europe, the United States and by some Israeli Ashkenazim, particularly those who identify as \\"Lithuanian\\". Minhag Polin has historically been the most common minhag among Ashkenazim in Poland, eastern Germany, Austria, Hungary, Belarus, Lithuania, Romania, and Russia. There are a number of minor differences between the Israeli and American Ashkenazi practice, in that the Israeli practice follows some practices of the Vilna Gaon. The term \\"Minhag Ashkenaz\\", strictly applied, refers only to the minhag of German Jews south and west of the Elbe, such as the community of Frankfurt am Main. North- Eastern German communities such as Hamburg regarded themselves as following Minhag Polin, though their musical tradition and pronunciation of Hebrew, and some of the traditions about the prayers included, were more reminiscent of the western communities than of Poland proper. Jews in Germany were historically divided into the \\"Bayers\\" of Bavaria and southern Germany, who followed the Minhag Ashkenaz, and the \\"Polanders\\" in northern Germany who followed Minhag Polin. Minhag Polin was also the custom of some Jews in the Czech lands and Slovakia. Minhag Polin was introduced to the Moravian town of Kojet√≠n (present day Czech Republic) in 1648. Due to the large diaspora of Polish and Eastern European Jews who left Europe for the Americas, Israel, and elsewhere, Minhag Polin is the most common minhag found among Jews worldwide. Minhag Polin derives from Minhag Rinus, an earlier Ashkenazi rite developed by Jews in the German Rhineland. When Ashkenazi Jews from the Rhineland began to migrate to Poland and Eastern Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, they brought the Minhag Rinus with them. Over time, this minhag evolved into Minhag Polin. After the appearance of Hasidic Judaism in the 18th century and the popularization of Kabbalah in Eastern Europe, the Minhag Polin evolved further to incorporate kabbalistic elements. ==See also== *History of the Jews in Germany *History of the Jews in Poland *Lithuanian Jews *Minhag ==References== Category:Ashkenazi Jewish culture in Belarus Category:Ashkenazi Jewish culture in Europe Category:Ashkenazi Jewish culture in Lithuania Category:Ashkenazi Jewish culture in Russia Category:Jews and Judaism in Austria Category:Jews and Judaism in Hungary Category:Jews and Judaism in Romania Category:Jews and Judaism in Slovakia Category:Judaism in Belarus Category:Judaism in the Czech Republic Category:Judaism in Germany Category:Judaism in Lithuania Category:Judaism in Poland Category:Judaism in Russia Category:Judaism in Ukraine Category:Minhagim ","title":"Minhag Polin"},{"id":"61713706","text":"Dirk Kramer (born 11 April 1960) is a German skier.

He is portrayed by Keanu Reeves. The character of John Wick, originally named Jardani Jovonovich, is an assassin who has long retired, until a gang invades his house, steals his car and kills his dog, setting him on a near unstoppable path of revenge, after which a former associate (Santino D'Antonio) calls in a \\"marker\\" to have him fulfill an assassination leading to him being pursued by the entirety of the High Table of Assassins. ==Character biography== John was once named Jardani Jovonovich, born in Padhorje, Byelorussian SSR, Soviet Union, to parents who were of Romani descent. He was orphaned at a young age for unknown reasons, before being taken in by an old friend of his father, who would eventually become Wick's mentor. He was recruited by a Ruska Roma organized crime outfit and raised by its leader, a woman known as \\"the Director\\", at its New York headquarters. Under the supervision of the Director, Jardani was trained as an assassin; he learned multiple skills including martial arts, firearms, edged weapons, improvised weapons, tactical driving, infiltration, escapology and more. At some point Jardani took the name \\"John Wick\\" and left the Ruska Roma organization. He became a feared and ruthless hitman his targets would call \\"Baba Yaga\\". Wick was noted for his great focus and determination; his fighting prowess was such that he once single-handedly killed three men with a pencil. Eventually John met and fell in love with a woman named Helen. Hoping to leave his past as a contract killer behind him and pursue a normal life, John met with crime boss Viggo Tarasov, who agreed to grant him his wish if he could carry out a certain task for him. The exact nature of this task is unknown but it has been consistently described as \\"impossible\\" by various characters throughout the series (implying John wasn't expected to survive the task). In order to accomplish the task John required assistance from Camorra member Santino D'Antonio and subsequently ended up owing a blood debt to him. Viggo offers little elaboration on the mysterious task but said \\"the bodies he buried\\" laid the foundations for what his criminal organization became, implying Wick eliminated all his major rivals for him, enabling Tarasov to become one of New York's most powerful crime bosses. After completing his \\"impossible task\\" John Wick retired as an assassin and settled down with his wife Helen, his reputation and status now legendary. ===John Wick (2014)=== Following his wife's terminal illness, John prefers to remain isolated from society. He spends his days driving his prized car ‚Äî a 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 ‚Äî and caring for his new dog, Daisy, the last gift from his dearly departed wife. This changes when Iosef Tarasov assaults John, steals his car and kills Daisy. This sets John on a rampage of slaughter and vengeance. Attempting to protect his son from John's rampage, Viggo sends assassins to stop John, but all are killed. Eventually John takes his revenge, killing both Iosef and Viggo. After he does this, John rescues a pitbull puppy scheduled to be euthanized from an animal shelter. ===John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) === After exacting his vengeance on the Tarasovs, John retrieves his prized car from Abram Tarasov and forms a truce with him allowing him to live. John hopes to return to retirement but this is interrupted by Santino D'Antonio, who asks for him to complete his blood oath and assassinate his sister, Gianna, allowing Santino to have a seat at The High Table. Wick reluctantly travels to Rome to fulfill the task, only to realize that he will be Santino's next target for eliminating a member of The High Table. Santino sends his bodyguard Ares and Gianna's former bodyguard Cassian after Wick but both ultimately fail. Santino places a $7 million bounty on Wick's head, after which Wick enlists assistance from The Bowery King, who supplies him with a gun that carries only 7 bullets and information of Santino's location. John eventually finds Santino in the safe grounds of The Continental. Santino taunts John as The Continental Owner, Winston, advises John to walk away before he breaks the laws of The Continental. Despite this, John still assassinates Santino, leaving John to be declared \\"excommunicado\\" for conducting business on Continental Grounds. Winston allows John one hour to escape before the contract is doubled and his status is rescinded from all services. ===John Wick: Chapter 3 ‚Äì Parabellum (2019) === Excommunicated, exhausted, and injured, John spends his one-hour head start preparing to flee from New York, as assassins gather and hear word of the bounty on John for killing a member of the High Table. John escapes to Morocco, meets with former ally Sofia, and summons a favor to be brought to the Elder, a man outranking the High Table, who can cancel the kill order. John travels throughout the desert to the point of collapse in order for The Elder to find him. The Elder agrees to grant him forgiveness from the bounty in return for killing Winston and serving the High Table for the remainder of his life; John severs half of his ring finger and offers his wedding ring to The Elder to prove his commitment. John returns to New York and is pursued by assassins until he reaches the safe haven of the Continental. John reunites with Winston but decides not to kill him. Instead John and the hotel's concierge Charon fight against the High Table and their enforcers. Successfully defeating waves of attackers, Winston and High Table representative The Adjudicator parley on the hotel roof. Ultimately, Winston shoots John to restore his standing with the High Table and John tumbles from the roof into the street. The Bowery King, recovering from grave wounds inflicted by The Adjudicator's assassin, collects the badly injured John and brings him to his hideout, where he tells John he plans to fight against the High Table. He asks John if he is also \\"pissed off.\\" John replies \\"Yeah.\\" ==Characterization== The character and franchise has been described as a \\"central boogeyman character who can‚Äôt be killed\\" and a \\"modern, action- oriented equivalent of '80s horror franchises\\", and reportedly has a kill count of 306, exceeding Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers combined. Wick's violent one-man crusade has been described as an extreme case of workplace revenge. ==Reception== Since the franchise's inception, the character of John Wick and his development in subsequent sequels have been seen as a reinvigoration of Keanu Reeves's career. The films have a cult following and Reeves's portrayal of the character has been praised. == In other media == John Wick appeared as a crossover skin in the battle royale game Fortnite. This was the result of young children and teens mistaking Reeves for a skin, named The Reaper, in the game. According to Republic World, the skin is one of the most popular in the game. ==References*Film Locations Category:John Wick (franchise) Category:Action film characters Category:Film characters introduced in 2014 Category:Fictional American people Category:Fictional assassins Category:Fictional Belarusian people Category:Fictional Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners Category:Fictional Dait≈ç- ry≈´ Aiki-j≈´jutsu practitioners Category:Fictional judoka Category:Fictional jujutsuka Category:Fictional karateka Category:Fictional Krav Maga practitioners Category:Fictional marksmen and snipers Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional melee weapons practitioners Category:Fictional orphans Category:Fictional Romani people Category:Fictional sambo practitioners Category:Fictional United States Marine Corps personnel Category:Fictional vigilantes Category:Fictional wushu practitioners Category:Martial artists characters in films ","title":"John Wick (character)"},{"id":"61713792","text":"Yalyalup is a suburb of the Western Australian city of Busselton.

Moore by Charles Calverley, 1894 Edward Chandler Moore (August 30, 1827 - August 2, 1891) was a noted American silversmith, art collector, and benefactor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Moore was born in New York City, where his father, John Chandler Moore, was a noted silversmith, and learned his craft in his father's shop. From 1848-1851 he was a partner in the business, and when his father retired, Moore inherited the business. Moore was a highly successful silversmith when he entered an exclusive contract with Tiffany & Co. under which he would work exclusively for Tiffany's as an independent, outside craftsman. In 1868 he joined the firm, working as the firm's chief silver designer until his death 1891. Moore made many improvements in manufacturing processes, adding flatware to Tiffany's silver catalog in 1869. He won a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle in 1867 for his exhibit of silverware, another medal at the Centennial Exposition in 1876, and a special gold medal in 1878 in Paris. In 1889 he was awarded the Legion of Honor. He died in his summer house at Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. Moore amassed a notable collection of art, with a focus on art from Japan, the Islamic world and ancient Greece and Rome. His collection contains somewhere between 1,600 and 1,700 pieces. He first began to study objects to help inform his designs, and subsequently began to collect them. At one time he devoted his attention to Japanese and Chinese porcelains, and later old Persian wares. Over time he became interested in old glass and lusterware porcelains which now form an especially rich part of the collection. His collection includes antique Roman, Cyprian, Etruscan, Merovingian, Venetian, Persian, Arab, German, and Spanish glass; Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hispano-Moresque, Rhodian, Damascus, and Persian ceramics; Persian, Turkish, and Indian metalwork, including Saracenic metal work of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as well as Chinese and Japanese bronzes, swords and sword-guards; Japanese inro, netsuke, lacquer ware, and wood and ivory carvings; and Oriental jewelry, Persian lacquer, antique French and Venetian inlaid straw work, and a fine collection of Tanagra figurines. He bequeathed many objects form his collection to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which will host an exhibit of Moore's work in 2020, describes Moore as \\"the creative force who led Tiffany & Co. to unparalleled originality and success during the second half of the nineteenth century.\\" == References == * \\"Moore, Edward Chandler\\", American National Biography. * \\"Edward Chandler Moore\\", American Silversmiths. * \\"The Edward C.

He is best known for his subversive 'slumscape' paintings ironically featuring Disney characters. He is often cited as the inspiration for Banksy's 2015 Dismaland theme park installation, in which he was a featured artist. == Influences == Gillette grew up in the suburbs outside Detroit and drew a lot of creative inspiration from \\"The Wonderful World of Disney\\" TV show. When he visited the actual Disneyland theme park in 1978, he found himself disappointed by its artificiality, staying for only 30 minutes. As an artist, however, Disney characters, especially Mickey Mouse, continued to hold his interest. Gillette dropped out of college in 1982 and began touring the most \\"beautiful and horrid landscapes\\" he could find, which included the Himalayas and Calcutta, India. He later became a volunteer for Peace Corps. Many of the 'slumscapes' he paints are directly inspired by the residential slums he witnessed in his extensive travels. After moving to Orange County for a teaching position (where Disneyland is based), he became inspired to combine the two distinct aesthetics of residential wastelands and theme parks in his work. Gillette is a self-described pessimist, influenced by the writings of German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. He describes his work as \\"taking the things people love and imposing the worst-case scenario [on them]\\" == Exhibitions == Gillette has been exhibiting his work since 1997, with his first solo show at Broadway Gallery in Santa Ana, CA. The style he is currently known for emerged in a solo show called \\"Slumscapes - Blasphemy Blowout,\\" which depicted American fast food restaurants such as McDonald's against backdrops of slums, as well as well-known cartoon figures juxtaposed with religious iconography. His 2010 solo show at Copro Gallery in Santa Monica, \\"Dismayland,\\" was a commercial success and drew interest in his work from British artist Banksy. The aesthetic and themes established here began to define him as an artist. In 2015, Banksy contacted Gillette through his manager to purchase a ‚ÄúMinnie Hiroshima‚Äù painting (that became the official poster available at the Dismaland gift shop). Afterwards, he invited Gillette to be in a group exhibition in England at what was then described as ‚Äúan abandoned theme park.‚Äù Gillette discovered upon arriving at the unlikely ‚Äúbeach town‚Äù Weston Super Mare, that this park was Dismaland. His pieces sold very quickly at the show. Based upon his success, Gillette began to show in London at the former Lawrence Alkin Gallery ‚Äì now the Rhodes Gallery and internationally elsewhere. Gillette began to explore the actual value of art in his work. In 2017, he mounted a solo show at Gregorio Escalante Gallery in Los Angeles called \\"Total Dismay,\\" that turned the exhibition space into an \\"art landfill.\\" In the show, he premiered a series of new paintings mounted on walls and priced thousands of dollars, while the floor was littered with paper prints that patrons would actually walk on top of, that were for sale for $5. == Dismaland == In Spring 2015, Gillette was messaged on Facebook by Banksy's manager and invited to participate in a secretive group exhibition called Dismaland, a temporary art project organized by Banksy and built in the resort town of Weston-super-Mare, three hours outside of London. The pop-up would be a fully functioning theme park designed as \\"a sinister twist on Disneyland.\\" It opened on August 21, 2015 and ran until September 27. Banksy described it as a \\"family theme park unsuitable for children.\\" Including Gillette, the show featured 58 artists, such as Bill Barminski, Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer, Peter Kennard, and Ben Long. Gillette premiered six new paintings on canvas for the pop-up as part of his \\"Dismayland\\" series. Banksy created ten new works and funded the construction of the exhibition himself. Approximately 4,000 tickets were available for sale per day, priced at ¬£3 each. == References == == External links == * Jeff Gillette on Artsy Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:American graffiti artists ","title":"Jeff Gillette"},{"id":"61714000","text":"Bomb squad most often refers to a team specialised in bomb disposal.

Further Interplast organizations followed worldwide, e.g. in Australia, France and Italy. However, Interplast-Germany as a non-profit aid organization is neither formally, financially nor legally linked to those and acts independently in all matters. (This should be covered in more detail in the corresponding wikipedia articles, but is also evident from eg. the website of Interplast-Germany e.V. and other sources such as PDF p. 50, in german). He is also a photographer and humanitarian activist. == Life and work == Born in Datteln, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schoeneich grew up in a family of physicians. His father, internist Paul Schoeneich, practiced family medicine (GP) in Gelsenkirchen-Erle. From 1965 to 1967, he attended the boarding school of Landschulheim Schloss Heesen. From 1968 to 1974 he studied general medicine in Cologne and passed the state examination. He completed his clinical traineeships in Peru, Japan and the USA, among other countries, from 1972-1974. As a result of a key experience in the Peruvian Andean village of Coina in 1975, he began his studies in general and plastic surgery (amongst others with Ursula Schmidt-Tintemann) at the Klinikum Rechts der Isar in Munich (1975-1986). He received his doctorate in 1977. From 1980 onwards, he travelled to so-called developing countries and to crisis regions in (Southeast-) Asia, Latin America and Africa, to treat the poor, especially children and adolescents. In 1984, Schoeneich joined Interplast-Germany e.V., a non-profit medical aid organisation. In 1990, he opened a clinic for plastic and aesthetic surgery in Munich, which he ran until Spring 2017. In 1994, he founded the Munich section of Interplast-Germany e.V. and since then carries out 3 to 4 humanitarian missions a year in (South-East-)Asia, Africa and the Middle-East. In 2004, he co-founded the Interplast Foundation for Humanitarian Plastic Surgery to promote long-term projects. Since 2012, he is lecturing on medical and ethical aspects of medical humanitarian work at the Technical University of Munich. The lecture series \\"Humanitarian missions and internships in developing countries\\" was subsequently established as an optional part of the medical curriculum. In 2001 Schoeneich and Interplast- Germany e.V. were awarded the Charity Bambi of the Hubert Burda Media Group for their many years of medical aid in Afghanistan. The award was presented to him by actress and physician Maria Furtw√§ngler on November 15, 2001 in Berlin. In 2003, his work was showcased in a documentary titled \\"Unter der Haut - Das zweite Leben von Dr. Schoeneich\\" (\\"Under the skin - The second life of Dr. Schoeneich\\"). In 2006, he received the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his humanitarian work.Information dated July, 10, 2019: \\"Our database indicates that Dr. Schoeneich was awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in December 2006\\"., Ordenskanzlei, Bundespr√§sidialamt, Spreeweg 1, 10557 Berlin === First war surgery mission - Thailand  Cambodia (1980) === For six weeks in Spring 1980, he assisted in war surgery missions in refugee camps Khao-I-Dang and Non(g) Mak Mun between Thailand and Cambodia. He was a member of a medical team of the Soforthilfe e.V., a German non-governmental organization, privately established in Munich at the end of 1979 in response to the Cambodian refugee crisis. Initially in cooperation with Rupert Neudeck's committee \\"Ein Schiff f√ºr Vietnam\\" (\\"A Ship for Vietnam\\"), Soforthilfe e.V. porvided large-scale medical help on the ground during the Emergency Period 1979-1981. Caution: The linked article contains pictures that can be disturbing. In Deutsches √Ñrzteblatt, Schoeneich, along with three colleagues, described the extent of violence in the camps, military attacks and evacuations.. Online version no longer available. === War surgery missions - Pakistan and Afghanistan (1991-2004) === Responding to an appeal launched by the European Union in 1991, he flew to Peshawar, located in the Pakistan-Afghan border region, to support trauma surgeon Ortwin Joch, Interplast colleague and member of the German Afghanistan Committee (DAK), in the treatment of refugees seriously injured during the Afghan civil war. When Kabul was taken by the Mujahideen in 1994, the Peshawar initiative moved its activities from Pakistan to Afghanistan. Ongoing fighting between the troops of Ahmad Shah Massoud and growing Taliban militias made Kabul too insecure a place, so the project was set up 120 kilometers east to Jalalabad. It was here that Schoeneich, with the Interplast section Frankfurt and the help of the German Embassy, financed the reconstruction and conversion of a destroyed building into a hospital. It was inaugurated in September 1995 and, headed by Joch, throughout its existence, the only free-of-charge facility for reconstructive surgery in the region. In September 1996, the Taliban conquered Jalalabad and Kabul. The European Union ceased funding in October 1998. Temporarily supported by the Federal Foreign Office, the Interplast hospital was finally confiscated by the Taliban, forcing the project to be aborted at the end of September 1999. === Burma / Republic of the Union of Myanmar (since 1997) === In 1995, he had met Burmese scholarship holder Khin Maung Lwin (Ludwig-Maximilians-University) in Munich. Through Lwin's mediation, he was authorized by the Burmese Ministry of Health to conduct his first surgical mission in its then capital Yangon in 1997. In order to ensure sustainability and avoid \\"medical colonialism\\", he has since promoted the establishment and expansion of plastic surgery wards, organized equipment training, surgical workshops and scholarships for Burmese colleagues as well as clinical internships. In his 54 surgical missions up to and including 2017, 14 of 21 sites were located in border districts inhabited mainly by \\"ethnic minorities\\" or adjacent to areas of armed conflicts.Value derived from all online sources mentioned. Tabular overview of all missions can be added to the article for verification purposes. (M.v.E.) \\"Surgeons from the Munich section of Interplast Germany\\" The missions in Thai border regions (e.g., Sangkhlaburi) also served ethnic groups persecuted by the Burmese military regime. From 2005, the government granted him access to the so-called Golden Triangle.Date inferred from the summary of all available sources used. While he had previously treated Muslim members of the Rohingya minority in Thandwe and Sittwe, from 2015 onward he intensified his activities in the politically troubled state of Rakhine.  Cyclone Nargis  The night of May 2 to 3, 2008, just returned to Yangon after a 2 weeks surgery mission in central Burma/Myanmar, he there witnessed Cyclone Nargis, one of the most severe tropical cyclones in the history of weather records. In the early morning hours, a state of emergency was declared and the airport was shut down. Like other foreign organizations, Interplast specialists were not allowed to enter the Irrawaddy Delta, the region worst hit by the storm. Forced to inaction, his team flew back to Munich three days later. Due to a news embargo and the travel ban on foreign media representatives, they became of interest to German journalists.

In cooperation with the Amara Health Foundation and the Stiftunglife, he initiated the clinic ship project \\"Swimming Doctors\\" in April 2009, which is still operating today.  Journalist dispute  On 31 May 2008, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published Alice Schwarzers article \\"Renewal from within - Why Burma needs true friends\\". The article challenged Western criticism of the Burmese military government's disaster management as post-colonialist and driven by political interests. To Schoeneich, who had been working there unhindered by the military regime for ten years, she referred to as such a \\"true friend\\", who had been warned well in advance of the storm, and so had the population in Yangon. The head of the cultural section of german news magazine Der Spiegel, responded with an open letter on June 1, 2008. He condemned Schwarzer's reference to the surgeon's freedom of movement, as his case did not reflect the harsh reality his fellow journalists faced in the country. Also the Secretary General of the Society for Threatened Peoples (GfbV) and supporter of the boycott measures, wrote an open protest letter to Schwarzer on June 2, 2008. === China (2006) === In 2004, he performed surgery on the 15-year-old Chinese Xiao Liewen as a team member with his former professor, incrementally reconstructing the burnt right half of her face. For the first time in medical history, the preformation of a nose on the lower abdomen and its transplantation into the face succeeded. A German TV channel filmed the process and aired a documentary in the German TV show Galileo on March 23, 2006. In 2008 and 2013, Galileo aired a follow-up on Liewen's health and professional development. During a two-week mission in China, conducted by Interplast sections Munich and Wiesbaden in June 2006, Schoeneich picked up Liewen in Shanghai and performed follow-up surgery on her in Xuzhou. === Peace Missions === With his \\"Peace Missions\\" in Palestine and Irak in 2011, he abandoned the classic Interplast principle of political neutrality. Inspired by the documentary \\"The Heart of Jenin\\" and the West- Eastern Divan Orchestra, he assembled a surgical team of Christian, Muslim and Jewish colleagues. Their mission was to take place in Summer 2011 in Jenin, West Bank. On April 4, 2011 Juliano Mer-Khamis, Jewish-Palestinian director, activist and founder of \\"The Freedom Theater\\" in Jenin, was shot dead in broad daylight. Since Interplast local associates had also been threatened, the Palestinian Minister of Health moved the planned mission to Nablus, West Bank, where Schoeneich and his interreligious team performed free plastic surgery on 118 Palestinian patients from 23 June to 8 July. A camera crew from Bayerischer Rundfunk, headed by journalist Richard C. Schneider, accompanied the mission. The 30-minute documentary \\"Operation Peace\\" was broadcast on September 5, 2011, in Das Erste (ARD). \\"Operation Peace\\" was mentioned again in Schneider's 2018 book on the Middle East conflict. === Significance for Transsexual Men === In 1976, his then professor Edgar Biemer had started gender-reassignment surgery in Germany. Schoeneich offered this option not only to transsexual women, but also to transsexual men as early as the late 1980s. The surgical techniques he used at the time, he described in the book \\"Im falschen K√∂rper. Alles √ºber Transsexualit√§t\\" (\\"In the wrong body. Everything on Transsexuality\\") in 1991.Schoeneich, Heinrich; Oeking, Gisela (1991), From woman to man - The challenged gender, In: In the wrong body. Everything on Transsexuality.

In the first decade, he ruled together with his older brother Ulrich. After Ulrich's death, Hermann took over the custody of his nephew William and ruled as the de facto head of the family. Under his rule, the House of Celje began expanding its influence from its power base in present-day Slovenia and southern Carinthia to Central Europe and the Balkans. By marriage to the Bosnian princess Catherine, whose exact parentage is disputed, Hermann became the brother-in-law either of the Hungarian and Polish king Louis the Great, or of the Bosnian king Tvrtko I.Peter ≈†tih & al. Slovenska zgodovina od prazgodovinskih kultur do zaƒçetka 21. stoletja (Ljubljana: 2016), p. 136. His son Hermann II further expanded the family's wealth and influence. By the time of his death, Hermann I was the largest landowner in the territory of present- day Slovenia, where his possessions significantly outnumbered those of his Habsburg liege lords. ==Life== Little is known of Hermann's early life. He was the second-born son of Frederick of Sanneck, first Count of Celje, and his wife Diemut from the noble Wallsee family. His father had inherited the Celje Castle and took possession of it in 1332, but it's unclear whether Hermann was born there or in the nearby ≈Ωovnek Castle, their ancestral home. After his father's death in 1359 or 1360, Hermann took over the family estates which were significantly enlarged during his father's tenure, and ruled them together with his older brother Ulrich I. This was in accordance with the family tradition which avoided splitting the inheritance among brothers, and instead opted for shared rule among them. After Ulrich's death in 1368, Hermann became the sole administrator of the Celje estates, ruling also in the name of his 7-year old nephew William. Together with his son Hermann II and nephew William, Hermann took part in the crusade against Samogitians in 1377, as part of the entourage of Duke Albert III of Austria. Hermann died in 1385, and was succeeded by his second-born son Hermann, as his first-born son Hans died already in 1372. ==Marriage and children== Hermann was married to Catherine of Bosnia, a princess from the ruling Kotromaniƒá dynasty.Voje, Ignacij (1981). \\"Katarina Celjska - Kotromaniƒáka in njen peƒçat\\" [Catherine of Cilli ‚Äì Kotromaniƒá and her Seal].

In 2012, Kubecka was responsible for getting the Saudi Aramco network back up and running after it was hit by one of the world's most devastating Shamoon cyberattacks. Kubecka also helped halt a second wave of July 2009 cyberattacks against South Korea. Kubecka has worked for the US Air Force as a Loadmaster, the United States Space Command and is now CEO of HypaSec, a security firm she founded in 2015. She lives and works in the Netherlands. ==Early life== Kubecka's Puerto Rican mother became a robotics programmer and lacking money for daycare would take Kubecka to work with her. Kubecka said she \\"fell in love with programming\\" when she programmed a haunted house on the screen to say \\"boo\\". She continued learning how to program but at the age of 10 got into trouble when she hacked the US Department of Justice, then \\"was not allowed to use computers until she was 18,\\" after which she was recruited by the US Air Force. ==Saudi Aramco security work== In 2012, Kubecka came to prominence when Saudi Aramco's network experienced one of the worst hacks in history and she was contacted, out of the blue, to help. The Saudi Aramco network was flat and the hackers were able to roll through quickly and easily, hitting and infecting about 35,000 computers. Kubecka was contacted by a Saudi Aramco rep and asked to come to Saudi Arabia. After a brief negotiation, Kubecka put together a team of experts and went to Saudi Arabia to rebuild the large oil company's network from scratch. Facing the emergency and immediately following the hardware attack, Saudi Aramco was able to purchase 50,000 computer hard disk drives (right off the production line) during efforts to save their company and bring operations back up. == Cyber Terrorism work == In 2014, Kubecka worked to fix an email and rootkit attack on the Royal Saudi Arabian Embassy in The Hague, Netherlands. The first phase of the attack was caused by a weak email password of 123456 used on the official business embassy email. An Embassy insider and ISIS collaborator attempted to extort money from Prince Mohammed bin Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz, Sumaya Alyusuf and from the Royal Saudi Arabian Embassy of The Hague. During the second phase of the attack, the insider sent an extortion demand of 25,000 USD each from several Middle Eastern and Turkish Embassies. The third phase of the attack was caused by the Diplomatic Corps sending a warning notification to all The Hague embassies via email using CC not BCC, exposing the other official embassy email accounts to the attacker. During the fourth phase of the attack, the insider taunted the Diplomatic Corps, The Hague embassies and hacked into the Secretary to the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia personal Gmail account. The attacker rose the extortion demand to $35,000,000, then to $50,000,000 saying ISIS would destroy the Kurhaus of Scheveningen during the planned National Saudi Day celebrations to which over 400 dignitaries had been invited. After the Shamoon attack and Dutch Embassy hacks, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Saudi Aramco made security a top priority. Stanford University signed an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with one of the security colleges of Saudi Arabia in 2018. ==Career== She worked for Saudi Aramco until mid-2015 when she founded HypaSec. Kubecka is considered an expert on cyberwarfare and presents at trainings and conferences on cyber espionage, security information and event management, Industrial Control Systems Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (ICS SCADA), IT and IOT security topics. Kubecka was the keynote speaker at Security BSides security conference in London in 2017 and a featured speaker at OWASP's Global AppSec Amsterdam 2019. ==Works== * Down the Rabbit Hole An OSINT Journey: Open Source Intelligence Gathering for Penetration Testing (2017) * Hack the World with OSINT.

From 1878 to 1880 he studied law in Strasbourg and Berlin. From 1903 to 1907 he was the German ambassador to the government of Germ√°n Riesco Err√°zuriz in Santiago de Chile and at the same time accredited to the government of Manuel Jos√© Estrada Cabrera in Guatemala . From 1907 to 1908 he was ambassador in Rio de Janeiro where he played a leading role in negotiations related to the laying of sub-sea trans-Atlantic cables. From 1909 to 1911 ambassador in Belgrade and from 1911 to 1914 ambassador in Stockholm. In early 1915 he was ambassador to Argentina. His time as ambassador to Sweden was particularly fraught, as he engaged in a number of attempts to persuade the Swedish government to side with Germany in the First world war. Eventually he was expelled by the Swedish government for this. He was a strong support of Wilhelmine governance and an opponent of parliamentarism, and even considered that Sweden might one day be part of the German Empire. His replacement in the role was Helmuth Lucius von Stoedten, an opponent of Swedish activism. ==Later life== In 1919 he and his wife K√§the (n√©e Peipers) acquired Rotenberg Castle, which he finished rebuilding in 1922. He financed various infrastructure projects, such as the construction of Schlossstrasse and Oberer Schlossstra√üe 1921-1923.

Along with reducing over $4.9 billion in tariffs with about 4,400 item-by-item cuts, it also yielded discussion relating to the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC). One of its achievements was the adoption of a common external tariff by the European Economic Community. Significant concessions on tariffs to agricultural exports were granted by the United States. The Dillon Round was also agreed by 11 other Developed Countries and six Less Developed Countries: Cambodia, Haiti, India, Israel, Pakistan and Peru. Concern was expressed in the US over the potential exclusion by the EEC of traditional trading partners.

He sat in the Irish House of Commons as MP for Belfast, and held office as Third Serjeant-at-law and later as a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). Today he is chiefly remembered for his work in developing the town of Balbriggan, County Dublin.Ball p.164 He was born in Knock, near Balrothery, County Dublin, the third son of Alexander Hamilton (died 1768), solicitor and MP for Killyleagh, and Isabella Maxwell, daughter of Robert Maxwell of Finneborough, County Down.Ball p.218 Hugh Hamilton, Bishop of Ossory, was his elder brother. The Hamiltons had emigrated from Scotland in the early seventeenth century, and were mainly associated with County Down. Dictionary of National Biography Hugh Hamilton, Bishop of Ossory, the judge's elder brother He went to school in Belfast, and matriculated from the University of Dublin in 1749. He entered the Middle Temple in 1750, was called to the Irish Bar in 1756 and became King's Counsel in 1767.Ball p.218 He was MP for Belfast from 1768 to 1776, and served as Third Serjeant-at-law (Ireland) from 1774 to 1776. Hart p.171 He was accused by his political opponents of taking bribes to vote for the Government, but such charges were a normal part of the cut and thrust of eighteenth-century Irish politics and not in themselves evidence of corruption.Ball p.164 He became a Baron of the Court of Exchequer in 1776. As a judge he was described as sitting silently between his quarrelsome colleagues.Ball p.169 He died at Oswestry in 1793.Ball p.218 Although he had a Dublin town house, he lived mainly at Hampton Hall, Balbriggan. Apart from his legal and political career his main interest in life was in developing the town of Balbriggan. He opened factories there, began a cotton manufacturing industry, and encouraged the breeding of horses. He also did much to improve Balbriggan harbor: his proudest achievement was the building of the pier, which was completed in 1763. Reportedly he became something of a bore on the subject: it was said facetiously that only some great preoccupation could cause him to go for more than fifteen minutes without mentioning Balbriggan pier.Ball p.164 The tradition of civic improvement in Balbriggan was continued by his son and grandson. He married his cousin Elizabeth Hamilton, daughter of another George Hamilton, of the County Tyrone branch of the family and his wife Elizabeth Echlin, and had two sons, George and Alexander. George, the eldest son and heir, entered the Church, became Rector of Tyrella, County Down, and was the father, among other children, of George Alexander Hamilton, who like his grandfather was an MP, and later Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.Dictionary of National Biography Alexander served briefly as his father's replacement as MP for Belfast, but died prematurely in 1808.

Moreover \\"employers shall not engage for employment men between the ages of 18 and 50, and women between the ages of 18 and 40, or seek to engage such persons, except through the Ministry of Labour exchanges.\\" ==Calendar== The order was made under the Defence (General) Regulations, 1939, as having effect by virtue of the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945, as extended by the Supplies and Services (Extended Purposes) Act, 1947. This was effectively an extension of wartime powers to peacetime. ==Authority== The order was made on 18 September, came into force on 6 October, a copy was laid before the house on 20 October 1947 and was supposed to expire on 1 January 1949. The period was extended to 1 January 1950 by Statutory Instrument No. 2608, 1948. It was actually withdrawn in March 1950.http://www.unionhistory.info/britainatwork/display.php?irn=972&QueryPage;= ==Background== After World War II Britain was in a difficult financial situation. A significant amount of national assets had been sold to finance the war, and production had been switched to essential supplies, including the military. In addition to a huge war debt, the country had a shortage of coal miners in the newly nationalised coal industry, as well as in textiles (formerly a key export) and agriculture. Investment in most areas of commercial production had been cut back during the war and so conditions in mills and mines were not good. In addition at the time of the order, there were still 700,000 more in the armed forces than at the beginning of the war and 670,000 in government administrative posts, leading to a further shortage of employable staff, apart from those dead or unable to work as a result of the war. The National Government had taken powers during the war that allowed, as well as military conscription, \\"direction\\" of employment, certain reserved occupations, which were not eligible for conscription. War regulations and bills to extend the emergency powers of the government enabled Attlee's Labour government to enact an order as extraparliamentary legislation, which compelled certain groups of people to join or remain in particular industries. ==Opposition== Many occupations and professions were exempt, and this was characterised by Labour MP for Wroughton, Rhys Davies, in his parliamentary motion to annul the order, as controlling the employment of the working class. The infringement of liberties was taken up by others in the debate, from all political parties, including the minister himself, who characterizes it as a necessary evil at a time of national emergency. The order was subject of a correspondence in the pages of the Dartford Chronicle between Margaret Thatcher (then Roberts) and Norman Dodds.https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/100834 ==References== Category:Statutory rules and orders of the United Kingdom ","title":"Control of Engagement Order, 1947"},{"id":"61714637","text":"William Hepburn Buckler, FBA (1867‚Äì1952) was a French-born American classical scholar, archaeologist, diplomat and lawyer. He practised as a lawyer in Baltimore before serving in a number of diplomatic posts, which included service in London during the First World War and membership of the US delegation to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. While a lawyer, Buckler had developed an interest in archaeology and classical scholarship. He was part of the US archaeological expedition (1910‚Äì14) to Sardis in modern-day Turkey and returned there in the 1920s to catalogue and decipher ancient inscriptions uncovered at the site ‚Äì a project he remained involved with throughout the 1930s. He became an expert in the Lydian language and authored two monographs and three volumes of Monumenta Asi√¶ Minoris Antiqua. His scholarship was recognised with three honorary doctorates, a Festschrift (co-edited by his colleague W. M. Calder) and fellowship of the British Academy. == Early life, family and education == Born in Paris, France, on 1 February 1867, Buckler was the only son of Eliza n√©e Ridgely (1828‚Äì1894), daughter of Thomas and Eliza (Eichelberger) Ridgely of Hampton, Maryland, and her second husband Dr Thomas Hepburn Buckler (1812‚Äì1901), who had practised as a physician in his native Baltimore (also in Maryland) until 1866, when he moved to Paris and gained a license to practise there which he renewed until 1890.William Moir Calder, \\"William Hepburn Bucker\\", Proceedings of the British Academy, vol. 40 (1953), p. 275.Burke's Distinguished Families of America (1948), p. 2888.Eugene Fauntleroy Cordell The Medical Annals of Maryland, 1799‚Äì1899: Prepared for the Centennial of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty (Williams & Wilkins Co., 1903), p. 338. Through his mother's first husband, the younger Buckler was half-brother to Henry White, who was the US Ambassador to Italy from 1905 to 1907 and to France from 1907 to 1909, and a signatory of the Treaty of Versailles.\\"Henry White, noted diplomat, 77, dead\\", The New York Times, 16 July 1927, p. 11. == Legal and diplomatic career == Buckler came to England for his university education. He was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1887 and graduated in 1900 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He then completed a postgraduate Bachelor of Laws degree the following year and returned to the United States where he studied at the University of Maryland before he began practising law in Baltimore in 1893 or 1894.John Venn and J.

From 1904 to 1912, Buckler was a trustee of Johns Hopkins University. In 1906, Buckler was appointed secretary to the special US mission to Spain for King Alfonso XIII and Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg's wedding. Thus began a diplomatic career which saw him appointed secretary of the US legation in Madrid the following year, serving until 1909. In 1914, he was appointed a special agent at the US Embassy in London, serving for the duration of the First World War in that capacity. He was part of the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. == Archaeology == Buckler developed an interest in archaeology and classical studies while practising law in Baltimore. After his postings in Spain, he was appointed assistant director of the American expedition to Sardis from 1910 to 1914. By then a series of mostly buried ruins located in the Ottoman Empire, Sardis had been the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, a key city of the Persian and Seleucid empires, the seat of a proconsul under the Roman Empire, and the metropolis of the province Lydia in later Roman and Byzantine times.\\"Sardis\\", Encyclopedia Britannica, 28 May 2018.

In 1923, they co-edited Anatolian Studies Presented to Sir William Mitchell Ramsay (published by Manchester University Press)\\"Sir William Calder 1881‚Äì1960\\", Anatolian Studies, vol. 11 (1961), pp. 29‚Äì37. and Buckler himself authored Lydian Inscriptions (1924) and, with D. M. Robinson, Sardis: Publications of the American Society for the Excavation of Sardis, VII. Greek and Latin Inscriptions (1932). Buckler and Calder carried out further excavations in Asia Minor in 1924 and 1925, which lead to the publication of Monumenta Asi√¶ Minoris Antiqua, of which he worked with Calder to produce volumes 4 to 6 (published between 1933 and 1939). Buckler became a key scholar of the Lydian language and was primarily responsible for deciphering the inscriptions that were uncovered and published in MAMA. In the words of one obituary in the American Journal of Archaeology, Buckler did \\"more than any other American for the exploration and publication of monuments of Asia Minor and Cyprus\\". He was awarded an honorary DLitt by the University of Oxford in 1925 and honorary LLDs by the University of Aberdeen in 1935 and Johns Hopkins University in 1940.

He also did missionary work in many other parts of India for nearly 40 years, including Chupr√°h, Muzafferpore and Buxar, where he was able to spread Christian ideals to locals. == Early life (1809-1838) == One source says that Ziemann was born on November 27, 1809.Lorbeer. ‚ÄúMemoirs of Rev. W. Ziemann : Founder and Missionary of the Ghazipur Mission / by Rev. H.

H. Badley.‚Äù HathiTrust, babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nnc1.cr59894970&view;=1up&seq;=181. Ziemann was born in Gross-Wudicke in the German state Saxony in a village near the town of Rathenow, the third among seven children. His family lived on a house on a farm. In the winter, he went to the village-school and when summer came around, he helped with work on his family's farm. Ziemann grew up in a religious family with regular church attendance and prayer at meals and other parts of the day. Ziemann got his religious influence from his paternal aunt who joined the Moravian brethren and the sisterhood at Niesky. He often referred to her. In Ziemann's twenties, he was called for conscription and was in the infantry to serve in Magdeburg for three years. He was promoted to work at the commissariat. His father died around this time and when he returned from his army duties, he took possession of his parent's house and property where he settled in 1836. That same year on September 25, Ziemann married Miss Friedewicke Wiese. In 1838, her brother died so she and Ziemann went to live with her parents at Zabakuk and he sold his family property. == Call to missionary service (1840-1843) == In 1840 in Zabakuk, a theologian named Pastor Wrede began tutoring Ziemann. this tutoring encouraged him to become a missionary. He went to Berlin and met with Pastor Gossner to ask him to be sent to India to do mission work, after hesitation, Gossner gave permission. Mrs. Ziemann originally said no to accompanying her husband to India, but ended up joining him. Ziemann was blessed in front of the congregation on September 5, 1842 before he left for India. It was during this event of Ziemann that he gave a sermon on Jesus turning water into wine.Mullens. ‚ÄúA Brief Review of Ten Years' Missionary Labour in India between 1852 and 1861 : Prepared from Local Reports and Original Letters / by Joseph Mullens.‚Äù HathiTrust, babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433070293349&view;=1up&seq;=167. Ziemann was the leader of his six-person group and they left Berlin on September 7, 1842. Their journey consisted of going to Hamburg by Postchaise, taking a steamer to Hull and a train to Liverpool, arriving there on September 14, 1842. They left Liverpool on November 23 and arrived in Calcutta, India on April 8, 1843. == Missionary work (1843-1881) == === Early career (1843-1855) === Ziemann did missionary work from 1843-1855 in Chupr√°h, Muzafferpore and Buxar.  Chupr√°h, N√°gp√∫r and language acquisition (1843-1848)  On April 22, 1843, Ziemann and his team left Calcutta for Patn√° and arrived on June 2. They reached Chupr√°h on June 9, where Ziemann learned the Hindust√°n√≠ language. In August, he went to Benares to visit his financial supporter Sir Donald McLeod, a supporter of other missionaries in Central India. On February 8, 1844, he left Chupr√°h to go to Central India. Ziemann and his group arrived in N√°gp√∫r on March 27. Throughout this trip, he preached in Hindust√°n√≠ to locals and gave out Bible sections. He also learned the Mahrath√≠ language there and preached to public audiences daily from 6 am-12 pm and sometimes, locals would throw mud and cow-dung at him. He was forbidden from preaching in October and therefore left N√°gp√∫r on November 1, arriving back at Chupr√°h in January 1845, where he studied the local language, preached, visited village-schools and spent time with orphans.  Muzafferpore (1848-1851)  From March 11, 1848 to January 5, 1851, Ziemann was sent to Muzafferpore for more missionary work, where some locals were baptized. Ziemann made the new Christians stay in their own villages instead of living around the missionaries so as to decrease dependency on the missionaries, even though it was tradition to keep the converts around the missionaries. However, he would visit them, bring them their wives and help them however they needed it. In November 1849, Ziemann was sent to control the Arr√°h Mission, where he got cholera on his first night there. After recovering, he later returned to Muzafferpore. On February 5, 1851, Ziemann returned to the Chupr√°h Mission. At this point, he and his wife have two adopted native children.  Buxar (1852-1855)  On March 18, 1852, Ziemann went to the Buxar Mission, now with three adopted children. Under his orders, the school house was repaired and attended by 75 boys. After getting permission to use the English Church, he held services there. It was in Buxar when Ziemann decided to establish a mission in Ghazipore. Other practical work that Ziemann did is when he sold religious books at a month- long fair to the locals in Bullia in the Ghazipore district for ten rupees ten annas. The missionaries did this to save their books from being destroyed and to give value to the natives, who ended up listening and buying the books. === Later career (1855-1881) ===  Ghazipore Mission (1855-1881)  Ziemann established the Ghazipore Mission in March 1855. Ghazipore is in the North- West Provinces of India. The mission was established on the Ganges river.Richter. ‚ÄúA History of Missions in India / by Julius Richter ; Translated by Sydney H. Moore ; with Coloured Map by Bartholomew.‚Äù HathiTrust, babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951002043618f&view;=1up&seq;=216. He had already been there on his preaching tours. Ziemann took control and reopened the mission for Gossner's Missionary Society. In 1844, three missionaries of this society had previously started a mission in Ghazipore but it was soon terminated. By 1880, Ziemann established a church there with 642 churchgoers. From 1871-1880, foreign missionaries increased from 9 to 21 and there were over 29 000 native Christians. The missionaries would preach, give out religious texts and feed the hungry.Mackay. ‚ÄúFrom London to Lucknow: with Memoranda of Mutinies, Marches, Flights, Fights, and Conversations.

Ziemann worked with another missionary named H√∂ppner. Ziemann's wife took care of local orphans. From this mission, Ziemann maintained several outlying mission locations in including Gonda where he served ion an itinerant basis until the Methodist Episcopal Church in India opened a mission there in January 1865. \\"The Annual Report of the German Mission in Ghazeepore\\" from 1869 reveals the names of the many donors who supported this mission.Annual report of the German Mission in Ghazeepore ... : German Mission in Ghazeepore : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming.

This mission was called economical and was financially supported by Europeans. Ziemann settled permanently in Ghazipore in March 1855. == Return to Germany and back to India and Legacy == Ziemann took a leave of absence for health reasons in February 1875 to Germany. On his way there, he visited Palestine and Jerusalem for religious purposes. He returned to India at the end of 1875. George William Ziemann died on December 26, 1881 in Ghazipore. His death was reported to be mourned in India, England and Germany. Despite Ziemann's successful missionary work, theologian Julius Richter claims that he could also provide an example of what not to do. Ziemann would travel far to preach in many different parts of India, which was universal at the time but changed because it takes time to instill Christian ideas in others' minds with their different values and ideas. == References == Category:1800s births Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1881 deaths Category:People from Havelland Category:German Protestant missionaries Category:Protestant missionaries in India ","title":"George William Ziemann"},{"id":"61714746","text":"Urtis Orlando Blackett (born 24 March 1973) is a Saint Vincentian retired international footballer who played as a goalkeeper. ==Career== Blackett earned one cap for the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national team, coming in a 2000 friendly against Costa Rica.

When he was four years old, his family immigrated to Europe, intending to reach Belgium but instead settling in Vienna, Austria. Although his mother and father were not professional chefs, they found work in a Chinese restaurant, and later went into the restaurant business for themselves. Yang was continually aware of his outsider status while growing up, first as an immigrant in Austria, then as an Austrian in Europe, and later as a foreign passport-holder in China. The varying cultural contexts in which Yang was born and raised became sources of inspiration for his artistic projects, which focus on issues of identity, biography, social change, language, and authenticity. Yang received his higher education at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam, and at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he studied under Michelangelo Pistoletto. == Career == Jun Yang's work includes video, film, sculpture, installations, performance art, and interior and public space design. Beginning in 1997, Yang undertook a series of performance pieces titled As I Saw in Vienna, Cahors (1999), Paris (2000), Wolfsburg (2000), Leipzig (2001), and Stockholm (2002). For each performance he chose an image from a local newspaper and recreated it out of newsprint in a gallery space. He also shot a series of photo booth performances including As I Saw (Photo booth) (1997) and from salariiman to superman (1997). From 1999 to 2000, Yang was an artist-in-residence at the MAK Center for Art and Architecture in Los Angeles, where he used video and installation art to explore the aesthetics of Chinese restaurants and Chinatowns from Hollywood films, as well as his own family's history of emigration and restaurant ownership. After 2001, he opened a number of restaurants in Vienna, including ra'mien and ra'mien go, which he considered to be a continuation of his art and design work, rather than purely commercial ventures. Works such as Soldier Woods (2002), Mail for... (2006), and Jun Yang meets Jun Yang (2015) dealt with questions of language, naming, and identity. Yang branched out into film- making with A Short-Story on Forgetting and Remembering (2007), Norwegian Woods (2008), Seoul Fiction (2010), and The Age of Guilt and Forgiveness (2016). Works such as Paris Syndrome (2007) addressed issues of desire and alienation in modern exurban China and elsewhere. Many of his projects incorporate architecture and space design, such as GfZK Garden (2006), Cafe Paris Syndrome (2007), Hotel Paris Syndrome (2011), and a proposal for a public space - a cinema (2012). In 2017, he designed The Caf√© Leopold at Leopold Museum in Vienna. Yang has participated in numerous international biennials, including Manifesta 2012, Venice 2005, Liverpool 2006, Taipei 2008, Gwangju 2012 and 2018, Bangkok 2018, and Sydney 2018. In 2009, Yang co-founded the Taipei Contemporary Art Center. Yang published the first three volumes of The Monograph Project in 2015, and the second three volumes in 2018. The project covered 18 years of the artist's work, and was completed with two principle collaborators, the curator Barbara Steiner and the designer Oliver Klimpel. In 2018, Art Sonje Center in Seoul held a solo exhibition for Yang, titled The Overview Perspective. In January 2019, Yang participated in a panel discussion at the Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna with Ai Weiwei, Uli Sigg, and Ying Miao. In February 2019, Kunsthaus Graz opened a major retrospective of Yang's work, titled The Artist, the Work, and the Exhibition, which also included work by Mike Kelley, Paul McCarthy, Bruce Yonemoto, Koki Tanaka, siren eun young jung, Lee Kit, and others.

As a two-year-old in 2011 she was rated the best filly of her generation in Japan, after winning both of her races including the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies. In the following spring she ran third in the Tulip Sho and sixth in the Oka Sho before her season was curtailed by injury. She returned in 2013 but failed to win, with her best effort coming on her final start when she finished a close fourth in the Victoria Mile. She died later that year. ==Background== Joie de Vivre was a bay mare bred in Hokkaido by Northern Farm. During her racing career she carried the black, yellow, pink and red colours of Sunday Racing and was trained by Hiroyoshi Matsuda. She was ridden in most of her races by Yuichi Fukunaga. She was a small mare, weighing no more that 436 kg during her racing career. She was from the second crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Marialite and Saxon Warrior. Joie de Vivre's dam Biwa Heidi showed top class form as a juvenile, winning the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies in 1995. As a broodmare she also produced the outstanding racemare Buena Vista. Her dam, the Irish mare Aghsan, was a half-sister to the dam of Manhattan Cafe. ==Racing career== ===2011: two-year-old season=== On 12 November at Kyoto Racecourse, Joie de Vivre made her track debut in a contest for previously unraced juveniles over 1600 metres and won from the colt Temujin and sixteen others. The filly was then stepped up to the highest class for the Grade 1 Hanshin Juvenile Fillies over the same distance at Hanshin Racecourse four weeks later. She started the 5.8/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Sound of Heart (unbeaten in four races), Epice Arome (Kokura Nisai Stakes) and La Scintillante while the other fourteen runners included Fine Choice (Hakodate Nisai Stakes) and I'm Yours (Fantasy Stakes). After racing in mid- division Joie de Vivre produced a strong run on the outside in the straight to take the lead and drew away in the last 100 metres to win by two and a half lengths from I'm Yours. In the official ratings for Japanese two-year-olds Joie de Vivre was rated the best juvenile filly of the year, five pounds ahead of I'm Yours and Sound of Heart and three pounds below the top-rated colt Alfredo. In January 2012 Joie de Vivre was awarded the JRA Award for Best Two- Year-Old Filly at the JRA Awards for 2011, receiving 283 of the 285 votes. ===2012: three-year-old season=== Joie de Vivre made her first appearance of 2012 on 3 March at Hanshin when she started the 0.3/1 favourite for the 1600 metre Tulip Sho, a race which serves as a trial for the Oka Sho. After racing in mid-division she made progress on the wide outside in the straight but sustained her first defeat as she came home third, beaten two and a half lengths and a neck by Hana's Goal and Epice Arome. Despite her defeat, the filly started favourite in an eighteen-runner field for the Oka Sho five weeks later. She raced towards the rear of the field and although she made progress in the closing stages she was unable to catch the leaders and finished sixth, just under three lengths behind the winner Gentildonna. ===2013: four-year- old season=== After a ten month absence, Joie de Vivre returned in February at Kyoto when he finished seventh behind Tosen Ra in the Grade 2 Kyoto Kinen over 2200 metres. She was dropped to Grade 3 class for the Chunichi Shimbun Hai at Chukyo Racecourse on 9 March but came home sixth, three lengths behind the winner Satono Apollo. On 12 May Joie de Vivre was dropped back to 1600 metres for the Grade 1 Victoria Mile at Tokyo Racecourse and started at odds of 12.7/1 in an eighteen runner field. Ridden by Yuga Kawada she came from the rear of the field with a strong late run to finish fourth behind Verxina, Whale Capture and Meine Isabel, beaten a length by the winner.

The painting is currently in the Kunstmuseum Bern. ==Analysis== It was created while Klee was teaching at the Dusseldorf Academy following his trip to Egypt three years prior. The painting process consisted of first applying large squares of muted color on unprimed canvas. Klee then stamped on smaller squares, first in white and then in other diluted colors. The composition is dominated by the shape of a pyramid outlined with stamped lines. The structure could also be interpreted as the roof of a house or a mountain and was likely inspired by the Egyptian pyramids, the Niesen that overlooks Lake Thun in the artist's home country, and the titular Mount Parnassus. Above the pyramid to the right is a bright orange circle that represents the sun. Ad Parnassum was painted during a turning point in Klee's artistic style and is now considered a masterpiece in pointillism.

It is carvel-built, and like other Malay boat, it is a double ender (the bow and stern of the boat is sharp, i.e. having stem and sternpost).Vuuren 1917 op.cit., e.g., Nooteboom, C. 1940: ‚ÄòVaartuigen van Mandar‚Äô. Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, 80. The bow and stern were similar in shape, usually turn sharply because the board is cut, not bent, into shapes. The pattern of the planks indicates that it was no different than traditional boats from 1000 years ago. The first plank is longer than the keel. The plank is arranged from corner to corner with internal dowels. While mainly deckless, there is a low deck abaft the stempost, behind it is a place for washing.Horridge. (1981). p. 14-15. It is built using smooth curved planks, with double quarter rudders, used as a frame and the ribs are placed thereafter. == See also == *Palari *Patorani *Mayang *Benawa == References == == Further reading == * Liebner, Horst H.

It was first found in the Glenariff Valley, Garron Plateau, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, and in some locations in Iceland. The name comes from the town of Garron, in Northern Ireland, which is consequently considered its type locality. The name initially used was that of Garronite, without subfixes, but the discovery in 2015 of a garronite with dominant sodium instead of calcium in the position of interchangeable cations made it necessary to use subfixes, remaining as Garronite-Ca, to distinguish it from the new species, Garronite-Na. == Physical and chemical properties == Garronite-Ca is generally found as masses and nodules with a finely fibrous internal structure, white in color, usually showing a concentric growth structure. This causes the nodules to present with a conchoidal fracture. It is very rare as defined crystals. When crystals appear, they usually show the faces corresponding to {101} and {011}. == Localities == Garronite-Ca is formed under hydrothermal conditions at low temperature. It is a rare zeolite, and very rare in the form of defined crystals. As fibrous masses, filling vacuoles in basalts, it has been found in the county of Antrim, in Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), and in the area of F√°skr√∫√∞sfj√∂r√∞ur (Iceland). It is usually associated with phillipsite, which is located in the outer area of the nodules.

A former police officer, Baughman was suspected, but never convicted of, murdering a close friend and his first wife, before eventually killing his second wife while on a vacation in Antigua and Barbuda. After being sentenced to death for her murder, he hanged himself in prison in 2000, while still on death row. ==Early life== John Baughman was born in Illinois and grew up in Chicago. His father, Bill Baughman, worked on the railroad and was originally from Clinton, Illinois. His mother, Letha Smith Baughman, was a bookkeeper who had been orphaned as a young child and whose first child, a male, died as an infant. Baughman was the only other son of his parents, having two elder sisters. Baughman volunteered for two tours in Vietnam as a Marine infantryman. He later became a heavyset man and had always worn thick-rimmed glasses, which earned him the nickname \\"Bottles\\". He once served as a police officer in Homewood. He married his wife Gertrude, nicknamed \\"Trudy\\", on July 17, 1964; together they had three daughters. During those years, Baughman worked as a security guard, and did electrical work for an unknown company and eventually worked at Honeywell. Despite his credentials, he was described as a rather controlling man. ==Murders== ===Sgt. Dean Pence=== On July 26, 1970, Sgt. Dean Pence, a police officer in Flossmoor, was found murdered near the Prestwick Country Club in Will County. He had been shot with a .38 caliber revolver. A long-time friend of Baughman, then 28, he was killed by the former for being in a suspected affair with John's wife, Gertrude. Despite becoming the lead suspect, with even an arrest and return to Joliet, the grand jury in Will County refused to indict him, and Baughman was allowed to walk free of charges. ===Trudy Baughman=== In 1984, Trudy and John were inspecting some equipment in their garage in Matteson. According to Baughman, his wife suddenly tripped over a stove, which ignited some gasoline and set her on fire. Panicked, Gertrude started flailing around, apparently causing herself an injury to the throat. However, an examination by the coroner proved the story to be false, as the autopsy revealed that Trudy had first been strangled and then subsequently burned. Trudy had recently told Baughman that she wanted a divorce. In spite of the obvious murder scene, during his 1985 trial, Baughman, who claimed his wife's death was accidental, was acquitted by the Cook County judge of murder. He was, yet again, released. In 1988, Baughman's attorney, Fred Aprati, was \\"convicted in federal court of paying bribes to Cook County sheriff\`s police\\". It had been testimony by a county coroner who had not examined Trudy's body -- and not the head coroner, who had examined her body -- that shed doubt on the prosecution's case. https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-12-06-8802220382-story.html ===Valerie Baughman=== Years passed following his first wife's suspicious death, and since long before Trudy's death, Baughman had retired from the police force and now worked as a salesman for the Honeywell company. One night, he attended a singles' dance, where he met a twice-divorced woman named Valerie. She was an energetic customer service representative for 3M, for whom she had worked for 22 years, and had four adult children. They took a liking to each other, and in February 1991, the couple married. Valerie was aware of John's past, but believed the claims that he was innocent, in stark contrast with one of her children. In 1995, the couple went on vacation to St. John's in Antigua and Barbuda, registering at the Royal Antiguan Hotel. Interestingly, employees later testified that Baughman had requested a room for two for the first three nights, but then only a one-person room for the last. On May 27, John took his wife to the roof of the 8-story hotel, where he pushed her off. The fall crushed every bone in Valerie's body, killing her instantly. According to witnesses, Baughman didn't make any attempt to save her from falling. ==Trial, sentence and death== Immediately after, Baughman was arrested and held without bail in Her Majesty's Prison. During the investigation, he explained that his wife had accidentally fallen while they tossed love letters to each other. The coroner, however, declared that she had been pushed to her death. At his trial, Baughman was quoted as saying that he loved his wife very much, but that did not dissuade the jury, whose unanimous vote found him guilty of murder. Sentenced to death, Baughman was escorted out of jail, where Antiguans were cursing at him and cheering for his eventual death, without making a final statement. His lawyer, Gerald Watt, accused the court of bias in favor of the prosecutor, and announced that he was appealing the decision. On May 31, 2000, shortly after his final appeal was rejected, Baughman died by suicide in the Antiguan jail by hanging himself by a bed sheet from his cell window bars. == See also == * List of serial killers in the United States ==References== ==External links== * Category:1941 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Male serial killers Category:American serial killers Category:American people convicted of murder Category:People acquitted of murder Category:American police officers convicted of murder Category:Suicides by hanging Category:Serial killers who committed suicide in prison custody Category:Uxoricides Category:People from Orland Park, Illinois ","title":"John Baughman"},{"id":"61715390","text":"Tyrone Prince (born 12 March 1968) in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) is a Saint Vincent and the Grenadines international footballer, who played in midfield. == Biography == === National team === Tyrone Prince played for the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national football team between 1992 and 2005.

The hurricane then stalled over Grand Bahama for another day, finally pulling away from the island on September 3\\\\.

By August 28, the NHC was forecasting for Dorian to pass near the northern Bahamas as a major hurricane. On August 30, the government of the Bahamas issued a hurricane watch, and later that day a hurricane warning, for the northwestern Bahamas, including the Abacos, Berry Islands, Bimini, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama Island, and New Providence. A hurricane watch was also issued for Andros Island. The advisory meant that hurricane conditions were likely within 48 hours. The warnings were downgraded after Dorian moved away from the country on September 3. Forced evacuations were issued for the Abacos and Grand Bahama on August 31 as Dorian intensified while tracking towards the Bahamas.

Skiffs rented by the Bahamian government shuttled residents of outlying fishing communities to McLean's Town in Grand Bahama. Most major resorts were forced to close. Nine hurricane shelters were opened on Grand Bahama and 15 shelters were opened on the Abacos. Some chose to shelter at resorts instead, despite warnings by government officials that the buildings were unsafe. Prime Minister of the Bahamas Hubert Minnis warned people to \\"not be foolish and try to brave out this hurricane\\", later adding that those that did not evacuate \\"are placing themselves in extreme danger and can expect a catastrophic consequence\\". Airports in the Abacos, Grand Bahama, and Bimini were closed by September 1\\\\. Government workers were ordered to stay indoors once winds outside reached tropical storm-force. ==Impact== Hurricane Dorian's destruction in the Bahamas On September 1, the eye of Hurricane Dorian made landfall on the Abaco Islands with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h), making it the strongest hurricane on record to affect the Bahamas. On September 2, the eye of Dorian moved over the eastern end of Grand Bahama Island, and drifted across the island. Bahamian Minister of Agriculture Michael Pintard reported an estimated storm tide of at his home on Grand Bahama. Dorian also dropped an estimated of rain over the Bahamas. Hurricane Dorian killed at least 70 people in the Bahamas - 60 on Abaco and 10 on Grand Bahama. One of the fatalities was classified as indirect. Damage amounted to US$3.4 billion. Insured losses alone were confirmed to be at least US$1 billion. Across the Bahamas, the storm left at least 70,000 people homeless. An estimated 13,000 homes, constituting 45% of the homes on the Abacos and Grand Bahama, suffered severe damage or were completely destroyed. ===Abaco Islands=== Hope Town on September 5 Hurricane Dorian knocked out the power, water, telecommunications, and sewage service on the Abacos. For several days, Marsh Harbour Airport on Great Abaco was underwater, and the control tower was damaged by the waters. The airport was closed on September 4. About 90% of the infrastructure in Marsh Harbour was damaged. The shantytowns of Marsh Harbour, housing mostly poor Haitian immigrants, were completely destroyed. In central and northern Abaco, Dorian severely damaged roadways, as well as thousands of houses, with 60% of homes in northern Abaco damaged or destroyed. The power grid serving the entirety of the Abacos was destroyed. The terminal building of Treasure Cay Airport suffered significant damage. ===Grand Bahama=== There was an island-wide power outage on Grand Bahama Island, and an oil refinery was damaged. About 300 homes on the island were destroyed or severely damaged, with the heaviest damage on the eastern side of the island. At least 60% of Grand Bahama Island was left submerged as Dorian moved away on September 3. Grand Bahama International Airport went underwater by 07:00 UTC September 2, with water levels reaching 6 ft (2 m). Strong winds at the airport severely damaged buildings and aircraft, leaving debris strewn across the airport and surrounding roads. Floodwaters and sewage contaminated Rand Memorial Hospital. The operating room, intensive care unit, and the wards were rendered unusable after being tainted by sewage, while mold outbreaks after the floodwaters receded forced more parts of the hospital to be evacuated. The two main supermarkets in Freeport, as well as their warehouses, were inundated by storm surge. ===Elsewhere=== At 11:24 UTC on September 2, 2019, total power was lost on the island of New Providence. The following day, by 1:50 (UTC), 40% of power had been restored. ==Aftermath== U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents deliver relief supplies to the Bahamas The National Emergency Management Agency of the Bahamas (NEMA) handled the response to the hurricane, working with the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency. In the days after Dorian affected the Bahamas, officials surveyed the damage by air. Residents in the Abacos and Grand Bahama suffered from water shortages, power outages, and a lack of telecommunications; these conditions created difficulty in handling the logistics of the disaster. After the storm, at least 2,000 people stayed in government shelters. Thousands of people left Abaco and Grand Bahama in the days after the storm, with the Department of Rehabilitative Welfare Services in New Providence recording 6,854 evacuees entering Nassau by air from September 5‚Äì13. Several cruise companies redirected their ships to bring aid and transport passengers off the affected islands. Bahamasair offered free flights out of Abaco and Grand Bahama beginning September 5, though some passengers said they still had to pay. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force and the Royal Bahamas Police Force were deployed to Grand Bahama and Abaco via boat. Widespread looting, however, still occurred in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane. On September 5, the Central Emergency Response Fund of the United Nations provided US$1 million for initial emergency aid. The World Food Programme sent a team of 15 experts to coordinate emergency operations. The agency also provided power generators and 14,700 ready-to-eat meals. The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility paid the Bahamas about US$10.9 million on September 6, due to the country's insurance policy being activated. T√©l√©coms Sans Fronti√®res was the first non-governmental organization (NGO) on Abaco, which worked to re-establish satellite connection. The Pan American Health Organization sent a team of doctors, nurses, and 34 tons of medical equipment for a three-month stay in the country. On September 8, the Pan American Health Organization launched a $3.5 million appeal to cover health care related needs in the country.https://reliefweb.int/report/bahamas/paho-issues-35-million-donor- appeal-humanitarian-health-response-bahamas The International Organization for Migration provided 1,000 tarpaulins to the country. Team Rubicon Canada disaster response volunteers arrived on Grand Bahama and Great Abaco Islands on Sept 17 and joined teams from the US and UK in providing disaster response. The majority of the Team Rubicon Canada efforts were centered on clearing debris at key facilities and structures in Marsh Harbour. The United Kingdom pledged ¬£1.5 million to support the RFA Mounts Bay, which delivered emergency supplies and a helicopter. The government of the British Virgin Islands pledged US$100,000 to the Bahamas. The United States provided four helicopters to assist in search and rescue operations, while their Coast Guard also helped to rescue residents trapped by floodwaters. The Netherlands announced on September 5 that they would send two naval ships with supplies from nearby Sint Maarten. On September 6, Canada sent a CC-130J Hercules aircraft to Nassau, joining the Jamaican Defence Force's Disaster Assistance Response Team. Canada also pledged C$500,000 in humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, Canadian- based charity GlobalMedic sent in volunteers carrying water purification units and emergency hygiene kits. Japan provided tents and blankets through their Japan International Cooperation Agency. India announced it would send US$1 million in aid on September 8, while South Korea sent US$200,000 in humanitarian assistance the next day. On September 11, NEMA reported that 2,500 people were still missing; this figure was revised down to 1,300 the next day. Recovery efforts were hampered slightly on September 13‚Äì14 as Tropical Storm Humberto passed within 30 mi (45 km) east of the Abaco Islands, requiring the issuance of tropical storm warnings for the northwestern Bahamas. Impacts were minimal, however, as the strongest winds and rain were on the eastern flank of Humberto and thus stayed away from the Bahamas. As of September 15, about 2,100 people remained in 20 shelters across New Providence, Grand Bahama, and Abaco. The Ministry for Disaster Preparedness, Management, and Reconstruction in Nassau received $3.6 million dollars-worth of modular shelters, medical evacuation boats, and construction materials from the United States embassy in Nassau. This donation was an addition to what was nearly $38 million in assistance from the United States to disaster recovery in The Bahamas since Hurricane Dorian. ==Death toll and search for survivors== As of December 22, 2019, the known death toll is 70, with officials indicating the true toll may be more than 600. The number of missing persons fell from 1300 the third week of September to under 300 in October, when it was last updated. Police Commissioner Anthony Ferguson stated that the final toll from the hurricane will likely never be known, although when the National Hurricane Center's final report was released, estimates of between 200 and 300 were given. Within a week of the hurricane's impact U.S. and Canadian urban search and rescue teams were deployed across Abaco and Grand Bahamas. Morgues in Abaco and Nassau reached capacity within a week of the hurricane, necessitating the use of refrigerated shipping containers. Bahamian officials advised rescuers to mark corpses' locations rather than collect them, which was also necessary for canine teams unable to confirm finds obscured under debris. Corpses remained buried under debris for nearly three weeks after the hurricane, with decomposition leading to reports of overwhelming miasma in many communities. ==See also== *Effects of Hurricane Andrew in The Bahamas ‚Äì another Category 5 hurricane to affect the country *Hurricane Dorian *Hurricane Lorenzo ‚Äì the second Category 5 hurricane of the 2019 season ==References== ==External links== *ReliefWeb: Hurricane Dorian - Aug 2019 Dorian Bahamas Category:2019 in the Bahamas Dorian ","title":"Effects of Hurricane Dorian in The Bahamas"},{"id":"61715482","text":"The Philippine‚ÄìJapanese Friendship Tower is a monument in Bagac, Bataan, Philippines. ==History== The site of the Friendship Tower in Bagac, Bataan is located about from where the Bataan Death March of April 1942 took place which caused the deaths of 10,000 war prisoners.

To a large extent this is achieved by avoiding contact with sensitive reef life, but it also applies to diving on historical wrecks and in caves with delicate rock formations. It is in the interests of diving tourism service providers to help protect the condition of the dive sites on which their businesses rely. They can contribute by encouraging and teaching low impact diving and following best-practice procedures for diving in sensitive areas. Low impact diving training has been shown to be effective in reducing diver contact with the bottom, the most common cause of reef damage. The environmental impact of scuba divers has a behavioural component and a skill component. The diver needs to pay attention and actively avoid harmful contact with the surroundings, and it is only possible to do so if the necessary will and competence exist. Many of the skills are not included in entry level diver training, but they are part of technical diver training. There are also training programmes specifically focused on low impact diving in various environments. == Scope == === Techniques === The techniques are intended to minimise the effects of recreational scuba diving activities on the environment. *Care is taken during shore entries and exits, paths are used and shore habitats are treated with due care. *Water is entered over sand and gravel where this can allow adjustments and gear checks with least impact. *Equipment is rigged and operated to avoid contact with the benthos. No equipment is left to dangle below the diver. *The divers should be weighted correctly so that neutral buoyancy can be achieved with minimal inflation at any point in the planned dive. (for safety the diver must be able to float at the start and sink at the end of the dive) *Divers maintain neutral buoyancy throughout the dive to avoid requiring upward thrust to maintain depth, as downward fin-wash will disturb the bottom. *Divers remain aware of their depth and proximity to the bottom, particularly in darkness and low visibility, in tight quarters, and when taking photographs. *Divers check the size of a gap they intend to pass through to ensure that they will not contact sides, bottom, or where it exists, the overhead. *If contact with the reef is unavoidable to prevent drift, rock or dead coral is used. *Finning techniques are chosen to minimise risk of contact and fin-wash impingement on sediment or loose objects. *Contact with living organisms is avoided. *Disturbing and harassment of animals that might affect their natural behaviour is avoided. This particularly includes feeding, chasing, blocking, and riding animals. *No living or dead organisms are collected. *Photographs are taken with minimum disturbance and minimum exposure to bright light at night. Some sources recommend the use of a short metal probe (reef hook or muck stick) to make minimal area contact with the reef when it is necessary, but this practice is controversial. == Causes of diver damage to the environment == === Behavioural problems === Dive guides are expected to provide a good example for their clients, and should refrain from physically handling marine life, or making contact with sensitive benthic organisms, but they have often been observed to do these things while pointing out items of interest. This behaviour may vary regionally. Dive guides are commonly certified at divemaster level, which includes rescue skills and relatively advanced buoyancy control skills, so they should generally already have the skills to avoid contact with the bottom, and they are usually familiar with the local environment through experience. Understanding the consequences of contact with sensitive organisms or structures may be lacking. Other skilled divers may exhibit similar behaviour, but be less aware of the local environmental sensitivity. === Competence problems === Entry level diver training does not routinely put much emphasis on the skills of low impact diving. Most entry level courses are trimmed down to the minimum consistent with acceptable risk to the diver, so that they can be completed in the least time reasonably possible for the average participant. A large proportion of recreational divers do not take training that teaches the skills required to effectively limit contact with the solid environment, though this aspect of diving skill is part of most training for diving in overhead environments, where the skills are relevant to diver safety as well as environmental conservation, so the greatest recorded impact is in open water diving in easily accessible and popular but sensitive ecosystems, where fragile and often brittle organisms can be visibly damaged by clumsy and careless divers, and the damage remains obvious over long periods and is seen by many. Tropical coral reefs have received more attention than most other diving environments by researchers, and there are a relatively large number of papers in the literature covering diver impact on these environments. == Diver training == Recreational diver training has historically followed two philosophies, based on the business structure of the training agencies. The not-for profit agencies tend to focus on developing the diver's competence in relatively fewer stages, and provide more content over a longer programme, then the for-profit agencies, which maximise income and customer convenience by providing a larger number of shorter courses with less content and fewer skills. The more advanced skills and knowledge, including courses focusing on key diving skills like good buoyancy control and trim, and environmental awareness, are available by both routes, but a large number of divers never progress beyond the entry level certification, and only dive on vacation, a system by which skills are more likely to deteriorate than improve due to long periods of inactivity. Low impact diver training programs appear to be effective for a large range of pre-existing skill and certification levels. Similar training from various providers should have similar results. Many of the relevant skills are included in technical diver training, particularly cave and wreck diving, where they are also important for safety. Refresher courses focused on low impact diving skills and conducted in waters where environmental damage is unlikely can allow tourists who have lost skills through inactivity to regain or improve these skills before venturing into sensitive environments. Having a neutrally buoyant, horizontally trimmed, body position is the first step to low impact diving. This requires appropriate weighting, accurate buoyancy compensation, and a vertical alignment between the centre of buoyancy and centre of gravity when horizontal. *Correct weighting is a prerequisite for good buoyancy control *Good buoyancy control is needed for level trim *Level trim brings the fins higher above the benthos on most reefs where they are less likely to make direct contact and where fin wash is less likely to impinge on the bottom *Appropriate finning technique chosen should reduce risk of reef impact - It can be selected to suit lateral or vertical proximity to the nearest solid surface While neutrally buoyant, the diver can move in the horizontal plane by applying fin thrust only in the horizontal plane. The finning techniques used are all standard techniques used by technical divers and work best with fairly stiff paddle bladed fins: **The frog kick is an energy efficient stroke at low speeds. It directs the fin thrust directly backwards which is useful in silty environments and places with very delicate bottom dwelling organisms. The modified frog kick is a reduced version of the frog kick, with feet raised by bending the knees, suitable for places where there is vulnerable structure to the sides. **The modified flutter kick is based on the regular flutter kick, but with the fins raised above the horizontal by bending the knees, and using small movements of the knees and ankles. Thrust is directed mainly backwards and the fins remain well above the bottom and have very little sideways movement, so good in narrow spaces. **The reverse kick is very useful, allowing divers to move in reverse, and also useful for positional control, but it only works well with moderately rigid paddle type fins **The Helicopter turn is a technique to rotate the diver about a vertical axis on the spot using mainly lower leg and ankle action, also from a horizontal trim with raised feet. *Reduction of dangling equipment - reduces risk of low-hanging items contacting reef when in close proximity *Awareness of proximity to surroundings - allows avoidance of movements which will result in reef contact, particularly high impact contact *Understanding of ecological effects of reef contact - allows avoidance of particularly vulnerable organisms *Adjusting proximity to suit sea conditions - clearance between diver and benthos can be adjusted to allow acceptable risk of contact for variations in surge and current. === Diamond Reef System === The Diamond Reef System is a safety-based diving curriculum that uses a portable, collapsible underwater obstacle course to simulate a reef or dive wreck structure. The program is used to train divers to utilize proper body positioning and safe interaction with coral reefs, fragile marine ecosystems and shipwrecks. This program was adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and dive training operations worldwide. === PADI Low Impact Diver === The PADI Low Impact Diver training program is targeted at certiÔ¨Åed divers of any experience level. It includes classroom theory, confined water exercises and open water dives over two days. The focus is on buoyancy, streamlining, weighting, trim and propulsion techniques beyond the standard entry level courses of PADI and SSI. Certification requires satisfactory demonstration of the skills in confined and open water. This training is available in parts of the Asia-Pacific region. === BSAC Marine Conservation === The British Sub-Aqua Club and Big Blue Conservation provide a course to educate divers about problems affecting the marine ecology. The targeted skills are buoyancy control and air consumption improvement. The training is held as a workshop with two buoyancy skills dives. There is an optional certificated extension covering knowledge of the ocean environment, including field identification of marine organisms, and ecological monitoring and conservation dives over a 4 day 5 dive course. == References == Category:Recreational diving Category:Marine conservation ","title":"Low impact diving"},{"id":"61715531","text":"A nurse works in hospital conditions similar to where Furey worked in Vietnam. Joan A. Furey (born in Brooklyn, New York in 1946) is a United States Army nurse veteran. She began her military service in 1968 when she joined the Army Nurse Corps. Her patriotism influenced her volunteered deployment to Vietnam in 1969 where she served as a second lieutenant and eventually earned the Bronze Star. Her dedicated service continued when she returned home as Furey focused on aiding other returning Vietnam veterans. Her post-war accomplishments include earning her master's degree in nursing from New York University in 1975, pioneering studies in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) through her service in the Department of Veteran Affairs, and her service as the Director of Center for Women Veterans. == Early life == Joan A. Furey was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1946 and grew up on Long Island during her childhood. Growing up in a patriotic home, she was raised by a father who was a World War II veteran. In an interview later in her life, she spoke more candidly about her father's service. He served in Germany and France where he was wounded on the front lines. After returning home, he was diagnosed with ‚ÄúSoldiers Heart‚Äù and Furey attributes this to PTSD, even though it had not been specifically labeled and diagnosed yet. She remembers attending Memorial and Veteran Day parades. Her love for her country even at a young age propelled her future career. Furey recalls knowing she wanted to be a nurse as early as ten years of age. She attended and graduated from the Pilgrim State Hospital School of Nursing in Brentwood, New York in 1967. Furey remembers two very opposite views of the Vietnam War. While her peers protested at Columbia University in early 1968, she felt no pressure to stand with them. The country was divided as the war in Vietnam raged on and prominent Civil Rights Leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in April 1968. Meanwhile, North Vietnamese and Viet Cong soldiers planned attacks all across South Vietnam in January 1968, in what is known as the first Tet Offensive. Instead of protesting, Furey chose to go to war. Furey was awarded the bronze star for her service as a nurse in Vietnam. == War service == In July 1968, Furey left for basic training at Fort Sam Houston's Medical Field Service School. There she learned basic Army Corps protocol including administration duties, military rank and positions, and understanding common medical departments. In a short six-week period, she excelled in medical training which often included performing treatments on bleeding goats. After basic training, she served at Letterman Hospital in San Francisco, California. Her time there helped prepare her for life at war in Vietnam as she worked in the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency room. While there she cared for wounded Vietnam War soldiers with injuries ranging from shrapnel wounds to amputations. F urey deployed to Vietnam on January 27, 1969 and remembers bombing on her first sleepless night in the battle field at Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam. She was transferred to a very short-handed unit in the Central Highlands, the 71st Evacuation Hospital in Pleiku, Vietnam. Her experience in the ICU at Letterman Hospital allowed her responsibility in the ICU at the 71st Evacuation Hospital, even as a young nurse. As many nurses, Furey had to detach her emotions from the soldiers she worked on and the war itself. The demoralizing war and the unanswered questions of why America was involved took a toll on her as the war raged on. Furey spent a full year in the ICU unit as she refused to be rotated out after six months. Her nursing efforts saw her care after not only U.S and ARVN soldiers, but also for Vietnamese civilians. She was discharged from the Army in 1970, and returned home after spending a full year in the service of her country in Vietnam. She was awarded the Bronze Star for her patriotic duty and heroic nursing efforts. == Post-war life == The Vietnam War Women's Memorial depicts the suffering of many female veterans of the war, whom Furey sought to help after the war through her work with the VA. Furey returned home and went back to school aided by the G.I. Bill. She received her Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree from Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York, then received her Master of Science in Nursing degree from New York University in Manhattan, New York. Her post-war efforts directly correspond with her service in Vietnam, as she pioneered efforts in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and women veterans' affairs. Her career is heavily based in nursing efforts for the Department of Veteran Affairs, where she served for 30 years. She worked all over the country in veterans' projects including in Bay Pines, Florida and Menlo Park, California in various capacities. She helped conduct research in PTSD and the psychological effects of war on women veterans. === Work in PTSD === Although Furey's time at war was short, the impact of her service was life-changing. Like her, many other veterans returned home, but their minds suffered from major damage. Tragedy, bloodshed, and death caused many veterans to suffer from what is now called post- traumatic stress disorder, a term coined in the 1970s after the effects of the Vietnam War. Furey devoted her life to this cause, helping and aiding women veterans who suffered from PTSD, and who were often forgotten by the general public. Furey began working for Veteran Affairs in 1978, and was stationed as a nurse at the VA Medical Center in Bay Pines, Florida. Over the next several years, she found herself advancing in VA ranks and participating in state-of- the-art research that would define her career. She was named the Director of the Department of Veteran Affairs' Center for Women Veterans in 1995. As associate director of education at the Palo Alto, California Medical Center, Furey pioneered the first-ever Veteran Affairs National Center for Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder. Here, she established an in-house treatment program for women returning from war. Furey was known for her proficiency and knowledge in PTSD study, and even testified before Congress in 2000, proving statistics on women veterans and their role in society. She tried to get more aid and help from the government to support these women. She worked on numerous scholarly articles and research projects, bringing to light the effects of war on servicewomen. Her most well-known accomplishment is her work on the Visions of War: Dreams of Peace anthology. === Visions of War: Dreams of Peace === In 1991, Furey co-edited a compilation of poetry pieces by veteran women who served in Vietnam with another former Army nurse, Lynda Van Devanter. The anthology brought to life the voices of women who served as nurses in the battlefields of Vietnam. An interview at the United States Air Force Academy in 1999 with Donald Anderson was supposed to capture her thoughts on the book, but the interview discussed much more. After Furey explained that her most favorite piece of Vietnam War literature was Tim O‚ÄôBrien's \\"How to Tell a True War Story\\" from The Things They Carried, Anderson asked her about literature from the view of a woman. She explained her work on the poetry pieces. She said women were not willing to use their names in correspondence with their work, as they feared the stories would not be appreciated, and that readers would not accept their point of view on war. Furey, along with co-author Van Devanter, encouraged the women to let their voices be heard, to help them understand many were feeling the same anxieties about their experiences in Vietnam. They helped the women find meaning in their moving tributes. Furey says that many women, including herself, came from nursing backgrounds, but that the young girls had never experienced injuries like they saw in Vietnam. The experiences had two outcomes for nurses: they either empowered the women, or completely destroyed them. She explains how real PTSD was for these returning nurses, and how neglected they felt because they had to worry about the dying soldier rather than their own pain and suffering. === Awards and accomplishments === Furey has authored several published pieces, and was co-author of the poetry anthology Visions of War: Dreams of Peace. She has received many awards, including the 1998 National Public Service Award, and the 1998 the Common Cause Public Service Achievement Award. In 1999, she was the recipient of the Women Executives in State Government \\"Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award\\". She received the Department of Veteran Affairs Exceptional Service Award in 2000, and the Veteran Affairs Distinguished Career Award in 2004. She was inducted into the New York State Veterans Hall of Fame in 2015. Furey appeared in the PBS documentary The Vietnam War. ==References== Category:Living people Category:People from Brooklyn Category:1946 births Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:American military nurses Category:Female United States Army personnel Category:New York University alumni Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Stony Brook University alumni Category:United States Department of Veterans Affairs officials ","title":"Joan A.

His last recording is on the 2018 album We Came to Play. ==Career== Thomas grew up in the US state of Georgia. He moved to New York City in 1965 and co-founded his own band with guitarist Hearlon \\"Cheese\\" Martin. He was the bassist as well as the lead vocalist of the group. He said: \\"I did my own thing, which is to keep a nice bottom in the pocket. I never bothered with any fancy stuff because I always did the singing in my bands, and you can't be fancy and sing\\". In 1971 James Brown saw the band at Smalls Paradise club in Harlem. Brown was in search of new musicians for his own band. He did an impromptu performance with the band and decided to hire the whole group. Thomas said his band used to cover Brown's songs and that joining Brown was a smooth transition for them. He recorded on Brown's releases during 1970s. The first album titled Hot Pants was in 1971. He also recorded on releases by The J.B.'s. Many of these recordings were later sampled in hip hop music, such as \\"Pass the Peas\\", \\"Gimme Some More\\", and \\"Escape-ism\\". Thomas performed with Brown for more than thirty years, longer than other bassists in that position. He recorded on several R&B; number one hits such as \\"Hot Pants\\", \\"Make It Funky\\", and \\"Papa Don't Take No Mess\\". In a 2005 interview he expressed satisfaction with his work, stating: \\"I've been involved in one of the biggest, most legendary acts in the world. It's gone on for a long time ‚Äì 33 years, on and off ‚Äì and I feel good about the musicians I've played with\\". After Brown's death in 2006, Thomas transitioned back to fronting his own group and collaborating with various bands.

Many manufacturers would have marketed this boat as a 27 footer, as did Tanzer. And with a displacement of 6000 pounds, this boat is reaching the upper limits of what can be realistically pushed around with an outboard motor. The PY was available with an optional inboard engine.\\" In a paceship.org review Jay Moran concluded, \\"the PY 26 is quite large for its length, but the boat still sails very well, even in light air with a 150% genoa. In heavy airs, the boat feels stable, secure and is usually remains fairly dry. The large tiller steered outboard rudder makes the boat very responsive and provides excellent helm feedback. In summary this is a well built, roomy, and beautiful looking, high performance sailboat\\". In an owner review Tristan Nettles wrote, \\"all in all the PY26 is a strong and capable boat that needs 10 knots or more of breeze to really handle well. It is simple in its systems and capable of offshore passages. My biggest knock against the boat is its underpowered engine. The boat is very big and spacious for its size.

First parts were still published in 1802 by Friedrich Wilmans, but its final form was published by Goethe in 1807. == Development history == In 1795, four years after the premier of The Magic Flute, Goethe began to plan a sequel to Mozart's opera.Borchmeyer, Dieter, ed.: Johann Wolfgang Goethe. Dramen 1791-1832. Frankfurt am Main 1993 (Johann Wolfgang Goethe. S√§mtliche Werke, Briefe, Tageb√ºcher und Gespr√§che; vol. 6). p. 1049. Originally Goethe had envisaged his Magic Flute II for a great success on stage. But his working process was consistently interrupted, thus the development was protracted. Besides Goethe already stated worries about finding the right composer in 1795. Another negative factor was added as Emanuel Schikaneder, the librettist of Mozart's The Magic Flute, published an own sequel in cooperation with the composer Peter Winter. Goethe's The Magic Flute Part Two is published for the first time by Friedrich Wilmans in 1802. The subtitle Draft of a Dramatic Fairy Tale still reveals a stage play character.Waldura, Markus: \\"Der Zauberfl√∂te Zweyter Theil\\". Musikalische Konzeption einer nicht komponierten Oper. In: Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht, ed.: Archiv f√ºr Musikwissenschaft, Stuttgart 1993 (Jg. 50. 1993, H. 4), pp. 259-290, p. 290. In 1807 Goethe published the Magic Flute II as a fragmentary closet play, which was as far as it was taken. The difference to the earlier version is a longer plot and an apotheosis as ending, which was a traditional final scene of plays in that time.Brown, Jane K.: An den Grenzen des M√∂glichen. Goethe und \\"Die Zauberfl√∂te\\". In: Mathis Mayer, ed.: Modell \\"Zauberfl√∂te\\". Der Kredit des M√∂glichen. Kulturgeschichtliche Spiegelungen erfundener Wahrheiten, Hildesheim 2007 (Echo; Bd. 10), pp. 187-200, p. 190. Also a plot on the symbolic level is completed at the end.Cebadal, George, ed.: Goethes: Die Zauberfl√∂te II. Die Entdeckung von Goethes √§gyptischen Mysterien im Bindeglied zwischen Mozarts \\"Zauberfl√∂te\\" und der \\"Faust\\"-Dichtung. Vollst√§ndiges Textbuch von Goethes \\"Der Zauberfl√∂te zweyter Theil ‚Äì Fragment\\" mit einer Einleitung und Neuinterpretation von George Cebadal. Norderstedt 2016, p. 65. However, the main story is not completed. Notes and drafts of Goethe give insights in his previous plans and reveal opportunities for a much longer plot; but a reconstruction is very speculative. In the literary criticism is the thesis supported, that Goethe continued symbols and other ideas of his Magic Flute II in other works, especially the Faustian poetry.Brown, Jane K.: An den Grenzen des M√∂glichen. Goethe und \\"Die Zauberfl√∂te\\". In: Mathis Mayer, ed.: Modell \\"Zauberfl√∂te\\". Der Kredit des M√∂glichen. Kulturgeschichtliche Spiegelungen erfundener Wahrheiten, Hildesheim 2007 (Echo; Bd. 10), pp. 187-200. p. 190. Even the now strange mixture between opera and closet play is used in Faust II at central points. Thomas Mann even described Goethe's Magic Flute as the \\"small Faust [...] where the Homunculus and the son are still one in the luminescent box\\".\\"Das ist der kleine 'Faust', ‚Äì die 'Zauberfl√∂te', wo Homunculus und der Sohn noch Eines sind im leuchtenden K√§stchen ...\\" (Mann, Thomas: Lotte in Weimar. Frankfurt am Main 1965. p. 263) == Plot == === Scenes 1-2 === At the beginning one hears about a not fully succeeded plan of revenge by a report of Monostatos to the Queen of the Night: As Pamina and Tamino were expecting a childbirth, the Queen of the Night sent out Monostatos to kidnap the child immediately after delivery. But Monostatos had only managed to put the child inside a magical coffin as he felt an interruption by a strong magical power. Afraid of this power and Sarastro's approaching Monostatos decided to flee, but previously he still took a moment to seal the coffin by the Queen's magic. Thus, the son of Pamina and Tamino should be sealed for all eternity or die, if the parents would see their son. The second part of the curse is now announced by a Greeklike chorus, that apparently determines the destiny. === Scenes 3-4 === Then the scene shifts to the realm of the sun, where a group of ladies, according to the directions of Sarastro's wise men, keeps the coffin in motion to preserve the child from death. === Scene 5 === Papagena and Papageno live in a natural region, which appears like a cockaigne. But neither a golden waterfall nor the magic flute (Tamino's gift to their wedding) and glockenspiel, that grant roasted birds flying directly into the mouth, cannot distract them from their sadness over not having children. From the hidden a Greeklike chorus advises them to be active and go working on the one hand, on the other hand they should also enjoy calm. Papagena and Papageno follow the advice. === Scenes 6-7 === In the temple of Sarastro's priesthood the priests have gathered to welcome a brother, who was on pilgrimage for one year. According to the rules of the priesthood now they have to chose a new pilgrim from among the priests by lot. The lot falls to Sarastro. === Scene 8 === According to an omen Pamina wants to dedicate the coffin to the sun. Her entourage sets the coffin on an altar. After a prayer the earth starts shaking. The altar sinks together with the coffin into the earth. Pamina desperately stays behind. === Scenes 9-11 === Papagena and Papageno find big and beautiful eggs in their home. Sarastro appears and helps with magical power whereby three children hatch out of the eggs. Then Sarastro informs them about the misery of Pamina and Tamino. After the disappearing of the coffin Pamina visited Tamino. In the moment they saw each other they fall into a periodic sleep from which they only awoke for a short time just to yield to despair. In this way they are cursed up to now. Sarastro calls Papageno and his family to visit the royal court. The jolly family and in particular the magic flute should help against the misery. Sarastro stays lonely behind and then climbs a mountain. === Scenes 12-13 === Papageno and his family arrive at the royal court, where a group of courtiers welcomes them. Papageno spreads a good mood, but also jokes about the values of court society. === Scenes 14-15 === Papageno visits the cursed couple and eases their misery by playing the magic flute. Priests appear, who herald the location of coffin and call the parents up to rescue their son. === Scenes 16-19 === The coffin is in an underground vault surrounded by two guardians each of them has a spear and a lion on a chain. In this darkness, only lighted up by the coffin, the guardians have a mysterious dialogue about the mystery of life and the human straying between light and darkness, between mania and mania. Pamina and Tamino enter the vault and shortly afterwards the Queen of the Night appears to call the guardians up to defend the coffin. The guardians starts threatening gestures, but the parents and especially Pamina invoke the mother love. In this way the guardians are appeased and the Queen of the Night is forced to flee. Now Pamina and Tamino step closer to the coffin and the child hears the voices of its parents. Finally the coffin opens and the child rises up as a brightly illuminated genius, who also illuminates the heads of all others. == Context and interpretation == === Epochal threshold === Already Mozart's The Magic Flute apparently makes references to the moods of its time, that was influenced by the Enlightenment and a revolutionary spirit. It stands to reason that the Queen of the Night as monarch represents the old values of the Dark Ages, where the church and nobility possessed an undisputed supremacy; besides Sarastro and his brotherhood of the sun realm represent the Enlightenment and a civil order. But neither the system of the Queen is completely condemned, nor Sarastro's civil brotherhood is uncritical glorified. So the night realm produces the jolly bon vivant Papageno, while the sun realm creates the tortured soul Monostatos. Similar to the play also in reality old and new values tend to claim absoluteness, but are not absolutely right or wrong; like the civil leadership of the French Revolution turned into The Terror. Goethe could meant such value conflicts by the dialogue of the two guardians as they talk about the human straying between light and darkness, between mania and mania.Cebadal, George, ed.: Goethes: Die Zauberfl√∂te II. Die Entdeckung von Goethes √§gyptischen Mysterien im Bindeglied zwischen Mozarts \\"Zauberfl√∂te\\" und der \\"Faust\\"-Dichtung. Vollst√§ndiges Textbuch von Goethes \\"Der Zauberfl√∂te zweyter Theil ‚Äì Fragment\\" mit einer Einleitung und Neuinterpretation von George Cebadal. Norderstedt 2016, pp. 50-51. Furthermore, Goethe's Magic Flute II shows numerous motifs of syntheses (like Papagena and Papageno have to use working and activity as well as enjoyment and calm to get children),Cebadal, George, ed.: Goethes: Die Zauberfl√∂te II. Die Entdeckung von Goethes √§gyptischen Mysterien im Bindeglied zwischen Mozarts \\"Zauberfl√∂te\\" und der \\"Faust\\"-Dichtung. Vollst√§ndiges Textbuch von Goethes \\"Der Zauberfl√∂te zweyter Theil ‚Äì Fragment\\" mit einer Einleitung und Neuinterpretation von George Cebadal. Norderstedt 2016, p. 61. that seems to suggest a use of both systems, instead of becoming absolutely obsessed by one. === Freemasonry and the Mysteries of Isis === Both Mozart and Goethe were Freemasons. The last words of The Magic Flute are dedicated to the three ideals of Freemasonry (wisdom, strength and beauty): \\"Strength has triumphed, rewarding / beauty and wisdom with an everlasting crown!\\" These words proclaim the victory of Sarastro's priests and it seems reasonable that Sarastro's order of initiated is based on a Freemason order. The Freemasons of that time were very interested in myths and especially in mystery cults of ancient times, where the initiation into the priesthood was related with a symbolic death experience.Assmann, Jan: Schiller, Mozart und die Suche nach neuen Mysterien. In: Ernst Behler / Manfred Frank, eds.: Athen√§um. Jahrbuch f√ºr Romantik. Paderborn 2006 (Bd. 16). pp. 13-37, pp. 18-22. In this way, the passing through the darkness by not shunning night, death and other dreads is an important motif of The Magic Flue.Cebadal, George: Goethe, Schiller und die verschleierte Wahrheit. Ein kleiner Beitrag zur Mysterienkultur in Goethes \\"Faust\\"-Dichtung und der Weimarer Klassik. Norderstedt 2019, p. 31. Pamina's courage to face the death overcomes even the rules of the brotherhood and paves the way for her initiation in their male society: \\"A woman unafraid of darkness and death / is worthy and will be consecrated.\\"\\"Ein Weib, das Nacht und Tod nicht scheut, / Ist w√ºrdig, und wird eingeweiht.\\" (http://www.opera- guide.ch/opera.php?id=254&uilang;=de) Considering that the mysteries of Isis are a theme in The Magic Flute, then it is reasonable to recognize in the plot of the child in the golden coffin an allegory to Isis' son, the sun god Horus.Cebadal, George, ed.: Goethes: Die Zauberfl√∂te II. Die Entdeckung von Goethes √§gyptischen Mysterien im Bindeglied zwischen Mozarts \\"Zauberfl√∂te\\" und der \\"Faust\\"-Dichtung. Vollst√§ndiges Textbuch von Goethes \\"Der Zauberfl√∂te zweyter Theil ‚Äì Fragment\\" mit einer Einleitung und Neuinterpretation von George Cebadal. Norderstedt 2016, pp. 46-66. Like the myth of Horus is based on the simple perception of the course of the sun, according to which the sun sinks into the ground in the evening and comes out of the ground in the morning, the child in the coffin is wandering on earth's surface, sinks into the underworld and finally raises oneself in the air. The final scene, where the luminescent genius is surrounded by two lions and flies up, reminds strikingly on pictorial representations of the sun god Horus at sunrise, who is also surrounded by two lions, the representation of the earth deity Aker. == The Magic Flute II as a preliminary draft of the Faustian poetry and other works == In literary studies is stated, that The Magic Flute II was the godfather of Goethe's very deepest symbols.Brown, Jane K.: An den Grenzen des M√∂glichen. Goethe und \\"Die Zauberfl√∂te\\". In: Mathis Mayer, ed.: Modell \\"Zauberfl√∂te\\". Der Kredit des M√∂glichen. Kulturgeschichtliche Spiegelungen erfundener Wahrheiten, Hildesheim 2007 (Echo; Bd. 10), pp. 187-200. p. 190. Accordingly, numerous studies have discovered influences of The Magic Flute II in Goethe's other works and especially in his Faustian poetry,See for a review: Waldura, Markus: \\"Der Zauberfl√∂te Zweyter Theil\\". Musikalische Konzeption einer nichtkomponierten Oper. In: Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht, ed.: Archiv f√ºr Musikwissenschaft. Stuttgart 1993 (Jg. 50. 1993, H. 4), pp. 259-290. p. 260. Or also: Hartmann, Tina: Goethes Musiktheater. Singspiele, Opern, Festspiele, \\"Faust\\". T√ºbingen 2004. p. 299. which is commonly considered to be the most important work in German literature. === Faust II: Act III. (also called Helen-Act) === Most frequently is studied the genius of The Magic Flute II in relation to the Euphorion of Faust II.Hartmann, Tina: Goethes Musiktheater. Singspiele, Opern, Festspiele, \\"Faust\\". T√ºbingen 2004. p. 299. The Euphorion only appears in the third act, which Goethe discussed with Schiller as \\"peak [...] of the whole\\".Schiller to Goethe, 23 September 1800 (translation: David Constantine, ed.: Faust. The First Part.). Some general themes of the Helen-Act with references to The Magic Flute II are also accumulating in the Euphorion.  The Euphorion  In regard to the plot of the genius, the comparison to the sun god (\\"like a miniature Apollo\\", Z. 9620) and the sun's course (into the underworld and up again) is strikingly in this short passage about the Euphorion:George Cebadal: Goethe, Schiller und die verschleierte Wahrheit. Ein kleiner Beitrag zur Mysterienkultur in Goethes \\"Faust\\"-Dichtung und der Weimarer Klassik.

That of Helena ought to be played, not by one, but by two great female artists; for we seldom find that a fine vocalist has sufficient talent as a tragic actress.\\" ‚Äì Conversations with Goethe by Johann Peter Eckermann Jan. 25., 1827 (translated by John Oxenford) * Initiate of ancient mysteries and Freemasonry Goethe talking about hidden aspects of initiation in the Helen-Act: \\"Let the crowd of spectators take pleasure in the spectacle; the higher import will not escape the initiated, as has been the case with the 'Magic Flute', and other things beside.\\" ‚Äì Conversations with Goethe by Johann Peter Eckermann Jan. 25., 1827 (translated by John Oxenford) As an explanation to read the Helen-Act Goethe refers to the Eleusinian Mysteries in a letter to Iken: \\"Eleusis servat, quod ostendat revisentibus.\\" ‚Äì Goethe's letter to K.J.L. Iken Sep. 27., 1827 * Synthesis of two opposing value systems As an explanation to read the Helen-Act Goethe refers to the big dispute between artists of classicissm and artists of romanticism in a letter to Iken: \\"I never doubted that the readers for whom I effectively wrote would grasp the principal significance of the portrayal straight away. It is time that the impassioned dispute between classicists and romantics should finally be reconciled.

His firm of Fletcher & Gardiner was nationally renowned. Fletcher was born in Alstead, New Hampshire to Timothy Fletcher and Hannah Fosdick.

During the German occupation of Denmark in World War II, she became a member of the Danish resistance. As a communist, after Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, together with her husband Kjartan Munck, she contributed to the first clandestine publications in Denmark. She went on to collaborate with the writer and resistance fighter B√∏rge Houmann, working as a courier, organizing illegal meetings and contributing to the resistance papers Land og Folk and Ugens Nyt. Continuing her studies after the war, she became a specialist at the children's psychiatric hospital in Aarhus. From 1970 until her retirement in 1988, she held the position of chief consultant. H√∏eg Brask is remembered in particular for her ground-breaking contributions to autism. ==Early life and education== Birte H√∏eg Brask (nicknamed Trille) was born in the Copenhagen district of Frederiksberg on 23 November 1918. She was the daughter of the laboratory director Axel H√∏eg Brask (1875‚Äì1942) and Emma Brincker (1879-1968). The youngest of three sisters, she was brought up in the Vesterbro district. While a student at Falkonerg√•rdens Gymnasium, she became active in the left-wing Dansk Gymnasiastforbund (Danish High School Association). After matriculating in 1936, she studied medicine at the University of Copenhagen where she met Kjartan Munck, a communist. ==Career== She married Kjartan Munck in 1937 and had a son, Ole, in 1939. In 1946, her marriage with Munck was dissolved. She became the life-long partner of B√∏rge Kruuse Houmann (1902‚Äì1994) whom she married in 1962. ===Resistance work=== H√∏eg Brask showed interest in social and cultural radicalism from an early age. As a result, she was attracted to participating in illegal activities during the German occupation. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, she became firmly committed to the resistance cause in the autumn of 1941. Together with her husband, she became involved in the distribution of Danske Toner, the first illegal paper in Denmark which was published by B√∏rge Houmann, one of the early leaders and later head of the communist resistance movement. Using the cover name Mads, she became one of Houmann's closest associates for the remainder of the German occupation, organizing hiding and meeting places, clandestine printing operations and performing extensive courier work. She became a major contributor to the illegal publications Land og Folk and Ugens Nyt, based on information received from Kremlin radio broadcasts. During the war, H√∏eg Brask put her son Ole into care in order to devote all her efforts to the resistance. She later regretted this decision. ===Post-war career=== After the war, H√∏eg Brask completed her medical studies, graduating in 1946. She became increasingly interested in pediatric psychiatry, becoming a specialist in 1957. From 1958, she headed the psychotic children's department in the newly established child psychiatric hospital in Aarhus. From 1970, she served as the hospital's chief consultant until her retirement in 1970. One of her colleagues, Vandborg S√∏rensen, commented: \\"As a human being, she was a fascinating person... Professionally, she was inspirational, because her insight into children with autism was so impressive.\\" In 1988, an account of her work with psychotic children was published as Tilegnet Birte H√∏eg Brask: et skrift om psykotiske b√∏rn. H√∏eg Brask died in Aarhus on 1 January 1997. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:1997 deaths Category:People from Frederiksberg Category:Danish resistance members Category:Danish female resistance members Category:Danish psychiatrists Category:Danish women physicians Category:20th-century Danish writers ","title":"Birte H√∏eg Brask"},{"id":"61715645","text":"Adam Azimov is a Canadian film director.

He was born in Budapest, Hungary and started playing the cello at the age of eight with Em√∂ke Cs√°th-Vasv√°ry, In June 1957, following the Hungarian uprising, he emigrated with his parents and younger brother to Wolverhampton, England. Leslie Sutton, on the staff of the Birmingham School of Music, accepted him as a student and for nearly two years guided him during this formative period of his career. He joined the Midland Youth Orchestra under Blyth Major and on several occasions in later years was able to return as a soloist for the orchestra's concerts. Following the family's move to Croydon, Surrey in 1959, he obtained a music scholarship to continue his secondary education at the Trinity School of John Whitgift. He pursued his cello studies at the International Cello Centre, London under Milly Stanfield and Maurice Eisenberg. He won prizes at music festivals and scored successes in music exams, eventually gaining the Silver Medal of the Associated board of the royal schools of music. As a member of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain he became principal 'cellist and subsequently appeared as a soloist with the orchestra. British citizenship was granted in 1963. In the following year, he entered the Royal Academy of Music on the coveted Ada Lewis Scholarship and his training continued there with Douglas Cameron. He was placed second in the Queen's Prize, one of this country's leading competitions for young professionals, and he further distinguished himself by winning all the Academy 'cello and chamber music prizes for which he was eligible. On leaving the Academy in 1967 (where he was appointed as a full member of the professorial staff in 1976) his winning the BBC Cello Competition with a \\"remarkable interpretation\\" of Dvorak‚Äôs cello concerto. brought him national recognition. He went on to win prizes at the Geneva and Vienna International Competitions which resulted in the award of a Gulbenkian Fellowship to participate in a course of intensive study held by Pablo Casals in Puerto Rico in 1967. Music critics consistently acclaimed his performances. \\"He is a force to be reckoned with . . .\\" wrote The Times after his auspicious London Wigmore Hall debut in 1969. The guidance he received from Pierre Fournier at this stage in his development proved of infinite benefit to his playing. The last competition in which he participated was the Gaspar Cassado International Competition which he won in Florence in 1971. This was followed by an increasing number of prestigious individual engagements and two extensive tours of Italy. He made an impressive impact on the musical scene with his commanding performance of the Bach Suites for unaccompanied 'cello, in London (1972), at the Kennedy Centre (1973), and Vienna (1974). He reaped many musical successes in his concerts and broadcasts in the UK as well as abroad in Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Switzerland and Greece in addition to Austria and the U.S. Numerous BBC recordings have been archived in the British Library. For his Henry Wood Promenade Concert debut in 1974 he played the Elgar cello concerto, with Sir Charles Groves, and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. He appeared at numerous important Festivals, one which gave him particular pleasure was the Marlboro Festival, U.S., under the direction of Rudolf Serkin. At the Bath and English Bach Festivals he played chamber music with Alan Civil, Clifford Curzon, Leon Goossens, Heinz Holliger and Yehudi Menuhin. The recording of the Schubert String Quintet with the Alberni Quartet (CRD 1018) was nominated for a Grammy for best chamber music performance in 1976. The commercial recordings (playing his 1762 Joseph Gagliano instrument), with his regular pianist Clifford Benson of the two Faure sonatas (CRD 1016) and the Britten Cello Sonata for an Open University Project (A304OU16), offer rare reminders of his artistry. Thus, before he had reached the age of 30, Thomas Igloi had already made a significant contribution to the international musical life. He had well covered all the accepted criteria for an established British concert artist having played in the principal concert halls and with the leading conductors and orchestras. His broad repertory included the most popular concertos, but also embraced pieces by Lennox Berkeley, Frank Bridge and Wilfred Josephs. In 1975 he gave the first performance of the cello concerto by Arnold Cooke with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Sir Charles Groves at the 81st season of Proms. Apparently in excellent health, he died of heart failure in his sleep at his home in Croydon on 17 April 1976. Several of his close associates performed tribute concerts during the following months. The most telling tribute is that he and his playing were admired throughout the music profession ‚Äì not least by other 'cellists. Thomas Igloi had assuredly established himself as the most outstanding 'cellist of his generation. ==References== Category:British cellists Category:1947 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Hungarian emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:People from Wolverhampton Category:People from Croydon Category:People educated at Trinity School of John Whitgift Category:Naturalised citizens of the United Kingdom Category:Alumni of the Royal Academy of Music Category:British male musicians Category:20th-century British musicians Category:20th-century British male musicians Category:Musicians from Budapest ","title":"Thomas Igloi"},{"id":"61715684","text":"Nathaniel Paul (d. 1839) was a minister and abolitionist who worked in Albany, New York, Wilberforce Colony in Canada, and traveled to Britain to raise support to aid African Americans. He went to Britain to gain support and stayed there from 1832 until 1835. He was a brother of Thomas Paul. In 1827 he gave a speech celebrating the abolition of slavery in New York. His comments included the statement: \\"The lordly planter who has his thousands in bondage, may stretch himself upon his couch of ivory, and sneer at the exertions which are made by the humane and benevolent, or he may take his stand upon the floor of Congress, and mock the pitiful generosity of the east or west for daring to meddle with the subject, and attempting to expose its injustice: he may threaten to resist all efforts for a general or a partial emancipation even to a dissolution of the union. But still I declare that slavery will be extinct; a universal and not a partial emancipation must take place; nor is the period far distant.\\" On January 14, 1832, the abolitionist newspaper, The Liberator, published a letter from Paul about his trip to England. Paul was involved in fundraising efforts for Wilberforce Colony in Canada, a settlement that included African Americans fleeing violent attacks in Cincinnati, Ohio. The colony was named after British abolitionist statesman William Wilberforce. ==References== Category:1770s births Category:1839 deaths Category:Religious leaders from Albany, New York Category:African-American abolitionists ","title":"Nathaniel Paul"},{"id":"61715709","text":"The Clay County Courthouse, Eastern District is located at Courthouse Square in the center of Piggott, one of two county seats of Clay County, Arkansas (the other is Corning).

She is a lecturer in mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. == Education == As a high school student, Khovanova became a member of the Soviet team for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). In the summer of 1975, Valery Senderov gave the team a list of difficult mathematical problems used in the entrance exams of Moscow State University to discriminate against Soviet Jews, a topic she later wrote about. Khovanova won the silver medal at the 1975 IMO, and a gold medal at the 1976 Olympiad. Her finish at the 1976 Olympiad was second among all competitors, the highest achievement for female students until 1984, when Karin Gr√∂ger from East Germany tied for the first place. Khovanova graduated with honors from Moscow State University (MSU) with a master's degree in mathematics in 1981. She completed her Ph.D. at MSU in 1988 with Israel Gelfand as her doctoral advisor. == Career == Khovanova left the Soviet Union in 1990, and worked for several years in Israel and the US as a postdoctoral researcher. However, she stopped working as a researcher to raise her children, and then worked in the telecommunications and military contracting industry, before returning to academia as a lecturer at MIT. Khovanova has been a mathematics competition coach at the Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School in Marlborough, Massachusetts. In 2010, she helped found the MIT PRIMES program for after school mentoring of local high school students, and she continues to serve as its head mentor. She is also head mentor for mathematics of the Research Science Institute, a summer research program for high school students at MIT. === Research === In Khovanova's earlier mathematical research, she studied representation theory, the theory of integrable systems, quantum group theory, and superstring theory. Her later work explores combinatorics and recreational mathematics. ===Online activities=== In the mid-1990s Khovanova created a website called Number Gossip, about the special properties of individual numbers. In 2007, she created a mathematics blog, centered on mathematical puzzles and problem solving. == Personal life == When Khovanova emigrated to Boston, she did not know how to drive. A friend gave her a copy of The Boston Driver's Handbook which she studied to learn tips before learning years later that the book was intended to be humorous. She has two sons; her first was born in the Soviet Union. ==Recognition== An essay about Khovanova, ‚ÄúTo Count the Natural Numbers,‚Äù by Emily Jia, won the 2016 Essay Contest of the Association for Women in Mathematics. Two of Khovanova's papers were included in the annual Best Writing on Mathematics volumes, in 2014 and 2016 respectively. == References Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:People from Moscow Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:Soviet emigrants to the United States Category:American women mathematicians Category:Soviet women mathematicians Category:20th-century women mathematicians Category:21st-century women mathematicians Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:Expatriate academics in the United States Category:International Mathematical Olympiad participants Category:Science bloggers Category:Russian bloggers Category:American women bloggers Category:American bloggers Category:20th- century American mathematicians Category:20th-century Russian mathematicians Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty ","title":"Tanya Khovanova"},{"id":"61715838","text":"Brett Toth (born September 1, 1996) is an American football offensive tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He is also a United States Army ROTC instructor at Arizona State University. He is an Army Black Knights football graduate who is a beneficiary of revised United States Department of Defense policies regarding professional athletic career opportunities for military service academy graduates. Toth is a second lieutenant in the United States Army with deferred service. ==Early life== Toth attended West Ashley High School in Charleston, South Carolina. ==West Point career== Toth studied physics and nuclear engineering at West Point and became the first person to represent Army at the Senior Bowl when he was invited to participate in the 2018 edition. He also played in the 2018 East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game. As a junior for the 2016 Army Black Knights football team triple option offense (which finished second in the country with a 339.5 yards of offense per game), he was rated as the fifth-best run-blocking tackle in NCAA football according to Pro Football Focus and the 23rd-best offensive lineman according to Bleacher Report. During his senior season, the 2017 Army Black Knights led the nation in offense. During that season, Army rushed 785 times last season and attempted just 65 forward passes. Toth served as a graduate assistant for the 2018 Black Knights and he executed the engineering officer training, earning a platoon leader role. ==Professional football career== When Toth entered his commitment at West Point, there was a 5-year service commitment. However, the policy was changed to 24 months during his stay. There had been precedent (such as Joe Cardona of the 2015 NFL Draft) for military school graduates to be allowed to defer their 24-month service policy, but in 2017, United States Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis rescinded the policy to allow military service academy student-athlete graduates to delay their assignments to explore professional sports opportunities. In June 2019, United States President Donald Trump requested that a policy be established to facilitate athletic pursuits and 2019 NFL Draft selectee Austin Cutting was the first to sign a professional contract following the new policy. When Toth applied for his waiver in August 2019, he was stationed at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. Toth cites Alejandro Villanueva, Collin Mooney and Josh McNary as his role models. Toth had served a year as a second lieutenant before being granted a deferment. In August 2019, he signed a three-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles even though he had already missed all of training camp and two preseason games. The Eagles waived Toth, but he was claimed by the Cardinals at the end of the 2019 preseason. He was placed on the reserve/non-football illness list by the Cardinals on October 19, 2019. On September 4, 2020, Toth was waived/injured by the Cardinals, and reverted to the team's injured reserve list two days later. He was released on October 6, 2020. On October 7, 2020, Toth was claimed off waivers by the Philadelphia Eagles. ==References== Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Players of American football from South Carolina Category:Sportspeople from Charleston, South Carolina Category:American football offensive linemen Category:Army Black Knights football players Category:United States Army personnel Category:Philadelphia Eagles players Category:Arizona Cardinals players ","title":"Brett Toth"},{"id":"61715855","text":"Adam Joseph \\"Flip\\" Filipczak (February 12, 1915 ‚Äì July 4, 1992) was an American professional basketball player.

Promoted to junior Lieutenant in 1749, he was granted, in 1750, leave of six months to stay at Bornholm. In September of that year he started as an apprentice at the Construction Commission and embarked two years later together with Lieutenant F. C. KaasProject Runeberg - DBL Vol 9 page 55 on a study tour to Britain, France and Holland to learn their methods of shipbuilding. This tour took four years and included England, Brest, Rochefort, Toulon, Italy, Pisa, Venice, Naples, Marseilles and Amsterdam. He returned in November 1756 and was appointed a full member of the Construction Commission. In a very short time he became responsible, together with Lt. Kaas, for the building of a chebekn.b.

Late in 1757, using the best of French frigates as his inspiration, Krabbe produced designs for a new frigate which resulted in two new ships being built - S√∏e Ridderen (1758) and Langeland (1758). In September 1758 Krabbe was officially appointed as Fabrikmester, master shipbuilder to the Royal Danish Navy and his first ship-of-the-line was designed. In 1761 he was appointed as an advisor to the committee for the construction of Helsing√∏r harbor. In 1768 he reported on the condition of the harbour at Christians√∏, with recommendations for improvements. In July 1772 he retired as fabrikmester. ==Krabbe's ships== In 1766 complaints about the cost of Krabbe-designed ships were made by Dannesjold-Sams√∏e of the Construction Committee.

The ‚Ç¨STR is calculated by the European Central Bank (ECB) and is based on the money market statistical reporting of the Eurosystem. The working group on euro risk-free rates has recommended ‚Ç¨STR as a replacement for the EMMI Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA) as the Euro risk-free rate for all products and contracts. ==History== 20 September 2017: ECB's Governing Council has decided to develop a euro short-term rate based on data collected by the Eurosystem for money market statistical purposes. 13 September 2018: The working group on euro risk-free rates recommends to replace the EONIA with the euro short-term rate. 12 March 2019: The ECB decided to use the acronym ‚Äû‚Ç¨STR‚Äú. 2 October 2019: Start publishing the rate. ==Characteristics== Characteristics of the ‚Ç¨STR: * The ‚Ç¨STR is published by the ECB. * It is based on the unsecured market segment. The ECB developed an unsecured rate, because it is intended to complement the EONIA. Furthermore, a secured rate would be affected by the type of the collaterals. * The money market statistical reporting covers the 50 largest banks in the euro area in terms of balance sheet size. * While the EONIA reflects the interbank market, the ‚Ç¨STR extends the scope to money market funds, insurance companies and other financial corporations because banks developed significant money market activity with those entities. The ISIN is EU000A2X2A25. ==Methodology== ===Overnight rate=== The ‚Ç¨STR is calculated using overnight unsecured fixed rate deposit transactions over ‚Ç¨1 million. For each TARGET2 business day the ‚Ç¨STR is calculated as a volume-weighted trimmed mean. Steps of the calculation: * Ordering the transactions from the lowest rate to the highest rate. * Aggregating the transactions at each rate level. * Removing the top and bottom 25% in volume terms (trimming). * Calculating the mean of the remaining 50% and rounding to the third decimal.

An English observer Thomas Fowler reported their news including the Danish opinion that James VI asked for too high a dowry, but they had seen extensive preparations for the marriage including a coach made of silver. According to their report, Anne of Denmark was keen for the marriage to go ahead, and Fowler wrote; \\"the young lady is so far in love with the king's majesty as it were death to her to have it broken off, and has made good proof (in) diverse ways of her affection, which his majesty is apt enough to requite\\".Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 124-7, quotation (modernised) p. 124, source British Library Egerton MS 2,598/16.

Pranav, Althara and Nisha in lead roles, with Mansoor Ali Khan, Senthil, Nizhalgal Ravi, Nellai Siva, Thalaivasal Vijay, Ajay Rathnam, Santhana Bharathi and Kolangal Shyam playing supporting roles. The film, produced by S. Subramanian, had musical score by K. Manish and was released on 30 May 2008. ==Plot== Bharani (K. Dinesh Kumar) and his two friends are college students and they live together in a small thatched house in Chennai. Their parents believe that they are good students but in reality, they spend their time enjoying as much as possible with the money they get from their parents. Bharani even becomes a male prostitute to make easy money. Bharani and his collegemate Anitha (Althara) fall in love with each other and they have sexual intercourse. In the meantime, the dumb David (J. Pranav) comes to live with them. David was acting as a speech-impaired person and breaks into the three friend's life to take revenge. David slickly kills Bharani's two friends with the help of Joseph (Kolangal Shyam) and burns their body to get rid of the evidence. David now plans to kill his last target: Bharani. Bharani who is in a college trip in Kodaikanal is shocked to see David there and he kills Bharani and burns his dead body in the forest. The police inspector Dharma (Mansoor Ali Khan) finds out that David is the killer and arrests him. In court, David reveals that he had killed four people for justice and requests an open courtroom, and the judge accepts after much thinking. In the past, David worked in the real estate business and lived with his beloved sister Anitha (Nisha). Anitha and his friend Joseph were about to get married. One day, Anitha's mobile phone was stolen in a restaurant by the waiter and the waiter sold it to Bharani. Bharani found her photos on her phone, he morphed obscene pictures of her and sent it to her contact list. Anitha was then harassed by men who saw her pictures. An unsettled and ashamed Anitha committed suicide by self-immolation and a vengeful David decided to take revenge on the person who edited his sister's pictures. David found out that the restaurant waiter stole his sister's phone. David met him and threatened to tell him everything. David then murdered him and burned his body. In court, the media and the public congratulate David from his braveness but the judge sentences him to the death penalty for taking justice into his own hands.

He worked with Rausse until his death in 1848 at a water cure institution in Alexandersbad. Hahn was one of the first to use the term \\"Naturheilkunde\\" (Nature Cure). In 1850, he managed Buchenthal water cure in Canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland. In 1852, he became director of Tiefenau water cure in Canton of Z√ºrich. Hahn completed the second and third part of Rausse's book Instructions for the Use of Water Cure during 1851‚Äì1852. In the early 1850s Hahn gave up alcohol, coffee, meat and spices.Treitel, Corinna.

He operated a naturopathic sanatorium Auf der Waid in Oberwaid near St. Gallen from 1862. Medical Historian Karl Eduard Rothschuh commented that Hahn \\"started out exclusively with the water cure but with his addition of dietetics and vegetarianism to nature cure, he pushed its influence into the beginning of the health and life reform movement.\\"Rothschuh, Karl E. (1983). Naturheilbewegung, Reformbewegung, Alternativbewegung. (Nature Cure Movement, Reform Movement, Alternative Movement). Stuttgart: Hippokrates. p. 79. Hahn was influenced by Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland's book Makrobiotik and began to prescribe to his patients a lacto-vegetarian diet from 1852 that consisted of whole wheat bread, milk and uncooked vegetables.Bergdolt, Klaus.

Harwood Academic Publishers. p. 183. His Die naturgem√§sse Di√§t (The Natural Diet) in 1859 argued against the meat-based diet that was promoted by Jacob Moleschott, Gabriel Valentin and others. He argued for a meatless diet and provided evidence of its physiological benefits, including longevity and physical strength.

The permit was owned by William and William Eugene Kuiper, doing business as the Muskegon Heights Broadcasting Company. The station hit the air in February 1963 and increased its daytime power to 10,000 watts in 1971. The station suffered a humorous accident in 1975 when a field mouse crawled into the transmitter site, shorting out a transformer and keeping the station off the air for 45 minutes during its broadcast of a high school basketball game. In 1979, majority control was transferred to another Kuiper business‚Äîthe Furniture City Broadcasting Corporation, which owned WFUR in Grand Rapids‚Äîwhich procured authorization two years later to broadcast at night with 500 watts.FCC History Cards for WKBZ March 1974 brought an FM sister station, WKJR-FM 101.7 (now WMRR); the stations broadcast religious programming.

(The station briefly went by WWEZ for five months in 1992.) Upon becoming WQWQ, the station flipped to soft adult contemporary, and after trying hot AC that fall, moved back to soft AC in early 1991 in order to ensure an FM station didn't fill the format void. WLC was owned by Bishop Nathaniel Wells and flipped WQWQ back to a religious format, with gospel music and church services. In 1998, as part of a bankruptcy settlement, WLC donated its WKBZ at 850 kHz to Grand Valley State University, which became WGVS. The WKBZ intellectual unit, news/talk programming and call letters were retained by the seller and moved to 1520 kHz. However, WLC's financial troubles continued. After a sale to Harbor Pointe Broadcasting collapsed because the company went bankrupt, the station went off the air in March 2001, when WLC Broadcasting became bankrupt and its assets claimed by creditors. The station became an affiliate of Radio Disney during its final month of operation.

The Brogowskis had three children of their own at the time, the youngest of whom, Marysia or Maria, was the same age as Sznycer. Sznycer was treated as one of the family. She helped them in the fields and shared a bed with Maria. Maria and Sznycer became extremely close. The Brogowskis found sheltering Sznycer challenging especially because the village was so close to the Belzec extermination camp. Their children helped protect Sznycer, comforting her and staying with her in a root cellar when she had to hide to avoid Nazi patrols. When she was not able to hide, the Brogowskis referred to her as their niece. On one occasion Sznycer was identified as Jewish, but the family was able to distract the accuser with food and alcohol. After this the Brogowskis had Sznycer baptized, in hopes of protecting her. ==Postwar== After World War II, Sznycer spent several years in a Bund orphanage. In 1949, she moved to a kibbutz in Israel with other displaced youths. Years later, the parties tried to reconnect, but Sznycer had forgotten the surname of the Polish family. One of the Brogowskis' children, now Maria Jurczak, posted an advertisement in a newspaper with a photograph of Sznycer. This was identified by a friend of Sznycer who brought them together. Sznycer (now known as Rina Feinmesser) met Maria in 2007. By that time, nearly six decades later, the Brogowski parents who had sheltered her had died. The Brogowskis were posthumously awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Jerusalem in 2006 (or 2008; sources vary), which was received by their daughter Maria. ==See also== *Julia Pƒôpiak *German Nazi extermination camp SS-Sonderkommando Belzec in Be≈Ç≈ºec *German retribution against Poles who helped Jews *Irena Sendler *Polish Righteous Among the Nations *Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust == References == Category:Catholic Righteous Among the Nations Category:Polish Righteous Among the Nations Category:Polish Roman Catholics Category:Married couples ","title":"Cecylia and Maciej Brogowski"},{"id":"61716653","text":"Annaka Harris is an American author.

Smaranda Gheorghiu (5 October 1857 ‚Äì 26 January 1944) was a Romanian poet, novelist, essayist, playwright, educator, feminist and traveler. She wrote under a number of pseudonyms and is perhaps best known under the moniker Maica Smara (Mother Smara), which was given to her by Veronica Micle. An early Romanian feminist, she wrote both fiction and non- fiction works with a feminist slant in which she argued against the prevailing views of the time, which held women to be intellectually inferior to men. Smara traveled extensively and recorded her experiences in several volume of travel literature. For her work as a teacher and her efforts to reform the education system, she is sometimes given the sobriquet ‚ÄùEducator of the People‚Äù. == Biography == She was born on 5 October 1857 in the Wallachian city of T√¢rgovi»ôte in a noble family. The daughter of Ni≈£ƒÉ Andronescu and Alexandrina VlƒÉdescu, she was the oldest of ten children. Ni»õƒÉ was a wealthy landowner and one time prefect of the county, while Alexandrina, also of noble stock. was a woman who thoroughly enjoyed traveling and delighting her close ones with stories of European museums. Although the precise relation is disputed, Smaranda was a relative of poet and fabulist Grigore Alexandrescu. After elementary studies in her hometown, in 1870 she went to high-school in Bucharest, graduating from the Central School for Girls. Soon after finishing high-school she married George G√¢rbea, a teacher, against her family's wishes. G√¢rbea encouraged her literary interests and introduced her to some of the cultural paragons of the age, such as Ion Luca Caragiale, George Co≈übuc and Alexandru Vlahu≈£ƒÉ. It was during this time that she first started publishing poetry. Her marriage to G√¢rbea was rocky and after becoming estranged several times, she finally leaves him for good in the early 1880s, when she receives a teaching position in the town of Sinaia. In 1883 she meets Petre Gheorghiu, an army captain and moves with him to Ploie»ôti, where she continues to teach and start contributing to the ≈ûcoala Rom√¢nƒÉ magazine. She later moves to Bucharest, where she will continue teaching until the end of her life. By the mid-1880s she was already established in the Bucharest literary scene, with Smaranda hosting some of the most popular gatherings of the cultural elite. Around this time she meets Mihai Eminescu and Veronica Micle, who will soon become her friends and give her the nickname Maica Smara, a reference to both motherhood and monasticism. Her second husband, Petre Gheorghiu died a few years after their marriage, which left Smaranda a widow with two daughters: Zoe and Magadalena, one from each marriage. == Literary career == Caricature in Furnica showing art collector Ioan Kalinderu welcoming Maica Smara in his incipient Bucharest museum of art. 1910. Her literary debut came in 1881, when she began publishing poetry in Alexandru Macedonski's Literatorul magazine. Much of her early output consisted of pedagogical writings and children's literature. She also starts to publish more serious poetry and essays in literary magazines and periodicals such as Convorbiri literare, F√¢nt√¢na Blanduziei, AdevƒÉrul, Revista literarƒÉ, Genera»õia viitoare, Rom√¢nul, Tribuna and Universul. In 1888 she publishes her first book, a volume of poetry called Din pana suferin»õei (Suffering's Pen). Her next volume is one of short stories, Novele (1890). In 1892, shortly after the death of her friend, Veronica Micle, she wrote a monograph of Micle, in which she outline her contributions to the Romantic poetry of Romania. A talk on Micle's legacy held at the Romanian Athenaeum on 13 December 1891 also gives her the distinction of being the first woman to hold a lecture in this prestigious institution. In 1893, Smaranda Gheorghiu issued her very own literary journal, Alti»õe »ôi Bibiliuri (Lace and Frills), through which she called for a reform of the education system, which she saw as outdated. Throughout the 1890s her works become more politically charged. In 1896 she holds two lectures on feminism, among the first of their kind in Romania. These are Feciorii »ôi fiicele noastre (Our Sons and Daughters) and Inteligen»õa femeii (Women's Intelligence), both later published as volumes. Around the turn of the century, Maica Smara begins publishing travel literature, based on her tours of Europe. Between 1904 and 1906 she publishes several plays covering subjects as diverse as incest, legal male responsibility for fathered children, the Union of the Romanian principalities, or working class life. Her first novel, Fata tatii, (Daddy's Girl) was published in 1912 and deals with feminist issues. She continues to write until towards the end of her life, with the last work published during her lifetime being C√¢ntƒÉ Dorna (Dorna is Singing), an epic poem in two acts that appeared in 1939. Despite her multifaceted literary output, her most recognizable work today probably consists of the lyrics ‚ÄúVine vine primƒÉvara / Se a»ôterne-n toatƒÉ »õara / Floricele pe c√¢mpii / Hai sƒÉ le-adunƒÉm copii‚Äù that make up the so-called ‚ÄùC√¢ntecul »ôcolarului‚Äù, a well known children's song about the arrival of spring. == Activism and travels == Particularly after the death of her second husband, Smaranda traveled extensively in Romania, Italy, Belgium, France, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Greece etc., often lecturing on education and women's emancipation. She described many of these excursions in a series of travel writings. As her fame grew, she was invited to represent Romania in several international conferences, such as the 8th International Congress of Orientalists (Stockholm and Christiania, the 9th Universal Peace Congress (Paris, 1900) and the Latin Congress (Paris, 1902). In 1900 she is elected vice-president of the Universal Union of Women's Congress for Peace. She was also a strong supporter of outdoor education, and in 1936 took part in the Second International Congress for Open Air Education, which took place in Belgium. Some sources incorrectly claim that Smaranda Gheorghiu was the first woman in the world to reach the North Pole. Considering that the first verified attainment of the North Pole by a human was not until 1926, this claim is obviously false and most likely appeared as a misunderstanding of the title of her 1932 volume O rom√¢ncƒÉ spre Polul Nord (A Romanian Woman towards the North Pole), which details her 1902 travels through Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland. According to this travel memoir, she did manage to reach North Cape, one of the northernmost points of Europe, an impressive feat for that time, but more than 2000 kilometers shy of the North Pole. == Legacy == Maica Smara died on 26 January 1944 in Bucharest and was buried in the Bellu Cemetery, receiving homages from many of the cultural and political personalities of the time. A bust depicting her was unveiled in Mitropoliei Park, T√¢rgovi»ôte in 1957. A second bust can be seen in Ci»ômigiu Gardens, in central Bucharest, where she is described as ‚ÄùEducatoare a poporului‚Äù (Educator of the Romanian People). The secondary school ‚ÄùSmaranda Gheorghiu‚Äù in T√¢rgovi»ôte was named in her honour in 1997. == Bibliography == === Poetry === * Din pana suferin»õei, 1888 (Suffering's Pen) * Corbul cu pene de aur, 1897 (The Raven with Golden Feathers) * Mozaicuri, 1897 (Inlays) * Calvar, 1901 (Calvary) * »öara mea, 1905 (My Country) * C√¢ntƒÉ Dorna, 1939 (Dorna is Singing) === Short stories === * Novele, 1890 (Novellas) * Dumitri»õe brumate, 1932 (Hoarfrosted Marigolds) === Novels === * Fata tatii, 1912 (Daddy's Girl) * BƒÉiatul mamei, 1917 (Mom's Boy) * Domnul BƒÉdinƒÉ, 1931 (Mr. BƒÉdinƒÉ) === Theater plays === * Mirza, 1904 * IspƒÉ»ôire, 1905 (Expiation) * La 24 ianuarie, 1905 (On January 24) * Dorul de »õarƒÉ, 1905 (Homesickness) * Meseria»ôii, 1905 (The Craftsmen) * St√¢lpi de pazƒÉ, 1906 (The Guarding Pillars) === Travel literature === * Schi»õe din T√¢rgovi»ôte, 1898 (Sketches from T√¢rgovi»ôte) * Schi»õe si amintiri din Italia, 1900 (Sketches and Memories from Italy) * De la Bucure»ôti la Capul Nord, 1905 (From Bucharest to Cape North) * Schite si amintiri din Cehoslovacia, 1925 (Sketches and Memories from Czechoslovakia) * O rom√¢ncƒÉ spre Polul Nord, 1932 (A Romanian Woman towards the North Pole) === Non-fiction === * Veronica Micle.

She was part of the United States Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) fleet from 1926 to 1940. She then served as US FWS Brant (FWS 523) in the fleet of the Fish and Wildlife Service from 1940 to 1953. She then operated commercially until she sank in 1960. ==Bureau of Fisheries== === Construction and characteristics=== Coolidge & H. C. Hanson designed Brant for U.S. Bureau of Fisheries fishery patrol service in the Territory of Alaska with an emphasis on the seaworthiness necessary to operate in the exposed waters there.NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center AFSC Historical Corner: Brant, Flagship of the Alaska Patrol Fleet Kruse & Banks constructed her at North Bend, Oregon, and launched her on 3 June 1926. At in length, she was the largest vessel ever to serve in the BOF fleet at the time. She was built of fir and old-growth Port Orford cedar and was of heavy construction. She had a six-cylinder direct-reversible Union full diesel engine for propulsion, and a Union gasoline engine powered her air compressor, bilge pump, and electric generator. She had a modern electrical system that included a 110-volt type A4H 150-ampere-hour Edison nickel-iron-alkaline storage battery, a radio, and an Allan Cunningham anchor windlass. She had accommodations for a crew of nine and up to six passengers. ===Operational history=== In early July 1926, Brant departed Seattle, Washington, bound for the Territory of Alaska carrying the Commissioner of Fisheries, Henry O'Malley, and Congressman Milton W. Shreve from Pennsylvania's 29th Congressional District; they spent several weeks inspecting Alaska fisheries. After finishing her summer duties in Alaska, she proceeded to San Pedro, California, and spent the winter of 1926‚Äì1927 conducting fishery patrols off California and Mexico, encountering severe storms and suffering a broken propeller blade. At one point in 1926, she found herself disabled off the Columbia River Bar on the Oregon-Washington border and sent out a distress signal; a United States Coast Guard cutter responded and towed her to safety. Brant returned to Alaska in March 1927 and established her annual pattern of operations, which involved patrols in Southeast and Southcentral Alaska and occasional operations as far west as Kodiak Island. She often provided transportation for BOF agents and other BOF employees from Seattle to Alaska and between ports and BOF stations in Alaska. She also regularly conducted general fisheries supervisory work. She usually spent winters at Seattle, where she underwent offseason repairs, overhauls, and renovations. By 1928, her pilothouse had undergone extensive modifications. Brant‚Ä≤s operations changed over time as her responsibilities evolved. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, she conducted patrols each spring off Neah Bay and Cape Flattery on the coast of Washington to protect populations of sea otters and fur seals during their annual northward migration. On 30 June 1929, she departed Seattle with Commissioner O'Malley aboard for a two-month inspection of fisheries in Alaska and of fur sealing operations on the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea. Over the winter of 1933‚Äì1934, she was among several BOF vessels that underwent extensive renovations at Seattle funded by a US$20,000 appropriation by the Public Works Administration. During the mid- and late 1930s, she operated each autumn in Southeast Alaska, patrolling to protect the local fisheries and conducting surveys of salmon spawning streams. On 15 July 1938, Brant ran aground on Williams Reef in the Kodiak Archipelago from Kodiak and suffered heavy damage. Two United States Navy seaplane tenders, and , arrived to render assistance and succeeded in refloating her. Teal then towed her southward and passed the tow to the U.S. Coast Guard cutter , which towed her the rest of the way to Ketchikan, Territory of Alaska. The BOF fishery patrol vessel then towed her to Seattle, where she underwent extensive repairs. With her repairs complete, Brant departed Seattle on 4 January 1939 and proceeded to Juneau, Territory of Alaska, where she spent three months providing services in support of the biennial session of the Alaska territorial legislature. While she was at Juneau, she spent two weeks in February 1939 assisting in the search for a Marine Airways passenger plane with six people on board that had been reported missing during a 12 February 1939 flight from Ketchikan to Juneau.Anonymous, \\"Flier Sights Wreckage of Lost Airship,\\" San Bernardino Sun, February 15, 1939, Page 1 Retrieved September 7, 2019 In March 1939, she transported several Civilian Conservation Corps workers from Juneau to Little Port Walter at Port Walter, Territory of Alaska. In his annual report on fisheries in 1939, the chief of the BOF's Division of Alaska Fisheries, Ward T. Bower, referred to Brant as the \\"flagship of the patrol fleet.\\" ==Fish and Wildlife Service== port bow view of US FWS Brant as she appeared after a major renovation sometime between 1940 and 1953 US FWS Brant sometime between 1940 and 1953.In 1939, the BOF was transferred from the United States Department of Commerce to the United States Department of the Interior, and on 30 June 1940, it was merged with the Interior Department's Division of Biological Survey to form the new Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), an element of the Interior Department destined to become the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of a major reorganization in 1956. The vessel thus became part of the FWS fleet as US FWS Brant (FWS 523). As late as 1947, Brant remained in use in the FWS fleet as a base of operations for surveying streams; in this role, she served as the mother ship for small FWS skiffs powered by outboard motors which operated in shallow water both to identify obstructions in streams that could interfere with the spawning journeys of salmon and to transport FWS personnel to and from shore. In the 1950s her original engine was replaced by a new Union diesel engine manufactured at Oakland, California, in 1951 which on average consumed of diesel fuel a day, and her fuel tanks had a capacity of . By that time, her main engine and propeller controls were located in her engine room, as were fire and bilge pumps and a battery bank. Brants United States Government career ended in 1953, when the FWS sold her to the Foss Launch and Tug Company. ==Later career== The Foss Launch and Tug Company based Brant at Los Angeles, California, registering her as a towing vessel and tug. By August 1955, she was laid up at the Craig shipyards in Long Beach, California. In 1959, Foss sold her to Joseph and Bernedee Rose of Los Angeles. The Roses adapted Brant for use as an oil exploration survey vessel. ==Loss== On the morning of 8 May 1960, Brant was underway to an oil exploration survey location off Point Conception, California. When her engineer on watch checked her engine room at 06:30, all appeared normal, but soon thereafter a fire broke out in the engine room.Schwemmer, R., Brant in Shipwreck Database Summary, U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries: West Coast Region, 2000 (not paginated) Brant‚Ä≤s crew attempted to douse the fire using a fire hose and at first appeared to be bringing the fire under control, but seawater from the fire hose stopped the fire pump driving water through the hose. Brants ventilation cowls on deck were trained forward and directed fresh air into the engine room, fanning the flames after the fire pump failed. The crew donned life jackets and launched a skiff equipped with an outboard motor in case they had to abandon ship. They were unable to stop Brant, because the fire made it impossible for them to reach her engine controls in the burning engine room, but they did attempt to set Brant on a course toward the shore so that she would beach herself. Finally, with the fire again out of control and no means left aboard to fight it, Brants captain feared that she might explode and ordered her crew to abandon ship, and they hurriedly jumped overboard.Wheeler, E. D., and R. E. Kallman, Shipwrecks, Smugglers, and Maritime Mysteries of the Santa Barbara Channel, Pathfinder Publishing, Ventura, California, 1984, p. 122. With her engine still running, the unmanned Brant began circling, endangering the men in the water, although her entire crew of eight was rescued by small vessels in the vicinity and survived uninjured. At 08:33, the U.S. Coast Guard cutter USCGC Cape Sable arrived on the scene to find Brant burning and abandoned. She sprayed firefighting foam and four streams of seawater onto the fire and succeeded in containing it but not in extinguishing it. Brant eventually was brought to a halt by plugging her main engine air intake. Several explosions occurred in Brant‚Ä≤s after hold where oxygen tanks were stowed, and she sank in the Pacific Ocean in of water off Point Conception at around 14:00. At the time Brant sank, she was valued at US$40,000 and the oil exploration equipment lost with her at US$45,000. A remotely operated underwater vehicle later identified her debris field on the ocean bottom. == References == Category:Fishery protection vessels Category:Ships of the United States Bureau of Fisheries Category:Ships of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Category:Ships built in Oregon Category:1926 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1926 Category:Maritime incidents in 1938 Category:Maritime incidents in 1960 Category:Ship fires Category:Shipwrecks of the California coast ","title":"USFS Brant"},{"id":"61716795","text":"Midnight Snack may refer to: * Midnight snack * Midnight Snack (Robot Chicken), en episode of Robot Chicken * Midnight Snack (album), an album by Homeshake * The Midnight Snack, a Tom and Jerry cartoon ","title":"Midnight Snack"},{"id":"61716833","text":"Milk It may refer to: * Milk It (song), a song by Nirvana * Milk It (album), an album by Death in Vegas ","title":"Milk It"},{"id":"61716837","text":"Rajendra Shah may refer to: *Rajendra Shah (author) (28 January 1913 ‚Äì 2 January 2010) was a lyrical poet who wrote in Gujarati. *Rajendra Shah (cricketer) (1950 ‚Äì 28 September 2018) was an Indian cricketer.

He is a presenter of the podcast and television programme Newscast (formerly Brexitcast) and the host of the radio programme Any Questions? == Early life == Mason was born in Airedale Hospital in Steeton with Eastburn, West Yorkshire. He grew up in Grassington, North Yorkshire, and attended Ermysted's Grammar School in Skipton. He listened to radio, in particular BBC Radio Lancashire, from an early age and his childhood ambition was to present his own programme. He attended Christ's College, Cambridge, where he studied Geography, before gaining a postgraduate diploma from City, University of London. == Career == Mason started his career as a trainee in broadcast journalism at ITN in 2001. After a year, he relocated to BBC Newcastle, where he befriended future broadcaster Rob Young, and then to the BBC regional desk at Westminster. His first report from Westminster was in 2004. For two years, Mason reported for BBC News as a Europe correspondent, followed by a short stint as a political reporter on BBC Radio 5 Live. He then became a political correspondent for BBC News in 2012. On 20 February 2016, Mason broadcast from outside 10 Downing Street as he unsuccessfully attempted to engage ministers arriving for the cabinet meeting called to discuss David Cameron's renegotiation of the UK's European Union membership. In June 2017, he started presenting the podcast Brexitcast with Adam Fleming and was later joined by Laura Kuenssberg and Katya Adler. From 12 September 2019 to 30 January 2020, Brexitcast was also broadcast on BBC One television. Brexitcast was renamed Newscast after the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union on 31 January 2020. The first edition of Newscast aired on 6 February. It was again renamed The Coronavirus Newscast, also known as Coronacast, during the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2018 he presented the BBC Radio 4 documentary Could the PM Have a Brummie Accent? In August 2018 while discussing Theresa May dancing during a visit to Kenya, Mason simulated dancing, moving his shoulders and swaying from side to side. In November 2018, live on BBC Breakfast, Mason asked \\"So where are we in all of this Brexit process? To be quite honest, looking at things right now, I haven't got the foggiest idea what is going to happen in the coming weeks. Is the Prime Minister going to get a deal with the EU? Dunno! Is she going to be able to get it through the Commons? Don't know about that, either. I think you might as well get Mr Blobby back on to offer his analysis, because, frankly, I suspect his is now as good as mine.\\" Mason was praised for his honesty after his comments were shared on social media and translated into French in newspaper Le Parisien. In December 2018 he unveiled a blue plaque honouring the Yorkshire-born journalist W. R. Mitchell (1928‚Äì2015). A 2018 study of \\"the Twitter output of 10 seasoned UK political correspondents\\" found that Mason was a \\"prolific\\" tweeter, and had 66,000 followers between month 1 September and 3 October 2018. Mason tweeted about a \\"diverse and humorous range of interests beyond the political scene\\", including his native Yorkshire and goldfish named for other journalists. In March 2019 he presented the BBC Radio 4 documentary The Country vs the City. The following month in April, Mason abandoned a news bulletin on The Andrew Marr Show due to technical difficulties. On 9 October 2019 Mason was appointed chair of the BBC Radio 4 debate programme Any Questions? He said it was \\"daunting\\" to take over from Jonathan Dimbleby, who had been chair for 32 years. Mason suggested his Yorkshire accent helped him get the job and pointed at a lack of a broad range of regional accents more generally in British broadcasting. His first show was broadcast from the University of Reading on 18 October with guests Si√¢n Berry, Madeline Grant, David Lammy and Brandon Lewis. In October 2019, the website The Conservative Woman described Mason as \\"mildly irreverent, self-deprecating and congenial... as well as being an experienced and highly competent political broadcaster\\". Mason is an occasional host of BBC Breakfast. Despite previous reports that he might join the new digital station Times Radio, he remains at the BBC. == Personal life == Mason has two children and lives in London.

Bik is known for her work detecting photo manipulation in scientific publications, and identifying over 400 research papers published in China from a \\"paper mill\\" company. Bik is the founder of Microbiome Digest, a blog with daily updates on microbiome research, and the Science Integrity Digest blog. == Early life and education == Bik was born in the Netherlands. She attended Utrecht University majoring in biology, and continued there for her doctorate. Her dissertation was about developing vaccines for new classes of Vibrio cholerae involved in cholera epidemics across India and Bangladesh. Her doctorate and postdoctoral studies were conducted at the molecular microbiology department in the National Institute of Health and the Environment in Bilthoven. == Career == === Public sector === After receiving her Ph.D., Bik worked for the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment and St. Antonius Hospital in Nieuwegein, where she organized the development of new molecular techniques for identifying infectious agents. === Academia === In 2001, Bik moved to California to work at Stanford University in the laboratory of David Relman, where her work focused on human microbiomes, previously unidentified species in them, and their diversity across individuals. Her work explored other mucosal microbiomes, confirming that the human oral microbiota contains distinct genera from the gut microbiota. While at Stanford, Bik worked on an Office of Naval Research project to study the microbiome of dolphins and sea lions in San Diego. She found that their microbiome was distinct from other mammals, and influenced by the sea they lived in. === Private sector === In 2016, Bik left Stanford to work for uBiome, a biotech company involved in the sequencing of human microbiomes, before leaving the company in 2018 to work full-time on analyzing scientific papers for image duplication and other malpractices. === Science integrity === In 2014, she started the blog Microbiome Digest, where she provided easy-to-understand commentaries on recent scientific papers. The blog soon became a success, and Bik enlisted help from her colleagues on Twitter to manage the content. She is also an active contributor to Retraction Watch and PubPeer, highlighting scientific papers that present falsified, duplicated, and questionable data, such as in western blot images. Together with Arturo Cassadevall and Ferric Fang, Bik published an mBio paper investigating the prevalence of these questionable practices within published scientific papers, where they found nearly 400 papers with intentional figure manipulation (i.e. about 800 duplicate images). She estimates half of these were created with the intention to mislead. Bik is active on the social media micro-blogging platform, Twitter, where she posts potentially duplicated figures for her more than 60,000 Twitter followers () to investigate. Her investigations have exposed significant levels of scientific misconduct in several journals. In 2018, Bik was featured on the pop science podcast \\"Everything Hertz.\\" In 2019, Bik announced via Twitter that she was taking a year off paid work to investigate scientific misconduct, the subject on which she coauthored a preregistered test suggesting that \\"academic culture, peer control, cash-based publication incentives and national misconduct policies,\\" but not pressure to publish, may affect scientific integrity, with nationality being a stronger predictor than individual attributes. Her analysis of 960 recent papers published in Molecular and Cellular Biology found that 6.1% contained inappropriately duplicated images, about 10% of which were retracted, and led to a pilot image screening program at the journal identifying problems with 14.5% of subsequent submissions. In February 2020, Science reported that Bik had identified over 400 research papers published in China over the previous three years, apparently all originating from the same \\"paper mill\\" company providing full service production of articles describing fake research for medical students on demand. Bik said, \\"students in China need to have a paper published to get their MD, but they do not have time to do research, so that is an unrealistic goal.\\" In March 2020, commenting on the publication of the results of a clinical trial by Didier Raoult on the effect of hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19, she identified a conflict of interest and strongly criticized the methodology of the study. The learned society that owns the journal in which the results were published admitted that the publication was not at the level expected by the society, in particular due to a lack of justification of the criteria for patient selection and triage. However, the society rebutted allegations of a conflict of interest, stating that the peer review process prior to publication was respected because Jean-Marc Rolain, being one of the co-authors of the article and editor of the journal, did not participate in the evaluation. The publisher Elsevier then announced an additional independent evaluation to determine whether the concerns about the article were well founded. == References == ==External links== * Microbiome Digest blog * Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch whistleblowers Category:Dutch microbiologists Category:Scientific misconduct Category:Utrecht University alumni ","title":"Elisabeth Bik"},{"id":"61716876","text":"Aristide or Aristid Blank, also spelled Blanc or Blanck (January 1, 1883 ‚Äì January 1, 1960), was a Romanian financier, economist, arts patron and playwright. His father, Mauriciu Blank, an assimilated and naturalized Romanian Jew, was manager of the Marmorosch Blank Bank (BMB), a major financial enterprise. Aristide took up jobs within the same company, and, after seeing action in the Second Balkan War and World War I, began expanding its investments, branching out into maritime transport and founding CIDNA/CFRNA airlines. This period witnessed his attempt at setting up a press empire around the twin dailies AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa, and his brief engagement with Epoca. Inheriting his father's position at the BMB, Blank expanded its activities and expenditures, setting aside money for graft, and allowing his staff to engage in accounting fraud. By 1923, he was also engaged in Romanian nationalist politics, sponsoring propaganda writings and working alongside historians Nicolae Iorga and Vasile P√¢rvan. He set up his own publishing house, Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ, and a literary agency, which was for a while managed by philosopher Nae Ionescu‚Äîultimately sacked by Blank upon the discovery of embezzlement. Blank, who allegedly alternated mainstream politics with support for the far-left, found himself pitted against the antisemitic far-right, being brutalized by the National Christian Defense League and marked for retribution by the Iron Guard. Beginning in the early 1920s, Blank cultivated Crown Prince Carol, who took over as King of Romania after a 1930 coup. Emerging as Carol's economic adviser, Blank joined the resulting camarilla, an affiliation which shielded him from the consequences of BMB mismanagement. The enterprise crashed in 1931, unable to absorb the effects of the Great Depression. Blank was removed from his managerial position following intervention by the National Bank of Romania, but used political channels to preserve some measure of control, and was instrumental in toppling National Bank Governor Mihail Manoilescu, who did not wish to refinance the BMB. His influence fluctuated for the remainder of Carol's reign; still unable to fully control the BMB, he still owned Discom, a lucrative retailer for products of state monopolies. Public antisemitism and fascism took the forefront during the late years of Carlism and the early years of World War II. This period saw Blank marginalized, and resulted in additional scrutiny of the BMB affair, at the end of which he was sentenced to pay 600 million lei in damages. Blank reemerged as BMB manager after King Michael's Coup of 1944, but he and his business were finally repressed by the communist regime from 1948. In 1953, he was sentenced to 20 years for high treason, but managed to have that verdict overturned in 1955. After international pressures, he was allowed to emigrate in 1958, and lived his final months in Paris. His children from his successive marriages and affairs include American soldier Milenko Blank and French press magnate Patrice-Aristide Blank. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Born in Bucharest on the first day of 1883Claudiu Seca»ôiu, \\"Biografia lui Aristide Blank (I)\\", in Realitatea EvreiascƒÉ, Issues 520‚Äì521 (1320‚Äì1321), July‚ÄìAugust 2018, p. 15 (New Style: January 13), Aristide was the son of Mauriciu Blank.

R., \\"Y-a-t-il un antis√©mitisme roumain?\\", in L'Univers Isra√©lite, Vol. 79, Issue 47, August 1924, p. 367 By 1920 the family's ethnic background was still largely unknown to the Romanian public, with the Jewish publication M√¢ntuirea noting that Aristide was of \\"obscure origin\\".Zarafopol, \\"Imprumutul Blank\\", in Furnica, Vol. XV, Issue 27, April 1920, p. 11 Circa 1880, Mauriciu was entering the financial elite of the newly established Principality of Romania, having served as head of the Marmorosch Blank Bank (BMB) since 1874. At the time of Aristide's birth, it was the most powerful private bank in the Romanian Kingdom.Mucenic, pp. 339‚Äì343 Blank's political friend and enemy, Constantin Argetoianu, claims that Mauriciu had a marriage of convenience to Aristide's mother Betina Goldenberg, who was \\"ugly as well as vulgar, avaricious as well as venomous\\".Argetoianu (1997), p. 270 One of Aristide's sisters were married off to another financier, Adalbert Csillag, who would experience complete bankruptcy. Another sister, Margot, married industrialist Herman Spayer, whose residence on Bati»ôtei Street was briefly used by the BMB.Waldman & Ciuciu, pp. 124‚Äì125 The family finally received Romanian citizenship in 1883,Maschio & PƒÉduraru, p. 291 shortly after Aristide's birth. According to a hostile note by French journalist Jean Mourat, Blank Jr was \\"raised in luxury, so as to keep up with good traditions.\\"Jean Mourat, \\"Les millionaires meurent dans leur lit\\", in Ce Soir, May 1, 1937, p. 10 Aristide received an elite education, and was possessed of an artistic sensibility;Nicolae Cajal, Hary Kuller, Contribu»õia evreilor din Rom√¢nia la culturƒÉ »ôi civiliza»õie, pp. 70‚Äì71. Bucharest: Editura Hasefer, 2004. however, Argetoianu portrays him as \\"highly intelligent [but] lacking a serious culture\\", his main attributes being ambition, jealousy, and eventually paranoia.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 68, 70 He became a published poet in his teenage years: his DespƒÉr»õire, a pastiche from Eduard von Feuchtersleben that he signed as \\"Aristide Blanc\\", appeared in Foaia PopularƒÉ in April 1900.Aristide Blanc, \\"DespƒÉr»õire (dupƒÉ Feuchtersleben)\\", in Foaia PopularƒÉ, Issue 16/1900, p. 5 Blank took a graduation diploma from the University of Bucharest Faculty of Law and Philosophy. In January 1909, he married the daughter of politician Emanoil Culoglu, with a civil ceremony attended by VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu, Emil Costinescu, and Vasile Mor»õun.\\"O cƒÉsƒÉtorie √Æn lumea mare\\", in Tribuna, Vol. XII, Issue 287, January 1909, p. 10 Initially, he closely followed his father's career in finance. By 1910, he was serving on the board of directors for various BMB branches, including Moldova Bank of Ia»ôi and the Aromanian Bank of Commerce.Mucenic, p. 344 He was inducted into the Order of Commercial and Industrial Merit in 1912, when he also served on the committee to establish the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies.Waldman & Ciuciu, p. 120 In June 1913, Blank was blackmailed by Seara newspaperman Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti, who had inaugurated a smear campaign against the BMB. According to notes left by Searas Mateiu Caragiale, Blank \\"trapped\\" Bogdan-Pite»ôti with direct support from the Romanian Police.Ion Vianu, Investiga»õii mateine, p. 39. Cluj-Napoca & Ia»ôi: Biblioteca Apostrof & Polirom, 2008. This refers to a sting operation at Flora Restaurant, where Blank heard Bogdan-Pite»ôti and his associate Adolf Davidescu state their demands while policemen were standing by.\\"»òantagiul Serei\\", in Opinia.

Bucharest: Editura Socec, 1921 A month after, Romania entered the Second Balkan War, with Blank enlisted as a Land Forces officer in Southern Dobruja. It was here that he first met historian and politician Nicolae Iorga, with whom he would cooperate on cultural ventures in the early 1920s.»öurlea, p. 134 Upon the expedition's end, Blank Jr helped to establish and finance two BMB naval transport enterprises‚Äîrespectively operating on the Black Sea and the Danube.Mucenic, p. 347 In the winter of 1914‚Äì1915, he was sent to the United Kingdom by the Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu government in order to secure a loan for the state, establishing neutral Romania's closer ties to the Triple Entente.Ion G. Duca, Amintiri politice, I, pp. 149‚Äì150. Munich: Jon Dumitru-Verlag, 1981 This mission caused much controversy at home: Foreign Minister Emanoil Porumbaru refused to sign his name to the deal, believing that it compromised Romania's policy of non-alignment; he was consequently forced to resign. Upon his return, Blank debuted in economic theory with a tract on pricing policies, Scumpirea »ôi ieftinirea traiului (\\"Increases and Decreases in the Cost of Living\\", Bucharest, 1915‚Äì1916). In September 1915, he served as executive of an anonymous partnership for the manufacture and sale of ammunition. This had been established by his father with participation from Culoglu, Alexandru Kiri»õescu, and Mihail SƒÉulescu.\\"»òtiri ‚Äî 24 septembrie n. 1915\\", in Gazeta Transilvaniei, Issue 197/1915, p. 3 As reported by Argetoianu, Blank Jr still had connections in the German Empire, which he used to plant his protege Felix Wieder in a German consortium‚Äîa position which Wieder then used to defraud that firm.Argetorianu, p. 68 ===Social rise=== The Treaty of Bucharest brought Romania into the war as an Entente ally, then its invasion by Germany. Again drafted as a Lieutenant, Blank was spotted at Ia»ôi, the provisional capital of a rump Romanian state. Argetoianu reports that wartime Ia»ôi was where Blank first earned the trust of Carol of Hohenzollern, the disgraced Romanian Crown Prince. Carol used Blank in his attempts to earn support from Premier Alexandru Averescu. Also according to Argetoianu, Blank was also faking asthma attacks, which saw him relieved of his duties and sent to Paris.Argetoianu (1997), p. 68 Blank remained in France for the rest of World War I, and beyond, working primarily as a propagandist and financier for Romanian nationalist causes.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 68, 69 Historian Orest Tafrali identifies Blank and Paul BrƒÉtƒÉ»ôanu as the two main backers of La Roumanie newspaper, which campaigned for the creation of a Greater Romania.CƒÉlin Hentea, \\"AvanpremierƒÉ editorialƒÉ. Mereu nerostita istorie a luptelor rom√¢nilor\\", in Revista LiterarƒÉ, Issue 2/2018, p. 24 Before the end of that year, Blank was allegedly in Nice, alongside Octavian Goga, the Transylvanian poet-activist.Pic., \\"'Eu (Octavian Goga) scriu, scriu, scriu'! 'Dta (Iuliu Maniu) taci, taci, taci'!\\", in Chemarea Tinerimei Rom√¢ne, Issue 12/1926, p. 2 In December, he published in La Renaissance his own project for a Greater Romania, which he depicted as an economic boon for the Allied cause. Blank envisaged the Danube as a commercial highway for Romanian grain and timber, but noted that its success relied on the internationalization of the Turkish Straits.Charles Demailly, \\"A travers la presse. L'union des Roumains\\", in Le Gaulois, December 8, 1918, p. 3 In 1919, when he was decommissioned as a Captain in the Second Cavalry Regiment, Blank put out the first volume of an illustrated propaganda album, La Roumanie en images. Iorga viewed it as a superior work of art, but noted that its selection of prints displayed \\"banality\\" and a \\"lack of familiarity with all newer discoveries regarding Romania's past\\". After reading his comments, Blank employed Iorga as his editorial adviser.»öurlea, p. 133 The following year, he sponsored French editions from Iorga's own works: Histoire des Roumains et de leur civilisation and Anthologie de la litt√©rature roumaine.»öurlea, p. 134. See also Stanciu, p. 567 Blank's profile in culture and politics was intertwined with his personal life. Around 1919, he was briefly married to Ecaterina Caragiale, daughter of the playwright Ion Luca Caragiale and Mateiu's half-sister.George CƒÉlinescu, Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne de la origini p√ÆnƒÉ √Æn prezent, p. 1002.

By then, Blank had fathered a son, Patrice-Aristide,Vartic, p. 8 reportedly born \\"Aristide Blank Satinover\\"H√©l√®ne Duc, M√©moires de la Shoah. H√©l√®ne Duc.

Their businesses now branched out into aviation. In 1920, Aristide used BMB funds to set up CIDNA/CFRNA, alongside aviator Pierre de Fleurieu. This was the first airline to offer a direct Paris‚ÄìBucharest flight, with an extension to Istanbul; the route was inaugurated by Albert Louis Deullin, with a landing at Pipera Airport in October 1921.\\"Derni√®re heure. Paris‚ÄìBucarest en avion\\", in Journal des D√©bats, October 24, 1921, p. 4 According to Argetoianu, Blank also involved himself in setting up the Romanian Air Club, because doing so would bring him closer to Carol, himself an aviation enthusiast.Argetoianu (1997), p. 71 Also then, Blank founded the BMB's General Building Society, which managed construction firms in Bucharest and C√¢mpina. Both Blanks also became involved in assisting humanitarian work by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. This included a BMB loan for the reconstruction of Bukovina Jewish property, for which Blank offered a reduced interest.Silviu B. Moldovan, \\"Recenzii. Note de lecturƒÉ.

As noted at the time by Furnica magazine, this mission could effectively turn Blank against BrƒÉtianu and his supporters in the banking industry, since the PNL's policy was to prevent adversaries from \\"doing even the right thing\\". By contrast, PNL doctrinaire VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu viewed Blank as one who opposed attempts of rebuilding Romania's economy into a \\"national framework\\".\\"Coresponden»õƒÉ ineditƒÉ. Dialog de la distan»õƒÉ VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu ‚Äî Radu R. Rosetti\\", in Dosarele Istoriei, Issue 1 (53), 2001, p. 23 A lasting feud ensued between Blank and the National Liberals, which resulted in the BMB being staffed exclusively with adversaries or dissidents of the PNL‚Äîincluding Goga, Alexandru C. Constantinescu, Nicolae Tabacovici, and Alexandru Vaida-Voevod. In 1920, Blank set up a luxurious Romanian restaurant in Paris' Latin Quarter,\\"Echos et nouvelles. La Roumanie a Paris\\", in L'Univers Isra√©lite, Vol. 75, Issue 31, April 1920, p. 106 which was for a while managed by sociologist Mihai Ralea.NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 32 Having secured a contract for the transfer of scholarships for Romanian students in France, Blank also sponsored Iorga's Romanian School, created in 1922 at Fontenay-aux-Roses.Irina Iacomi, \\"Un moment dans l'histoire intellectuelle entre France et Roumanie. √âcole Roumaine de Paris\\", in Revue Roumaine d'√âtudes Francophones, Vol. 6, 2014, p. 127; Stanciu, pp. 567‚Äì568; »öurlea, p. 134 As seen by historian Petre »öurlea, Iorga's relationship with Blank was \\"highly profitable for [Romanian] culture\\". It resulted in the establishment of a popular theater tied to Iorga's Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians.Stanciu, pp. 567‚Äì568; »öurlea, pp. 133‚Äì134 According to historian Lucian T. Butaru, Iorga appreciated Blank's cultural endeavor, and this may have helped tone down his otherwise entrenched antisemitism.Lucian T. Butaru, Rasism rom√¢nesc. Componenta rasialƒÉ a discursului antisemit din Rom√¢nia, p√¢nƒÉ la Al Doilea RƒÉzboi Mondial, pp. 95‚Äì06. Cluj-Napoca: EFES, 2010. Blank also provided funds for Iorga's son Mircea to study abroad, which, Argetoianu claims, effectively meant that the Iorga family was in his debt;Argetoianu (1997), pp. 226‚Äì227 Iorga responded to such accusations, noting that his son was under no obligation to work for Blank.Stanciu, p. 567 ===AdevƒÉrul and literary circle=== In addition to being a gifted orator, Blank still had literary pretensions. He debuted as a pseudonymous dramatist in Paris and Bucharest. According to Argetoianu, his work in the field was merely \\"idiotic\\",Argetoianu (1997), p. 69 though Blank was admitted to the Romanian Dramatists' Society in 1930.Cernat, p. 45 His few published plays include Iarna la Hangerli and Rapsodie des dieux. In the 1920s, he founded or financed a series of cultural institutions of his own. These included Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ publishing house, which was established and named on Iorga's advice and offered lucrative employment to intellectuals such as Dimitrie Gusti and Vasile P√¢rvan.Mo»õoc, passim; NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 377; Pandrea, p. 356; »òeicaru & Marcovici, pp. 319‚Äì322 Blank was also responsible for the Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ editorial office and, in 1920, for a literary club called Societatea FilarmonicƒÉ. Also in 1920, Blank became the target of a renewed smear campaign, this time carried by Tudor Arghezi's Cronica. As reported by a Siguran»õa source, he solved this issue by presenting Arghezi with a gift of 100,000 lei, later supplemented by a monthly stipend.Raluca Nicoleta Spiridon, \\"Tudor Arghezi √Æn aten»õia structurilor de informa»õii (1932‚Äì1946)\\", in Caietele CNSAS, Vol. III, Issue 1, 2010, p. 134 Blank also agreed to sponsor Arghezi associate Gala Galaction, who asked for a grant of 160,000 lei in order to translate the Bible into Romanian. However, Galaction failed to keep up with the writing schedule. In 1921, Blank partly withdrew his support, and only advanced Galaction 36,000 lei for his version of the New Testament.Emanuel Con»õac, \\"Tradi»õia biblicƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ. O prezentare succintƒÉ din perspectiva principalelor versiuni rom√¢ne»ôti ale Sfintei Scripturi\\", in Studii Teologice, Issue 2/2011, p. 197 During those months, Blank attempted to built up his a press empire of his own. He sponsored Grigore Filipescu, a BMB associate, helping him relaunch the conservative daily Epoca. He maintained some say in Epocas editorial policy, preventing Liviu Rebreanu from publishing an article that was critical of Blank himself.Popescu, pp. 19‚Äì20 Blank purchased the left-wing dailies AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa, which became BMB and Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ assets. Reportedly, this investment cost him 7 million lei.Aladin, \\"AdevƒÉrul, Lupta »ôi Lumina sau farsele d-lui Mille\\", in Contimporanul, Vol. I, Issue 11, September 1922, p. 13 The circumstances for Blank's takeover, whereby journalist Constantin Mille renounced his most valuable enterprise, were debated by the staff, and remain mysterious. Florentina Tone, \\"PƒÉrintele ziaristicii rom√¢ne moderne\\", in AdevƒÉrul, December 21, 2008 Ciprian Chirvasiu, \\"Constantin Mille, geniul inovator al Adeverului (IV)\\", in AdevƒÉrul, July 2, 2013 Shortly after, Mille used the money to launch another newspaper, Lupta, which competed with Blank's consortium and opened its offices just opposite. Mainly using AdevƒÉrul to air his polemics with the National Liberal Viitorul, Blank immediately reassured its readers that the newspaper would remain a strong voice on the traditional left. However, an article in Contimporanul alleges that he personally sacked the caretaker editor, Emil Fagure, which also caused the resignation of another staff member, Barbu BrƒÉni»ôteanu. Management was then handled by militant Romanian journalist Constantin Graur and by Jewish entrepreneur Emil Pauker, who was coincidentally the uncle of a prominent communist, Marcel Pauker. As argued by Argetoianu, Blank purposefully spent his own money on far-leftist causes, so as to undermine the Romanian state. He claims to have personally intervened to have Mauriciu \\"put a leash\\" on Aristide, when the latter became involved with Philippe Ciprut in sponsoring the Socialist Party of Romania. In 1924, Blank resold AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa to Graur and other subordinate journalists, causing Mille to express his indignation in Lupta: \\"I had sold my newspapers to Mr Aristide Blank, a man of youth, of culture, of initiative, who had, in addition to his millions, the structure of an honest man, of a fighter for democracy and truth. I could not imagine that Mr Blank viewed AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa with the character and interest of a regular fella, as a commercial business that one just sells off to whomever\\". Pauker and his brother Simion took over more shares of AdevƒÉrul, which became widely perceived as their newspaper, and therefore as a \\"Jewish\\" enterprise. According to memoirist and lawyer Petre Pandrea, Blank intended to take over as Minister of Finance, and for this reason surrounded himself with intellectuals such as P√¢rvan and Nae Ionescu.Pandrea, pp. 217‚Äì218, 296, 356 At Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ, he oversaw luxury editions from works both Caragiales, possibly intended as homages to his former wife.Vartic, p. 5 Blank also took personal charge of the Economics Collection, which he then assigned to a specialist Mihail Manoilescu, who used it to publish his own tract, Politica produc»õiei na»õionale (\\"The Policy of National Production\\").Mo»õoc, pp. 80‚Äì81 Until 1923, Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ's printing offices put out the literary magazine G√¢ndirea, managed by Cezar Petrescu and Nichifor Crainic. As reported by Crainic, this partnership broke down when P√¢rvan attempted to prevent them from hosting criticism of Blank.Nichifor Crainic, \\"Cronica mƒÉruntƒÉ. √én anul al 18-lea\\", in G√¢ndirea, Vol. XVIII, Issue 1, January 1939, pp. 54‚Äì55 Also in 1923, Ionescu purchased his Bucharest villa using an affordable credit obtained from the financier;NastasƒÉ (2010), pp. 394‚Äì395; »òeicaru & Marcovici, p. 320 a year later, Blank sponsored Constantin Daicoviciu's research at Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa.Constantin Daicoviciu, \\"Fouilles et recherches a Sarmizegetusa. Ier Compte-rendu\\", in Revista Dacia, Vol. I, 1924, p. 224 Ionescu was employed by Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ, but left after a public row with its patron. The issue of contention was Ionescu's fraudulent management of the Central Book Office, a literary agency and subsidiary of Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ, which allegedly brought Blank losses of 800,000 lei.Pandrea, pp. 217‚Äì218, 356 As narrated by journalist Pamfil »òeicaru, Blank caught on only after attending Ionescu's lavish house-warming party, and later discovered that Ionescu had forged P√¢rvan and Gusti's signatures on the company's balance sheets.»òeicaru & Marcovici, pp. 320‚Äì322 Blank shielded Ionescu from prosecution, but forced him to write a letter of confession.Pandrea, pp. 217‚Äì218; »òeicaru & Marcovici, pp. 321‚Äì322, 356 Photocopies of this were kept by all those whom Ionescu had defrauded,»òeicaru & Marcovici, pp. 321‚Äì322 while Blank had the original, which he reportedly showed to Argetoianu after Ionescu made attempts to return as a politician.Argetoianu (1998), p. 18 ===Far-right attacks and Regency intrigues=== Blank's involvement with youth and left-wing causes during the process of Jewish emancipation saw him engaged in a prolonged conflict with the antisemitic far-right, and in particular with Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, who would emerge as a regional leader of the National Christian Defense League (LANC). Codreanu first identified Blank as an enemy during the Student Congress of 1920, when he attempted to pass motions for religious discrimination; this was opposed by other youth leaders, whom Codreanu then accused of being Blank's agents.NastasƒÉ (2011), p. 175 In late 1923, police agents captured Codreanu, Ion Mo»õa, and other LANC activists, accusing them of plotting to assassinate members of the Romanian political and financial elite, including the Blanks.Pop, pp. 42‚Äì43 Though cleared of the crime, Codreanu later acknowledged that he and Mo»õa wished to rid Romania of those who had \\"corrupted all of Romania's parties and politicians\\", identifying Aristide as a leading sponsor of the National Peasants' Party (PN»ö).Pop, p. 42 The latter rumor was replicated in other sources, with one unsigned denouncer claiming that the PN»ö's debt to the BMB ran higher than 30 million lei in 1930. In April 1924, at the height of a scandal involving Codreanu's arrest, LANC affiliates stormed into a hall where Blank Jr was lecturing on economic matters.

A note in L'Univers Isra√©lite claimed that the incident was in fact orchestrated by government, while Argetoianu believes that students in general genuinely detested Blank. The harassment continued over several years. In January 1925, Codreanu's student organizations again alleged that Blank was trafficking in influence through the Romanian universities, and used this issue as a rally call for a student strike.NastasƒÉ (2011), pp. 122‚Äì123 As part of their conflict with Iorga, LƒÉncieri youths openly confronted him, asking him why had \\"sold himself to banker Blank\\"; details about such contacts were popularized by LANC leader A. C. Cuza and by the PN»ö's own Virgil Madgearu.Stanciu, pp. 566‚Äì568 The Iron Guard, founded by Codreanu after his split with the LANC, put up Blank's name on an enemies' list which also included Constantin Banu, Alexandru C. Constantinescu, Wilhelm Filderman, and Gheorghe Gh. M√¢rzescu.Magda Stavinschi, \\"Chipuri uitate. Constantin Banu\\", in Magazin Istoric, February 2012, p. 21 As reported by Argetoianu, Blank held the top position on that list, and was effectively marked for death.Argetoianu (1998), p. 303 The Guard, along with other far-right groups, also singled out AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa as propaganda for anti-Romanian concepts.Ornea, pp. 245, 392, 402, 459‚Äì465 In March 1925, Blank married Vota Vesniƒá, orphaned daughter of Yugoslav Premier Milenko Radomar Vesniƒá. Their Paris wedding was attended by numerous figures in politics and social life, including the then-Yugoslav Premier Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, Maharajah Jagatjit Singh, diplomat Nicolae Titulescu, banker Robert de Rothschild, and writers such as Marcel Pr√©vost and Elena VƒÉcƒÉrescu. A LANC newspaper covered the event, noting: \\"Blank must be reminded that this international and Jewified society does not impose itself on the Romanian public, who still feels the same way about him as those students who pummeled him out [...] in late March 1924.\\"\\"CƒÉsƒÉtoria 'regelui' finan»õei rom√¢ne»ôti. Cine a participat la recep»õie\\", in Rom√¢nia √éntregitƒÉ, Issue 5/1925, p. 13 In honor of his new wife, Blank sometimes used the pseudonym Votaris, which combined their given names.Argetoianu (1997), p. 130 A sport aficionado, Vota organized a tennis tournament at the Blank family villa in Techirghiol.\\"SerbƒÉrile dela Techirghiol-Eforie\\", in Realitatea IlustratƒÉ, Vol. VII, Issue 347, September 1933, p. 13 In June 1926, she gave birth to the financier's son, Milenko Blank.\\"Dans le monde. Naissances\\", in Journal des D√©bats, June 10, 1926, p. 3 In March 1925, Iorga was enraged by Blank, who had presented a complete list of BMB sponsorships for Iorga's ventures; the two men parted ways. Also that year, Carol was forced out of the country by the political establishment, but Blank continued to cultivate their relationship. As reported by Argetoianu, he effectively managed (and often misused) the Prince's bank accounts. This is partly backed by later historians: Mihai Opri»õescu notes that Blank was betting on Carol's return;Opri»õescu et al., p. 38 Claudiu Seca»ôiu also notes that Blank and Carol enjoyed a \\"great rapport\\" in 1927, when Blank \\"supported him financially.\\"Claudiu Seca»ôiu, \\"Biografia lui Aristide Blank (II)\\", in Realitatea EvreiascƒÉ, Issues 522‚Äì523 (1322‚Äì1323), September 2018, p. 15 Following the death of King Ferdinand I that same year, Carol was sidestepped in the succession list, and the throne went to his minor son Michael. A Council of Regents oversaw matters relating to the court; one of its members was Gheorghe Buzdugan, who, in 1929, declared having \\"particular high esteem for Aristide Blank, the banker who is a remarkable personality, a man with a big heart and a philanthropist.\\"\\"Roumanian Statesmen and Leaders Declare Their Views on Current Jewish Question\\", in the Jewish Daily Bulletin, June 19, 1929, p. 1 Mauriciu, who had withdrawn from active participation at the BMB, died at Vienna in November 1929, with Aristide organizing the funeral ceremony.Mucenic, p. 348 Blank Jr was by then head of the BMB, allegedly because Mauriciu had overestimated his son's business acumen.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 70‚Äì71, 270 According to Argetoianu, he went on to severely weaken the company with a project to destroy the National Liberals' influence in high finance, as well as with unwise investments‚Äîsuch as opening a BMB subsidiary on Place Vend√¥me.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 70‚Äì71 From 1923, the group had three additional international offices‚Äîin Istanbul, Vienna, and New York City. Sitting on the BMB's steering board, Argetoianu claimed to have observed the company having engaged virtually all of its available funds in investment schemes.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 269‚Äì270 Another issue hindering the bank's activities was the growing rivalry between Blank and his associate Richard de S√∂pk√©z, with both engaged in drawing up capital on their respective side. According to Argetoianu, they each took at least 13.5 million lei in yearly stipends, while also collecting dividends from companies credited by the BMB, and through which Blank defrauded associates such as Ion G. Duca and George II of Greece.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 270‚Äì272 A later investigation suggested that Blank had used large sums of money for graft, and that his staff was engaged in accounting fraud. ===BMB crash and royal protection=== A September 1929 review in Revista EconomicƒÉ pointed out \\"conundrums\\" (buclucuri) having to do with the BMB's investments in industry. It also noted that Blank was spreading rumors that the state bank for industry, Creditul Industrial, needed to be restructured; allegations emerged that this was a deliberate attempt create market panic, so that a new Creditul could then refinance Blank's own projects.Remizier, \\"Situa»õia\\", in Revista EconomicƒÉ, Vol. XXXI, Issue 39, September 1929, pp. 341‚Äì342 By 1930, the BMB had defaulted after registering 1.6 million lei in deficit.Florin Mihai, \\"'Tunurile' Suveranului\\", in Jurnalul Na»õional, August 8, 2008 The enterprise went bankrupt in October 1931, immediately after being exposed to the consequences of the Great Depression‚Äîthough, Argetoianu notes, the world crisis only served to obscure the effects of Blank's own managerial \\"insanity\\".Argetoianu (1997), pp. 70, 268 This crash sparked a national scandal, after allegations that some investors had market moving information, allowing them to withdraw deposits in advance. Blank himself argued that withdrawals were made possible by rumors of a looming war between Romania and the Soviet Union, but his explanation failed to convince the general public. According to Argetoianu, Blank also complained that the investors' walkout was facilitated by the National Bank of Romania, whose Governor, Costin Stoicescu, was a disgruntled BMB employee. He believes that this claim was credible, in that Stoicescu always opposed state intervention in favor of the BMB.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 272‚Äì273 Shortly before the BMB's crash, Carol returned home abruptly, deposing his son and taking over as King. As a result, Blank made his way into the camarilla, a secretive para-legal circle which decided on political and financial matters.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 67sqq; Opri»õescu et al., p. 38; Ornea, pp. 17, 265 Also frequenting this circle, Argetoianu noted that Blank was a second-wave inductee into the camarilla, arriving in at the same time as Tabacovici and \\"the pimp\\" Alexandru Mavrodi; but also that, during the first year of Carol's reign, he became his most influential adviser, to the point of \\"ruling over Romania\\".Argetoianu (1997), pp. 67, 71‚Äì72 The same memoirist further contends that Blank and Carol shared a psychological pathology, namely \\"hyperacute sexual excitement\\" and \\"erotomania\\", which prevented them for going through with any project. He notes that Blank's vice, which required him to spend large sums for the sexual favors of \\"women who are into money and luxuries\\", ended with him going destitute and \\"half insane\\".Argetoianu (1997), pp. 69‚Äì70 A doctrinaire on economic matters, Blank served as a trustee of the Academy of Economic Studies (1929‚Äì1939), and also oversaw a committee for the administration of penal facilities (1930‚Äì1935). He continued to write newspaper articles, studies and memorials on Romania's postwar situation. His books include ' (\\"Contributions to Solving the Economic Crisis\\", 1922), La crise economique en Roumanie (\\"The Romanian Economic Crisis\\", 1922), Economice (\\"Economic Writings\\", 1932), Literare (\\"Literary Writings\\", 1932) and ' (\\"The Monetary Issue as Relates to Public and Private Credit\\"). Argetoianu describes such contributions as \\"childish inventions\\" and \\"theoretical jugglery\\", noting that \\"not even Tabacovici would read them\\"‚Äîbut also that Carol was highly impressed, for being \\"entirely ignorant on financial and economic matters.\\"Argetoianu (1997), pp. 69, 71 The monarch also recognized Blank's achievements in the transportation, inducting him into Meritul Aeronautic order of chivalry. As Argetoianu claims, the king eventually grew aware that Blank was not fully competent, but continued to seek his advice. Argetoianu argues that this was because Blank had since earned the confidence of Carol's lover Magda Lupescu, buying her a villa and making it so that she would befriend Tabacovici and Wieder.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 71‚Äì72 Reportedly, the only camarilla businessman who could still mitigate his influence at the court was Nicolae Malaxa.Argetoianu (1997), p. 73 Like Malaxa and Max Auschnitt, Blank belonged to Me»ôterul Manole Lodge, a branch of Romanian Freemasonry which was intimately involved in sponsoring cultural projects by fellow Masons.NastasƒÉ (2010), p. 231 & (2011), p. 477 In 1930, however, Blank gave up on his main investment in the cultural field, allowing Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ to be acquired by the State Printers and Monitorul Oficial.Waldman & Ciuciu, p. 120. See also Opri»õescu et al., p. 39 An anonymous report of the period claims that this liquidation resulted in massive payoffs for all the stakeholders, including Crainic and Puiu Dumitrescu.Opri»õescu et al., p. 39 Two years later, Blank's CIDNA was taken over by the French state and became a component of the state carrier, Air France. Argetoianu and Blank were instrumental in helping Carol reach a settlement with his former wife, Queen Helen.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 123‚Äì124 In January 1931, Argetoianu also sent Blank to approach Titulescu in St. Moritz, hoping to ensure his own political survival as part of a Titulescu cabinet.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 130, 133, 142, 173, 198, 201 A rumor circulating at the time alleged that Titulescu owed 14 million lei to the BMB.Potra, p. 389 The cabinet, which was never sworn in, was to include Blank as one of the ministers.Argetoianu (1997), p. 166 In addition to endorsing Carol, Blank was going public as a critic of PN»ö governments in matters of economic policy. According to Grigore Gafencu, he was using AdevƒÉrul and the Carlist newspaper Cuv√¢ntul to criticize attempts at contracting a new loan in France. Blank and his colleagues described these as a sure path to economic enslavement. Daniel Apostol, \\"Marea CrizƒÉ din 1929‚Äì1933 √Æn presa rom√¢neascƒÉ a vremii: Statul cheltuie»ôte banul public √Æn dezmƒÉ»õ!\\", in Historia, June 2010 According to PN»ö man Ioan Hudi»õƒÉ, Gafencu was in fact Blank's man inside both party and government. Hudi»õƒÉ reports several accounts according to which Blank had arranged Gafencu's wedding to an actress, and that she had earlier been his mistress.Potra, pp. 185, 201, 208 ===Camarilla clashes=== A Iorga government was instead sworn in, with Argetoianu holding several ministerial portfolios. Over the following months, he and Blank came to clash over the issue of Romania's Alcohol Monopoly.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 262‚Äì264, 276‚Äì277, 437 Blank associated himself with the \\"international gangster\\" Reschnitzer to obtain a lease on that enterprise, but, Argetoianu reports, \\"didn't get anything out of it, because I myself stood in [their] way\\" (emphasis in the original).Argetoianu (1997), p. 262 He recalls agreeing to give Reschnitzer's consortium a pre-emption right to the Monopoly, thus placating Blank, but also that he never actually intended to sell the company.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 276‚Äì277 The two camarilla figures were also at odds over Blank's creation of Discom, a private enterprise which served as a retailer for the Tobacco, Salt, and Matches Monopolies. Under his management, this business never produced an actual profit for the state, as most surpluses were drawn into covering BMB losses.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 274‚Äì276 Carol also intervened to get Discom a share from the Alcohol Monopoly, as well as control over Loteria de Stat; through the king's pressures, the General Council of Bucharest also spent 500 million lei on acquiring Blank's allotment in Otopeni. In June 1931, Blank was dispatched to Berlin, kicking off trade negotiations between Romania and Weimar Germany.\\"Famous Roumanian Jewish Banker Aristide Blanc Representing Roumanian Government in Berlin\\", in Daily News Bulletin Issued by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, June 15, 1931, p. 6 By then, the BMB affair had presented an opportunity for Manoilescu, also a camarilla man, who became Governor of the National Bank that same year. Manoilescu claimed that Argetoianu's demands for a bailout were feudal in nature, and could only serve to demolish whatever remained functional of Romania's industry and agriculture.Opri»õescu et al., pp. 38, 40 According to Argetoianu, Manoilescu was \\"determined to destroy Aristide\\", unaware that the king had issued orders to protect Blank at all cost.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 300‚Äì305, 311 The point is underscored by Pandrea, who also notes that a resentful Nae Ionescu played a part in forcing Manoilescu to push for Blank's bankruptcy.Pandrea, p. 356 In that context, Premier Iorga took Carol's side, writing in Neamul Rom√¢nesc that the state had a moral duty to rescue Blank's business.Opri»õescu et al., p. 40 As a BMB associate, Grigore Filipescu openly asked Manoilescu to refinance Blank's enterprise. Once his request was denied, he publicized Manoilescu's conflict of interest and pushed for an audit. Manoilescu sued him, alleging forgery, but failed to make his case in court.Popescu, p. 36 This parallel scandal continued to 1937, when Filipescu was able to demonstrate in front of a jury that Manoilescu, despite being publicly antisemitic, had been bribed by Jewish finance.Crax., \\"DouƒÉ achitƒÉri cu t√¢lc resunƒÉtor\\", in Rom√¢nul. Organ al Partidului Na»õional-»öƒÉrƒÉnesc din Jude»õul Arad, Issue 1/1937, p. 2 As noted by Argetoianu, Blank and Manoilescu also continued to attack each other as \\"scoundrels and profiteers\\", and were equally right: \\"their readers should embrace [the respective] half of what each one writes down\\".Argetoianu (1997), p. 269 Among the later authors, Opri»õescu notes that Manoilescu was essentially right, and that Argetoianu, as a BMB steakholder, was \\"try[ing] to profit from this situation\\". The BMB crash, which brought down other banking institutions, convinced Argetoianu to legislate debt relief; however, when it emerged that Blank and Manoilescu were acting in bad faith, he made efforts not to bail out the bank itself, but merely contained the effects of its failure.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 273‚Äì274, 282‚Äì284, 286, 290‚Äì232, 325‚Äì326 & (1998), p. 11 As he reports, Stoicescu also played a part in this controversy. He \\"had poor Aristide grilled and spinning over burning coals\\",Argetoianu (1997), p. 292 finally obtaining Blank's resignation and replacement with S√∂pk√©z. His shares in the company were then handed in as a loan collateral to the Romanian state.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 292‚Äì293, 298, 313‚Äì314, 316‚Äì326 As claimed by Argetoianu, Blank continued to defraud his own bank by cashing in a check for 43 million lei, which he then deposited for safekeeping with Blanche Ulman-Vesniƒá, his mother-in-law.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 298 He and Argetoianu, working together, collected a dossier showing Manoilescu's own history in illegal trading.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 326‚Äì327 Reassured by Carol's support, Blank was ultimately victorious and, as a result, Manoilescu lost his camarilla privileges in November 1931.Argetoianu (1997), pp. 328‚Äì335; Ornea, p. 265 Argetoianu himself was eventually replaced after proposing that the BMB merge with other credit enterprises into a single private entity supervised by the National Bank. As he reports, his fall was made possible by a businessmen's coalition, which included Manoilescu and \\"even the right honorable Aristide Blank\\";Argetoianu (1997), pp. 297‚Äì298 the most vocal opposition came from smaller banks, which were threatened with liquidation. In 1932‚Äì1933, the National Bank refinanced the BMB, though the latter had to concede its shares in Discom; this operation failed to keep the enterprise afloat, and it was finally liquidated in 1936. According to Mourat, Blank \\"does not seem to have been seriously compromised\\" by BMB scandals, and continued to be credited by foreign investors, \\"keen on learning about the 'immense potential' of his rich country.\\" Blank also preserved his standing in literary circles. He entertained and dined cultural figures, including writers Scarlat Froda and Mihail Sebastian‚Äîin his diaries, the latter refers to Blank as a \\"poser\\".Sebastian, pp. 12‚Äì13 According to Sebastian, Blank and Froda had threesomes with actress Leny Caler.Sebastian, p. 98 Sebastian also claims to have had a sexual encounter with Blank's daughter Dorina, who \\"offered herself\\" to him.Sebastian, pp. 23, 27, 268 ===Return and marginalization=== As argued by Opri»õescu, the \\"political dimension\\" of the BMB crash showed that Blank was in a position to blackmail Romania's elite, but also that Carol \\"grew tired of bankers\\". If Blank slowly lost his influence at the court, it was also because he no longer had enough funds left for sponsoring Carol's enrichment schemes.Argetoianu (1997), p. 361 He focused on philanthropic work, and, in 1933, opened up Caritas Hospital with a ceremony attended by Carol. Reportedly, he still had leverage in February 1935, when he obtained the sacking of Finance Minister Victor SlƒÉvescu.Argetoianu (1998), pp. 10‚Äì12, 234, 303; Iulian Oncescu, Andrei Tudorache, \\"Victor SlƒÉvescu ‚Äî ministru de finan»õe (1934‚Äì1935)\\", in Analele UniversitƒÉ»õii din Craiova. Seria Istorie, Vol. XVII, Issue 1, 2012, p. 114 In preparation for this intervention, Blank had published an op ed in Universul of January 28, detailing his own solutions to economic problems. In his diaries, Argetoianu referred to his contribution as \\"intelligent, though occasionally veering into utopia.\\"Argetoianu (1998), p. 10 The two were again on friendly terms, since, as Argetoianu argued, \\"it's better to have him on my side then against me.\\"Argetoianu (1998), p. 11 He heard Blank's \\"interesting plan\\" for developing tourism in Romania.Argetoianu (1998), p. 22 Blank also expressed an interest in funding Haig Acterian's project to pioneer television in Romania, then supported creating an Italo‚ÄìRomanian film company under Cines, but ultimately withdrew from both.Cernat, pp. 45‚Äì47 According to historian Grigore Traian Pop, in 1934 Blank and Victor Iamandi also worked to undermine Carol's protege Auschnitt, by depicting him as a sponsor of the Iron Guard; Pop sees the allegation as false.Pop, p. 43 Argetoianu noted that Blank's political agenda involved keeping a low profile, but also that he was regaining his influence on Lupescu, even as Wieder was losing his.Argetoianu (1998), pp. 22, 42, 120, 197, 200, 269 He reports that Carol's sister, Elisabeth Charlotte, detested Blank and Malaxa, asking her brother to remove them from his entourage; Carol allegedly replied that he had a set of obligations toward Blank.Argetoianu (1998), p. 198 Also according to Argetoianu, Blank's intrigues also resulted in Miti»õƒÉ Constantinescu's appointment as Governor of the National Bank, who then proceeded to persecute investor Oskar Kaufmann, Elisabeth's alleged lover.Argetoianu (1998), pp. 130, 197‚Äì198 Constantinescu and Blank formed a clique which opposed SlƒÉvescu's attempts to regain control of credit institutions, and obtained conditional support from Premier Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu. This conflict reflected splits inside the PNL, between TƒÉtƒÉrescu and Dinu BrƒÉtianu's factions (the latter of which included SlƒÉvescu).Argetoianu (1998), pp. 205‚Äì206, 233‚Äì235, 238 At the time, Argetoianu claimed to have discovered Blank's actual stake in such affairs‚Äînamely, that he hoped Constantinescu would allow the BMB to survive by returning it control over Discom, which had remained profitable.Argetoianu (1998), pp. 234‚Äì235, 269 Argetoianu looked back on 1935 as the worst year in Romanian history, only similar to the period of Ottoman dominion over the Danubian Principalities: \\"It would still appear as the better alternative to be trampled on by the Padishah than by that Yid Aristid Blank or the alms-giver Malaxa.\\"Argetoianu (1998), p. 200 As reported to Argetoianu by Elisabeth's lover, Sandi Scanavi, Blank was deemed \\"public enemy number 1\\" by the conservative establishment, with Malaxa a close second.Argetoianu (2003), pp. 300‚Äì301 In early 1936, Argetoianu claims, Blank was the \\"real master of this Romanian land\\", but had also registered a defeat when SlƒÉvescu returned to the National Bank leadership.Argetoianu (1998), pp. 238, 259 When Kaufmann began a legal battle against journalist Alfred Hefter, Argetoianu argued that the latter was being paid to calumny by Blank.Argetoianu (1998), pp. 301‚Äì303, 327‚Äì328, 337‚Äì338 As he noted: \\"that the bankrupt Blank has enough money on him to get Hefter moving, that is after all his own business, and at most something that would interest the prosecutor's office. The plot thickens and the issue turns messy because Miti»õƒÉ Constantinescu also gets involved into this personal conflict, and that the wheeler-dealer Aristid goes out of his way to also involve the King\\" (emphasis in the original).Argetoianu (1998), p. 301 On the night of May 4‚Äì5, 1936, an Iron Guard youth narrowly missed a chance to assassinate Blank outside Hefter's editorial offices, and, out of frustration, physically assaulted Hefter himself; in the aftermath, Blank spread rumors that the attempt was a false flag operation by Kaufmann's own clique. A month later, he and »òeicaru reacted against their rival Ionescu, who had been identified as an agent of influence for Nazi Germany. They presented Carol with a copy of the incriminating letter, which Carlist Ion S√¢n-Giorgiu allegedly took to Berlin \\"and showed it to a number of ministers there.\\"Sebastian, p. 56 By August, Blank was reportedly attempting to gather support for a \\"strongman government\\" that would quell Guardist agitation, and proposed either Argetoianu or Alexandru Averescu for the premiership.Argetoianu (1998), p. 432 In January 1937, British plenipotentiary Reginald Hoare left comments on Blank's newfound enthusiasm for regaining control of the BMB, as well as on his limited competence. Also according to Argetoianu, Vota had left Aristide, and, in October 1936, was living with Radu Polizu in Monaco. An inveterate gambler, Polizu allegedly relied on her for money.Argetoianu (2003), p. 283 By 1939, the National Bank had taken over the BMB's patrimony.Waldman & Ciuciu, p. 125 Blank also lost his father's home on Dionisie Street, which was bought by Eduard Mirto, and then leased to the American Legation.Argetoianu (2003), p. 67; Waldman & Ciuciu, pp. 135 Following national elections in December 1937, Carol allowed the fascist National Christian Party, a successor of the LANC, to form government; Blank's erstwhile friend, Octavian Goga, took over as Premier. As reported by Sebastian, the passage of antisemitic legislation was played down by Blank, who argued that the \\"continuation of the Goga government\\" was in then Jews' best interest, since \\"what would come after it would be infinitely worse.\\"Sebastian, p. 144 ===Outcast and hostage=== AdevƒÉrul was finally banned on Goga's orders.Ornea, pp. 392, 402 After Carol engineered a self-coup and formed the National Renaissance Front, Blank made attempts to regain his standing in political life. He followed Carol on his final trip to Britain in November 1938, and was registered with the royal retinue at Claridge's of London. This prompted Argetoianu to comment that Carol was still unable to renounce his \\"gang of tricksters\\", comprising Blank, Hefter, and Eugen Titeanu.Argetoianu (2002), p. 204 He reports meeting the \\"all-too-serene\\" Blank visiting the Wallace Collection alongside diplomat Dimitrie N. Ciotori: \\"I never asked him why he was in London: I don't doubt for a moment that he's here to pick up scraps from the table that's being set for King Carol\\".Argetoianu (2002), p. 207 In Romania, the outbreak of World War II saw the generalization of antisemitic laws, followed in 1940 the ascendancy of hardliner Ion Gigurtu. As reported by Sebastian, news of his ascendancy struck his \\"millionaire friends\\" Blank and A. L. Zissu, who were \\"terrified and cracking up\\", but who still pestered him with \\"abstract conversations.\\"Sebastian, p. 293 Such radicalization was followed in September by Carol's ouster, and afterward by the establishment of an Iron Guard-led \\"National Legionary State\\". This new regime blocked all of Blank's Romanian assets in October 1940, and instituted a special commission for re-litigating the BMB affair. This body resumed work after the Iron Guard's ouster in early 1941, and determined that Blank owed the Romanian state 600 million lei. Frequenting the left-wing journalist Tudor Teodorescu-Brani»ôte in April 1941, Blank expressed confidence that Germany would lose in its war with Yugoslavia.Sebastian, pp. 342, 357‚Äì358 Both he and his host resigned themselves by June, when Blank also circulated rumors about Romania's imminent participation in the invasion of Soviet territory. He still owned a paper mill, which was ordered to prepare for distribution in Bessarabia.Sebastian, p. 369 According to Sebastian, Blank argued in late 1941 that the war would only last for two more years, but was then \\"disgusted at the British lack of seriousness in Libya.\\"Sebastian, pp. 369, 446, 456 Blank had by then sent his son to study in the United States. Milenko took American citizenship and returned to Europe with the United States Army.Ion Ioanid, \\"Toate drumurile duc la Jilava\\", in √énchisoarea noastrƒÉ cea de toate zilele.

In 1943, Romania's Ministry of Finance sued Aristide Blank for the recovery of his assets, and obtained a foreclosure of his property on Berthelot Street, outside Ci»ômigiu.\\"Anun»õuri judiciare\\", in Monitorul Oficial, July 20, 1943, p. 4989 According to one report, Blank left Romania in 1941, together with members of the British Legation. However, Sebastian's accounts place him in Bucharest in 1942‚Äì1943, noting that his library was being seized by Romanian authorities on orders from Paul Sterian.Sebastian, pp. 505, 521‚Äì522, 548 In late 1942 or early 1943, Blank was included on a list of Jewish hostages, presented by the Central Jewish Office as a guarantee of its loyalism toward the Ion Antonescu regime; also featured were writers Henric Streitman and Iosif BrucƒÉr.Mihaela Gligor, Note √Æn procesul de epurare a filosofului Iosif BrucƒÉr, pp. 100‚Äì101. Cluj- Napoca: Presa UniversitarƒÉ ClujeanƒÉ, 2018. In early 1943, Sebastian notes, Blank was \\"looking for some refuge in the countryside.\\"Sebastian, p. 558 He finally left Bucharest in April, at the peak of Allied bombing raids, and by June was living in Butimanu.Sebastian, pp. 590, 598 The family's fortunes were restored in August 1944, which saw both the Liberation of Paris and the King Michael's Coup. Patrice emerged from the underground to serve as the youngest member of the Provisional Consultative Assembly. He also served on the original editorial board of France-Soir, before being expelled and sued for mismanagement in 1949. In 1944 Romania, the Jewish community still looked up to Blank Sr, believing him worthy of becoming the country's Minister of Finance.\\"13. S. Al. Bacher cƒÉtre Theodor Lavi.

In January 1945, Blank (whose domicile was on Ferdinand Boulevard) reopened Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ as its majority stockholder. His new associates on this project were Teodorescu- Brani»ôte, Sebastian, Alexandru Rosetti, and painter Jean Alexandru Steriadi.\\"Anun»õuri comerciale\\", in Monitorul Oficial, January 12, 1945, p. 156 From 1946, Blank rejoined the ranks of Romania's Freemasonry, which was reemerging after years of repression; this time around, he became an affiliate of Lan»õul de Unire Lodge, under Horia Hulubei. The select group, which also included Auschnitt, Malaxa, Nicolae CiupercƒÉ, Emil Ghilezan and Mihail Ghelmegeanu, was highly selective, to the point where its activities were kept secret from other Romanian Lodges.Diana Mandache, Masoni sub judecata comunistƒÉ. Grupul Bellu, p. 89. Bucharest: Editura Corint, 2019. Blank also helped Rosetti and Ionel Jianu with printing an art magazine, LuminƒÉ »ôi Culoare. With Galaction, Teodorescu-Brani»ôte, Rosetti, Petre Ghia»õƒÉ, Isaia RƒÉcƒÉciuni, Valentin Saxone, and Ion Vinea, he set up a liberal-democratic club, Ideea.Ion Cristofor, \\"Memoriile lui Valentin Saxone\\", in Tribuna, Issue 58/2005, pp. 5‚Äì6 ===Convict and emigrant=== Blank persisted in attempting to have the BMB assets returned to him, initially by cultivating National Peasantists such as Hudi»õƒÉ, but later focusing his efforts on the more powerful Romanian Communist Party. As part of this approach, he joined the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union and presided over its Financial Section. Initially, Blank obtained support from a Communist Party leader, Ana Pauker, who was an in-law of his AdevƒÉrul colleagues. In October 1945, she allowed him to access BMB funds, with Blank promising that he was going to fully repay his creditors. However, Blank also protected his family from the communist threat, sending Vota to live with Milenko in the United States; he visited them there in 1946, but opted to return to Romania in January 1947. One of his final activities at Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ was putting out the first edition of Pavel Chihaia's novel, Blocada, which was immediately removed from bookshops by communist censors. Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Destinul unui rezistent: Pavel Chihaia\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Issue 41/2001 The publishing house was shut down that same year. Blank himself was eventually singled out for retribution after having maintained contacts with British and American diplomats. He witnessed the proclamation of a communist republic in 1948, by which time he had lost touch with his Western backers. That year, the BMB was nationalized (though it continued to exist as a separate entity, under state management, to 1951); the company's former offices, a granite building on Doamnei Street, were taken by Romania's new secret police, the Securitate.Waldman & Ciuciu, pp. 120, 135 Blank himself was arrested as a spy on April 18, 1952, and put on trial for high treason with his meeting with foreigners and some of his papers used as evidence, then sentenced to a 20-year imprisonment in May 1953. At the time, his rival Manoilescu had also been identified as an enemy of the communist regime, and was sent to the labor colony of Ocnele Mari. Here, he met Pandrea, who recalls: \\"I made him recount the Blank bankruptcy, as a way of entertaining xenophobic inmates\\".Pandrea, p. 144 Memoirist Ion Ioanid, who was held with Blank in Jilava prison for a while in 1954, recalls that the financier was well groomed, and still wearing a two- piece suit. According to Ioanid, Blank missed his son Milenko, whom he believed he would never see again, but resented him for choosing a career in the army: \\"I feel like a hen that's been hatching a duck's egg!\\" Children from his other marriages had stayed behind in Romania. Reportedly, one of his daughters, Tina StƒÉnescu, had married a mayor of BuzƒÉu, and was still living at Sinaia in the late 1940s, shunning all relations with less assimilated Jews.Emil Simiu, \\"Anii de ucenicie\\", in Apostrof, Vol. XXII, Issue 11, 2011, p. 18 Novelist Matei CƒÉlinescu remembers that one of Blank's former wives was living at a part-nationalized villa in Floreasca in 1954, alongside her daughter, Helen Blank-Bogdan, and two granddaughters, Mab and Manola. Helen's husband, the lawyer Horia Bogdan, was also serving a jail term.Matei CƒÉlinescu, Ion Vianu, Amintiri √Æn dialog. Memorii, p. 221. Ia»ôi: Polirom, 2005. Blank's defense team was able to show that his conversations with foreigners were not covered by the Penal Code, and that papers found in his home and used against him in his trial were actually the early drafts of a novel. In April 1955, his conviction for treason was overturned, and commuted into a three-year sentence for mishandling national secrets; he had by then served the equivalent in Jilava and Pite»ôti, and was consequently set free. Blank's health was compromised, and, having been made an Officer of the Legion of Honor before 1925,\\"Fian√ßailles\\", in Le Temps, February 25, 1925, p. 4 he relied on medical support from the French Embassy. His visits brought him attention by Securitate operatives, and he was placed under surveillance. Throughout the late 1950s, Blank made several requests for an emigration visa to France, supported in this by the French government and Zionist groups responding to Vota's appeals; in 1956, a delegation of the French National Assembly visited him in Bucharest. Blank was also assisted by his other son Patrice, who returned to publishing after making and losing a fortune in the trade of precious metals.Drancourt, p. 74 All of his father's applications for emigration were denied by the Romanian side until March 1958, when he was finally allowed to leave for Paris. Aristide Blank died there on January 1, 1960, his official birthday. Patrice reportedly married a Rothschild and lived a life of luxury, and continued to be active in political life. Like his friend Bertrand de Jouvenel, he spoke out against the French economic mainstream, advocating right-libertarianism; this agenda was promoted by his own magazine, Liaisons Sociales, as well as by Commentaire journal and Saint- Simon Foundation, both of which he financed.Drancourt, passim His parallel advocacy for the United States of Europe brought him into conflict with Charles de Gaulle, but also ensured support from Joseph Rovan.Drancourt, pp. 73‚Äì74 As noted by lawyer Jacques Sinard, Patrice was also a promoter of common-law marriage from a Europeanist and liberal perspective.\\"D√©clarations des candidats\\", in Le Bulletin du Barreau de Paris, November 2003, p. 23 Patrice Blank was still active in publishing into the 1990s, as owner of the Liaisons group; he sold it to Wolters Kluwer in 1996.Drancourt, p. 76 He died in Paris, aged 73, on October 14, 1998, having just inaugurated a new libertarian magazine, Soci√©tal. He enjoys a posthumous fame as a central figure in conspiracy theories about the death of Robert Boulin in October 1979. According to these, Boulin was killed by his colleagues in the Rally for the Republic, because he had compromising information regarding party finances; Blank Jr is depicted as having absconded with Boulin's personal files just after his death was announced.

He became an archbishop in 1970 and served as an Apostolic Nuncio from then until his death. ==Biography == Mario Tagliaferri was born in Alatri (Frosinone), Italy, on 1 June 1927. He was ordained a priest on 5 August 1950. To prepare for a diplomatic career he entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1952. He joined the diplomatic service in 1954 and his early assignments took him to the Dominican Republic, the United States, Canada and Brazil. On 5 March 1970, Pope Paul VI named him a titular archbishop and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Central African Republic, as well as Apostolic Delegate to the Republic of the Congo and Chad. He received his episcopal consecration on 7 May from Cardinal Jean-Marie Villot. On 25 June 1975, Pope Paul appointed him Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Cuba. On 15 December 1978, Pope John Paul II named him Nuncio to Peru. On 20 July 1985, Pope John Paul named him Nuncio to Spain. After Tagliaferri had been nuncio there for three years, Cardinal Vicente Enrique y Taranc√≥n, Archbishop of Madrid, complained that he still acted like a typical nuncio in South American, where nuncios are accustomed to giving orders, a style unfamiliar to the Spanish Church, which he helped give a more conservative character. On 13 July 1995, Pope John Paul named him Nuncio to France. El Pa√≠s expressed surprise that he was sent to France rather than brought to Rome and made a cardinal now that he was 68. He took up that post on 16 October 1995 and established a routine‚Äìunusual for a nuncio‚Äìof regular visits to dioceses around the country. An official with the Conference of French Bishops recalled: \\"The more he was invited, the happier he was.\\" He died on 21 May 1999, shortly before his 72nd birthday. ==References == ==External links == *Catholic Hierarchy: Archbishop Mario Tagliaferri Category:1927 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Apostolic Nuncios to the Central African Republic Category:Apostolic Nuncios to the Republic of the Congo Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Chad Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Cuba Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Peru Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Spain Category:Apostolic Nuncios to France Category:Roman Catholic titular archbishops ","title":"Mario Tagliaferri"},{"id":"61716887","text":"The 2019 Czech Athletics Championships () was the 26th edition of the national outdoor track and field championships for the Czech Republic.

She is also the current President of the International Brain Research Organization. == Early life and education == Tracy Bale received her B.S. from Washington State University in molecular biology and genetics in 1992. After taking a gap year, she then began her doctoral studies in Neurobiology at the University of Washington, studying under Daniel Dorsa. She received her Ph.D. in 1997. She then became a postdoctoral fellow at the Salk Institute, researching neuroendocrinology under the supervision of Wylie Vale. == Career and research == Bale joined the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania in 2003. While at the University of Pennsylvania, she became co-director of the Penn Center for the Study of Sex and Gender in Behavioral Health and the Director of Research for the BIRCWH Faculty Scholars and of the Neuroscience Center at the School of Veterinary Medicine. In 2017, she moved her lab to the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Bale's research focuses on parental prenatal stress and how it can affect offspring in a myriad of ways, mostly in terms of brain development and behavior. She has examined these questions for the perspective of both mothers and fathers. When mothers experience stress during the first stage of development, their offspring tend to be more sensitive to stress themselves. In fathers, these changes result from epigenetics, where microRNAs can change the epigenetic marks of sperm coming from stressed fathers. == Awards and honors == * National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award (1997) * American Neuroendocrine Society Fellowship (2001) * Frank Beach Award, Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology (2003) * McCabe Fellow Award (2003) * Ziskind-Somerfeld Award, Society for Biological Psychiatry (2008) * Career Development Award, Society for Neuroscience (2008) * Richard E.

Her work primarily focuses on DNA interstrand crosslink repair and the diseases resulting from deficiencies in this repair pathway, including Fanconi anemia and karyomegalic interstitial nephritis. == Early life and education == After finishing high school in Poland, Smogorzewska completed her bachelor of science in molecular biology and biochemistry in 1995 at the University of Southern California. She then went on to enroll in the tri-institutional M.D., Ph.D. program of Weill Cornell, Rockefeller and Sloan Kettering, finishing her Ph.D. thesis studies on the functions of the telomeric protein, TRF2, in the lab of Dr. Titia de Lange at Rockefeller University in 2002, and her medical degree from Weill Cornell in 2003. Smogorzewska then went on to a residency in clinical pathology at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 2003‚Äì2006, becoming a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard Medical School between 2005‚Äì2009 under Dr. Stephen Elledge where she discovered the Fanconi anemia protein FANCI. == Career and research == Smogorzewska became an assistant professor at Rockefeller University in 2009 and was subsequently elevated to associate professor in 2015. Her lab focuses on DNA repair mechanisms, particularly the interstrand crosslink repair pathway, which concerns the cellular mechanisms by which the two strands of DNA that have been covalently linked are excised, creating a double strand DNA break that is subsequently processed by factors in the Fanconi anemia and homologous recombination pathways. In particular, Smogorzewska is interested in identifying new genes that are involved in this repair process in order to reveal the mechanisms at play in human diseases that result from deficiencies in interstrand crosslink repair, including Fanconi anemia and karyomegalic interstitial nephritis. To this end, Smogorzewska has successfully identified SLX4, RAD51 and UBE2T as interstrand crosslink repair factors, as well as developed a mouse model of karyomegalic interstitial nephritis. Recently, Smogorzewska has begun studies revolving around how replication stress is addressed by cells to promote genome stability.

For 21 years, Mary Papanikolaou volunteered to have her cervix sampled and smeared by her husband to help with his efforts to create the pap test, which has been shown to reduce cervical cancer deaths by up to 80 percent. == Early life == Born Andromachi Mavrogeni, Papanikolaou was the descendant of the Phanariote , which made history fighting against the Ottomans in the Greek War of Independence. She received a good education, could speak French and play piano. She met her husband Georgios on a ferry boat journey to Athens, and he fell in love with her charming personality. Papanikolaou eloped with her husband shortly after he obtained his PhD in zoology at the University of Munich in 1910. After returning to Greece following the death of Georgios' mother, the couple emigrated to New York City on October 9, 1913. Neither Papanikolaou or her husband spoke English, and they had between them only $250, the amount then required to enter the U.S. Papanikolaou took a job at Gimbel's Department Store as a seamstress, sewing buttons for $5 per week. Her husband took a series of odd jobs before obtaining a position at New York University's Pathology Department and Cornell University Medical College's Anatomy Department, where Papanikolaou joined him as an unpaid technician. == Contribution to research == Throughout her husband's career, Papanikolaou managed both his laboratory affairs and the couple's household affairs. At Cornell, Georgios was observing the ovulatory cycle of guinea pigs, but because he was not a clinician, he lacked access to patients. For 21 years, Mary Papanikolaou volunteered as an experimental subject for her husband, climbing up on to his examination couch every day so that he could sample and smear her cervix. She was quoted as saying: \\"There was no other option but for me to follow him inside the lab, making his way of life mine\\" and also decided not to have children so she could continue collaborating with her husband. Partly through his wife's volunteer efforts, Georgios was able to determine that the monthly changes to guinea pig vaginal discharge that he observed in the lab could also be seen in humans. To provide additional subjects for her husband's research, Mary Papanikolaou also held a party for some female friends, who agreed to have their own cervixes sampled. After one of these women was later diagnosed with cervical cancer, Georgios took her sample back to the lab and, with the help of another cytologist, determined that cancerous cells were indeed visible on the sample. In Georgios' own words: ‚ÄúThe first observation of cancer cells in the smear of the uterine cervix gave me one of the greatest thrills I ever experienced during my scientific career.‚Äù The Pap test is still widely used as a means of early cancer detection, and is estimated to have reduced fatalities caused by cancer of the reproductive systems in women by half. By some accounts, the pap test is considered the most significant advance in the control of cancer in the 20th century. == Death == Mary Papanikolaou continued her husband's work at the Papanicolaou Cancer Research Institute after his death on February 19, 1962. She died in Miami in October, 1982. == Notes == == References == Category:Year of birth missing Category:Place of birth missing Category:19th-century births Category:1982 deaths Category:Greek medical researchers Category:Greek women scientists Category:Women medical researchers Category:Cornell University staff Category:Miami University people Category:Greek emigrants to the United States Category:20th-century Greek scientists Category:20th-century Greek women ","title":"Andromachi Papanikolaou"},{"id":"61717019","text":"Mary M.

Though some historic Buddhist societies have been categorized as a feudalistic, it can be argued that the relationship between peasants and land owners was often voluntary. Free thinking Buddhist societies supported autonomy. Peasants had mobility and could own land themselves.http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman- ch3-4.pdf ==Modern views== 14th Dalai Lama believes that both Buddhism and Democracy share a common viewpoint saying \\"not only are Buddhism and democracy compatible, they are rooted in a common understanding of the equality and potential of every individual.\\" He believes that the ancient Sangha functioned democratically. Mipham Chokyi Lodro, the 14th Shamar Rinpoche, wrote a book, \\"Creating a Transparent Democracy\\" in 2006. Shamarpa proposes a transparent democracy where each citizen has self reliance and empowerment through a decentralized government system. Rather than a top-down control system, in which power flows down from national, to state to city, the system builds from village level up. Local units on the village level, combine to form the higher levels of government as well.Shamar Rinpoche. \\"Creating a Transparent Democracy: A New Model.\\"Bird of Paradise Press (2006) pp. 1‚Äì8 The system relies on the banning of all propaganda, the dissolving of political partiesShamar Rinpoche. \\"Creating a Transparent Democracy: A New Model.\\"Bird of Paradise Press (2006) pp. 13 and an education system that teaches competence in governance to all citizens. Transparency and self-reliance are indeed Buddhist values, but also universal... Where Shamarpa's proposal becomes distinctly Buddhist is his definition of the function of law. Protections are provided to the (1) Earth, natural environment, (2) human beings, and (3) animals. The Earth itself serves as the model for an ideal government, and it is the international community's responsibility to protect the natural environment.Shamar Rinpoche. \\"Creating a Transparent Democracy: A New Model.\\"Bird of Paradise Press (2006) pp. 11‚Äì12 David Kaczynski believes that Buddhism and Democracy need each other saying: ==History== ===Early Buddhism=== The spread of Buddhism led to the spread of Democratic values throughout Asia. Kurt Kankan Spellmeyer stated Buddhism and Democracy have gone hand-in-hand since the beginning. Egon Flaig concurs claiming that early Buddhist practices were an outgrowth from republican city-states of ancient India. He describes them as \\"often governed by a council of nobles (sabha) made up of male aristocrats, ruling either on its own or with the help of an assembly (samiti).\\" Ajahn Brahm claims \\"the longest sustaining democracy in the world in the Buddhist sangha.\\" ===MahƒÅsammata=== The Agga√±√±a Sutta of the Pali Canon introduces a figure named \\"MahƒÅsammata\\" (Pali; lit. \\"the Great Elect\\") as the first monarch. The scripture elaborates on the formation of civilization that occurred with the adoption of ownership. As theft became a major societal concern, it was decided that an ruler should be elected to ensure the punishment of evil and preservation of righteousness. MahƒÅsammata is also said to have been responsible for the establishment of caste and law. ===Later Buddhism=== German historian Markus R√ºttermann has found in the 12th through the 14th centuries \\"several Japanese monasteries were making decisions by majority vote.\\" B. R. Ambedkar believed Buddhism to be a Democratic religion which led to his conversion and founding of the Navayana school of Buddhism. ===Tibetan Buddhism=== There are many fine examples of Buddhist values integrating with government process to produce transparent democratic states. However, when religious leaders serve as government administrators, without forfeiting their religious authority, the result can be unchecked power. After the 16th century in Tibet, Buddhist leaders were inseparable from government administrators. The concept of samayas, vows to the guru, became a tool for suppressing people's rights and manipulating political authority.Shamar Rinpoche. \\"Creating a Transparent Democracy: A New Model.\\"Bird of Paradise Press (2006) pp. 17-18 Shamar Rinpoche of the Karma Kagyu Lineage saw religion and politics as working against each other in Tibet. Lamas as ruling class gave the country enduring structure and order, but many people put unquestioning faith in their spiritual leaders, with very little room for critical judgement of political decisions. These concerns were put forward by Shamarpa at a meeting in Varanasi India in 1998, called by the Dalai Lama. The meeting was attended by heads of Tibetan schools as an effort to better the future of Tibetans.Yeshe Dronma, \\"The Reincarnations of the Kunzig Shamarpa the Red Crown Lama of Tibet\\".

On the evening of 26 November, Prezan presented his plan, part of which envisioned the 1st Army forming a giant screen from east of Curtea de Arge»ô and along the southwest to the Olt River. The 1st Army, however, was in poor shape. As of 26 November, after months of heavy and costly fighting against the Germans and Austro- Hungarians, its forces had dwindled to 34,649 infantry soldiers in nine divisions, which in strength were actually the equivalent of little more than 3 divisions.Michael B.

The closeness of the pursuit gave the Romanians no respite, and exhausted men started surrendering in growing numbers. On that day Morgen's forces took 3,000 prisoners. In the evening of 30 November, after having occupied Pite»ôti on the morning of the 29th, Gruppe Krafft's Alpine Corps were given a period of rest in the forest near Davide»ôti, in the midst of several unsuspecting Romanian regiments.

The division's bicycle company shot an attacking Romanian cavalry regiment to pieces. At 2:30 pm on 3 December, the Bavarians took T√¢rgovi»ôte by storm.

The Romanians attacked on 1 December, pushing the 217th Division from MihƒÉile»ôti southwest towards St√¢lpu. However, the Central Powers counterattacked on 3 December, pushing the Romanians back and retaking MihƒÉile»ôti by 4 pm on that day.

However, the MCG (Marele Cartier General/Romanian General Staff) rightly argued that this would only serve to completely destroy the remaining Romanian forces.

Born as Frederick, Lord of ≈Ωovnek (Sanneck) and baron of Savinja (Soune) in the Holy Roman Empire, he inherited vast estates in Carinthia, Carniola and Styria upon the extinction of the Counts of Heunburg. These included the Celje Castle, located at a strategic position in the center of the Savinja Valley, guarding a main transit route connecting Lower Styria with Carniola, as well as guarding the border with Hungary. The castle was fairly close to the ancestral seat of the Lords of Sanneck, and was thus made into their new residence. In 1341, Frederick was granted the title of Count of Celje (Cilli, in German) by Emperor Louis IV. The coat of arms of the House of Heunburg, three yellow stars on a blue background, were incorporated in the coat of arms of the Counts of Celje, and are now part of the Coat of Arms of Slovenia. ==Life and achievements== Louis IV. of Bavaria in 1341, raising Frederick of Sanneck to the rank of Count of Celje (Cilli). Frederick was the son of Ulrich of Sanneck, Lord of ≈Ωovnek. His father was a free noble in the March on the Savinja, a region fragmented among various small estates, which was contested between the House of Gorizia-Tyrol and the Habsburgs.Milko Kos, Srednjeve≈°ka zgodovina Slovencev (Ljubljana: 1985), pp. 260-61 Frederick's father took the side of the Habsburg dukes of Styria, becoming their vassal. His allegiance was instrumental in the incorporation of the Savinja Valley into the Duchy of Styria and thus into the Habsburg domains.Kos, Srednjeve≈°ka zgodovina Slovencev, p. 261 Frederick's mother was Catharine, the firstborn daughter of Ulrich II Count of Heunburg and of Agnes of Baden. Ulrich of Heunberg owned important estates in Carinthia, Carniola and Styria, while Agnes was the titular heiress of the House of Babenberg through her mother Gertrude of Austria. Both of Frederick's parents died around 1315, and he became the head of the house. In 1322, the male line of the Counts of Heunburg became extinct, and Frederick inherited the estates from his maternal uncle Hermann. However, he had to contend the inheritance with his cousin Ulrich V. of Pfannberg, son of Count Hermann's younger sister Margaret. He also had to deal with the dowager countess Elizabeth, daughter of the powerful Albert II of Gorizia, who claimed part of her late husband's estates. After a protracted legal and military struggle, Frederick prevailed with the help of his brother-in-law Ulrich von Walsee, captain (governor) of Styria, who enjoyed the support of the reigning duke Otto the Merry. By 1333, Frederick was in possession of almost all of the Heunburg estates. Frederick followed his father's policy of allegiance to the Habsburgs. In the early 1330s, he was named captain (governor) of Carniola and the Windic March, preparing the ground for a smooth transition of power from duke Henry of Bohemia, the last male member of the Gorizia-Tyrol dynasty, to the Habsburgs.Kos, Srednjeve≈°ka zgodovina Slovencev, p. 261 When the Habsburgs did take over Carniola in 1335, Frederick was confirmed in his position. As a reward for his loyalty, the Habsburgs gave their consent for Frederick's elevation to the status of count. In April 1341, he was granted the title of Count of Celje by the Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV in a ceremony in Munich. Shortly before his death, he took part of a diplomatic mission on behalf of Albert II, Duke of Austria and the Hungarian king Louis the Great to the papal court in Avignon. ==Policy of expansion == Slovenian historian Milko Kos called Frederick \\"the first architect of the Celje glory\\", claiming that \\"he possessed all those abilities in statesmanship that would characterize his greatest successors\\".Kos, Srednjeve≈°ka zgodovina Slovencev, p. 261 By the time of his death, he was one of the most powerful feudal lords in the territory of present-day Slovenia, rivaled only by his Habsburg liege lords, the Albertine line of the Counts of Gorizia and the Counts of Ortenburg. Frederick pursued a strategy of alliance with the latter: his first born son Ulrich would marry Adelaide, daughter of Count Albert I of Ortenburg, while her brother and Albert's successor Otto VI married Frederick's daughter anna. The arrangement would prove very beneficious to the Counts of Celje, as they would inherit all Ortenburg possessions in Carinthia and Carniola after the death of Frederick's grandson and namesake Frederick III of Ortenburg in 1418.France Dolinar et. al, Slovenski zgodovinski atlas (Ljubljana, 2011), 89-90. Frederick's fiefs and allods covered almost the entire territory of the former March on the Savinja (now firmly part of the Duchy of Styria), safe for scattered ecclesiastical lands. In addition to that, he acquired vast areas in the wealthy Krka Valley and the Heunburg original territories around Heunburg (Vovbre, in Slovene) in southeastern Carinthia. He was succeeded by his sons Ulrich and Hermann I. ==Marriage and children== Frederick married Diemut of Wallsee.

It is endemic to central-western and northern Brazil. Prior to its description by Carvalho and Giaretta in 2013, it was confused with Adenomera martinezi. The specific name saci is Portuguese word for a kind of whistling imp in Brazilian (Tupi) folklore, in allusion to the whistling call of this frog. ==Description== Adult males measure and adult females, based on just one specimen, in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is pointed in dorsal view and acuminate in lateral view; in males, the snout tip has a weakly to well- developed fleshy ridge. The tympanum and supratympanic fold are present. The finger tips are rounded but not expanded, without webbing or fringing. The toe tips are unexpanded and unflattened; no webbing is present. Dorsal coloration consists of 4‚Äì6 symmetrically arranged rows of longitudinal dark-colored spots on dark gray to very dark brown background. Cream-colored vertebral stripe is present. The throat and belly are cream colored, sometimes finely covered with white spots. Males have an internal, subgular vocal sac. The male advertisement call is a long (72‚Äì241 ms) whistle. This call is different from that of the morphologically very similar Adenomera martinezi even to the human ear. The tadpoles are dorsoventrally compressed. Gosner stage 37 tadpole measures in total length; the body measures . ==Habitat and conservation== Adenomera saci occurs in montane rock fields with sandy/muddy soil at elevations above , and in lowland grassy fields with sandy/muddy soil, almost always associated with palm grove marshes (veredas), at about above sea level. Males call within underground chambers or from exposed calling sites, typically among grassy tufts.

EVE was founded in 2010 by the psychologist and former college professor Lynette Long, with the mission \\"to achieve gender parity in the monuments, symbols, and icons, of the United States.\\" Its ongoing projects include adding more statues of women to the National Statuary Hall Collection, creating new historical markers honoring America's heroes, adding images of women to America's paper currency and coins, increasing the number of women honored on stamps and Google Doodles, and increasing the number of female character balloons in parades. ==Women in U.S. Monuments== Equal Visibility Everywhere's U.S. Monuments & Memorials project covers statues, plaques, and historical markers ‚Äî the overwhelming majority of which are dedicated to men. Only 8% of statues in the U.S. recognize women. Out of 5,193 public outdoor sculptures of individuals in the United States, only 394 are of women. Additionally, no national memorial in Washington DC is of a woman‚Äîall 44 honor men. In July 1884, the first U.S. statue of a woman, Margaret Haughery, was erected in New Orleans. The statue of Margaret depicts her seated in her office but with a child nearby suggesting the looming role as mother. ===Put a Woman in National Statuary Hall=== National Statuary Hall The National Statuary Hall Collection is one of America's most prominent memorials to outstanding citizens. Located in the U.S. Capitol Building, the collection features 100 statues of distinguished Americans, two from each state. In Statuary Hall, the original House Chamber, there is only one statue of a woman out of 38 statues displayed. There are nine statues of women and ninety-one statues of men in the entire Collection which is displayed throughout the Capitol. Equal Visibility Everywhere's ‚ÄúPut a Woman in Statuary Hall‚Äù project is dedicated to correcting this gender representation imbalance. Currently, Equal Visibility Everywhere is leading efforts in multiple states to replace statues of men with statues of women in the National Statuary Hall Collection. Bills authorizing statues of Amelia Earhart (Kansas), Mary McLeod Bethune (Florida), Willa Cather (Nebraska), Martha Hughes Cannon (Utah) and Daisy Bates (Arkansas) have been signed into law. ===Kansas's Amelia Earhart Statue=== In 2010, EVE's founder, Dr. Lynette Long was visiting the United States Capitol with her son Seth and noticed the disparity in the number of statues depicting men and women. She noted to the Washington Post that there were nine statues of women and ninety-one statues of men. This observation led her to form Equal Visibility Everywhere (EVE) and make one of EVE's core missions increasing the number of women represented in the National Statuary Hall Collection. Dr. Long researched the most famous women in American History, with the prospect of adding them to The Collection. While doing her research she discovered a 1999 Kansas State House Resolution which authorized that the statue of John James Ingalls be replaced with a statue of Amelia Earhart. Clay statue of Amelia Earhart to be cast in bronze for the National Statuary Hall Collection. In 1999, the Kansas state legislature voted on a resolution to replace their state's statues of 19th- century statesmen George Washington Glick and John James Ingalls in response to a Congressional Bill which would allow states to replace either or both of their two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection. One of Kansas's replacements was to be of aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart and the other Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower's statue was commissioned and placed in National Statuary Hall Collection in 2003, but the legislation authorizing Amelia Earhart's statue was never signed by the Governor of Kansas nor by the Architect of the Capitol. Kansas's resolution named the Atchison Chamber of Commerce in charge of raising the money for the Earhart statue but the project failed to make progress and the plans were shelved. Amelia Earhart's preliminary clay statue for the National Statuary Hall Collection. EVE took interest in the shelved 1999 Kansas Resolution and after acquiring appropriate authorization from the Governor and Chamber of Commerce, EVE formed the Amerlia Earhart Statue Selection Committee which included the Governor of Kansas, Head of the Amelia Earhart Festival, Head of the Atchison Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Earhart Family, three prominent museum curators, and Dr. Long. Thirty-two proposals were received in response to a nationally distributed Request for Proposals. The sculptors participated in a three rounds of competition with the finalists traveling to Kansas with their maquettes to make their presentations directly to the selection committee. Two of America's most prominent sculptors George and Mark Lundeen from Loveland, Colorado were chosen to sculpt Amelia for the U.S. Capitol. The Committee and the Earhart family agreed that their maquette portrayed a breathtaking image of Amelia Earhart. The clay statue is completed and has been cast in bronze. ‚ÄúAmelia‚Äù has been approved by the U.S. Capitol. Kansas's agreement with the Capitol includes mandatory payment for the statue, its move from Colorado where it was cast to the U.S. Capitol, holding an unveiling ceremony and reception in Washington, DC and transporting the Ingalls Statue back to Kansas to an agreed upon appropriate and honorable resting place. ===Maryland's Harriet Tubman Statue=== Equal Visibility Everywhere proposed three women to the Maryland State Legislator in 2011 to replace one of their statues with representation of a woman. The three proposed by EVE were: Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross, Rachel Carson, author of Silent Spring and founder of the environmental movement and abolitionist Harriet Tubman. EVE enlisted the help of Maryland NOW (the National Organization for Women) which agreed to help lobby for Harriet Tubman as the replacement statue for John Hanson. In 2011, Maryland Senate Bill 351 and Assembly Bill 455 proposed to replace the statue of John Hanson, who served as \\"President of the United States in Congress Assembled\\" under the Articles of Confederation, with a statue of Harriet Tubman. Opposition to the statue of Harriet Tubman was led by Maryland's former Senate President, Thomas V. ‚ÄúMike‚Äù Miller, Jr., a 68-year-old Democrat who has been a member of the Maryland Senate since 1975. He was joined by two other long-standing Democrats, Senator Thomas ‚ÄúMac‚Äù Middleton (a member of the Senate since 1995 and descendant of John Hanson) and Senator Roy Dyson (also a member of the Senate since 1995). Senator Miller went on to propose that, ‚Äúa special category should be established in Statuary Hall for women and blacks who were not considered when states first were invited to contribute statues in 1864.‚Äù Linda Mahoney, former president of Maryland NOW ‚Äì one of the key sponsors of the bill spoke about the roadblock to reporters, ‚ÄúHarriet Tubman is facing an uphill battle. John Hanson appears to have many descendants, some of them currently serving in the state legislature.\\" The bill which proposed to make Harriet Tubman the third statue representing the state of Maryland was signed into law by Maryland Governor Martin O‚ÄôMalley who then appointed a Committee in 2012 to oversee the project. Maryland's statue of Harriet Tubman would have been the first statue of an African American to be added into The Collection. The first sculpture to honor a black woman in the Capitol was a bust of Sojourner Truth. The Architect of the Capitol was clear that each state can have two and only two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection, consequently the statue of Harriet Tubman was never created. ===Florida's Mary McLeod Bethune Statue=== Nilda Comas, a Florida artist, works on a clay version of the Mary McLeod Bethune statue to be installed in Statuary Hall in Washington. In the National Statuary Hall Collection the state of Florida is represented by statues of John Gorrie, a physician, scientist, inventor, and humanitarian and General Edmund Kirby Smith, a Confederate General. In 2016, Florida resident Dr. Lynette Long, founder of Equal Visibility Everywhere, traveled to Tallahassee to promote the placement of a statue honoring a woman in National Statuary Hall. She addressed the Florida State Legislature's Women's Caucus, lobbied individual members of the state legislature, and testified on behalf of FLHB 141, urging the body to add a woman to the National Statuary Collection. The Florida Legislature passed the bill which would remove the statue of General Edmund Kirby Smith from the National Statuary Hall Collection and create a commission to propose names of three statue candidates to the Florida legislature. The recommendations were environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Publix founder George Washington Douglas, and educator Mary McLeod Bethune. The following legislative session, a bill proposing Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune to represent the state of Florida was passed then signed by former Governor Rick Scott making Mary McLeod Bethune the first African American to be honored with a statue in the National Statuary Hall Collection. Protest in Tavares Florida over the Lake County Board of County Commissioners' 3 - 2 vote to add Confederate monument to local museum.General Edmund Kirby Smith Statue Removal Backlash Following passage of the 2018 bill to replace the statue of General Edmund Kirby Smith with Mary McLeod Bethune, a state panel considered proposals of where to display the Smith statue when it was removed from the US Capitol. The panel agreed to relocate the statue to Lake County Historical Museum located in Tavares, Florida based on a proposal by its curator, Bob Grenier. In 2019, the Lake County Board of County Commissioners voted 3 - 2, approving the Smith statue installation at the Lake County Historical Museum. Despite the vote of approval, roughly 400 protestors gathered in opposition to the placement of the monument of Confederate General Smith in Lake County. Eight Lake County Mayors signed a letter to Gov. Ron DeSantis asking for action to prevent the installment of the Smith statue in the Tavares museum. Florida Governor DeSantis did not respond. Eustis Commissioner Robert Morin, an opponent of the county vote, said, \\" Lake County Board of County Commissioners' Chairwoman, a supporter of the move said, \\"The thought of bringing a Confederate statue to Lake County really bothers a lot of our African American population and also a lot of creative thinkers like myself‚Äú It is important to preserve statues and monuments which tell the story of where we‚Äôve come from and where we are today, even if those artifacts invoke strong emotions.‚Äù ===California's Sally Ride Statue=== The state of California is currently represented by statues of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Catholic Saint, Father Junipero Serra. The Serra statue has remained in National Statuary Hall since 1931. The statue of Ronald Reagan is a \\"replacement statue\\" and was gifted to the Capitol in 2007. In 2015, California State Senator Ricardo Lara's bill to replace the statue of Father Serra with a statue of Sally Ride was introduced in California's Senate Government Organization Committee and passed 10-0. The bill then went to the California Senate where it narrowly passed. The bill was never heard in the Assembly due to opposition from the Catholic caucus. Pope Francis was scheduled to canonize Rev. Junipero Serra and bless the Serra statue in National Statuary Hall. If Sally Ride were to be added to The Collection, she would be the first statue of a known LGBT person. Ride, who earned a Doctorate in Physics from Stanford University is most remembered for her contributions to science and being the first U.S. woman astronaut in space. Father Junipero Serra Controversy Many Native American leaders see Father Junipero Serra as guilty of slavery and violent evangelicalism during his mission work in 18th-century America. Under the direction of Father Junipero Serra, Spanish soldiers forced the native peoples living in the areas to build the Spanish missions. Jean Fran√ßois de Galaup, a French explorer made critical observations on the Spanish missions around the treatment of California native peoples.Leal, Juan Felipe and Rountree, Mario Huacuja (2011), Economic y sistema de haciendas en Mexico, Juan Pablos, Editor, D. R. Voyeur, pp. 22-23 It is estimated that California's Native American population was roughly 310,000 at the beginning of Spanish mission work. By the end of the 19th century, California's indigenous peoples had been reduced to approximately 100,000. ===Historic Markers=== Florida's Department of State recognizes significant places, persons, and events in Florida via the Historical Markers Program. In 2017 only six of the 950 state markers are of women: Annie Tommie, a Seminole Leader with a camp on the new river in Fort Lauderdale in the 1800s; Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of ‚ÄúUncle Tom's Cabin‚Äù who wintered in Mandarin, Florida; Milly Francis, labeled the Creek Pocahontas for saving the life of a Georgia Militiaman; Princess Marie Antoinette Murat, the great grandniece of George Washington and married to the nephew of Napoleon; women's rights activist Roxcy Bolton, and Zora Neale Hurston, author of ‚ÄúTheir Eyes Were Watching God.‚Äù Dr. Lynette Long, Founder of Equal Visibility Everywhere, speaking before the unveiling of the Dr. Galt Simmons historic marker in Miami Beach, FL Equal Visibility Everywhere, the Miami-Dade County Commission for Women and the Kampong of the National Tropical Botanical Garden obtained permission and produced the historical marker honoring Dr. Eleanor Galt Simmons, Miami's first female physician. Dr. Long has been successful in getting the State of Florida to approve markers for Aviatrix Amelia Earhart, Seminole Chief Betty Mae Tiger Jumper, Historic Preservationist Barbara Baer Capitman, and Pulitzer Prize Winner Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. She cooperated with other groups to help erect markers of other noted Floridians including Impresaria Judy Drucker and Preservationist Marjory Stoneman Douglas.Barbara Baer Capitman Memorial in Lummus Park, Miami Beach, FL. Before 2007, only three of the 650 Official Scenic Markers in New Mexico mentioned women. In response, the New Mexico State Legislature passed the Historic Women Marker Initiative of 2007. Ten markers honoring women have been added to the state's collection since 2010 and an additional 25 are expected to bring the total of historic markers to 100. ==Stamp Out Stamp Bias== Equal Visibility Everywhere's stamps project, 'Stamp Out Stamp Bias, is dedicated to eliminating gender disparity in United States postage stamps. Men depicted on stamps outnumber women by four to one. From 2000 to 2009 the U.S. Postal Service honored 206 individuals on commemorative stamps; only 43 were women. As of February 2019, there are 138 stamps honoring women and 660 stamps honoring men. ==References== Category:Non-profit organizations based in the United States ","title":"Equal Visibility Everywhere"},{"id":"61717353","text":"Valdegutur is a village in the municipality of Cervera del R√≠o Alhama, in the province and autonomous community of La Rioja, Spain.

She founded the Lisburn Suffrage Society, which she left to become a militant activist, leading on an explosion at the Anglican Lisburn Cathedral in Ireland. She was imprisoned briefly, and awarded a Women's Social and Political Union Hunger Strike medal. She continued her campaign, albeit peacefully, during and after World War I. == Personal life == Born Lillian Margaret Grubb in either 1870 or 1871, most likely in Ireland her parents were Richard Cambridge Grubb of Cahir Abbey, County Tipperary and Killeaton House, County Antrim and his wife, Harriet Richardson. She had two brothers, Cameron and Richard. The latter of whom became a veterinary surgeon. She was born into a wealthy family who made their fortunes from the linen industry. She married in 1892, becoming the second wife of Captain Robert Henry Metge (1850-1900) who was an MP for Meath and also a magistrate. Robert had already 13 children by his first wife, Frances Lambart, and lived at Athlumney, Kilcairne, County Meath. Robert and Lillian Metge had two daughters, Lillian Gwendoline Cole Metge (known as \\"Gwendoline\\") and Dorothy Elise Cole Metge. Robert Metge died on 19 September 1900 before Lillian became involved in the militant suffragette activities. Gwendoline Metge committed suicide in 1920. By 1921, Metge had been living in Seymour Street, Lisburn, then in Shrewsbury briefly, then Dublin, where she died on 10 May 1954. Metge's personality was described as 'tall straight backed and stern'.Lillian Metge mannequin at Lisburn == Suffragette activism == Metge became interested in pressing for the right to vote as neither her financial status nor education was enough, as she was a woman, and she became involved in being active for women's rights. In Ulster, this interest among liberal middle-class women in social changes went across the Nationalist/Unionist divide and the aim for improvements across social classes. Despite that, there was a view among many Ulstermen that women were not able to manage the complex politics of Ulster and Home Rule and so should not be allowed to vote, and that it was not a general demand, but just came from an active few. Some local women's groups were content with aiming for the same property requirements as men rather than for universal suffrage. Metge's own views on these matters were not clearly recorded. Metge founded the Lisburn Suffrage Society and was its president and secretary at different times. There were a number of Irish and Ulster suffrage groups, and attempts to unite their efforts. Metge wrote articles for the Irish Women's Suffrage Federation (IWSF) movement's newsletter, the Irish Citizen. In 1913, Metge represented the IWSF at the International Women's Congress, held in Budapest. In 1913, the IWSF considered whether it would be a militant group. In April 1914, Metge left both IWSF and the Lisburn society over some 'administrative' issues, and made a speech stating her intent to be militant, as to do otherwise would be a dishonour to the vision in which she believed. In May 1913, she was part of the large group of women who charged at King George V outside Buckingham Palace and were reportedly beaten by the police. In July 1913, she was at the Belfast trial of Dorothy Evans and Madge Muir, and then was arrested herself for throwing stones at the court windows. Metge helped look after Evans, released early on 26 July for health reasons, during Evans's hunger strike in Tullamore prison. Metge, on one occasion, possibly bought 'green and white' shoes for her fellow Irish suffragette, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington. Lisburn Cathedral, site of the explosion On 31 July 1914, Metge, carried out a plan to bomb the Anglican Lisburn Cathedral, with a Miss D. Carson, Maud Wickham, and Dorothy Evans. An explosion waking the town in the dead of night. An Ulster Volunteer Force quartermaster's wife, Lillian Spender, initially thought it was a big gun, later when she found out it was suffragettes she said 'suffragettes - the brutes!' and called Metge - a 'mad militant'. The dynamite blew out the oldest stained glass chancel window in the Church of Ireland Cathedral, which outraged some local people. The police had initially gone to the gasworks, thinking that had blown up, but then at the cathedral they found the damage to the window, and suffragette leaflets lying about among the broken glass and rubble. Metge was a suspect, due to her known militant position, and also as the women's footprints had made a muddy trail straight to the rear of Metge's house. Metge and her co-conspirators were arrested at 8 am the next day, but had to have police protection as they were taken into custody, as bottles, stones and mud was thrown and the house windows were broken. Any local sympathy was further lost when the government stated they would raise local (tax) rates to cover the cost of repairing the Cathedral's damage. Lillian Metge's Hunger Strike Medal 1914 Metge and the others were taken to Crumlin Road Prison and went on hunger strike. Metge was awarded a Hunger Strike Medal \\"for Valour\\" by the WSPU, with its green white and purple ribbon, and a date on the bar of 10 August 1914. Metge's Hunger Strike Medal is now held in the Lisburn Museum. == Trial and release == At Metge's and the others' trial, as well as the police finding the footsteps trail and a linen handkerchief from the scene, further evidence was presented, including four sets of muddy boots and damp coats with spent fuse matches in their pockets at Metge's house. A local shopkeeper gave evidence that Mrs Metge had asked to buy dynamite a few months previously saying it was 'to blow up a tree in her garden'. As at other suffragette court appearances, the women on trial did not co-operate with the court, shouting out, making long speeches for their cause, pushing the police, and at one stage 13 policemen were involved in holding the four women back, as an apple was thrown at the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Moorhead, who said the throw 'wasn't bad ... for a woman'. Metge demanded to be released saying 'there is one law for women and another for men. A woman could not get justice here'. Despite the strong evidence, the women were never sentenced as the UK Home Secretary had intervened in the 'votes for women' campaign, which WSPU had said was being stood down due to imminent war (as World War I was about to break out) and all court actions against suffragettes stopped and the women already imprisoned were released. but Metge's release was also conditional on her taking no further activism. == Later life == Metge pursued peaceful campaigning for women's rights during the War, writing for the Citizen and working with the Irish Suffrage and British Women's Social and Political Union leaders. Some women were granted the right to vote after the War in 1918, and Metge gave up her activism in 1920 (not long after her daughter Gwendoline committed suicide). She moved from Lisburn to Shrewsbury for a while then went to live in Dublin. Metge was left a gold watch in the will of Dorothy Evans, which had originally been given by 'Belfast suffragette friends' when Evans died in 1944. Metge died on 10 May 1954 in Dublin. She is buried in Deansgrange Cemetery, Dublin. == See also == * List of suffragists and suffragettes including more on different suffrage societies in Ireland * Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom * Hunger Strike Medal *The Irish Citizen == References == Category:1870s births Category:1954 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:People from County Meath Category:Irish suffragettes Category:Irish women's rights activists Category:Hunger strikers Category:Hunger Strike Medal recipients ","title":"Lillian Metge"},{"id":"61717584","text":"Parthena (Tena) Ipsilantis Katsaounis is a Greek-American statistician interested in the factorial design of physical experiments.

The Fort is named for its builder, Jerome Benson. The Fort was abandoned a year after it was built in 1857. Fort Benson was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.617) on September 11, 1957. Jerome Benson, in fear, built the Fort because of land disputes. The fort on his land claim, was made of earthworks and wood. The fort was defended by a brass cannon. The fort was used only one year as about half the Mormons around his land were told to return to Utah during the Mormon War, also call the Utah War. On December 27, 1858, the US Army arrived into San Bernardino. The US Army's Mojave Expedition leader was Colonel William Hoffman. He placed troops in San Bernardino and Cajon Pass to deal with Indians and the land problems.

The confrontation lasted from May 1857 to July 1858. There were some casualties, mostly non-Mormon civilians. The war had no notable military battles. Poll, Richard D., and Ralph W.

The Mormons, fearful that the large U.S. military force had been sent to annihilate them and having faced persecution in other areas,Missouri Executive Order 44 made preparations for defense. Though bloodshed was to be avoided, and the U.S. government also hoped that its purpose might be attained without the loss of life, both sides prepared for war. The Mormons manufactured or repaired firearms, turned scythes into bayonets, and burnished and sharpened long- unused sabres.The Aiken massacre took place the following month. In October 1857, Mormons arrested six Californians traveling through Utah and charged them with being spies for the U.S. Army. They were released, but were later murdered and robbed of their stock and $25,000. pp. 562‚Äì563http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi- bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url;=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/whq/38.4/b \\"Brigham Young and Wild Bill Hickman\\", Salt Lake City Messenger, Newsletter #77, February 1991, Utah Lighthouse Ministry Taking all incidents into account, MacKinnon estimates that approximately 150 people died as a direct result of the year-long Utah War, including the 120 migrants killed at Mountain Meadows. He points out that this was close to the number of people killed during the seven-year contemporaneous struggle in \\"Bleeding Kansas\\". In the end, negotiations between the United States and the Latter-day Saints resulted in a full pardon for the Mormons (except those involved in the Mountain Meadows murders), the transfer of Utah's governorship from church President Brigham Young to non-Mormon Alfred Cumming, and the peaceful entrance of the U.S. Army into Utah.William P.

It has been categorized in the Ceratostomataceae family and under the genus Harzia. The genus Harzia contains three accepted species: H. acremonioides, H. verrucose Hol-Jech, and H. velatea Hol-Jech. Within the genus Harzia, H. acremonioides is one of the most common species that can be found in all climate regions around the world. ==History and taxonomy== The species was first named as Acremonium atrum in 1837 by Corda. Then in 1871, Harz named it Monosporium acremonioides. In 1886, the species got its well- known name Acremoniella atra (Corda) Sacc.. However, Holubov√°-Jechov√° pointed out the fact that \\"atrum\\" frequently refers to a black fungus, which is not the species look like, so the legitimate name of the species was later replaced by Harzia acremoniodies (Harz) which was given by Costantin in 1888. The species was named Monopodium uredopsis by Delacroix in 1890, and again in 1904, it was named as Eidamia acremonioides by Lindau, and she put the species under a new genus named Eidamia, but the legitimate name of the species remains unchanged. ==Growth and morphology== The genus Harzia consists of a hyaline mycelium, a brown thick-walled blastoconidia, and hyaline conidiophores. As of a member of the genus Harzia, the spores of H. acremonioides are large, one-celled, cinnamon brown or golden brown, ovoid to sugblobose, thick-walled, usually smooth-walled, but sometimes with a slight wrinkling or the exposure, and they tend to vary in size. H. acremonioides are produced asexually, at 20 ¬∞C on MEA, its colonies can reach about 3.3 cm diam in about just five days, and 20-30 x 15-20 um, almost smooth-walled obovoid conidia are produced. Growths of H. acremonioides can be obtained on potato mush agar, potato glucose agar, potato extract agar, and rice; slightly growth can be obtained in solutions of sucrose and maltose and a synthetic mutrient agar. The growth of H. acremonioides on rice is colored brown, and when growing the species on potato mush agar at 20 ¬∞C, firmly growth of mycelium was obtained producing megaspores. ==Physiology== For H. acremonioides, the production of the conidia and the color of the macrospore are affected by temperature. At 20 ¬∞C, optimum growth in all the culture media employed can be obtained, numerous conidia and brown megaspores were formed; at 30 ¬∞C, very little growth are obtained, no conidia were observed, and the majority of the megaspores were hyaline; and when grow the species on synthetic nutrient agar, no growth occurred at 25 or 30 ¬∞C. In addition to temperature, the presence of other fungi may also have decided effects on the growth of H. acremonioides. When H. acremonioides is isolated from seeds, the fungus is always associated with another fungus named Alternaria tenuis auct.. With the presence of Alternaria tenuis auct., H. acremonioides grows rapidly, producing abundant spores and mycelium, and when grow H. acremonioides in pure culture, it grows much slowly and produces less mycelium and fewer spores ==Habitat and ecology== H. acremonioides is classified as a plant-pathogenic fungus, however, it does not appear to be of serious pathological significance. Generally, the species has been regarded as a type of Saprotroph. It can directly acquire nutrients from wild plants and cultivated plants includes Pteridium aquilinum, beet, alfalfa, Pteridium aquilinum, Heracleum sphondylium, Scrophularia nodosa, Urtica sp. Rumex acetosella ryegrass and Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium. H. acremonioides has been found widely distributed on various substrata. It has been reported from peat bogs in Ireland soil in the Netherlands, Germany, Canada, the United States, the British Isle, Australia, Papua, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Rhodesia and Kenya, carst caves in the USSR and Yugoslavia, coniferous forests in Japan and Hungary, whereas the main recorded substrates are the seeds of different plants that are often found in association with Alternaria alternata. The species has been isolated from seeds from the Netherlands, Denmark, British Columbia, and Ontario., and a variety of seeds that associated with the species includes Allium cepa L. (onion), Beta aulgaris L. (beet), Daucus carota L. var. sat'iaa DC. (carrot), clover, peas, wheat, grass, cotton, radish, timothy and sorghum. It has also been isolated from rotting stems and leaves of clover, radish, Betula alba, tomato, beans, corn, cobs, Salsola kali, graminaceous plants. ==Mycoparasitism== According to Urbasch‚Äôs research in 1986, H. acremonioides can act as a biotrophic parasite to parasitizes the species Stemphylium botryosum with lobed, contact cells that work as appressoria are being utilized, which can cause little damages to the species. However, H. acremonioides can still grow without host fungi. Besides the ability to parasite the species Stemphylium botryosum, H. acremonioides can also invade the sclerotia of some species which ends up with a drastic reduction in the number of viable sclerotia. In order to control H. acremonioides, pycnidial dust can be used as a seed dressing to protect the seeds. ==References== Category:Melanosporales ","title":"Harzia acremonioides"},{"id":"61717761","text":"Symmetric fair cake-cutting is a variant of the fair cake-cutting problem, in which fairness is applied not only to the final outcome, but also to the assignment of roles in the division procedure. As an example, consider a birthday cake that has to be divided between two children with different tastes, such that each child feels that his/her share is \\"fair\\", i.e., worth at least 1/2 of the entire cake. They can use the classic divide and choose procedure: Alice cuts the cake into two pieces worth exactly 1/2 in her eyes, and George chooses the piece that he considers more valuable. The outcome is always fair. However, the procedure is not symmetric: while Alice always gets a value of exactly 1/2 of her value, George may get much more than 1/2 of his value. Thus, while Alice does not envy George's share, she does envy George's role in the procedure. In contrast, consider the alternative procedure in which Alice and George both make half-marks on the cake, i.e., each of them marks the location in which the cake should be cut such that the two pieces are equal in his/her eyes. Then, the cake is cut exactly between these cuts‚Äîif Alice's cut is a and George's cut is g, then the cake is cut at (a+g)/2. If a who termed it meta-envy-free. Several variants of symmetric fair cake-cutting have been proposed: * Anonymous fair cake-cutting requires that not only the values be equal, but also the pieces themselves be equal. This implies symmeric fairness, but it is stronger . For example, it is not satisfied by the symmetric-divide-and-choose above, since in the case that a=g, the first agent always gets the leftmost piece and the second agent always gets the rightmost piece. * Aristotelian fair cake-cutting requires only that agents with identical value measures receive the same value. This is implied by symmetric fairness, but it is weaker. For example, it is satisfied by the asymmetric version of divide-and-choose: if the agents' valuations are identical, then both of them receive a value of exactly 1/2. == Definitions == There is a cake C, usually assumed to be a 1-dimensional interval. There are n people. Each person i has value function Vi which maps subsets of C to weakly- positive numbers. A division procedure is a function F that maps n value functions to a partition of C. The piece allocated by F to agent i is denoted by F(V1,...,Vn; i). === Symmetric procedure === A division procedure F is called symmetric if, for any permutation p of (1,...,n), and for every i: > Vi(F(V1,...,Vn; i)) = Vi(F(Vp(1),...,Vp(n); p‚àí1(i))) In particular, when n=2, a procedure is symmetric if: > V1(F(V1,V2; 1)) = V1(F(V2,V1; 2)) and V2(F(V1,V2; 2)) = V2(F(V2,V1; 1)) This means that agent 1 gets the same value whether he plays first or second, and the same is true for agent 2. As another example, when n=3, the symmetry requirement implies (among others): > V1(F(V1,V2,V3; 1)) = V1(F(V2,V3,V1; 3)) = V1(F(V3,V1,V2; 2)). === Anonymous procedure === A division procedure F is called anonymous if, for any permutation p of (1,...,n), and for every i: > F(V1,...,Vn; i) = F(Vp(1),...,Vp(n); p‚àí1(i)) Any anonymous procedure is symmetric, since if the pieces are equal - their values are surely equal. But the opposite is not true: it is possible that a permutation gives an agent different pieces with equal value. === Aristotelian procedure === A division procedure F is called aristotelian if, whenever Vi=Vk: > Vi(F(V1,...,Vn; i)) = Vk(F(V1,...,Vn; k)) The criterion is named after Aristotle, who wrote in his book on ethics: \\"... it is when equals possess or are allotted unequal shares, or persons not equal equal shares, that quarrels and complaints arise\\". Every symmetric procedure is aristotelian. Let p be the permutation that exchanges i and k. Symmetry implies that: > Vi(F(V1,....Vi,...,Vk,...,Vn; i)) = Vi(F(V1,....Vk,...,Vi,...,Vn; k)) But since Vi=Vk, the two sequences of value-measures are identical, so this implies the definition of aristotelian. Moreover, every procedure envy-free cake-cutting is aristotelian: envy-freeness implies that: > Vi(F(V1,...,Vn; i)) ‚â• Vi(F(V1,...,Vn; k)) Vk(F(V1,...,Vn; k)) ‚â• > Vk(F(V1,...,Vn; i)) But since Vi=Vk, the two inequalities imply that both values are equal. However, a procedure that satisfies the weaker condition of Proportional cake- cutting is not necessarily aristotelian. Cheze shows an example with 4 agents in which the Even-Paz procedure for proportional cake-cutting may give different values to agents with identical value-measures. The following chart summarizes the relations between the criteria: * Anonymous ‚Üí Symmetric ‚Üí Aristotelian * Envy-free ‚Üí Aristotelian * Envy-free ‚Üí Proportional == Procedures == Every procedure can be made \\"symmetric ex-ante\\" by randomization. For example, in the asymmetric divide-and-choose, the divider can be selected by tossing a coin. However, such a procedure is not symmetric ex-post. Therefore, the research regarding symmetric fair cake-cutting focuses on deterministic algorithms. Manabe and Okamoto presented symmetric and envy- free (\\"meta-envy-free\\") deterministic procedures for two and three agents. Nicolo and Yu presented an anonymous, envy-free and Pareto-efficient division protocol for two agents. The protocol implements the allocation in subgame perfect equilibrium, assuming each agent has complete information on the valuation of the other agent. The symmetric cut and choose procedure for two agents was studied empirically in a lab experiment. Alternative symmetric fair cake-cutting procedures for two agents are rightmost mark and leftmost leaves. Cheze presented several procedures: * A general scheme for convering any envy- free procedure into a symmetric deterministic procedure: run the original procedure n! times, once for each permutation of the agents, and choose one of the outcomes according to some topological criterion (e.g. minimizing the number of cuts). This procedure is not practical when n is large. * An aristotelian proportional procedure for n agents, which requires O(n3) queries and a polynomial number of arithmetic operations by the referee. * A symmetric proportional procedure for n agents, which requires O(n3) queries, but may require an exponential number of arithmetic operations by the referee. === Aristotelian proportional procedure === The aristotelian procedure of Cheze for proportional cake-cutting extends the lone divider procedure. For convenience, we normalize the valuations such that the value of the entire cake is n for all agents. The goal is to give each agent a piece with a value of at least 1. # One player chosen arbitrarily, called the divider, cuts the cake into n pieces whose value in his/her eyes is exactly 1. # Construct a bipartite graph G = (X+Y, E) in which each vertex in X is an agent, each vertex in Y is a piece, and there is an edge between an agent x and a piece y iff x values y at least 1. # Find a maximum-cardinality envy-free matching in G (a matching in which no unmatched agent is adjacent to a matched piece). Note that the divider is adjacent to all n pieces, so NG(X)= n ‚â• X (where NG(X) is the set of neighbors of X in Y). Hence, a non-empty envy-free matching exists. Suppose w.l.o.g. that the EFM matches agents 1,...,k to pieces X1,...,Xk, and leaves unmatched the agents and pieces from k+1 to n. # For each i in 1,...,k for which Vi(Xi) = 1 - give Xi to agent i. Now, the divider and all agents whose value function is identical to the dividers' are assigned a piece and have the same value. # Consider now the agents i in 1,...,k for which Vi(Xi) > 1. Partition them into subsets with identical value-vector for the pieces X1,...,Xk. For each subset, recursively divide their pieces among them (for example, if agents 1, 3, 4 agree on the values of all the pieces 1,...,k, then divide pieces X1,X3,X4 recursively among them). Now, all agents whose value-function is identical are assigned to the same subset, and they divide a subcake whose value for them is greater than their number, so the precondition for recursion is satisfied. # Recursively divide the unmatched pieces Xk+1, ..., Xn among the unmatched agents. Note that, by envy-freeness of the matching, each unmatched agent values each matched piece at less than 1, so he values the remaining pieces at more than the number of agents, so the precondition for recursion is satisfied. == References == Category:Fair division ","title":"Symmetric fair cake-cutting"},{"id":"61717787","text":"Leah Wrenn Berman Williams (born 1976) is a mathematician at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, specializing in discrete geometry.

In 1959, she married fellow inorganic chemist Neil Waters, who was knighted in 1995. ==Academic career== Waters was appointed as a lecturer in chemistry at the University of Auckland in 1961, rising to the rank of associate professor. In 1983, she joined Massey University as a senior research fellow and associate professor in chemistry, and in 2000 she was made a full professor at Massey's Albany campus. Following her retirement, she was conferred with the title of professor emeritus. Her research focused on the determination of molecular structure using X-ray crystallography. An early publication by Waters was the first to describe the structure of a coordination complex containing a metal‚Äìhydrogen bond. Waters served as president of the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry in 1989‚Äì1990, and was the first woman to hold the position. ==Later life== Following her formal retirement, Waters continued part-time research and teaching activities at Massey Albany. Her husband, Neil Waters, died in Auckland in 2018. ==Honours and awards== In 1996, Waters was awarded the Massey Medal of Massey University, in recognition of services to the university and to science. In the 2006 New Year Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to chemistry. Waters was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1999, and is also a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry. ==References== Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:People from Auckland Category:People educated at Diocesan School for Girls, Auckland Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:New Zealand chemists Category:New Zealand women chemists Category:Inorganic chemists Category:Crystallographers Category:New Zealand women academics Category:University of Auckland faculty Category:Massey University faculty Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of New Zealand Category:Officers of the New Zealand Order of Merit ","title":"Joyce Waters"},{"id":"61717911","text":"Paperino e altre avventure (Donald Duck and Other Adventures), also known as Paperino giornale, is a 1937-1940 weekly Italian Disney comics magazine published by Mondadori. The comic was launched by Federico Pedrocchi, Mondadori's art director, as a companion to the existing weekly Topolino (Mickey Mouse) magazine. Paperino published 149 issues from December 30, 1937 to October 26, 1940, at which point it was merged with Topolino. The eight- page newspaper published the first Italian Donald Duck comic book story, \\"Paolino Paperino e il mistero di Marte\\" (\\"Donald Duck and the Secret of Mars\\"), which was written and drawn by Pedrocchi, and serialized in 18 one- page installments. Pedrocchi wrote eight serials starring Disney characters for the paper, featuring Donald Duck, Goofy and the characters from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. During the same period, he also wrote two further Disney stories which were printed in Mondadori's biweekly publication Albi d'oro. Paperino also published non-Disney adventure comics from the United States, including Popeye, Buck Rogers, Ella Cinders and Tarzan, along with non-Disney comics created by Pedrocchi and others. In 1938, when the fascist Mussolini government ordered publishers to stop publishing American creations, Paperino dropped its American comics, except for Donald Duck; the Ministry's order made an exception for Disney comics. ==Origin== Pedrocchi, a former novelist and advertising illustrator, joined Mondadori in 1936. At the time, Al Taliaferro's Donald Duck comic strip was being reprinted in several of Mondadori's publications, including Topolino, I Tre Porcellini and Nel Regno di Topolino, and Pedrocchi thought that Donald was appealing enough to anchor his own magazine. Pedrocchi's pitch to Mondadori in 1937 said: In each issue, the front page contained either the latest episode of a Donald Duck story, or (for six months in 1938-39) a set of Taliaferro's Donald Duck daily comic strips. When Pedrocchi started writing comics about Goofy and Snow White characters, they were printed on the back page. Pedrocchi was influenced by Taliaferro's strip, and some of the character poses in Pedrocchi's stories are copied from Donald Duck. But the settings were different: Taliaferro's strip takes place in US suburbia, while Pedrocchi's Donald lives in urban Milan, where the magazine was published. \\"Paperino\\" also lives on his own, with no sign of three little nephews. ==Disney stories== Federico Pedrocchi wrote eight Disney comics stories for Paperino e altre avventure between 1937 and 1940, and two stories for Albi d'oro in 1938 and 1939. All ten are described below, in chronological order. ===Donald Duck and the Secret of Mars=== \\"Paolino Paperino e il mistero di Marte\\" (Donald Duck and the Secret of Mars) was published in 18 parts, from issue #1 to 18 (Dec 30, 1937 - April 28, 1938). The story was written and drawn by Federico Pedrocchi. The story was reprinted as a full 17-page story in the biweekly Nel regno di Topolino #57 (April 25, 1938). While some cite this story as the first ever Donald Duck comic book story, that distinction actually goes to William A. Ward's Donald and Donna, which premiered seven months earlier in the UK magazine Mickey Mouse Weekly in issue #67 (May 15, 1937). Having lost the key to his house, Donald Duck falls asleep on a park bench. When a policeman wakes him, he inadvertently smacks the cop, and then runs away. Two sinister strangers see him fleeing from the law, and drive him away. Dr. Kraus and his assistant, Baus-Baus, have built a rocket they plan to pilot to Mars, and they need a third person on their voyage. Thinking that the police are on his trail, Donald agrees, and they lift off. After destroying oncoming chunks of ice from a comet's tail, Donald accidentally breaks the helmets of the team's spacesuits, and Baus-Baus locks him up in a storage room. Donald finds a journal written by Captain Bluff, who set off on a journey to Mars forty years earlier. The spaceship lands on Mars, and Donald is sent out first to make sure the air is breathable. He's picked up a group of gangly cat-faced Pindos, who carry him to their leader, Chief Bluff. Thrilled to see another Earthling, Bluff reveals that he was tricked by Dr. Kraus into traveling to Mars decades ago, to discover the secret of the Pindos' power. Dr. Kraus takes charge of the Pindos' big, monkey-faced enemies, the Pondos, who invade the Pindos' stronghold. Donald is thrown down the stairs to the basement, where he finds the \\"Room of the Sun\\", the true source of the Martians' power. By standing in a concentration of solar energy, Donald temporarily gains super-strength, and fights off the Pondos single-handedly. He chases Kraus and Baus-Baus into their spaceship, which crashes into Bluff's palace, destroying the Room of the Sun and ending the threat that unscrupulous people would use the Pindos' secret power. Donald's boost of strength wears off, and he and Bluff pilot the ship back to Earth, taking Kraus and Baus-Baus as prisoners. Back on Earth, Donald is given a reward for apprehending the wanted criminals, but gets fined an equal amount for assaulting an officer, leaving him with nothing. The art in this first Paperino story was influenced by Taliaferro's Donald Duck comic strip‚Äîin fact, Donald's pose in the fourth panel of the first strip, jumping on the park bench trying to chase away an imaginary mosquito, is taken directly from Taliaferro's first Donald Duck Silly Symphony Sunday comic strip of August 30, 1936. Comics historian Alberto Becattini also sees sci-fi influences: \\"There were also clear references to Dick Calkins' Buck Rogers -- which was, by the way, one of the regular features in Paperino -- and to Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon, as far as the spaceships and the alien landscapes were concerned. It must be noted that Pedrocchi himself was quite familiar with science fiction plots, having been writing and laying out an s.f. series, \\"Saturn Against the Earth\\", since 1936.\\" Becattini and David Gerstein also point out Pedrocchi's debt to Floyd Gottfredson's Mickey Mouse comic strip, which was running in Paperino's sister paper, Topolino: \\"Like Mickey in \\"His Horse Tanglefoot\\" (1933), a naive Donald is tricked into helping the bad guys. As in Gottfredson's \\"Island in the Sky\\" (1937), the villain's quest for a scientific secret ultimately leads to his destruction. And as in \\"Mickey Mouse Sails for Treasure Island\\" (1932), a long-missing sailor is discovered ruling a lost world... As the art director of his country's Disney editions, however, Pedrocchi was professional enough to absorb more than just story details. He also taught himself how Gottfredson structured a Disney adventure: with character-based plot threads that built upon one another, dovetailing together neatly in the end.\\" ===Donald Duck, Special Correspondent=== \\"Paolino Paperino inviato speciale\\" (Donald Duck, Special Correspondent) was published in 30 parts, from issue #19 to 48 (May 5 - Nov 24, 1938). The story was written and drawn by Federico Pedrocchi. It was reprinted as a full 30-page story in the monthly Albi d'oro #21 (Sept 1938). At the start of this story, Donald bumps into an old friend, Peter Pig (called Meo Porcello), from Donald's first cartoon, the 1934 Silly Symphony short The Wise Little Hen. Peter remains Donald's sidekick through the next adventure as well, \\"Donald Duck Among the Redskins\\", and also makes an appearance in \\"Donald Duck, Fortune Teller\\". Leaving the police station at the end of the previous story, Donald is approached by Lucius Linotype (Signor Linotipi), editor of the newspaper Another World (L'altro mondo). He hires Donald and Peter as reporters and sends them to war-torn Selvania, where they must take a picture of General Sweet (Generale Miele), who's never been photographed. On the road to Selvania, the boys meet another reporter, Bart Caterwaul (Bartolomeo Circonlocuzioni), also known as \\"the Cat\\", from rival paper The Old Globe (Mondo intero). He pretends to befriend them, but when they get to the Selvanian border, the Cat tells a soldier that Donald and Peter are spies from Selvania's enemy, Marinzia. After a disastrous trial, Donald and Peter are sentenced to be executed, but they manage to get a telegram to Mr. Linotype, who arrives in an airplane just in time to explain things to the authorities. The Cat continues to sabotage Donald and Peter's efforts to get to the front lines and photograph General Sweet, but Donald gets in the way of the Cat's photo, and a picture of the duck is printed in The Old Globe as the general. The rival paper is humiliated, but the Cat uses the opportunity to trick the Marinzians into capturing Donald, thinking that he's General Sweet. Donald pretends to be Sweet, and tricks the Marinzian's General Sour (Generale Fiele) into attacking at a strong point in the Selvanian defenses. Peter hears the real Sweet promising the Cat a photo, and sneaks across enemy lines to tell Donald. Furious, Donald steals a plane, kidnaps Sour, and brings him to Selvania. The war over, Donald and the Cat both rush back to their newspapers with a photograph of the general. The Cat's paper publishes first, but still gets a pic of the wrong man; Donald's paper gets a shot of the real General Sweet, and Linotype rewards Donald and Peter for their service. ===Salesman Goofy=== \\"Pippo viaggiatore di commercio\\" (Salesman Goofy) was published in 9 parts, from issue #40 to 48 (Sept 29 - Nov 24, 1938). The story was drawn by Enrico Pinochi. The story was reprinted as a full 17-page story in the biweekly Nel regno di Topolino #72 (December 25, 1938). In the story, Goofy is hired by the Rosatea perfume company. A jealous rival tries to trick Goofy into switching the normal bottles with bottles made of unbreakable glass, and Goofy ends up breaking all of the bottles to prove they're the right ones. This \\"Pippo\\" (Goofy) story premiered in issue #40, replacing the American strip Ella Cinders as the American content was being phased out. Pedrocchi was hoping to produce another comic headlined by a Disney character, Il Giornale di Pippo, and created a dummy mockup of the first issue. The final panel in the last part has the word \\"Continua...\\" (\\"To be continued...\\"), presumably a lead-in to the proposed Pippo paper, which never materialized. There was a six-month gap from Paperino #49 to #71 (Nov 1938 to May 1939) without a Pedrocchi-written Disney story. During this period, Pedrocchi wrote two stories published in Albi d'Oro -- \\"Donald Duck and the Philosopher's Stone\\" and \\"Clarabelle in the Claws of the Black Devil\\"‚Äîwhile the front page of Paperino was filled with American Donald Duck comic strips. ===Donald Duck and the Philosopher's Stone=== \\"Paperino e la pietra filosofale\\" (Donald Duck and the Philosopher's Stone) was published as a 28-page story in Albi d'oro #22/1938 (Oct 15, 1938). The story was the third and last Disney story with Pedrocchi as both writer and artist. Donald inherits a gigantic, complicated machine from his late uncle Paolo Paperis, which is supposed to turn rocks into gold. Uncle Paolo's faithful butler Socrate shows Donald the machine, which is kept in the dungeons of Paolo's mansion. Donald needs to load the machine with rocks, and then use the fabled philosopher's stone, which is buried in the garden. Donald ultimately discovers that Socrate is actually Paolo in disguise, who wanted to test his nephew. The Italian Disney Comic Guide blog comments, \\"The stock moralistic ending of the so-called Socrate would risk confining the story to the list of stories for the little ones if it were not for the timely Donaldesque reaction to the forced life lesson.\\" ===Clarabelle in the Claws of the Black Devil=== \\"Clarabella fra gli artigli del diavolo nero\\" (Clarabelle in the Claws of the Black Devil) was published as a 26-page story in Albi d'oro #25/1939 (April 15, 1939). The story was drawn by Enrico Pinochi. Horace Horsecollar (Orazio Cavezza) and Clarabelle Cow (Clarabella) work at a luxury hotel, where there's a series of mysterious thefts committed by \\"the Black Devil\\". Assisting with the investigation, they end up getting kidnapped by the thief, Fagnocco the cook, and taken onboard a smuggling ship. Fagnocco turns out to be Peg-Leg Pete (Pietro Gambadilegno), who was disguised with a fake mustache. Clarabelle saves the day, and at the end of the story, Horace proposes marriage to Clarabelle. While often romantically linked, Horace and Clarabelle have never tied the knot in Disney comics published in any other countries. Pinochi swiped most of the art for this story from the Mickey Mouse adventures \\"Race for Riches\\" (1935), \\"The Pirate Submarine\\" (1935‚Äì36) and \\"Dr. Oofgay's Secret Serum\\" (1934). ===Donald Duck Among the Redskins=== Original stories returned to Paperino e altre avventure with \\"Paperino fra i pellirosse\\" (Donald Duck Among the Redskins), published in 29 parts from issue #72 to 100 (May 11 - Nov 23, 1939). The story was drawn by Enrico Pinochi. The story was reprinted as a full 29-page story in the monthly Albi d'oro #33 (Dec 1939). Mr. Linotype sends Donald and Peter on another assignment, this time to report on a tribe of Indians who live in a hidden valley. The Cat, now a tax collector trying to collect from the Indians, follows them and tries to take advantage. There are two rival tribes in the valley, and Donald and Peter try to end the war between them. ===Snow White and Basilisk the Wizard=== At the same time that original Donald Duck stories began to appear on the front page of Paperino, a Pedrocchi-written Snow White story took over the back page. \\"Biancaneve e il mago Basilisco\\" (Snow White and Basilisk the Wizard) was published in 29 parts, from issue #72 to 100 (May 11 - Nov 23, 1939). The story was \\"drawn in a baroque, sometimes surreal style\\" by artist Nino Pagot. It was reprinted as a full 29-page story in the biweekly Nel regno di Topolino #92 (Nov 25, 1939). The evil wizard Basilisk (Mago Basilisco) kidnaps the child of Snow White and Prince Charming. Snow White discovers that the sorcerer is living in the castle that belonged to the Evil Queen, and the prince goes to rescue the child, but he is blinded by Basilisk's magic gaze. The Seven Dwarfs help Snow White to rescue the child from the sorcerer's gorilla servants, and they annihilate the wizard by rolling an avalanche of boulders to crush him. When the wizard dies, his castle crumbles. This story continues the comics adaptation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by Merrill De Maris, Hank Porter and Bob Grant, created in the United States for the Silly Symphony Sunday comic strip. The 20-part adaptation was translated into Italian and printed in Topolino #265-284 (Jan 20-June 2, 1938), and collected in Nel regno di Topolino #66 (Sept 25, 1938). Pedrocchi's sequel makes reference to the Prince's imprisonment in the Queen's dungeons, a subplot that appeared in the comic strips but not in the original movie. The Italian Disney Comic Guide blog comments, \\"For the Seven Dwarfs, Pagot's models are obviously those already available, in fact the schematism and repetitiveness of their poses is a limit. But the best job is the one on the environments, fully enjoyable only in the first edition: the influences from contemporary d√©co inspirations can be guessed, as in the initial sequence on the waters of the enchanted lake. The hybrid Mago Basilisco is a completely new authorial creation, devilish and with a body similar to that of a wolf. An unironic incarnation of pure Evil, he literally dies at the end of the story, crushed by an avalanche of boulders so much that his black soul soars in the air for a few seconds before heading to Hell.\\" Mago Basilisco appeared later in Luciano Bottaro's 1966 story \\"Paperin Furioso\\", a parody of the Italian epic poem Orlando Furioso published in Topolino #544-545 (May 1‚Äì8, 1966). ===Donald Duck, Fortune Teller=== \\"Paperino chiromante\\" (Donald Duck, Fortune Teller) was published in 30 parts, from issue #101 to 130 (Nov 30, 1939 - June 13, 1940). The story was drawn by Enrico Pinochi. The story was reprinted as a full 26-page story in the monthly Albi d'oro #37 (April 1940). In the story, Donald sets up a fortune telling tent, with Goofy as his assistant. Peter Pig and \\"the Cat\\" appear in small roles, and the cast also includes Horace, Clarabelle, Peg-Leg Pete and Eli Squinch (Eli Squick). Horace and Clarabelle Cow are depicted in this story as married, following on from his proposal in \\"Clarabelle in the Claws of the Black Devil\\". Disney Comic Guide points out, \\"The plot anticipates some thirty years, more or less, that of \\"Donald Duck, Wizard of Duckburg\\" (\\"Paperino stregone di Paperopoli\\") (1967) of Rodolfo Cimino and Giulio Chierchini, but the latter will be a story of very different depth and foresight.\\" ===The Seven Bad Dwarves Against the Seven Good Dwarfs=== \\"I Sette Nani cattivi contro i Sette Nani buoni\\" (The Seven Bad Dwarves Against the Seven Good Dwarfs) was published in 21 parts, from issue #101 to 130 (Nov 30, 1939 - June 13, 1940). The story continued the Snow White adventures printed on the magazine's back page, and was drawn by Nino Pagot. In the story, Dopey (Cucciolo) has disappeared, and Grumpy (Brontolo) and Doc (Dotto) set off to search for him. They're taken prisoner in the realm of King Severo, where they learn that Dopey was kidnapped by the Seven Bad Dwarfs, who want to take the diamond mine from their Good counterparts. The Bad Dwarfs' underground country is accessed through a hollow tree trunk. The Good Dwarfs triumph by diverting water through the Bad Dwarfs' caves, flushing them out and into the sunlight. This story introduces the Seven Bad Dwarves: Furbicchio, Sibilo, Maligno, Mastiff, Ricino, Spinaccio and Cipiglio. Alberto Becattini translates the names into English as Wily, Hiss, Malicious, Mastiff, Castor Oil, Bramble and Scowl. Disney Comic Guide comments, \\"The deformed and memorable Seven Bad Dwarfs... represent the dark side of the mythology of the Dwarfs, so much so that the adventure can be characterized as a sibylline descent into the unconscious of the protagonist Dwarfs, with the congenital muteness of Cucciolo as a further signal of impotence of the protagonists before being able to resurface in the world kissed by light, where the word (= intelligence) has finally, a way to express one's power in the face of the brute forces to be sedated.\\" The Bad Dwarfs returned to Italian comics in four stories written from 1960 to 1966, often in the service of the Evil Queen. The first was \\"The Seven Dwarfs and the Christmas Spell\\" (\\"I Sette Nani e l'incantesimo di Natale\\") in Almanacco Topolino #48 (Dec 1960). The fourth story was Paperin furioso, Luciano Bottaro's parody of Orlando Furioso in Topolino #544 (May 1966), which also included the Mago Basilico from Pedrocchi's first Snow White story. They were also revived in the mid 70s to mid 80s in Brazilian comics, in eight stories printed in O Pato Donald, Mickey and Tio Patinhas. ===Donald Duck and the Chinese Vase=== \\"Paperino e il vaso cinese\\" (Donald Duck and the Chinese Vase) was published in 19 parts, from issue #131 to 149 (June 27 - Oct 26, 1940). The story was drawn by Enrico Pinochi. In the story, Donald reads that Count Baffirossi (Count Red Mustache) is offering ten thousand lire to detectives who can recover his stolen Chinese vase. Donald and Goofy set up a detective agency in front of the Count's house, and Donald puffs enough hot air about being expert detectives that Baffirossi agrees to a hundred thousand lire. They find suspicious fingerprints on the column that held the vase, and discover they belong to the cook, who quit recently. When the investigators go to the cook's house, her fierce husband chases them away. They convince the Count to buy a second vase, to lure the thief into returning‚Äîand the thief does, taking the second vase while Donald and Goofy are sleeping nearby. Donald accidentally finds the thief in the cellar the next morning‚Äîit's the cook's husband, an alcoholic who stole the vase to drain the Count's wine caskets. Both vases have smashed, and Donald and Goofy try to put them back together. The police lieutenant Sbronzini hears the cook's husband admit that he's the thief, and takes credit for the capture. Donald and Goofy manage to reassemble the vases, as the cook begs the Count for clemency. The Count agrees not to press charges if the cook comes back to work for him, and then gives the hundred thousand lire to Donald and Goofy. Pinochi's artwork is heavily traced from Gottfredson's Mickey Mouse comic strip story \\"The Seven Ghosts\\", with Count Baffirossi as a double for Gottfredson's Colonel Bassett. ==Non-Disney stories== These stories also appeared in Paperino e altre avventure: ===Italian comics=== * Will Sparrow by Luigi Cordero & Kurt Caesar: #1-44 * Zorro Della Metropoli by Cesare Zavattini, G. Martina & Walter Molino: #1-16 * Il Corsaro Nero by D. Natoli, Rino Albertarelli & Walter Molino: #17-77 * Luciano Serra Pilota by Amedeo Martini & Walter Molino: #56-79 * Kit Carson by Federico Pedrocchi & Walter Molino: #80-133 * Capitan L'Audace by Federico Pedrocchi & Walter Molino: #91-149 * Saturno contro la Terra by Federico Pedrocchi & Giovanni Scolari : #122-149 * Aeroporto Z by Federico Pedrocchi & Kurt Caesar: issues #124-149 ===American comics=== * Buck Rogers (Elio Fiamma) by Dick Calkins & Rick Yager: #1-40 * Ming Foo (La Rondine dei Mari) by Brandon Walsh & Nicholas Afonsky: #1-37 * Popeye (Braccio di Ferro) by Elzie Segar: #1-40 * Ella Cinders (Ella Parella) by Bill Conselman & Charles Plumb: #25-39 * Tarzan by Burne Hogarth: #112-133 * Tim Tyler's Luck (Mario e Furio) by Lyman Young & Nat Edson: #134-149 ==Cancellation== The 1938 Ministry of Popular Culture decree that magazines had to stop publishing American-created content put pressure on both Topolino and Paperino, which had to fill the void with more Italian-created content. (After dropping Buck Rogers, Ella Cinders, Ming Foo and Popeye in 1938, Paperino did introduce one American-produced page in February 1940, first presenting Tarzan and then Tim Tyler's Luck.) After Paperino issue #149 (Oct 26, 1940), the magazine was absorbed into Topolino. The three artists that worked on Paperino's Disney-related comics never drew Disney characters again after the paper closed. Federico Pedrocchi continued to write and work as art director for Topolino, but only on non-Disney stories. Enrico Pinochi became a full-time illustrator, and later moved to Argentina. Nino Pagot set up an animation studio with his brother Toni, and left the field. ==Legacy== Rebo, the Saturnian dictator from Pedrocchi's Saturno contro la Terra (Saturn Conquers the Earth), returned to Disney comics in a March 1960 story by Carlo Chendi and Luciano Bottaro: \\"Paperino e il razzo interplanetario\\" (\\"Donald Duck and the interplanetary rocket\\"), in Topolino #230-232, in which Donald foils his plans to conquer Jupiter. Bottaro also wrote and drew three more stories featuring Rebo in 1995 and 1997. ==Reprints== ===Italy=== As noted above, six of the eight Paperino e altre avventure stories were reprinted shortly after their serialization, as complete stories in the biweekly Nel Regno di Topolino or the monthly Albi d'oro. Both magazines ended publication in 1940, so the final two Paperino stories (\\"The Seven Bad Dwarfs Against the Seven Good Dwarfs\\" and \\"Donald Duck and the Chinese Vase\\") were not reprinted in the pre-war books. After the war, most of the stories were reprinted once in the restarted Albi d'oro between 1947 and 1954. Some were reprinted in Super Almanacco Paperino in the late 1970s, in Paperino Mese in 1989-1990, and in Zio Paperone and Le imperdibili between 2006 and 2008. The apparently unfinished \\"Salesman Goofy\\" is the least-reprinted of the Disney stories; it hasn't been published in an Italian comic since 1949. The two Pedrocchi stories from Albi d'oro were last reprinted in 1956. In 1990 and 1991, the entire series of Paperino e altre avventure was reprinted, including the non-Disney strips, in six volumes by Comic Art as Paperino: Collana Grandi Ristampe. ===United States=== Only two of the Paperino stories have been reprinted in the United States. \\"Donald Duck and the Secret of Mars\\" was reprinted in Gladstone Publishing's Donald Duck #286 (Sept 1994), translated by Fabio Gadducci, with dialogue by Bruce Hamilton & David Gerstein. It was also reprinted in 2012, with restored art and a new translation, in the Gottfredson collection Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse volume 3: High Noon at Inferno Gulch. The second story, \\"Donald Duck, Special Correspondent\\", was reprinted in two parts in Boom! Studios' Donald Duck #364 and 365 (March‚ÄìApril 2011), translated by Gerstein. ===Europe=== The Paperino stories have also been reprinted rarely in other European countries. Some of the stories were reprinted in the Scandinavian countries between 1984 and 1988, \\"The Secret of Mars\\" was reprinted in France's Picsou Magazine in 2004, \\"Special Correspondent\\" in India's Donald Duck and Friends in 2012, and \\"Chinese Vase\\" in Germany's Die tollsten Geschichten von Donald Duck in 2016. In Portugal, most of the Paperino stories were reprinted between 2015 and 2017 in Disney Big, Disney Hiper and Minnie & Amigos, except for \\"The Secret of Mars\\" and \\"Salesman Goofy\\". There are two stories that have only been reprinted in Portugal and Italy: \\"Donald Duck, Fortune Teller\\" and \\"The Seven Bad Dwarves Against the Seven Good Dwarfs\\". \\"Donald Duck and the Philosopher's Stone\\", \\"Clarabelle in the Claws of the Black Devil\\" and \\"Salesman Goofy\\" have never been seen outside of Italy. ==References== Category:Disney comics titles Category:Donald Duck comics Category:Arnoldo Mondadori Editore Category:Comics magazines published in Italy Category:Italian-language magazines Category:1937 comics debuts Category:Magazines established in 1937 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1940 Category:Weekly magazines published in Italy Category:Defunct magazines published in Italy ","title":"Paperino e altre avventure"},{"id":"61717915","text":"Diario Hoy en la Noticia (in English, \\"the newspaper of today's news\\") was an Argentine newspaper that was published in the city of La Plata, in Buenos Aires Province. It was founded on 10 December 1993, by the family of the Secretary General of the Union of Workers and Minors of Education and Minority (SOEME), and union leader of the General Confederation of Labor, Antonio Balcedo, The paper closed down in 2012. Balcedo's wife, Myriam Renee Chavez de Balcedo, known as Nen√©, was its last director. The paper's offices were located at 426 32nd Street; its printing plant was located on 508th Street at the corner of 24th Street in the Manuel B. Gonnet neighborhood. == Distribution == On June 1, 2010, Diario Hoy expanded its distribution area and began distribution free of charge in: Berazategui, Quilmes, Brandsen, Magdalena, Ranchos, Bavio, Chascom√∫s, Lezama, General Conesa, Maip√∫, San Miguel del Monte, Las Flores, General Guido, Dolores, Castelli, General Belgrano, General Lavalle, and Mar de Aj√≥. In 2018, the newspaper ended free distribution and cost 15 pesos. Its circulation reached 60,000 copies per day. == Closure == On January 4, 2018 Marcelo Balcedo, who held the position of morning director, was arrested in Uruguay with his wife Paola Fiege, accused of the crimes of money laundering, smuggling and international trafficking of firearms, ammunition, explosives and other related materials, \\"all in real repetition regime\\". In response, Myriam Ren√©e Ch√°vez de Balcedo stepped back in as director and laid off more than a hundred employees, including journalists, photographers, cameramen, and editors. At this stage the paper reduced its circulation, ended free distribution and began to charge (10 to 15 pesos), and some weekends did not distribute a print edition, among other adjustments made by its director. On the morning of October 18, 2018, Myriam Ren√©e Ch√°vez de Balcedo was arrested by order of federal judge Ernesto Kreplak, accused of illicit association, money laundering, and defrauding for 64 million pesos in the SOEME, the guild led by his son, Marcelo Balcedo, in prison since January 2018. Later, Court No. 3 of La Plata granted him house arrest and ordered an embargo for 400 million pesos. Given this situation, the editor of the newspaper published a final cover and editorial on November 2, 2018 with the title: \\"Judge Kreplak: Do not be a donkey, ideas are not killed.\\" Since November 3, 2018, print distribution has ceased.

The book was published by Random House on August 13, 2019, eight years after Obreht's 2011 debut novel, The Tiger's Wife. ==Plot== The novel follows two parallel narratives in the American frontier. Living in the lawless, drought-ridden lands of the Arizona Territory in 1893, 37-year-old frontierswoman Nora Lark waits inside her home for the return of the men in her life. Nora's husband, Emmett, left in search of water for the household and their two elder sons left following an explosive argument. Nora lives with her youngest son, who is convinced that a mysterious beast is stalking the land surrounding their home. She also lives with Emmett's wheelchair-bound mother, Missus Harriet, as well as Emmett's cousin, Josie, a clairvoyant who hosts seances to communicate with the dead. Nora, affected by her loneliness and isolation, speaks to her long- dead daughter, Evelyn, who died of heat stoke in Arizona as a baby. Lurie Mattie, an immigrant Muslim from a Balkan piece of the Ottoman Empire, is a former outlaw and a man haunted by ghosts. He is able to see lost souls who want something from him, and he acquires their \\"wants\\". Lurie finds reprieve from the soul's longing in an unexpected relationship with Burke, a dromedary camel from the United States Camel Corps. However, Lurie is being pursued by a marshal on a charge of manslaughter and he takes cover in the Camel Corps. They are led by the camel driver Hi Jolly (aka Hadji Ali), a Turk of Syrian- Greek descent and a convert to Islam. Lurie travels with Burke in the Camel Corps on a westward trek from Texas. ==Publication== Inland was published by Random House on August 13, 2019. The novel debuted at number twelve on The New York Times Hardcover Fiction best-sellers list on September 1, 2019. ==Reception== On the review aggregator website Book Marks, which assigns individual ratings to book reviews from mainstream literary critics, the novel received a cumulative \\"Rave\\" rating based on 46 reviews: 30 \\"Rave\\" reviews, 12 \\"Positive\\" reviews, 3 \\"Mixed\\" reviews, and 1 \\"Pan\\" review. Ron Charles of The Washington Post praised the novel, writing, \\"The unsettling haze between fact and fantasy in \\"Inland\\" is not just a literary effect of Obreht's gorgeous prose; it's an uncanny representation of the indeterminate nature of life in this place of brutal geography.\\" Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Chanelle Benz stated, \\"Obreht's simple but rich prose captures and luxuriates in the West's beauty and sudden menace. Remarkable in a novel with such a sprawling cast, Obreht also has a poetic touch for writing intricate and precise character descriptions.\\" Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Carolyn Kellogg gave the novel a mixed review, praising the characters of Lurie and Burke but lamented, \\"It's unfortunate that among all the varied characters we meet in Inland, Native Americans don't ever leave the periphery. It's a missed opportunity. At times, this sweeping story seems almost too big for even a writer of Obreht's gifts.\\" ==References== Category:Novels by T√©a Obreht Category:2019 American novels Category:Random House books Category:Novels set in Arizona Category:Fiction about the United States Army Category:Ghosts in written fiction Category:Fiction set in 1893 Category:Novels set in the 1890s ","title":"Inland (Obreht novel)"},{"id":"61717950","text":"Cody Lake, or Lake Cody, may refer to: * Cody Lake (Minnesota), a lake in Minnesota, USA * Lake Cody (Quebec), a lake in Quebec, Canada ","title":"Cody Lake"},{"id":"61717988","text":"John Arkhaph (also spelled Arkaph or Archaph) was the bishop of Memphis in Egypt in the 320s and 330s. He was a disciple of Bishop Melitios of Lykopolis, whom he succeeded in 327 as leader of the Church of the Martyrs.Scott T. Carroll (1989), The Melitian Schism: Coptic Christianity and the Egyptian Church (PhD diss., Miami University), p. 115. The origin and meaning of \\"Arkhaph\\" are uncertain. Athanasius treats it as a Coptic name and calls him \\"Archaph who is also called John\\". Socrates Scholasticus transforms it into the Biblical name Achab. Possibly it is formed from arch (supreme) and apa (father) as an alternate to the title archiereus (high priest), which was used of the bishop of Alexandria in some Coptic documents.W. Telfer (1955), \\"Meletius of Lycopolis and Episcopal Succession in Egypt\\", Harvard Theological Review 48(4): 227‚Äì237. Besides Athanasius and Socrates, the historian Sozomen is an important source for John's career. John is first mentioned in the Breviarium Melitii, a list of bishops and other clergy of the Church of the Martyrs submitted by Melitios to the Council of Nicaea in 325. Nothing of his earlier life is known. Nor do any writings by him survive. He is \\"a shadowy and controversial figure\\".David M. Gwynn (2018), \\"John Arkaph\\", in David G. Hunter, Paul J.J. van Geest and Bert Jan Lietaert Peerbolte (eds.), Brill Encyclopedia of Early Christianity Online. Consulted online on 7 September 2019. Melitios chose John as his successor shortly before his death in 327. The schism in the Egyptian church that had been healed at Nicaea was resumed in 328 at the election of Athanasius as bishop of Alexandria. John was a staunch opponent of Athanasius, although the two reconciled long enough for the Emperor Constantine I to send John a letter of congratulations for ending the schism. There is a note added beside John's name in Athanasius' copy of the Breviarium: \\"was ordered by the emperor to be with the bishop\\". The exact meaning of the note and the identity of the bishop are a matter of academic debate. It may mean that John was ordered to submit to Athanasius in 328, or it may mean that John had been the representative of his church to the Alexandrian church at the time of the Council of Nicaea.Hans Hauben (2000), \\"John Arkhaph and 'the bishop' (Athan., Apol. Sec. 71.6): A Reassessment\\", Ancient Society 30: 271‚Äì275. Ultimately, the rivalry between John and Athanasius resulted in the latter's condemnation at the Council of Tyre in 335. Athanasius then went into exile, while John and his clergy were restored to their positions. Constantine, however, took exception to the council and exiled John and the rest of his clergy. In 337, the emperor died and Athanasius returned.Carroll (1989), p. 144. Nothing more is known of John after the Tyrian settlement fell apart. ==References== ==Further reading== *Hauben, Hans. 1994. \\"Jean Arkhaph, √©v√™que de Memphis, dans le catalogue m√©litien\\".

It is currently in the Kunstmuseum Basel. ==Analysis== Klee's adaptation of the human head divides an elderly face into rectangles of orange, red, yellow, and white. The flat geometric squares within the circle resemble a mask or the patches of a harlequin, hence the title's reference to the artist-performer Senecio. The triangle and curved line above the left and right eyes respectively give the illusion of a raised eyebrow. The painting's use of lines, ambiguous shapes, and space all demonstrate the principles of Klee's artistry in which simple graphical elements are set in motion by energy from the artist's mind. == References == Category:Paintings by Paul Klee Category:1920s paintings Category:Portraits by Swiss artists Category:Cubist paintings ","title":"Senecio (Klee)"},{"id":"61718069","text":"350px Portrait of a Woman is a c.1475 tempera and oil on panel painting by Antonio or Piero del Pollaiolo.

After secondary education at Merksem, near Antwerp, he began studying Philosophy and Theology at Antwerp seminary. His studies there were interrupted by the seminary's closure in 1797. He was ordained priest at Emmerich am Rhein in 1802. Between 1803 and 1825 he served in a number of parishes in and around Antwerp. On 13 April 1825 was named dean of Lier, and in 1829, to his surprise, bishop of Ghent, in succession to Maurice-Jean de Broglie, who had been banished in 1817 and died in 1821. He arrived in Ghent on 7 November 1829 and was consecrated the following day in his cathedral by the bishop of Tournai. He was solemnly enthroned on 18 November. His relations with the government of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands were difficult, due to differing interpretations of rights to religious liberty and free expression. He swiftly placed himself under the authority of the Provisional Government of Belgium set up by the Belgian Revolution. On 27 May 1834 the diocese of Ghent was split to re-establish the diocese of Bruges, the territory of which now corresponded to the province of West Flanders. Van de Velde approved and encouraged new congregations for charitable apostolates, including the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary, and was active in the establishment of diocesan schools, minor seminaries, and parish Sunday schools. One of his first actions as bishop, on 2 December 1829, had been to decree the re-establishment of the Major Seminary of Ghent, which reopened on 3 February 1830. In 1833 the Jesuits obtained permission to set up the Sint- Barbaracollege in the city, and the Dominicans returned to Ghent in 1835. At a meeting of the Belgian bishops in Mechelen, in the summer of 1833, Van de Velde proposed the founding of the Catholic University of Belgium, which opened in Mechelen on 4 November 1834, and transferred to Leuven in 1835 as the Catholic University of Leuven. He died at Ghent on 7 August 1838 and was buried in his cathedral. ==References== Category:1779 births Category:1838 deaths Category:Bishops of Ghent Category:19th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:People from Antwerp (province) ","title":"Jean-Fran√ßois van de Velde"},{"id":"61718152","text":"Ch√¢teau de Hames was a castle in Hames-Boucres, Pas-de-Calais, France. ==History== The castle at Hames consisted of a courtyard, surrounded by four towers with a donjon.

Built in 1969 as Beechmont Mall, it originally included John Shillito Company (Shillito's) and Mabley & Carew as its major anchor stores, with Gold Circle joining in 1980. Each anchor store changed names twice during the original mall's history: Shillito's became Rike Kumler Co. (Rike's) and then Lazarus, Mabley & Carew became Elder-Beerman and then Parisian, while Gold Circle became Hills and then Kmart. Between 2002 and 2003, the center was demolished except for the Lazarus and Kmart buildings, and renamed to Anderson Towne Center. Following the conversion of Lazarus to Macy's at that point and the closure of Kmart in 2013, the center's present anchor stores are Macy's, Kroger, Sky Zone, and Crunch Fitness. ==History== Plans for Beechmont Mall were first announced in September 1967. Developer Carl H. Lindner and his brother Robert D. Lindner announced that the mall's anchor stores would be two local department stores: John Shillito Company (Shillito's) and Mabley & Carew, with over of retail space occupying . Manuel D. Meyerson and Associates served as leasing agent for both anchor stores. According to the initially- announced plans, the Shillito store was to consist of two levels, with the lower level mainly consisting of apparel, shoes, toys, and sporting goods, while the upper level would feature furnishings, household goods, appliances, and discounted merchandise. Baxter, Hodell, Donnelly & Preston was hired as the architectural firm to design the Mabley & Carew store. The mall's location was chosen on Beechmont Avenue (SR 125) in Anderson Township. Construction began in October 1968, with projected costs of $14 million. By this point, several tenants had been confirmed for the mall, including Lerner New York (now known as New York & Company), Waldenbooks, Kinney Shoes, F. W. Woolworth Company, Florsheim Shoes, Casual Corner, Swiss Colony, 5-7-9, along with Thriftway Supermarket and SupeRx Drugs. The Lindner brothers sold the mall to Prudential Financial in 1977. The first change to come to the mall was in 1978, when Dayton, Ohio-based Elder-Beerman purchased all four locations of Mabley & Carew. Four years later, Federated Department Stores (now Macy's, Inc.) merged Shillito's with the Rike Kumler Co. (Rike's), another Dayton- based department store, and dual-branded all locations as Shillito-Rikes. In 1983, Beechmont Mall underwent an expansion whose construction costs were valued at $2,000,000. This expansion consisted of adding a Gold Circle discount store (also owned by Federated) to the north end of the mall, while relocating the Thriftway supermarket to a larger location on the mall's periphery. In addition, the older Thriftway location would become a food court. Further consolidation by Federated affected the two anchor stores under its ownership throughout the late 1980s. In 1986, the company merged the Shillito-Rike's stores with Lazarus, a department store based in Columbus, Ohio. As a result, Beechmont's western anchor was remodeled and converted to Lazarus that year. Two years later, following the acquisition of Federated by the Campeau Corporation, the Gold Circle chain was sold to Kimco Realty, which leased all of the Cincinnati-area locations to Hills that year. Woolworth closed at the mall in 1989 when its lease was not renewed, and its space was subdivided for smaller stores. In addition, Limited Brands (now L Brands) expanded its presence at the mall by downsizing Lerner New York for The Limited while also adding a branch of its sister brand Limited Express (now Express). Many of these changes were instigated by MetLife, which had acquired the mall from Prudential in 1987, and sought to target more white-collar worker demographics by bringing in more fashion-oriented tenants. Hills closed the store in June 1991 and five months later it was converted to Kmart, which relocated from an existing store to the west at Cherry Grove Plaza. Elder- Beerman closed its store at Beechmont Mall in 1992 after deeming that renovations to the store would be too costly. The store was sold that same year to Parisian, a department store chain based out of Birmingham, Alabama which had begun seeking other Cincinnati-area locations after the initial success of their location at Forest Fair Mall (now Forest Fair Village). In addition, a TGI Friday's restaurant opened at the mall the same year. Further renovations in 1993 included expanded locations for existing tenants Claire's, GNC, and B. Dalton. MetLife proposed renovation plans for the mall in 1994, which would include new entrances and expansion of the food court. Gap and Bombay Company also opened at the mall at this point, and mall management cited these stores as examples of the more upscale tenants desired in creating a more upscale image for the mall. ===1990s: Decline=== Despite the addition of these new stores, the mall's occupancy rate began to decline throughout the late 1990s due to its age, its smaller size than other malls, and increased competition from Kenwood Towne Centre. MetLife put the mall up for sale in 1996, but withdrew the sale after lack of interest. MetLife auctioned Beechmont and nine other malls under its ownership in 1997, and Zamias Services, Inc. bought all ten that December. By 1998, many major tenants had left the mall, including Gap, Express, and Lane Bryant. As a result, Zamias sought renovation plans, with proposals including a multiplex movie theater Parisian closed at the mall in late 1999 due to declining sales. Goldman Sachs acquired the mall from Zamias in 1999. The company proposed tearing down the mall and redeveloping it as an outdoor shopping center, but declined at the time due to concerns that redevelopment would not yield a large enough return on investment. Delays in redevelopment, combined with the expiration of tenant leases, contributed to an increasingly high vacancy rate at the beginning of the 21st century; by 2001, The Cincinnati Enquirer described the mall as a \\"ghost town\\" with \\"a handful of smaller stores\\" alongside Lazarus and Kmart. Victory Real Estate of Columbus, Georgia was announced as a potential buyer in November of that year. After buying the property, Victory Real Estate renamed it to Anderson Towne Center and announced that they would begin converting it to an outdoor mall. These plans called for the demolition of everything except for the Kmart and Lazarus buildings, along with the addition of exterior- facing retail suites and new locations for TGI Friday's and CVS Pharmacy, two of the only remaining tenants at the time. Demolition began in January 2003. Also included in the redevelopment would be a Kroger supermarket, then the largest in the chain, on the site of the former Parisian. In addition, the Lazarus store was renovated. Kroger opened for business in November 2004. The rest of the renovated center opened in 2005, by which point the Lazarus store had been re-branded as Macy's. At the time of reopening, the new mall had multiple vacancies, but township representatives and mall owners noted that this was due to several leases having not yet been finalized. Kmart closed at Anderson Towne Center in 2014. Five years later, the former Kmart was torn down for an AMC Theatres multiplex theater and a Crunch Fitness. Other tenants joining in 2019 included Sky Zone trampoline park and Bar Louie restaurant, while Macy's expanded its store with a branch of its discount division Macy's Backstage. ==References== Category:Shopping malls established in 1969 Category:Shopping malls in Hamilton County, Ohio Category:1969 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Anderson Towne Center"},{"id":"61718216","text":"Portrait of H≈çj≈ç Genan was a Japanese Samurai of the Sengoku period.

The building was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1996. ==Overview== Built in 1875, the Mitsuke school vies with the Former Nakagomi School in Saku, Nagano for the title of the \\"oldest western school building in Japan\\". As with the Nakagomi School, the wooden school building is an example of the Giy≈çf≈´-style of the early Meiji period, a pseudo-Western style of architecture which incorporates both western and Japanese elements. The building originally had three stories on a stone foundation, but was enlarged in 1883 with the addition of a two-story tower. The tower contained a drum, rather than a bell, for telling the time. It closed as a school in 1922, and was thereafter used for a number of purposes, including a teacher's training college, martial arts dojo, girl's high school sewing classroom, Imperial Japanese Army hospital, and municipal hall, until it finally reopened in 1992 as an education museum. On the north side of the former school is the Iwata Bunko, which was founded by the local kokugaku scholar ≈åkubo Takuhisa in 1864 on land donated by the neighboring ≈åmikunitama Jinja Shinto shrine. This library contained over 5000 volumes of works pertaining the kokugaku studies, and is housed in a kura-style building. The Iwata Bunko also protected under the same national historic site designation as the former Mitsuke School. ==See also== *List of Historic Sites of Japan (Shizuoka) ==References== ==External links== *Iwata city Tourism Guide *Shizuoka Prefecture Sightseeing Guide Category:Buildings of the Meiji period Category:History of Shizuoka Prefecture Category:Iwata, Shizuoka Category:Historic Sites of Japan Category:Education museums Category:School buildings completed in 1875 Category:1875 in Japan Category:Giy≈çf≈´ architecture ","title":"Mitsuke School"},{"id":"61718617","text":"Angelsea Sidings in 1980s.

Her father, Santiago Uribarrena Munitxa, a socialist activist, was a railway worker. After the strikes of October 1934, the Civil Guard arrested him and forced him to get into a river to turn in weapons, getting sick and dying a few days later. His funeral was celebrated on 30 December 1934, which was the first civil funeral in Durango. Benita was the youngest of four siblings. After the bombing of Durango on 31 March 1937, she was evacuated together with one of her sisters and her mother. They arrived in France in June 1937 with the Habana ship. == Exile == In France, she worked at a hotel and started her political activity in the Communist Party of Spain (PCE). She participated as a clandestine courier and guided people who fled Spain through the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales border. In 1944, she joined the French Resistance. She was arrested and imprisoned for one month until the liberation of France. Uribarrena lived most of her life in Le Soler.

The villages, or as the Spanish called them, Rancheria, were located what is now Loma Linda, California. Guachama Rancheria was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.95) on March 29, 1933. A marker was placed at 25894 Mission Road, Loma Linda, California to designate were the villages were. Translated, \\"Guachama\\" means a \\"place where there is plenty to eat\\". There were fresh springs and creeks in the area, thus providing ample food. Nearby was the Jumuba rancheria, another group of villages, that also start mission farming and cattle ranching. In 1772 Spanish exploration of the area started. Mission San Gabriel started to look at what is now the Loma Linda (beautiful hill) and Redlands lands in 1810, as a place to start a mission outpost. Father Francisco Dumetz (?-1811) came to the area and started Rancho San Bernardino on May 20, 1810 as an outpost of the Mission San Gabriel. Rancho San Bernardino became the headquarters of farming and cattle ranching in the area. The Guachama were taught to farm and care for cattle. Zanja trenches were made to bring water to more farm land. Guachama Rancheria from this time was called San Bernardino. In 1819 it was officially renamed San Bernardino Rancho of the Mission San Gabriel. Due to flooding from San Timoteo Creek, the mission was moved to higher ground in 1830.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.The area. adjacent to the Beartown Wilderness, is proposed as an addition to the wilderness. An area in a remote location, the Forest Service has classified it as possessing high scenic integrity with a steep and rugged terrain offering a challenge for those practicing orienteering or backcountry camping. The area is part of the Garden Mountain Cluster. ==Location and access== The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia east of Va 16, west of Beartown Wilderness and about 6 miles south of Tazewell, Virginia. The area has no improved or unimproved roads. However, there are about three to five miles of informal trails and logging roads which are passablet. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Hutcheson Rock and Tazewell South. Boundaries of the Beartown Wilderness Additions. Beartown Wilderness Addition A, as identified by the Wilderness Society, is on the left. The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails in the vicinity are given on National Geographic Maps 787 (Blacksburg, New River Valley, Trails Illustrated Hiking Maps, 787). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. ==Natural history== The area is part of the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. Yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock and red maple are found in colluvial drainages, toeslopes and along flood plains of small to medium-sized streams. White oak, northern red oak, and hickory dominate on the north and west, while chestnut oak, scarlet oak and yellow pine are found on ridgetops and exposed sites. The area contains about 285 acres of potential old growth forest. Most of the area is in the Dry Mesic Oak ecological community type. The varied topography of the area includes a wide variety of ecological types with hot, dry, windswept ridges to cool, moist coves. ==Topography== The wildland is part of the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Ecosystem Section. Ridges, composed of sandstone and shale, run northeast/southwest, with parallel valleys created from limestone or shale. The area is on the south side of Clinch Mountain where the mountain ends, making a change into a breached, dome-shaped geologic structure called Burkes Garden. The lowest elevation of 2320 feet is found along the southern boundary, and the high elevation of 3800 feet is found at a point on the north on the crest of Clinch Mountain. The area includes the headwaters of Roaring Fork and Laurel Creek. Roaring Fork is a tributary of Laurel Creek, which drains into the North Fork Holston River. The creek is canoeble from the point where it flows along VA 601 near Asberrys Virginia ==Forest Service management== The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Beartown Wilderness Addition A was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The area includes 1246 acres of land with the ownership of subsurface mineral in private hands. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. The area is designated ‚ÄúBackcountry‚ÄîNatural Process‚Äù, the strongest level of protection for a backcountry area. ==See also== *Garden Mountain Cluster *Natural Communities *Beartown Wilderness ==References== ==Further reading== * Stephenson, Steven L., A Natural History of the Central Appalachians, 2013, West Virginia University Press, West Virginia, . * Davis, Donald Edward, Where There Are Mountains, An Environmental History of the Southern Appalachians, 2000, University of Georgia Press, Athens, Georgia. . ==External links== * George Washington and Jefferson National Forest * Wilderness Society Category:George Washington and Jefferson National Forests Category:Southwest Virginia Category:Mountains of Virginia ","title":"Beartown Wilderness Addition A"},{"id":"61719208","text":"Nizhniye Bishindy () is a rural locality (a selo) in Verkhnebishindinsky Selsoviet, Tuymazinsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

The borders between Italian Eritrea and the Ethiopian Empire were defined in the 1889 Treaty of Wuchale. After Italy conquered Ethiopia in 1936 and established the colony of Italian East Africa, Eritrea became part of it. During World War II it fell under British military occupation and came under United Nations supervision in 1951. On 15 September 1952 it became the Eritrean Autonomous State, federated with the Ethiopian Empire under the sovereignty of the Ethiopian crown. Autonomy was withdrawn on 14 November 1962, following the beginning of the Eritrean War of Independence in 1961. After the Ethiopian revolution in 1974 the province was put under the reign of Derg and later the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The province achieved de-jure independence under the Eritrean People's Liberation Front in 1991 and was officially abolished by Ethiopia in 1993, becoming the independent state of Eritrea. ==References== Category:Political history of Eritrea Category:Political history of Ethiopia Category:Asmara Category:Historical regions Category:Former polities of the Cold War ","title":"Eritrea Province"},{"id":"61719860","text":"Maa Pallelo Gopaludu is a 1985 Telugu film directed by Kodi Ramakrishna.

His artworks seek to disrupt internalized patterns of thinking, associations, and ways of existing in the world through exhibitions and performances. He is a relative of the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, the writer Mary Lutyens and the composer Elizabeth Lutyens. == Work == Lutyens' projects have been exhibited internationally and center on explorations of sensory perception and the unconscious mind. He frequently uses hypnosis as a part of his performances. Lutyens collaborates with artists, writers, and scientists on his projects. His interests in sensory perception and synesthesia have led him to collaborate with neuroscientist Richard Cytowic, as well as neuroscientist Vilayanur Ramachandran. He has also worked closely with The Institute for Art and Olfaction on various projects, using specially created scents as a means of enhancing and deepening the experiences of his performance works. In addition, Lutyens has worked extensively with sensory impaired communities including the Association of Persons with Visual Impairments in Turkey and the Latvian Society of the Blind. Lutyens has also collaborated with organizations including Vision Forum, the International Association of Synaesthetes, Artists, and Scientists. === Hypnotic Show === Hypnotic Show is an evolving project created in collaboration with Raimundas Mala≈°auskas. It has been shown in various iterations, performed at dOCUMENTA (13), in Kassel, Germany in 2012. Performances of Hypnotic Show at dOCUMENTA (13) were held in a cabin, specially designed by Lutyens, called the Reflecting Room. A near exact replica of the upper cabin was installed below, upside down, so that the floor of the cabin appeared to be covered in a mirror. Even when visitors realized that the bottom floor of the cabin was not a mirror, their minds still saw it as such. Within this mirrored space, Lutyens held 340 hypnotic performances over 100 days, with 7,000 people in attendance. Scripts for these performances were adapted from Raimundas Mala≈°auskas‚Äô book, Paper Exhibition along with contributions from various artists. Special scents, designed by Sissel Tolaas, were also released into the space in order to deepen the experience. An instance of Hypnotic Show was performed at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City as a part of the exhibition Tales of Our Time in 2017. A video was also produced along with this performance. Previous events have involved scripts by artists and writers, including Pierre Huyghe, Joachim Koester, John Menick, Sof√≠a Hern√°ndez Chong Cuy, Carey Young, Etienne Chambaud and Robert Barry. === The Inductive Museum === The Inductive Museum was a performance piece presented Culture Summit in Abu Dhabi in 2019. Lutyens was invited as a keynote artist by curators Alexandra Munroe and Xiaorui Zhu-Nowell of the Guggenheim, to open the summit towards the theme of Cultural Responsibility and New Technology. Hypnotized visitors engaged in a variety of sensory experiences, including touch, smell, and sight, in order to elicit visions of a museum that existed within the psyche. === CO2morrow === CO2morrow is a reactive sculpture, first shown at the Royal Academy of Arts in London as a part of the show, ‚ÄúEarth: Art of a Changing World‚Äù in 2009. The project was created in collaboration with artist Alessandro Marianantoni and climate scientist Andrew Manning. Inspired by Timothy Morton‚Äôs idea of the hyperobject, CO2morrow approaches climate change as an issue of consciousness. The sculpture is created almost entirely out of carbon fiber and is modeled after a scrubber molecule that takes CO2 out of the air, based on research by chemist Omar Yaghi. The sculpture is also covered in LED lights that react in real time to data received from a network of sensing technologies in the United Kingdom. During the project, the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, who were helping Lutyens and his team collect data, were hacked in Climategate, an email leak that attempted to expose climate science as a conspiracy. After its showing at the Royal Academy of Arts, CO2morrow was moved to Seaton Delaval Hall, on the northeast coast of the England. === Neurathian Boatstrap === Neurathian Boatstrap is a multimedia installation displayed in 2015 at the 14th Istanbul Biennial, ‚ÄúSALT WATER: A Theory of Thought Forms‚Äù curated by Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev. The entire piece was housed inside and as a part of a two-story boat. The title of the project derives from Neurath‚Äôs boat, a metaphor central to anti-foundational explanations of knowledge, first formulated by the Austrian philosopher Otto Neurath. Lutyens used various objects to reframe sensory experiences: Chladni plates show the sound of the voices of a blind community that Lutyens collaborated with; large sea stones and their ceramic casts present a kind of ‚Äúbraille‚Äù of the sea. The hypnotic scripts for the project were derived from three novels, Asli Erdoƒüan‚Äôs The City in Crimson Cloak (1998), J.G. Ballard‚Äôs The Crystal World (1966), and Ren√© Daumal‚Äôs Mount Analog (1952). Lutyens also presented video pieces he created about impossible colors, those colors that are not usually perceivable between red and green, yellow and blue. === Phobophobia === Phobophobia is a project that addresses the fear of fear. It was performed at ‚ÄúATARAXIA,‚Äù curated by Koyo Kouoh, for the Salon Suisse at the 57th Venice Biennale in 2017. The performance uses hypnotism along with specially designed sculptures to open up and release fear through the process of discharge. By externalizing fear, Lutyens sought to assist visitors in releasing trauma as it exists in the body. Throughout the duration of the performance, special smells designed by Stephen Douthwaite were released to transition the frame of mind, enhancing and furthering goals of the hypnotic induction. === Color Therapy === Color Therapy is an installation presented on large LED screens simultaneously in six cities around the world over the course of a year. The project was presented in key public locations such as Times Square (New York), Piccadilly Circus (London) Amsterdam, Milan, Toronto and Singapore in 2014. The project explored the ways in which color can expand and effect consciousness through hypnotic visuals. Short 60-second films were played on the screens, reacting in real time to local weather data. The colors of each film related to an inverse of the current weather, creating emotional warmth when it‚Äôs cold, wet or windy, and a feeling of calm when it‚Äôs hot, dry or still. An iteration of the project was presented as Soma Chroma at Piccadilly Circus and Dubai Dubia at Zayed University in Dubai as a part of ISEA 2014, and K-Tanglement in New York, Toronto, Milan, and Amsterdam. == Literature == Lutyens wrote a book, published by Sternberg Press recounting his dOCUMENTA (13) experience titled, 100 Days: Memoirs of a Hypnotist. == References == == External links == * Category:Living people Category:1964 births Category:Artists from London Category:Artists from Los Angeles Category:English performance artists ","title":"Marcos Lutyens"},{"id":"61720056","text":"Seilala Lam (born 18 February 1989) is a Samoan born rugby union player who plays as a hooker.

In 1974, Warcha≈Çowski suggested the generic name Gruevia, believing the name Rhodopaea to be preoccupied by a butterfly genus of the same name described by Achille Guen√©e in 1845.

Their larvae are specialized predators of termites. ==Taxonomy== Oxynopterus mucronatus was originally described by the French entomologist Guillaume-Antoine Olivier in 1792 as Elater mucronatus. The type specimen was obtained from the collection of William V, Prince of Orange. It became the type species of the genus Oxynopterus, established by the English naturalist Frederick William Hope in 1842. O. mucronatus is classified under the tribe Oxynopterini, in the click beetle family Elateridae. The generic name Oxynopterus means \\"sharp-wing\\" in ancient Greek; while the specific name mucronatus is Latin for \\"pointed\\". Both refer to the sharp, pointed tips of the elytra. ==Description== O. mucronatus, like other members of the genus Oxynopterus, are among the largest of the click beetles. The males have distinctive feather-like antennae, with long flat lamellae extending from the antenna segments. The females in contrast, have thin toothed antennae and are larger than the males. The prothorax is shield-shaped, with sharply pointed posteriolateral tips. The elytra are long and smooth, tapering to a sharp point. The claws are simple, without bristles (setae), pads, or lobes on the tarsal segments. They are predominantly reddish-brown in life. ==Ecology== The larvae of O. mucronatus are specialized predators of termites of the genus Neotermes. ==Uses== Dried O. mucronatus is regarded as a traditional aphrodisiac in Javanese culture. They are also popular among insect collectors due to their large sizes. ==See also== *Campsosternus *Tetralobus flabellicornis ==References== Category:Beetles described in 1792 Category:Oxynopterus Category:Aphrodisiac foods ","title":"Oxynopterus mucronatus"},{"id":"61721284","text":"Giant click beetle can refer to several large members of the family Elateridae, they include: *Oxynopterus :*Oxynopterus mucronatus *Tetralobus :*Tetralobus flabellicornis ","title":"Giant click beetle"},{"id":"61721595","text":"Acacia trinervata, the three-veined wattle, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae in the legume family Fabaceae. ==Description== It is an erect or spreading shrub growing to a height of .

The term \\"rainbow\\" is symbolic of the hope brought by the child after the storm of the previous loss. Research conducted at the University of Michigan establishes that \\"parental relationships have a higher risk of dissolving after a miscarriage or stillbirth, compared with a live birth\\", and that the risk is highest for those couples who have experienced a stillbirth. In the 21st century, such parents seeking to have another child often turn to online support groups for information and encouragement. According to physician Jennifer Kulp-Makarov, \\"It is an extremely emotional and devastating experience to lose a pregnancy or baby. To create a life or bring a baby into the world after such a loss is amazing like a miracle for these parents‚Äù.

In 1952 he entered Harvard College, where he lived in Adams House, and graduated in 1956 with an AB magna cum laude in physics. He immediately moved to Los Angeles and joined the research department of Hughes Aircraft Company. He received an MS in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology in 1957, and after a year at the Sorbonne on a Fulbright scholarship returned to Caltech, where he completed his PhD in 1962. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi. In 1959 he began part- time work in the Communications Systems Research Section of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and in 1961 he became a full-time Member of the Technical Staff there. In 1967 he became a Consulting Engineer with the Space and Information Systems Division of Raytheon Company in Sudbury, Massachusetts, where he worked on advanced communications systems. In 1981 he founded Sequoia Systems Incorporated in Marlborough, Massachusetts, which produced fault-tolerant computer systems, specialized for transaction processing, using a tightly coupled architecture of his design. Nine years later the company began trading on the NASDAQ exchange. Stiffler died March 24, 2019 in Watsonville, California. ==Research== Stiffler in the 1980s Stiffler was author or coauthor of numerous papers and books, and was awarded several hundred patents. His thesis, \\"Self-synchronizing binary telemetry codes\\", supervised by Solomon Golomb, combined the ideas of binary orthogonal codes (in which codewords are completely uncorrelated with one other) and self-synchronizing codes (in which there is no ambiguity about the positions of the boundaries between code words); he found constructions of self- synchronizing binary orthogonal codes for all codeword lengths greater than or equal to four, and proved nonexistence for all shorter lengths. In 1964 he developed the puncturing technique (and proved the Solomon‚ÄìStiffler bound) with Gustave Solomon, and coauthored Digital Communications with Space Applications with Golomb, Andrew Viterbi and two others. His 1971 book Theory of Synchronous Communications grew out of NASA's need for highly power- efficient synchronous serial communication during data transmissions for its deep space program; a review called it \\"unparalleled in its comprehensive treatment of the synchronization problems of time-discrete communications\\" and \\"a landmark in the theoretical development\\" of the subject. In 1971 he edited a special issue, on error correcting codes, of IEEE Transactions on Communication Technology, and in 1980 he edited a special issue of IEEE Transactions on Computers surveying fault-tolerant computing. In 1975 he was made a Fellow of the IEEE, a distinction reserved for IEEE members with \\"extraordinary record[s] of accomplishment\\". ==References== Category:American electrical engineers Category:American computer scientists Category:Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences alumni Category:California Institute of Technology alumni Category:Fulbright Scholars Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:People from Polk County, Iowa Category:1934 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Engineers from Iowa Category:Hughes Aircraft Company ","title":"J.

During his time playing high school football, he passed for 2,542 yards with 50 touchdowns and only 11 interceptions. His high school quarterbacks coach was Pro Football Hall of Famer Kurt Warner. In his senior year of high school, he received offers from 12 colleges, committing to USC in 2018. USC had been one of the only teams from one of the Power Five conferences to show interest in Slovis, which happened shortly after USC quarterbacks coach Bryan Ellis visited the high school. Arizona State offensive coordinator Rob Likens had also shown interest in Slovis, but was unable to recruit him before he committed to the Trojans. Slovis graduated from his high school a semester early and enrolled at the University of Southern California in January 2019. ==College career== === USC ===  Freshman season  Slovis entered the 2019 season as the second quarterback in the depth chart, behind then-starting quarterback JT Daniels. Slovis made his first collegiate appearance in the Trojans' season opener against Fresno State, after Daniels suffered a season-ending knee injury. Slovis would go on to make his first start next week, where he set the school record for quarterback touchdowns in a 45‚Äì20 victory over the 23rd ranked Stanford Cardinal. For his efforts, Slovis was named the PAC-12 Freshman of the Week. The next week, Slovis started in an away game against BYU, where he would throw three interceptions in a 30‚Äì27 loss in overtime. Slovis would next start in a home game against the 10th ranked Utah Utes, where he left the game early in the first quarter after suffering a possible head injury. Backup quarterback Matt Fink would proceed to lead the Trojans to a 30‚Äì23 upset victory. Following the incident, Slovis was placed in the concussion protocol and ruled out for the next game, an away game at Washington, leaving Fink to start. Slovis would return to the starting position for the next game, a narrow loss at 9th ranked Notre Dame. Rebounding from that loss, Slovis would lead the Trojans to two straight wins, a blowout against Arizona and a come from behind victory in USC's first away game win of the season at Colorado. For his performance in the Colorado victory, Slovis was awarded his second PAC-12 Freshman of the Week Award. Following a 56‚Äì24 blowout loss to Oregon, where Slovis set the USC record for most pass attempts in a game, Slovis would return to his native Arizona where he set another school record with 292 passing yards and 4 touchdowns in the first quarter of a 31‚Äì26 victory against Arizona State. For his performance, Slovis was awarded the PAC-12 Player of the Week Award, while freshman Kenan Christon was named the PAC-12 Freshman of the Week. The following week, Slovis led the Trojans to a 41‚Äì17 blowout of Cal going 29/35 for 406 yards, 4 touchdowns and zero interceptions. In the final game of the regular season, Slovis broke another USC record throwing for single game passing yards, throwing for 515 yards and 4 touchdowns (the previous record of 493 yards was set by Matt Barkley in 2012) in a 52‚Äì35 win over UCLA. It was his fourth game of at least 400 yards passing, setting yet another school record. During the 2019 Holiday Bowl, with USC down 28‚Äì24 but making a comeback, Slovis suffered an elbow strain in the second quarter after getting sacked by A. J. Epenesa. He was replaced by Matt Fink and USC would lose to the Iowa Hawkeyes 49‚Äì24. Slovis finished the 2019 season with a freshman record 3,502 yards, 30 touchdowns to only 9 interceptions and an NCAA Freshman record 71.8 completion percentage, while leading USC to an 8-4 regular season record and a Holiday Bowl berth en route to being named the PAC-12 Freshman of the Year.  Sophomore season  Following the 2019 season, multiple sources pegged Slovis as a possible contender for the Heisman Trophy in 2020. On July 14, 2020 he was named to the Davey O'Brien Award Watch List alongside other notable quarterbacks, including 2020 Heisman Trophy favorites Trevor Lawrence and Justin Fields. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Pac-12 Conference football season was indefinitely suspended. In September, Slovis sent an open letter alongside several other USC players urging California Governor Gavin Newsom to loosen restrictions related to the pandemic to possibly allow for a 2020 season. ===Statistics=== { class= style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! colspan=\\"20\\" style=\\"background:gray; border:2px solid silver; color:white;\\"NCAA career statistics - ! colspan=\\"20\\" style=\\";\\" USC Trojans - ! rowspan=2Season ! rowspan=2Games ! rowspan=2Games started ! rowspan=2Record ! colspan=9Passing ! colspan=7Rushing - !

A pharmacist in civilian life, Winning was an officer in the part-time Militia during the inter-war years. He volunteered for overseas service with the Second Australian Imperial Force during the war and fought in the Middle East, Greece and Crete, in 1941. He commanded an infantry battalion in Syria on occupation duties, and in Australia where he led them in a garrison role in the Northern Territory. He was promoted to brigadier in early 1943 and commanded several formations in Australia until assuming command of the 13th Brigade in the field, commanding them against the Japanese in the final stage of the New Britain campaign. In 1946, he returned to civilian life, working as a pharmacist. He died at the age of 65 after falling from a cliff at Watsons Bay, New South Wales. ==Early life and military career== Born in Hurstville, New South Wales, on 9 April 1906, Winning was one of five children born to Robert and Elizabeth Winning. He attended Sydney Boys' High School and then the University of Sydney. He was a pharmacist in civilian life, and began his military career in the part-time Militia in 1927. His father was an ironmonger of Irish heritage who was American by birth, while his mother had been born in England. He served with the 1st/19th Infantry Battalion as a lieutenant during the early 1930s. By February 1936, Winning had reached the rank of captain. At the outbreak of the war in late 1939, he volunteered for overseas service with the Second Australian Imperial Force and was appointed as a major in the 2/4th Infantry Battalion. He served with them as a company commander, and then battalion second-in-command, fighting against the Italians in North Africa in January 1941, and then the Germans in Greece and Crete in April and May 1941. He was mentioned in despatches for his service during this period. After this, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in July 1941 and given command of the 2/8th Infantry Battalion. This battalion had been heavily depleted by the fighting in Greece and on Crete, and was rebuilt under Winning's leadership in Palestine. In October, Winning led the 2/8th to Syria, where they undertook occupation duties until January 1942. The battalion was then brought back to Australia to prepare for actions against the Japanese in the Pacific, but was instead deployed to Darwin, Northern Territory, as garrison troops assigned to Northern Territory Force. Winning remained with the battalion until 18 February 1943. In February 1943, he was promoted to brigadier and commanded the 3rd Brigade, a Militia formation, on garrison duties until April 1944. This was followed by command of the 12th Brigade until May 1945. In 1945, he led the 13th Brigade during the New Britain campaign against the Japanese, taking command of the brigade in the field after its previous commander, Brigadier Eric McKenzie, fell ill. For his services in this campaign, he later received the Distinguished Service Order (in 1947). He had earlier been appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in June 1943. He also received an Efficiency Decoration. ==Later life== Post war, Winning relinquished his 2nd AIF appointment in 1946 and was placed on the Reserve list, returning to civilian life, initially in a factory, then as a pharmacist at St Luke's Hospital, in Darlinghurst, New South Wales.

In 1867, two of his brothers, Morris and Samuel visited Jacksonville, Florida which was still recovering from the Civil War and recognized the pent-up demand for dry goods. In 1867, they moved the family business to Jacksonville which then had a mere 4,000 residents. Cohen attended public schools in New York City and then joined his brothers (along with a third brother Julius ) in Jacksonville in 1875 which had grown to 7,000 residents. In 1880, Jacob assumed control of the store after his brother Samuel moved to New York City to work as a purchasing agent and Morris moved to England where he became engaged in the lace business. Jacob established a \\"one-price\\" policy with fixed price tags where there was no negotiating involved, an unusual practice at the time. In 1890, the population increased to 17,000 and Cohen moved the business into the Gardner Building, Jacksonville's first skyscraper and Florida's tallest building. In 1891, Julius died of typhoid fever. In 1901, Jacksonville burned to the ground and Cohen built a 300,000 square foot store on the site of the burned down St. James Hotel designed by Architect Henry John Klutho promising that the building would be \\"institution for the people.\\"Wood, Wayne. \\"St. James Building\\".

The station operated on 89.3 MHz between 1977 and 1981. ==History== On September 29, 1975, Oak Ridge applied for a construction permit for a new 10-watt noncommercial radio station to serve Orlando. The application, backed by faculty adviser and station manager Jack Howard, was approved in October 1976. WGAG-FM \\"FM 89\\", also known as \\"Green and Gold Radio\\" for the school's colors, began regular programming on November 3, 1977. Its regular programming included rock, beautiful music and easy listening programs, along with military-sponsored programs and political commentaries by the school's student body president as well as local and school news. Initially broadcasting from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., its broadcast day was extended to 9 p.m. by 1979. WGAG-FM operated with an array of equipment donated by seven local radio and television stations, as well as donated records and lumber for construction. Its transmitter had been manufactured in 1947, (Continued) and the age of the donated equipment presented issues at times for staff. The station, operated by the school's radio club, ran on a shoestring budget: $200 a year, brought in by selling doughnuts and clearing lawns. Oak Ridge's radio station, however, quickly found an insurmountable obstacle: a major change in Federal Communications Commission regulations relating to Class D 10-watt radio stations. In 1978, the FCC announced it would cease licensing new Class D stations and encouraged as many as possible to upgrade to \\"full-service\\" Class A operation, with an effective radiated power of at least 100 watts. The power increase was a financial impossibility for Oak Ridge High School, resulting in the closure of WGAG-FM in 1981 and the school instead pursuing the idea of creating a television production studio to be operated by students. ==References== ==External links== * GAG Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1977 Category:Radio stations disestablished in 1981 Category:1977 establishments in Florida Category:1981 disestablishments in Florida Category:High school radio stations in the United States GAG-FM ","title":"WGAG-FM"},{"id":"61724714","text":"The Harry Wade Exit Route was discovered and made by Henry Wade from Illinois in 1849. Henry Wade, his wife and children were in the Bennett-Arcan party caravan emigrating west. At the direction of guide Jefferson Hunt the caravan took a poorly planned turn and descended into Death Valley, California while looking for a shortcut off the Old Spanish Trail. The caravan of a 100 wagons were looking for the shortcut to get to the California Gold Rush sooner. Some of the party died in the valley and the name stuck. Henry Wade found a path out of the Valley, the trail he made is today called the Henry Wade Road, a dirt road. After departing Death Valley Wade found the Old Spanish Trail and came to Southern California though the Cajon Pass. Many in the party also suffered but nonetheless made it out of Death Valley. Harry Wade Exit Route was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.622) on October 9, 1957. A marker was placed about 30 miles north of Baker, California, on the Harry Wade Exit Route, to designate where his family escaped. The marker is at the southern end of Death Valley National Park. Digital-Desert : Mojave Desert Harry Wade was born on March 16, 1800, in Rochester, England. He married Mary Reynolds Leach, who was born on June 17, 1813, in London, England. In 1836, he migrated to the United States and settled in Tioga County, Pennsylvania. After surviving the move to California they moved to Northern California and ran an inn called The American House in Alviso, California. He died on October 13, 1883, in Alviso. Mary died on May 3, 1889, in Alviso.cvhistory.com THE Bennett-Arcan party ==Death Valley '49ers== Henry Wade was part of what would become known as the Death Valley '49ers. This was a group of pioneers from the Eastern United States that endured a long and difficult journey during the late-1840s California Gold Rush to prospect in the Sutter's Fort area of the Central Valley and Sierra Nevada in California. Their route from Utah went through the Great Basin Desert in Nevada, and Death Valley and the Mojave Desert in Southern California, in attempting to reach the Gold Country. The Death Valley party had split up from the Donner Party that took a more northerly route which would prove to be even more difficult. ==Marker== The marker at the site (about 30 miles north of Baker) reads:californiahistoricallandmarks.com CHL No. 622 Harry Wade Exit Route ‚Äì San Bernadino [sic] Telescope and Wildrose Peaks from Emigrant Canyon Road ==See also== *Santa Fe And Salt Lake Trail Monument *Death Valley *Death Valley National Park *Geology of the Death Valley area *Places of interest in the Death Valley area *History of California through 1899 *William L.

Missed by government agents during the signing of Treaty 8 in 1899, the Lubicon community was long without federal support. Seeking to have their traditional title acknowledged through the creation of an Indian reserve, Lubicon representatives have maintained an active land claim since 1933. As oil and gas development changed the face of Alberta, development on Lubicon land became an increasingly pressing issue. Between 1979 and 1982, over 400 oil and gas wells were drilled around the community of Little Buffalo, the band's headquarters. Most prominently, the nation mounted a protest campaign during the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, blockading roads crossing its traditional territory in October of the same year. Because of a disputed election, the band was placed under third-party management from 2008 to 2013. A secret ballot was used for the first time in 2013, resulting in the election of new Chief Billy Joe Laboucan and the restoration of Government of Canada recognition. In October 2018, Lubicon members approved a settlement with federal and provincial governments in a community vote. The agreement includes $121 million and 246 square kilometers of land near Little Buffalo. ==Land agreement== On October 24, 2018, the Lubicon Lake Band reached a land claim agreement with the province of Alberta. Chief Billy Joe Laboucan met with Alberta Premier Rachel Notley and federal Minister of Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett for the signing. The agreement includes a land allocation of around of Crown land in the area of Little Buffalo, northern Alberta, to the Lubicon Lake Band, and $95 million in financial compensation from the federal government. The province of Alberta is providing an additional $18 million, which will go toward the construction of a new post- secondary school for 682 residents who have long struggled with poverty and substandard housing. There will also be developments on infrastructure like housing, roads, and utility services. ==References== Category:First Nations governments in Alberta Category:Cree governments ","title":"Lubicon Lake Band"},{"id":"61724732","text":"Aristanax ( can refer to a number of people from classical antiquity: * Aristanax, a Platonist who lived in the 2nd century BC, and was the student of Carneades of Cyrene. * Aristanax, a priest of the sun in ancient Berytus in the 2nd century BC. * Aristanax, an ancient Greek physician, of whose life nothing is known, and of whose date it can be positively determined only that, as he is mentioned by Soranus of Ephesus, he must have lived some time in or before the second century AD.Soranus of Ephesus, De Arte Obstetr. p. 201 His most notable theory appears to have been that female children ought to be weaned later than male children. ==References== Category:Ancient Greek physicians Category:2nd-century BC Greek people Category:Middle Platonists ","title":"Aristanax"},{"id":"61724779","text":"Nancy Ann Neudauer is an American mathematician specializing in matroid theory and known for her work in mathematical outreach in Africa and South America.

Designed by William Butterfield, it was built in 1876-78 at the expense of Sir Arthur Elton and has been a Grade II* listed building since 1976. ==History== St John's was built as the parish church of the newly-formed ecclesiastical parish of South Clevedon, which separated from Clevedon in February 1876 as a result of a rapidly growing population. The church and its vicarage was built at the sole expense of Sir Arthur Elton of Clevedon Court and he commissioned William Butterfield to draw up the designs. Elton also provided an annual endowment of ¬£100. The foundation stone was laid by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. Lord Arthur Hervey, on 19 October 1876, and construction was carried out by the contractor, Mr. William Restall of Bisley. While the church was being built, temporary services were held in some adjacent farm buildings, which received the name \\"Barn Church\\". The completed church was consecrated by the Bishop of Bath and Wells on 30 April 1878. Elton also founded St John's National School in 1879. It was rebuilt in 1889, and became a library when a replacement school was opened in 1991. St John's church hall was built in the 1920s. ==Architecture== St John's is built of local stone, with dressings in Bath stone and tiles on the roof, in the Gothic Revival style. It was designed to accommodate 500 persons and made up of a nave, north and south aisles, chancel, north and south transepts, vestry and a south-west tower, with six (originally five) bells. A second vestry and new porch was added in 1883-84. The chancel and nave has a low clerestory with small windows. The flooring is paved with encaustic and plain tiles, and the lower region of the interior walls of the nave and aisles lined with Staffordshire tiles. The chancel's walls and reredos were built using Devonshire and other marbles and Bath stone. The centre of the reredos has a marble cross, surrounded by four Evangelistic emblems. It was obscured by wood panelling until the 1990s. The church's windows have middle pointed tracery and there is a rose window in the north transept. Heaton, Butler and Bayne of London supplied the stained glass of the chancel's five-light window and south transept's east window. The pulpit and choir fittings are made of oak and walnut wood. The organ was built by Henry Willis & Sons and gifted by Mr T. Sheldon. In 1909, the stone arch of the interior was replaced by a girder and iron screen, owing to subsidence issues. The work was carried out by C. S. Hare. ==ReferencesSt. John the Evangelist Church website Category:Churches in Somerset Category:Grade II* listed churches in Somerset Category:Church of England church buildings in Somerset Category:William Butterfield buildings Category:Grade II* listed buildings in North Somerset ","title":"Church of St John the Evangelist, Clevedon"},{"id":"61724997","text":"Give Signs is the third studio album by Australian blues musician Ash Grunwald.

The case established that in \\"determining whether the husband has been guilty of an indictable assault and battery upon his wife, the criterion is the effect produced, and not the manner of producing it or the instrument used.\\" William Henry Malone's Criminal Briefs, published in 1886, describes Justice Reade's opinion in this case to be \\"the most complete and satisfactory to be found in the books.\\" Siegel notes that the decision \\"tacitly incorporates their relative privileges and disabilities under the marital status rules of the common law\\", \\"discusses questions of authority and submission in the affect- based discourses of companionate marriage\\", and asserts \\"that an affectionate wife has the reserves of altruism to forgive her husband's outbursts of violence\\". ==Background== The jury in the case had rendered a special verdict finding that the defendant struck his wife \\"three licks with a switch about the size of one of his fingers (but not as large as a man's thumb) without any provocation except some words uttered by her.\\" ==Ruling== With regard to the wife's behavior that led to the husband's whipping her, the court noted, \\"The witness said there was no provocation except some slight words.

Formally, given a bipartite graph G = (X + Y, E), a Hall-violator in X is a subset W of X, for which NG(W) < W, where NG(W) is the set of neighbors of W in G. If W is a Hall violator, then there is no matching that saturates all vertices of W. Therefore, there is also no matching that saturates X. Hall's marriage theorem says that the opposite is also true: if there is no Hall violator, then there exists a matching that saturates X. == Algorithms == 250x250px === Finding a Hall violator === A Hall violator can be found by an efficient algorithm. The algorithm below uses the following terms: * An M-alternating path, for some matching M, is a path in which the first edge is not an edge of M, the second edge is of M, the third is not of M, etc. * A vertex z is M-reachable from some vertex x, if there is an M-alternating path from x to z. As an example, consider the figure at the right, where the vertical (blue) edges denote the matching M. The vertex sets Y1, X1,Y2, X2, are M-reachable from x0 (or any other vertex of X0), but Y3 and X3 are not M-reachable from x0. The algorithm for finding a Hall violator proceeds as follows. # Find a maximum matching M (it can be found with the Hopcroft‚ÄìKarp algorithm). # If all vertices of X are matched, then return \\"There is no Hall violator\\". # Otherwise, let x0 be an unmatched vertex. # Let W be the set of all vertices of X that are M-reachable from x0 (it can be found using Breadth-first search; in the figure, W contains x0 and X1 and X2). # Return W. This W is indeed a Hall-violator because of the following facts: * All vertices of NG(W) are matched by M. Suppose by contradiction that some vertex y in NG(W) is unmatched by M. Let x be its neighbor in W. The path from x0 to x to y is an M-augmenting path - it is M-alternating and it starts and ends with unmatched vertices, so by \\"inverting\\" it we can increase M, contradicting its maximality. * W contains all the matches of NG(W) by M. This is because all these matches are M-reachable from x0. * W contains another vertex - x0 \\\\- that is unmatched by M by definition. * Hence, W = NG(W) + 1 > NG(W), so W indeed satisfies the definition of a Hall violator. === Finding a minimal Hall violator === A minimal Hall violator is a Hall violator such that each of its subsets is not a Hall violator. The above algorithm, in fact, finds a minimal Hall violator. This is because, if any vertex is removed from W, then the remaining vertices can be perfectly matched to the vertices of NG(W) (either by edges of M, or by edges of the M-alternating path from x0). Note: the above algorithm does not necessarily find a minimum-cardinality Hall violator. For example, in the above figure, it returns a Hall violator of size 5, while X0 is a Hall violator of size 3. === Finding a Hall violator or an augmenting path === The following algorithm takes as input an arbitrary matching M in a graph, and a vertex x0 in X that is not saturated by M. It returns as output, either a Hall violator that contains x0, or a path that can be used to augment M. # Set k = 0, Wk := {x0}, Zk := {}. # Assert: #* Wk = {x0,...,xk} where the xi are distinct vertices of X; #* Zk = {y1,...,yk} where the yi are distinct vertices of Y; #* For all i ‚â• 1, yi is matched to xi by M. #* For all i ‚â• 1, yi is connected to some xj by an edge not in M. # If NG(Wk) ‚äÜ Zk, then Wk is a Hall violator, since Wk = k+1 > k = Zk ‚â• NG(Wk). Return the Hall-violator Wk. # Otherwise, let yk+1 be a vertex in NG(Wk) \\\\ Zk. Consider the following two cases: # Case 1: yk+1 is matched by M. #* Since x0 is unmatched, and every xi in Wk is matched to yi in Zk, the partner of this yk+1 must be some vertex of X that is not in Wk. Denote it by xk+1. #* Let Wk+1 := Wk U {xk+1} and Zk+1 := Zk U {yk+1} and k := k + 1\\\\. #* Go back to step 2. # Case 2: yk+1 is unmatched by M. #* Since yk+1 is in NG(Wk), it is connected to some xi (for i < k + 1) by an edge not in M. xi is connected to yi by an edge in M. yi is connected to some xj (for j < i) by an edge not in M, and so on. Following these connections must eventually lead to x0, which is unmatched. Hence we have an M-augmenting path. Return the M-augmenting path. At each iteration, Wk and Zk grow by one vertex. Hence, the algorithm must finish after at most X iterations. The procedure can be used iteratively: start with M being an empty matching, call the procedure again and again, until either a Hall violator is found, or the matching M saturates all vertices of X. This provides a constructive proof to Hall's theorem. # == External links == * == References == Category:Graph theory ","title":"Hall violator"},{"id":"61725088","text":"Shaun Sanghani (born June 28, 1980) is an American film producer and writer.

Larnach had joined the Bank of New South Wales about 1863 and risen to manager of their Geelong branch at a time when poor communications placed heavy responsibility on branch managers. Larnach was well-connected: his uncle, Donald Larnach, a long time Sydney member of the Bank of New South Wales' board was later chairman of the London board. William Larnach was also a family friend of W. J. T. Clarke, said at that time to be the richest man in Australasia. After the Bank of Otago became the National Bank Larnach was expected to remain with them a further twelve months.Scholefield, G.

He was one of the first artists in Germany to work in the French influenced \\"paysage intime\\" style. == Biography == His father was the lithographer, . His older brother, , also became a lithographer and a writer. In 1852, his family moved to Stuttgart, where his father set up his own lithography business. After completing an apprenticeship in his father's shop, he studied painting at the State Academy of Fine Arts. When his father died in 1864, Otto took over the management of the family business.Beringer: Baisch, Hermann. In: Ulrich Thieme, Felix Becker (Eds.): Allgemeines Lexikon der Bildenden K√ºnstler von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart. Vol.2 pg.376 In 1868, he went to Paris, where he copied the landscape and animal paintings of the Dutch Masters. He also became acquainted with Jules Dupr√©, who introduced him to the Barbizon School and the style known as \\"Paysage intime\\" (intimate landscape). After completing his studies there, he went to Munich and became a student at the private painting school operated by Adolf Lier. Although he graduated in 1873, he remained in Munich until 1880.Leo M√ºlfarth: Kleines Lexikon Karlsruher Maler. Karlsruhe : Badenia-Verlag, 1987, , pgs. 20‚Äì22 In 1875, he married Julie Sch√∂nleber, the sister of Gustav Sch√∂nleber, who had become his friend at Lier's school. He then relocated to Karlsruhe and, in 1881, became a Professor of animal painting at the Grand-Ducal Baden Art School. In order that his students could learn to paint from nature, he built an open-air studio; going so far as to buy a cow and some other small animals. He also took numerous trips to Holland and the Alps to paint landscapes. In the years 1884/85 and 1893/94, he served as Director of the school, which was renamed an \\"Academy\\" in 1892.

The broad-pinnuled version's fronds have rounded ultimate segments while the narrow-pinnuled version has very fine and narrow ultimate segments. == Distribution == Asplenium hookerianum is found in New Zealand (including the Chatham Islands) and Australia. === New Zealand === Found throughout the North and South Islands of New Zealand. Less common in Northland, inland Taranaki, western Waikato, King Country and the West Coast. Its range extends to Stewart Island and the Chatham Islands although it is uncommon. Occurs in lowland and montane forests, on shaded clay banks and rocky outcrops, in shrubland and open forest. May also be found among grass and in open pasture, under pine and macrocarpa trees, and in disturbed forest remnants. In the South Island, it is mostly confined to lowland areas. In the North Island, it can reach altitudes of up to 1375 metres but is less common above 1000 metres on both islands. === Australia === Found in Tasmania and Victoria where an estimated 700 plants live in four wild populations. Little is known about the previous distribution of this species. In Tasmania, it occurs in rainforest, usually on the heavily shaded margins of waterways and vertical banks. It may also be found in sheltered gullies within drier forests. Can also be found growing on the lower trunks of soft tree-ferns. They may reach altitudes of up to 500 metres. In Victoria, it occurs on sheltered rock faces in cracks and crevices under overhangs. They may reach altitudes of up to 1,200 metres. Because of its preference for cold and wet environments, it may be impacted by climate change in the future. == Etymology == First described by Raoul in 1844 as Asplenium adiantoides. This name was disregarded due to conflicting earlier homonyms. It was later described by Colenso in 1845. It was named after British botanist Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker. == Lifecycle == Asplenium hookerianum produces spores that are dispersed by wind. == Conservation == In New Zealand, A. hookerianum is listed as Not Threatened. In Tasmania, it is listed as Endangered. In Victoria, it is listed as Vulnerable. Not much is known about the threats to A. hookerianum. Intensive farming, forestry, and cliff-based recreational activities such as abseiling and rock climbing may have some impact. == Cultivation == Asplenium hookerianum is easily grown and makes a good pot plant, though it is slow growing. It is prone to scale and mealy bug infestations. It is not commercially available. == References == hookerianum Category:Flora of Australasia Category:Taxa named by William Colenso Category:Plants described in 1845 ","title":"Asplenium hookerianum"},{"id":"61725196","text":"Jackie Gowler (born 7 June 1996) is a New Zealand representative rower.

Born in Morunglav, Romana»õi County in 1868, his parents were Dumitrache and Nicoli»õa Ioan; the surname Dumitrescu was adopted later. His father was possibly of Greek origin. The future general was nicknamed ‚ÄúTurcu‚Äù (‚Äúthe Turk‚Äù) because he was intransigent and did not accept to be contradicted. In 1887, he entered the school for soldiers‚Äô sons in Craiova, entering the officers‚Äô school in 1890. He graduated in 1892 as a second lieutenant. The same year, he was assigned to the Rovine Regiment, serving there until 1896, when he was promoted to lieutenant. In 1897, he married Elena DƒÉbuleanu. His regimental service was interrupted in 1900‚Äì1901, when he was assigned to the soldiers‚Äô sons‚Äô school. In 1904, he became a captain, and was promoted to major in 1911, and to lieutenant colonel in early 1916. Soon after Romania's entry into World War I he fought with bravery in September 2016 at the Battle of Turtucaia, and in October at the First Battle of the Jiu Valley. He was promoted to colonel afterward, and in September 1917, he was named brigadier general and put in command of the 22nd Infantry Brigade. Romanian Army operations in the Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War in April 1919 Dumitrescu played an important role in the Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War. On April 18, 1919, he was appointed commanding officer of the 7th Division, replacing General . Starting a few days earlier from its positions around ZalƒÉu, the 7th Division attacked towards Carei and Oradea, then occupied Debrecen, after which it marched on to Karcag and Tiszaf√ºred. On July 19, General Gheorghe MƒÉrdƒÉrescu, the commander of the Romanian Army in Transylvania, put Dumitrescu in charge of the front line in the Madaras sector. Together with the forces of Generals (in charge of the Fegyvernek sector) and Traian Mo»ôoiu (in charge of the T√∂r√∂kszentmikl√≥s sector), Dumitrescu's troops crossed the Tisza River at Kisk√∂re on July 31, and eventually reached Budapest at the beginning of August. In October 1920 Dumitrescu was put in command of the 11th Division. Named major general in March 1924, he assumed the next month command of the 1st Army Corps. He entered the reserves in October 1929, and died in Craiova in 1935. His awards include the Order of the Crown (1910, 1919, 1924, the latter of the grand officer rank), the Order of the Star of Romania (1917, 1922, 1928, the latter of the grand officer rank) and the Czechoslovak War Cross 1918 (1928). ==Notes== Category:1868 births Category:1935 deaths Category:People from Olt County Category:Romanian Land Forces generals Category:Romanian Army World War I generals Category:Romanian people of the Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian War Category:Grand Officers of the Order of the Star of Romania Category:Grand Officers of the Order of the Crown (Romania) Category:Recipients of the Czechoslovak War Cross ","title":"Constantin Dumitrescu (general)"},{"id":"61725227","text":"Adhyarathri () is a 2019 Indian Malayalam-language comedy film directed by Jibu Jacob, written by Sharis Mohammed and Jebin Joseph Anthony, produced and distributed by Central Pictures.

It is endemic to Tanzania. ==Description== Nothobranchius lucius is a relatively large species of killifish and can be distinguished from the closely related N. melanospilus and N. makondorum, by its comparatively longer head, with a longer snout apparent in both males and females with the males having a thinner body. The snout is pointed with a subterminal mouth which faces slightly upwards. The dorsal profile is slightly concave on head and also concave from the nape to the posterior end of the dorsal fin; the caudal peduncle has a straight profile both dorsally and ventrally. Compared to many species in the genus Nothobranchius, N. lucius is rather dull in colour although an identifying mark is the presence of an orange line before the black margin of the caudal fin. ==Distribution== Nothobranchius lucius is found in a small area in southern central Tanzania, between Ifakara and the Kilombero river ferry. It appears to be replaced by the similar N. melanospilus to the east and by N. makondorum to the south of its range. ==Habitat and biology== Nothobranchius lucius is found in seasonal pools and marshes where it reproduces in the wet season and the eggs enter diapause to hatch the following season. It is a predatory species and swallows smaller fishes whole. ==Naming== Nothobranchius lucius was described in 2009 by Rudolf Hans Wildekamp, Konstantin Mikhailovich Shidlovskiy and Brian R. Watters with the type locality given as being a large pool on west side of road between Ifakara and the Kilombero River ferry, two kilometres south of Ifakara and one kilometre north of Kilombero River. The specific name lucius is Latin for a pike, a reference to this species strong teeth, predatory habits and somewhat pike-like appearance. ==Uses== This species is known in the aquarium trade where it is often known as the pike nothobranch and was called N. sp aff melanospilis before its formal description in 2009. ==References== lucius Category:Fish described in 2009 ","title":"Nothobranchius lucius"},{"id":"61725393","text":"Li Xinyi may refer to: * Li Xinyi (singer) (born 1998), Chinese singer and songwriter * Li Xinyi (tennis) (born 1962), Chinese tennis player ","title":"Li Xinyi"},{"id":"61725399","text":"Azolla rubra, known commonly as red azolla and Pacific azolla is a species of fern native to Australia and New Zealand.

The county hall, which is the headquarters of Kent County Council, is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The Sessions House, designed by Sir Robert Smirke, which can still be seen through the stone archway of the 1913 facade The original Sessions House, which was designed by Sir Robert Smirke in the Greek Revival style, was completed in 1824. The original design involved a symmetrical main frontage facing south west; the central section of three bays featured an arched doorway with a fanlight flanked by two narrow windows and there was a triple window on the first floor; the end bays of the central section slightly projected forwards. The building was initially used as a facility for dispensing justice but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the offices and meeting place for Kent County Council. Internally, the principal room in the Sessions House was the council chamber. The construction of a fa√ßade, designed by the county architect, F. W. Ruck, in the neo-baroque style, was completed in November 1913. The design of the facade involved a symmetrical main frontage of nine bays facing south west; the central section of three bays featured a large stone archway with iron gates on the ground floor; there was a triple window on the first floor and two sash windows on the second floor with pairs of huge Ionic order columns flanking the windows on the second and third floors supporting a pediment above. A further extension was added in the 1930s. Invicta House, a six-storey hexagonal building was built adjacent to County Hall in order to create extra accommodation capacity in the 1960s. The Centre for Kentish Studies, established at County Hall in 1933, relocated to the new Kent History and Library Centre in James Whatman Way, which also incorporated the town's former Central Library, in April 2012. In March 2020 the county council announced that it was considering leaving the building and moving to alternative premises which would be less costly to maintain. Works of art in the county hall include a portrait of the Deputy Lieutenant of Kent, Lionel Sackville- West, 3rd Baron Sackville, by John St Helier Lander and a portrait of the Governor of Bombay, George Harris, 4th Baron Harris, by Hubert von Herkomer. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in Kent M Category:Government buildings completed in 1824 ","title":"County Hall, Maidstone"},{"id":"61725478","text":"Diploblechnum fraseri, synonym Blechnum fraseri, known commonly as the miniature tree fern and by its MƒÅori name maukurangi, is a species of fern in the family Blechnaceae native to New Zealand, Malesia and Taiwan. == Distribution == Diploblechnum fraseri is found in New Zealand, Malesia and Taiwan. === New Zealand === Its North Island range spans from Te Paki in Northland to near Mokau in Waikato.

Initially unpaid, his roles were minor but demanded stage presence; the young actor was tall, spoke clearly and looked well in formal costume. Likely due to the insignificance of his roles, Mavrodi emerged as a malcontent, ready to defend perceived victims of injustice, particularly actresses ‚Äúinsulted‚Äù by directors. He would respond to personal slights by recruiting seconds and asking for a duel. After leaving Ia»ôi, he went to Paris, where he studied journalism for two years on a scholarship. Returning to Romania and moving to Bucharest, he briefly worked as a political reporter at AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa.

Although a general surgeon, he developed a special interest in the diagnosis and treatment of eye disease. He translated into English three major works of the Italian anatomist and surgeon Antonio Scarpa. With John Argyll Robertson, Wishart jointly founded the Edinburgh Eye Dispensary. He was surgeon in Scotland to King George IV and served as President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from 1820 to 1822. == Early life == Wishart was born near Kirkliston, West Lothian on 19 March 1781.\\"Scotland Births and Baptisms, 1564‚Äì1950,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XTG2-Y4V+:+10+February+2018), John Henry Wishart, 19 March 1781; citing , reference 2:17ZW503 His father, William Thomas Wishart (27 Feb 1746 ‚Äì 1799) owned the estate of Foxhall, Kirkliston in West Lothian, Scotland (formerly known as Todshaugh). His mother was Ann Balfour (b 28 June 1743). Wishart's paternal grandfather and great- grandfather, both named William Wishart, were Principals of the University of Edinburgh. Wishart went to school at the Royal High School of Edinburgh where a fellow pupil was James Wardrop. who would become a lifelong friend and colleague. At school Wishart won the Murray Medal for Latin in 1795. In 1797, at the age of sixteen, he matriculated as a student at the University of Edinburgh to study medicine but, as was common at that time, did not graduate. He served a surgical apprenticeship with the Edinburgh surgical partnership of Benjamin Bell (1749‚Äì1806), James Russell (1754‚Äì1836) and Andrew Wardrop (died 1823). This was regarded at the time as the leading surgical practice in Scotland with a wide referral base. == Career == 34 York Place in Edinburgh In 1805 Wishart qualified as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh with a probationary essay entitled Ophthalmia., which he dedicated to Professor James Russell. In this he gave accounts of conditions which caused inflammation of the eye, such as conjunctivitis which had increased incidence, partly as a result of trachoma which had been introduced into the population of Britain by soldiers returning from Egypt and Spain during the Napoleonic wars. Having decided to develop a special interest in ophthalmology, Wishart visited European centres to learn from some of the leading ophthalmic specialists. Accompanied by James Wardrop his friend from schooldays he studied under Georg Joseph Beer in Vienna. On his return to Edinburgh he set up practice at No 5 Nicolson Square. At this stage of his career he combined general surgery with ophthalmology. He translated into English two major works by the Italian anatomist and surgeon Antonio Scarpa, Wishart added his own notes and comments to the English edition of Scarpa's Treatise on Aneurism. He dedicated this to Professor John Thomson. He later translated Scarpa's Treatise on Hernia and dedicated this to his colleague James Wardrop. He was appointed surgeon-in-ordinary to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in 1803 and became assistant surgeon in 1818, acting surgeon in 1820 and consulting surgeon in 1824. He retired from the Infirmary staff in 1828. In addition to his Infirmary practice Wishart worked at the Public Dispensary in Richmond Street. In 1822 with his former apprentice John Argyll Robertson he founded the Edinburgh Eye Dispensary in the Lawnmarket. This was the first specialist eye hospital in Scotland, and served the sick poor as well as being a place for the teaching of medical students. He was elected president of Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1820. During his presidency John Barclay offered to the College his large collection of specimens on condition that a suitable building was obtained to house them. This resulted in the construction of the present College building in Nicolson Street, completed in 1832. === First description of type 2 neurofibromatosis === Wishart published widely on ophthalmic topics. In 1822 he published a Case of Tumours in the Skull, Dura Mater, and Brain. This is regarded as the first publication in English in which the clinical features and macroscopic post-mortem appearances of Type 2 neurofibromatosis are described. In this paper Wishart gives an account of a 21 year old individual who presented with increasing deafness affecting one then both ears. In addition he had a long-standing blindness in one eye. Examination showed a small palpable tumour on the occipital region. Over the next few months the symptoms worsened and the tumour grew in size. After consulting his physician colleague Dr John Abercrombie, who worked alongside him at the Royal Public dispensary, he dissected the tumour and established that it arose from the dura mater and was therefore not amenable to excision. The patient died two weeks later. At post mortem there were multiple small tumours arising from the dura mater and also from the cranial nerves. Tumours arose from the optic nerve accounting for the blindness and from both eighth cranial nerves accounting for the deafness. === Enucleation of the eye for tumour === He wrote one of the first accounts of a successful enucleation of the eye for tumour. In this work he describes the clinical features of an eye tumour in a nine-year-old boy. The enucleation was performed in four minutes and the patient 'bore the operation uncommonly well.' Wishart reported that the child was free of recurrence and symptom free eighteen months later. Wishart called the tumour fungus haematodes. From the features he describes (child with watery inflamed eye, unreactive pupil, cloudy white exudate in posterior chamber and lesion arising from the retina), it has been interpreted as representing a retinoblastoma, for which enucleation was, and remained the only treatment offering the prospect of a cure. == Later life == Wishart continued to take an interest in other aspects of surgery and in 1818 he translated Scarpa's Memoir on the congenital club feet of children from the Italian. In 1821 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposer was James Russell. He died at home, 34 York Place, on 9 June 1834. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in the sealed section known as the Covenanters Prison. == Family == He married Louisa Melville Wilson (born 1790), daughter of Major James Wilson of the Royal Artillery. They had five daughters and three sons. Their second son, James Alexander Wishart (1822‚Äì1855) became a doctor, graduating MD from the University of Edinburgh in 1843 with a thesis on cataract. He is buried in the family grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard. == Legacy == Wishart's name is given to one of the two forms of type 2 neurofibromatosis, the Wishart phenotype, which is seen in young people and characterised by multiple rapidly growing cerebral tumours. == Selected publications == *A Probationary Surgical Essay on Ophthalmia (1805) *A Treatise on Aneurism (an English translation of the work of Antonio Scarpa) *A Treatise on Hernia (an English translation of the work of Antonio Scarpa) *A memoir on the congenital club feet of children and on the mode of correcting that deformity (an English translation of the work of Antonio Scarpa) == References == Category:1781 births Category:1834 deaths Category:People from West Lothian Category:People educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh Category:Scottish surgeons Category:British ophthalmologists Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh Category:Presidents of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ","title":"John Henry Wishart"},{"id":"61725770","text":"Cosmin Pascari (born 12 May 1998) is a Romanian rower.

In addition, he advocated amnesty for the war prisoners and personally helped many priests and others to be released from detention camps.Akmad≈æa, Miroslav, Odnosi dr≈æave i Katoliƒçke crkve u Hrvatskoj od 1945. do 1953. god., Zagreb, 2001, p. 30 Rittig pointed out that the vast majority of the Catholic bishops accepted the new government, but that they were confused and distrustful because it unlawfully interfered with religious freedom.Benigar, Aleksa: Alojzije Stepinac - hrvatski kardinal, Zagreb 1993, p. 365 During the trial of Archbishop Stepinac, Rittig's letter from 1942, in which he praised Stepinac for his \\"hard work and martyrdom, sacrifice to the whole nation and the clergy, and charitable assistance to the Polish refugees and the hungry orphans\\" was read.≈†tambuk-≈†kaliƒá, Marina: Dokumenti obrane u sudskom procesu protiv nadbiskupa Alojzija Stepinca, Izvori za hrvatsku povijest 2, Zagreb, 1996, p. 295 In another letter written to the vice president of the Czechoslovakian Government, he wrote that \\"Archbishop Stepinac is not guilty\\", but still, as a staunch supporter of Slavic unity, defended the Yugoslav government despite acknowledging that \\"the Croatian priesthood is going through the most difficult time in its life and in the history of its Church.\\" Rittig heavily criticized capitalism.Croatian State Archives, OF Rittig, B. 12 During his term as a member of the Yugoslav Constitutional Assembly, Federal Assembly, and the Croatian Parliament he advocated the separation of church and state, but also greater rights for the Catholic Church and recognition of church marriages, but his proposals were rejected.Akmad≈æa, Miroslav, Odnosi dr≈æave i Katoliƒçke crkve u Hrvatskoj od 1945. do 1953. god., Zagreb, 2001, p. 57‚Äì58 Rittig retired in 1954.

A typesetter by trade, Rokhi served two years in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and was demobilized after being found unfit for service. He resumed work as a typesetter and held positions in printers' unions before being mobilized for Red Army service in 1919 during the Russian Civil War, serving as a political commissar. Decorated with the Order of the Red Banner for his leadership during the Red Army invasion of Georgia, Rokhi continued to serve as a division and corps commissar after the end of the war. In the late 1920s he held command of military schools and in 1932 became commander of the 34th Rifle Division, his last command before being arrested and executed during the Great Purge. == Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War == Rokhi was born during September 1892 in the Paltmale manor in the Governorate of Livonia in the family of a gardener. He graduated from primary school in 1906 and a Riga trade school in 1912, and began working in a printing house at the age of sixteen while a student in Riga. Rokhi became a typesetter after graduating from the trade school and continued working at a printing house in Riga. Drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in July 1914 when World War I began, he served as a private, first at the Grodno Fortress between 1914 and 1915 and then with the 176th Reserve Regiment in 1916. Rokhi was shell-shocked during the fighting and was demobilized in 1916 as a private after being found unfit for further service. Later that year, he worked as a typesetter in Vitebsk, being elected secretary of the board of the health fund and a board member of the city printer's union. In 1917, he continued as a typesetter, now in the printing house of Pravda in Petrograd. Following the February Revolution, Rokhi joined the Communist Party in July of that year. Between 1918 and 1919 Rokhi was a board member of the Petrograd Printers' Union, chairman of the printing department of the Petrograd Economic Council, and member and secretary of the central committee of the All-Russian Printing Industry Union. In February 1919 he helped organize the Vilna Military Revolutionary Committee. He then served as an agitator in the Riga Red Guard regiment, later becoming its political commissar. Mobilized for Red Army service in October of the latter year during the Russian Civil War, Rokhi became chief of the political department of the 1st Moscow Cavalry Division, serving as division political commissar between July and December 1920. During 1921 and 1922 he was commissar of the 12th and 18th Cavalry Divisions and then the Separate Caucasian Cavalry Brigade. Rokhi was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 8 December 1922 for his personal leadership of the vanguard of the 12th and 18th Divisions on 16 February near Krasny Most and on 28 February near Khetistavi, \\"contributing to success in these sectors of the front,\\" during the Red Army invasion of Georgia in February 1921. == Interwar period == After the end of the Russian Civil War, Rokhi became chief of the political department of the 13th Rifle Corps in November 1922. During the suppression of the Basmachi movement, he served as commissar of the 2nd Separate Turkestan Cavalry Brigade from April 1923, and between April and June 1924 as a commissar of the 2nd Turkestan Rifle Division, member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Fergana Group of Forces of the Turkestan Front, and as commissar of the 11th Gomel Cavalry Division. Rokhi transferred to serve in the same position with the 7th Samara Cavalry Division in June 1924 and in November of that year became commissar of the 5th Rifle Corps. He became chief of the distribution section of the organizational and distribution department of the Red Army Political Directorate in February 1925, before graduating from Commanders' Improvement Courses (KUVNAS) at the Frunze Military Academy in the following year. Upon graduation, Rokhi was appointed chief of the Military- Political School of the Ukrainian Military District. He transferred to become assistant commander of the 1st Rifle Corps for political affairs in January 1928, and a year later became chief and commissar of the Leningrad Infantry School. He studied at the Frunze Academy between 1930 and 1932 as a member of the first class of the advanced Special Group of the academy. Upon graduation, Rokhi became commander of the 34th Middle Volga Rifle Division, his final assignment. The division was transferred to the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army in 1934. He received the rank of Komdiv in 1935 when the Red Army introduced personal ranks, and in 1936 was awarded the Order of Lenin. Just before the Great Purge reached the army, People's Commissar of Defense Kliment Voroshilov wrote a letter to Rokhi on 5 May 1937, admonishing him for lapses in discipline in the division, awaiting \\"detailed explanations on...how exactly you could allow such disgracefulness and what exactly you will do in the future to avoid a recurrence of such shameful phenomena.\\" In his reply on 7 June, Rokhi stated that \\"I deserve this punishment...I will do my best to make amends with even more energetic work.\\" Rokhi was arrested on 2 July as a participant in a nonexistent Latvian fascist organization, less than a month later, and was sentenced to death by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union on 9 April 1938, charged with participation in a military conspiracy. Rokhi was shot in Khabarovsk on the same day, being buried there. He was posthumously pardoned on 31 October 1956 as part of de- Stalinization. == References == === Citations === === Bibliography === * * * Category:1892 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Soviet komdivs Category:People from Vidzeme Category:People from the Governorate of Livonia Category:Great Purge victims from Latvia Category:Soviet rehabilitations Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner Category:Russian military personnel of World War I Category:Imperial Russian Army personnel Category:Soviet military personnel of the Russian Civil War Category:Communist Party of the Soviet Union members Category:Frunze Military Academy alumni Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Latvian communists ","title":"Vilyam Rokhi"},{"id":"61726137","text":"Lilian Ajio (born 6 December 1984) is an Ugandan netball player who represents Uganda internationally and plays in the position of goal defense.

It is the headquarters of Leicestershire County Council. ==History== In the first half of the 20th century meetings of Leicestershire County Council were held at the Assembly Rooms in Hotel Street, Leicester while County Offices were established at No.1 Grey Friars in Leicester in 1936. After deciding that this arrangement was inadequate for their needs, county leaders chose to procure a new county headquarters: the site they selected at Glenfield had previously been open land which they considered was a more economical solution than a city centre site. Construction on the new building began in spring 1965. It was designed by the in-house architectural team in the Brutalist style, was built at a cost of ¬£1.4 million and was completed in November 1967. The design for the five-storey building involved continuous bands of glazing with concrete panelling above and below: a concrete mural depicting the River Soar by Tony Hollaway was unveiled at that time. An extension to accommodate a computer suite opened in 1970 and the Rutland Building extension was completed in 1974. The principal room was the council chamber which was panelled with Japanese teak and Bombay rosewood. Queen Elizabeth II made an official visit to County Hall during a tour of Leicestershire on 17 November 1989. A memorial to commemorate local people from the county who had died since the Second World War was unveiled on 9 November 2012: the memorial, entitled \\"Stand Easy\\", was designed by Kenny Hunter from Glasgow and comprised four bronze statues which were modelled on soldiers from Welbeck Defence Sixth Form College. Works of art in the building include a painting by John Ferneley depicting the Melton Mowbray Horse Fair. The building also contains a large collection of modern art collected by a former Director of Education, Stewart C. Mason.

The Film Stage, September 7, 2019. The film was shot in various real training facilities of the European Space Agency. ==Summary== Sarah (Eva Green) is a French woman who has spent her entire life, since infancy, training to be an astronaut. She learns that she is a late, last minute addition to the Proxima crew to Mars, the first humans who will lose sight of Earth. While Sarah is thrilled to be going she struggles with leaving Stella, her young daughter for whom she is the primary caregiver after separating from her spouse, Thomas. Despite her worries, she leaves Stella with Thomas and prepares for her mission. In addition to being a late comer to the mission Sarah is also the only woman on the Mars crew. She is met with open hostility by the American captain, Mike, who lets her know that he prefers the male substitute training to be her replacement. However Sarah gradually wins his respect as he watches her determination while training. During training Stella is allowed to visit Sarah once. Sarah insists that special allowances be made to accommodate her daughter and allow them more time together. While the meeting initially goes well it ends badly as Stella becomes anxious and bored and runs away, once again causing friction between Sarah and Mike, who berates Sarah for her actions. The following day Stella leaves while Sarah is still sleeping. Increasingly struggling with the emotional toll of leaving, Stella is surprised when Mike attempts to cheer her up, telling her that it is impossible to be a perfect mother or astronaut and they are only human. Later, at the last meeting before Sarah and the other astronauts go into a two week quarantine before leaving for space Sarah is devastated when Stella and Thomas miss their flight and her last opportunity to see her daughter in person before leaving earth. Sarah and Stella are able to see each other a final time, but this time it is between a pane of glass as Sarah is in quarantine. Stella reminds her mother that she promised they would be able to see the rocket she was leaving on together but Sarah broke her promise. A devastated Sarah sneaks out of quarantine and awakens Stella and takes her to see the rocket early in the morning. That evening the rocket launches with Sarah onboard with a picture of Stella by her side.

They remained close throughout Burt's life; Foster was sole executor of Burt's estate in 1805, and Burt's will left \\". . . to my trusty friend Joseph Foster of Boston, Goldsmith one hundred dollars.\\" He worked circa 1781-1830 as a silversmith in Boston, with a shop on Ann Street and later on Fish Street near Burt. Foster was recalled by Colonel Henry Lee in 1881 as follows: \\"An anxious visit of inquiry to 'honest Foster', the silversmith, who, in his long coat, knee-breeches and silver buckles, dwelt with his spinster sister in an impracticably low-jettied house, one step below the narrow sidewalk, and, as old-fashioned housekeepers believed, beat his silver to a superior whiteness\\". Foster's mark appears on a considerable quantity of Boston-area church plate. His work is collected in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and Yale University Art Gallery. == References == * \\"Joseph Foster\\", American Silversmiths (Ware birth). * \\"Joseph Foster\\", American Silversmiths (Boston birth). * Early American Silver in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Beth Carver Wees, Medill Higgins Harvey, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2013, page 30. * American Church Silver of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries: With a Few Pieces of Domestic Plate, Exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts, July to December, 1911, Museum of Fine Arts, 1911, pages 57-58. * American Silversmiths and Their Marks: The Definitive (1948) Edition, Stephen Guernsey Cook Ensko, Courier Corporation, 1983, page 193. * Sterling Flatware Fashions * Ware Vital Records Category:American silversmiths Category:1759 births Category:1839 deaths ","title":"Joseph Foster (silversmith)"},{"id":"61726418","text":"Socalchemmis dolichopus is a species of araneomorphae spider of the family Zoropsidae. == Distribution == The species is endemic to California in the United States.

The body of these large owlflies is black, quite hairy, with some yellow markings. Also the head is black, with large compound eyes. The long sturdy black antennae are clubbed. The wings do not have scales, are partly transparent and show a network of translucent lemon yellow ribs. In the fore wings appears a small basal dark spot reaching the base of the wings.D.

This species is rather similar to Libelloides coccajus, but in Libelloides longicornis the basal black area of the hind wings does not reach the anal angle. ==Biology== Adults can be encountered from June through August. They are diurnal predators of other small flying insects. Usually they fly between 2 meters and 3 meters high to catch their prey, preferably hunted under bright light conditions. The mating usually takes place in the late morning or at noon, when these insects are warmed by the sun. The male grabs after a short fight the female with the pincers located at the top of the abdomen. The females then lay their white eggs on stems of herbaceous plants in closely spaced double rows. Larvae resemble those of antlions, but they do not dig cavities in the ground.D. Badano & R.A. Pantaleoni, The larvae of European Ascalaphidae (Neuroptera) ==Bibliography== *Aistleitner, E.

The series has been collected in two tank≈çbon volumes. A series of two Drama CDs have also been released. ==Plot== Futoshi Mishima, a student at a high school in the countryside, is bullied by his classmates. The reason is that he is seemingly gay. In reality, Mishima does like guys so he does not resist their bullying, and instead, finds solace in secretly cross-dressing. One day on the rooftop of the school, Mishima finds the lipstick he had lost before in the hands of Makoto Kirino, one of the bullies. Kirino was about to put on the lipstick that Mishima used on his own lips. This is the story of these two young boys looking for a place they can really be themselves. ==Characters== ; ::Mishima is a high school student who lives in a rural area with his single mother; his father died before he was born. At school he doesn't have any friends and is bullied for appearing to be gay. While he doesn't openly agree to it, he does like men. He enjoys cross dressing, although he doesn't have the means to do so, he usually just applies lipstick. ; ::One of the bullies who harassed Mishima alongside Yumeno. He secretly ends up becoming Mishima's friend after the last discovers that, just like him, Kirino is gay and likes cross dressing. Kirino has hidden this side of him because of his conservative mother, who cannot accept the true nature of her son. ; ::Kirino's friend and classmate, with whom he constantly used to harass Mishima. Yumeno says he hates Mishima, but in reality, he is in love with him and his harassment was only the result of his own conflicted feelings. ; ::Mishima, Kirino, and Yumeno's teacher.

Initially coming to attention as a country blues performer, his later work also straddles jazz, Polynesian, ambient, and various experimental and improvisational styles. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Mike Cooper was born in Reading, Berkshire. After spending several years as a child in Australia, he returned to England. He started playing guitar after leaving school aged 16, and became involved in local skiffle groups. Having spent time at local jazz clubs, in 1961 he saw Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee play with Terry Lightfoot, and harmonica player James Cotton playing with Chris Barber's band at the Beaulieu Jazz Festival. Inspired by Alexis Korner, he formed an R&B; band, the Blues Committee, in which he was the lead singer. The band supported visiting blues musicians including John Lee Hooker, Jimmy Reed, and Sonny Boy Williamson. With changes in line-up, from 1964 the Blues Committee diversified into modern jazz as well as R&B.; Cooper also played as a solo act in folk clubs around Reading, performing country blues and folk music, Biography by Thom Jurek, Allmusic.com.

Retrieved 7 September 2019 After meeting such musicians as Martin Carthy, Leon Rosselson and Don Partridge, he began playing in London clubs, and appeared briefly as a guitar player in the 1963 film That Kind of Girl. He bought a 1932 National resophonic guitar, and learned to play Blind Boy Fuller's repertoire of songs, gradually acquiring his own style and learning to play lap steel guitar with a miniature whiskey bottle. \\"Mike Cooper ‚Äì A Biography\\", Cooparia.com. Retrieved 4 September 2019 ===Early career=== In 1965 Cooper turned professional, and played regular gigs in and around Reading. He met virtuoso guitarist Derek Hall, and they established a shared residency at the Shades coffee house in Reading, hosting visiting artists such as John Renbourn, Bert Jansch, Davey Graham, Al Stewart and others. With Hall, Cooper recorded a limited edition EP, Out of the Shades, on the local Kennet record label, comprising a mixture of country blues and other tunes. After Hall moved away, Cooper teamed up with harmonica player Jerry Kingett and recorded an unreleased album in the Netherlands. Cooper continued to perform as a solo act, touring widely in the UK and Europe. In 1968, he recorded another EP, Up the Country Blues, for the Saydisc label in Bristol, with liner notes by his friend Ian A. Anderson. Liner notes by Ian A. Anderson, Up the Country Blues, 45cat.com. Retrieved 7 September 2019 Cooper and Anderson appeared, with fellow acoustic blues musicians Jo Ann and Dave Kelly, on the album Blues Like Showers of Rain, and Cooper and Anderson also shared the LP The Inverted World, both albums released on the Matchbox label. Cooper continued to develop his playing style, and performed around Britain in clubs and at festivals. In 1968 he signed a recording contract offered by record producer Peter Eden at Pye Records, and at the end of the year recorded the album Oh Really!?. Apart from one song each by Blind Boy Fuller and Son House, all the tracks were written by Cooper. The album was performed as acoustic blues, with Cooper heavily influenced by Mississippi Fred McDowell, with whom he performed. Increasingly Cooper developed his own eclectic approach following his exposure to a wider range of music, especially jazz, at festivals where he performed. His second album, Do I Know You?, on Pye's subsidiary Dawn label, featured the bass playing of jazz musician Harry Miller, as well as field recordings, and was followed by his 1970 album Trout Steel, featuring a wider range of musicians including Mike Osborne, Alan Skidmore and John Taylor, as well as Harry Miller, Stefan Grossman, and the folk-rock band Heron. The album is considered \\"one of his most enduring and influential recordings.\\" His next album, Places I Know, was originally intended as a double album, with one LP of blues recordings and the other covering jazz and rock, but was released as a single album credited to Mike Cooper with the Machine Gun Co. and Michael Gibbs. In 1972, he released The Machine Gun Co. with Mike Cooper, a band album on which the other members were Geoff Hawkins (saxophone), Alan Cook (keyboards), Les Calvert (bass) and Tim Richardson (percussion). He was encouraged by music executive Tony Hall to make what became his final album of the decade, Life & Death in Paradise. It was released in 1974 and featured drummer Louis Moholo. In 1977, two of his tracks were included on Stefan Grossman's album Country Blues Guitar Festival which also featured Son House and Jo Ann Kelly. ===Stylistic diversification and later career=== Cooper continued to perform and tour in the UK and Europe, often collaborating with jazz musicians. He later said of the period, \\"I left behind the safe shores of melody and conventional harmony and headed out into the sea of timbre.\\" Interview: Mike Cooper, M-magazine, 14 October 2015. Retrieved 7 September 2019 The album 'Ave They Started Yet? recorded a collaboration with dancer Joanna Pyne on a tour in Europe in early 1980. The same year, he recorded a live album in Berlin with free jazz musicians David Holland and Lol Coxhill (credited as \\"The Johnny Rondo Duo\\"). He also played in G.T. Moore's reggae band the Outsiders; experimental band The Mayhem Quartet; the \\"no wave\\" jazz group Beating Time; the band Avant Roots, playing a mixture of Greek rembetika and improvised music; acoustic country blues band National Gallery; and electric blues band Continental Drift. In 1985, he recorded The Continuous Preaching Blues with Ian A. Anderson. He also recorded with Lol Coxhill and percussionist Roger Turner as The Recedents. Cooper became increasingly influenced by Polynesian slack key guitar styles, and in 1987 recorded an album, Aveklei Uptowns Hawaiians, with French slide guitarist Cyrille Lefebvre and other musicians including Lol Coxhill. He has continued to record in a unique style that he has called \\"ambient electronic exotica\\". From 1986 to 1996, he performed around Europe (Italy/Germany/Switzerland) with a four piece country blues band called \\"National Gallery - featuring Mark Makin, Michael Messer and Ed Genis. They performed around various festivals and appeared on Paul Jones Blues show on BBC Radio 2. They also appeared on Rai Uno TV in Italy. A CD featuring half of the band (Cooper/Makin) was issued on Rhiannon records called \\"National Gallery - Keep It Clean\\". Living in Rome, in 1999 he set up his own Hipshot label to release his recordings, and his subsequent releases have been prolific. Some of his albums include looped samples of music recorded in the Pacific, New Guinea, Australia, and elsewhere, often treated electronically. His later releases have included Rayon Hula (2004), which incorporates samples of exotica musician Arthur Lyman, White Shadows in the South Seas (2013), and New Globe Notes (2014). Cooper has also written and performed scores for silent films played at festivals around the world. He has also written extensively on Hawaiian slack key guitar styles and performers. ===Reissues=== His early 1970s albums Trout Steel, Places I Know, and The Machine Gun Co. with Mike Cooper have been reissued on CD. ==Discography== ===Solo albums=== * Oh Really!?

Though born in Syracuse, New York, Highgate's work with the American Missionary Association brought her south to teach freed slaves in locations such as Norfolk, Virginia and New Orleans, Louisiana. Highgate's writings for the Christian Recorder establish her as an early representation of the intersection of Protestantism and Black transcendentalism. == Early life == Edmonia Highgate was born in Syracuse, New York on June 21, 1844 as the first of Charles and Hannah Francis Highgate's seven children. Charles Highgate was a barber, and the family also rented out rooms, allowing them to support the education of their children. Edmonia Highgate received a teaching certificate from the Syracuse Board of Education after graduating from Syracuse High School in 1861, the only African American in her graduating class. She was influenced by her family's involvement with Plymouth Congregational Church, as well as their friendships with notable abolitionists and transcendentalists. == Career == === Travels: North and South === After the death of her father in May 1861, Highgate moved to Binghamton New York, where she became a school principal at nineteen years old. Three years later, Highgate transferred to an American Missionary Association school in Norfolk, Virginia. Though she taught at this school for freed slaves for less than a year, the relationships she formed with her fellow teachers as well as the students who experienced slavery changed Highgate profoundly. After leaving the school for mental health reasons, Highgate called her time at the Norfolk school \\"the most earnest months of my existence.\\" Highgate returned to Syracuse, New York in October of 1864, and gave a notable address to the National Convention of Colored Men. At the convention, Highgate was one of only two women who spoke, and was praised by the president of the convention, Frederick Douglass. In March of 1865, Highgate started a school for the newly freed in Darlington, Maryland. There, she wrote several letters that were published by the African Methodist Episcopal Church's Christian Recorder. These works include \\"Salvation Only in Work\\" and \\"Waiting for the Cars,\\" both written in February of 1865, as well as \\"A Stray Waif from the Port of Grace,\\" written in April of 1865. In May of 1865, Highgate published \\"Congojoco,\\" a serialized work of three installments including both fiction and nonfiction. The last installment, titled \\"A Spring Day Up the James,\\" was partially inspired by the death of her brother Charlie in battle. In 1866, Highgate moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, where she and her sister Caroline both worked as educators. In their time outside of the schoolhouse, the Highgate sisters visited African American victims of white violence in hospitals and helped to found the Louisiana Educational Relief Association, an organization for the advancement of black education. Highgate's writings in New Orleans emphasize the racial tensions of Reconstruction, particularly the race riots in the summer of 1866. === New Orleans Massacre === On July 30, 1866, 25 White Radical Republicans came together to protest the passing of Black Codes in Louisiana specifically the lack of black suffrage from the codes. They met at the Louisiana Constitutional Convention joined in support by over 200 African American Veterans of the Civil War. Angered by the threat of a potential loss in Louisiana White Supremacy, former Confederate men and the New Orleans police united and attacked the convention targeting the radical population. The targets waved a white flag in surrender, but shots continued to fire. As people fled the scene, the rioters chased the victims outside, causing the death of many African Americans walking in the streets as well. This riot led to the murdering over 200 people, mostly African Americans and 3 of the white radicals. Highgate, feeling threatened by these violent acts, left New Orleans and went to teach in Lafayette Parish. == Philosophical and political views == Highgate dedicated her life to fight for quality education and racial justice for African Americans. Soon after she received her teaching certification, she began working for the Pennsylvania‚Äôs Freedman Relief Association. A strong believer in the importance of education, she advocated for better education for freed black communities. Highgate worked to inspire more teachers to join the antislavery movement. In an address to the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, Highgate stated, ‚ÄúEven in the instruction given to the ignorant there lacks some of the main essentials of right instruction. The teachers sent out by the evangelical organizations do very little to remove caste-prejudice, the twin sister of slavery. We need Anti-Slavery teachers who will show that it is safe to do right.‚Äù Highgate traveled around working for the American Missionary Association giving addresses that encouraged people to donate. Half of her proceeds funded the school her mother worked at in Mississippi and the other half went to AMA funds. While working as a teacher , Highgate also worked strongly advocating for equal rights. While in New Orleans, Highgate attacked Louisiana‚Äôs School Board segregation policy resulting in some of her students to get shot at walking into school and in the classroom. Highgate wanted her students to stop suffering from racial hatred and to get the best possible education they could. She devoted all of her time to opening schools and generating forms of education for all kinds of people. In a letter she wrote to Reverend George Whipple in 1864 , Highgate claimed, ‚ÄúI am convinced that it would be useless to attempt to report in one letter the various thrilling cases with which am daily permitted to meet. I have lately taken a school of fifty second-grade pupils taught by Miss Hill. The children seem almost inconsolable at the loss of so amiable a teacher who left a home of affluence and devoted herself so self-sacrificingly to help in the great work of elevating the nation's freedmen . I have also just commenced teaching from four till six at the Rope Walk and already feel blessed in the effort. I have my reward in advance in all phases of this excellent work. My evening class of men who are studying geography arithmetic &c.; afford[s] me decided recreation. Oh how inspiring the thought that these dear souls are forever free.‚Äù == Death and afterward == Edmonia Highgate later fell in love with a white man, John Henry Vosburg. Highgate died suddenly on October 16, 1870 in Syracuse, New Yorks. Although many sources claim the reason for her death as ‚Äòunknown,‚Äô her body was found in the house of an abortionist, Mrs. Paine. Train tickets to Tugaloo, Mississippi were found in her trunk as her intention was to return to her teaching career there. Other sources claim on examination of her body it was found, that she was with child, and she probably took poison to hide the shame of an unwed pregnancy. ==References== Category:1844 births Category:1870 deaths Category:African-American activists Category:Activists from Syracuse, New York ","title":"Edmonia Highgate"},{"id":"61726859","text":"Dmitriyevka () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Dmitriyevsky Selsoviet, Ufimsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

It was fought between the Clan Macnab and the Clan Neish or MacNeish. The Macnabs won the battle. ==Background== It is recorded that in 1490 James IV of Scotland issued a warrant to Lord Drummond that read: This translates as: The Neishes apparently had the only boat on the loch and although the dwelling was demolished the Neishes repaired it and continued to live there, occupying most of the land near St Fillans and as far west as Tyndrum. The Clan Macnab and Clan Neish were at feud due to a long series of petty jealousies and grievances on both sides. Frequently small groups of the clans had met and fought each other, but finally both clans mustered their full force and met at Glenboltachan where a regular battle took place. ==The battle== The final battle between the two clans took place where the farm of Littleport is located about two miles north of the lower end of Loch Earn in the Glen of Boultachan in 1522. Finlay Macnab gathered together all of his fighting men for one final effort for the supremacy of the northern Loch Earn district. During the battle the chief of the Neishes long held his own, standing with his back to a large boulder. Eventually he was overcome and fell covered with wounds. According to tradition his blood still stains the boulder. Three sons of the Neish chief perished by his side. The rest of the Neishes also fought stubbornly but they were finally overcome and only a remnant of them were able to escape. Only thirty of the 500 Neishes survived the battle. ==Aftermath== The remaining Neishes settled on an island on Loch Earn, Neish Island, under the leadership of one of the relatives of their former chief. The feud between the Neishes and Macnabs continued and in one incident in 1612, the Neishes ambushed a Macnab servant, or according to abother account some MacNab clansmen, who had been sent by his chief to procure provisions and drink for the Christmas celebrations. The Neishes took all the goods and mistreated the servant who warned the Neishes that there would be reprisals, but they laughed at his threats and retreated to their island. In response the Macnab chief sent his twelve sons to attack the Neishes on their island stronghold. The Neishes having succumbed to the drink were all killed except for one small boy who hid under a bed and from who all of the name Neish are allegedly descended. The leader of the Macnabs, \\"smooth John\\", then decapitated the Neish chieftain before they departed, keeping his head as a trophy. The boat that the Macnabs used to get to and from the island was abandoned by them and could apparently still be seen by passers-by as late as the eighteenth century. Another account states that the boat was still to be seen in the nineteenth century. The Macnab chief's coat of arms includes \\"an open boat, ores in action\\", and the Neish's head appears on the crest badge for the Clan Macnab. ==References== Glenboultachan Glenboultachan ","title":"Battle of Glenboultachan"},{"id":"61726878","text":"Zhukovo () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Zhukovsky Selsoviet, Ufimsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

Born and raised in Johannesburg, he emigrated to Southern Rhodesia in 1956 and co-founded a textile company in Bulawayo. First elected to Parliament in 1970, he was named Minister of Commerce and Industry by Prime Minister Ian Smith in 1974. Two years later, he was named Minister of Information, Immigration, and Tourism. He chose not to run for reelection in 1977, and after leaving both Parliament and the Cabinet, died the same year. == Early life and career == Broomberg was born on 23 December 1915 in Johannesburg, South Africa. The son of Joseph Louis and Fanny Broomberg, he grew up in an Jewish family. He was educated at Forest High School in Johannesburg. He served in World War II with the South African Army's National Volunteer Brigade. After the war, Broomberg went into business, and was involved with a number of civic organizations. From 1946 to 1956, he was Chair of the Cotlands Babies Sanctuary. From 1948 to 1956, he was Chair of the Southern Communal Centre Building Fund, from 1954 to 1956 he was Chair of the Coordinating Council of Southern Suburbs Vigilance Associations, and from 1955 to 1956 he was Chair of the Queenshaven Coronation Foundation (Southern Committee). In 1956, he was appointed to the board of South Rand Hospital in Johannesburg, but resigned shortly after when he decided to emigrate. In 1956, Broomberg immigrated to Southern Rhodesia, settling in Bulawayo. In 1956, along with a business partner, he founded Sentex Weaving Mills, a small textile company with eight Weaving mills and a staff of 14. He was also served as the director of several other companies: Coys, Merlin Limited the Trans-Ocean Import Corporation, the U.D.C. of Rhodesia, Freecor Limited, and United Refineries. From 1958 to 1960, and again from 1966 to 1969, he was President of the Central African Textile Manufacturers Association. In Rhodesia, he also held leadership positions of a number of civic associations: as President of the Lions Club of Bulawayo, as National Chair of the Council for the Blind, as Vice-President of the Rhodesia Society for the Blind & Physically Handicapped, and as Chair of the King George VI Rehabilitation Centre for Blind & Physically Handicapped Children. == Political career == In 1970, Broomberg ran for Parliament as the Rhodesian Front candidate for the Bulawayo East constituency. He defeated his opponent, Centre Party vice president Arthur Sarif, with 65 percent of the vote. In 1974, Broomberg won reelection with 67 percent of the vote against his moderate Rhodesia Party opponent Jurick Goldwasser's 33 percent. Following the 1974 election, Prime Minister Ian Smith appointed Broomberg to the Cabinet as Minister of Commerce and Industry. As commerce minister, Broomberg became a key player in Rhodesia's sanction-busting efforts. He also sought to introduce price controls, which generated strong opposition from the Rhodesian business community. On 11 November 1974, Broomberg was honoured as a Member of the Legion of Merit. In 1976, Smith reorganized his cabinet, and named Broomberg as Minister of Information, Immigration, and Tourism. Broomberg's appointment was unexpected, as his performance as commerce minister was often criticized within Rhodesia's political establishment and he was widely expected to be dropped from the next cabinet. As information minister, Broomberg oversaw the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation, the country's main government mouthpiece. As immigration minister, he sought, largely unsuccessfully, to stem the flow of white emigrants out of Rhodesia. One of his methods was the creation of a section of the ministry's Immigration Promotion Department whose staff would write a letter to every departing white emigrant to ask why they were leaving, and to try to change their mind. As tourism minister, he worked to reverse the decline in tourism to Rhodesia, in particular by promoting the country as a tourist destination to white South Africans. In 1976, he opened a Rhodesian tourism office in Johannesburg, and oversaw a publicity campaign which saw Rhodesian \\"holiday girls\\" travel across South Africa in brightly-painted vans to promote tourism in Rhodesia. Broomberg left the Cabinet the following year after deciding not to run for reelection to Parliament in the 1977 election. He was succeeded as Minister of Information, Immigration, and Tourism by Foreign Minister P. K. van der Byl. He died the same year, on 4 November 1977, and was buried at the Jewish cemetery in Bulawayo. == Personal life == Broomberg married Fay Golub on 25 December 1939. They had three sons. They lived at Clark Road, and later at Selbourne Avenue, in Bulawayo. In his free time, he enjoyed golf, tennis, and painting, and was a member of several clubs: the Bulawayo Golf Club, the Parkview Sports Club, and the Wietzman and Reading country clubs. Broomberg was a practicing Jew and a Zionist, and an active member of the Bulawayo Hebrew Congregation. == Awards and honours == * 60x60px Member of the Legion of Merit of Rhodesia, Civil Division (awarded 11 November 1974) == See also == * History of the Jews in Zimbabwe == References == Category:1915 births Category:1977 deaths Category:20th-century South African businesspeople Category:Businesspeople in textiles Category:Commerce and industry ministers Category:Immigration ministers Category:Information ministers Category:Jewish politicians Category:Members of the Parliament of Rhodesia Category:Naturalised citizens of Rhodesia Category:People from Johannesburg Category:People from Bulawayo Category:Rhodesian businesspeople Category:Rhodesian Front politicians Category:Rhodesian Jews Category:Rhodesian politicians Category:South African Army personnel Category:South African businesspeople Category:South African emigrants to Rhodesia Category:South African Jews Category:South African military personnel of World War II Category:Tourism ministers Category:White Rhodesian people Category:White South African people Category:Zionists ","title":"Elias Broomberg"},{"id":"61727344","text":"General elections were held in Papua and New Guinea on 2 October 1954. ==Electoral system== The 29-member Legislative Council consisted of the Administrator, 16 civil servants, nine members appointed by the Administrator (three representatives of the indigenous population, three representing European settlers and three representing missionaries) and three elected Europeans.Local voice in Papua-N.

It is based on the idea that the Jews of the diaspora are incapable of forming their own states and would therefore parasitically attack and exploit states and peoples - which are biologically imagined as organisms or \\"peoples bodies\\". The stereotype is often associated with the accusation of usury and the separation of \\"creative\\", i.e. productive, and \\"raffling\\", non- productive (financial) capital (see \\"High Finance\\"). In the period of National Socialism, it served to legitimize the persecution of Jews up to the Holocaust. Some representatives of Zionism also took up the motif. They regarded a \\"parasitic\\" way of life in other cultures as an inevitable consequence of the diaspora and contrasted it with the establishment of a Jewish state as an ideal. == From Enlightenment to \\"Vorm√§rz\\" == Herder. Portrait of Gerhard von K√ºgelgen (1806) The earliest evidence of the idea of a \\"Jewish parasite\\" can be found in the 18th century. Precursors could be found, as suspected by the German-Israeli historian Alexander Bein, in the medieval notion of the \\"usurious Jew\\" who would suck the blood out of the people and the ritual murder legend according to which Jews would use the blood of Christian children for ritual purposes. In addition - for instance in Martin Luther's anti-Jewish writings - the idea can be proven that Jews are only guests in Europe, that Christians are their hosts, from which later the idea of the host people afflicted by parasites developed. The French Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire (1694-1778) explicitly denied the Jews the ability to achieve their own cultural achievements and to achieve lasting statehood: as evidence he cited the construction of the first temple, for which Solomon with Hiram of Tyre had had to engage craftsmen from Lebanon, and the double exile (first the Babylonian Exile after 597 BC and then the Diaspora after the expulsion by the Romans in 135 AD). The entire Torah would have been parasitically borrowed from ancient Oriental sources. The German theologian and philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803), an important representative of Weimar Classicism, wrote in the third part of his ideas on the philosophy of the history of mankind in 1791: A very similar passage can also be found in the fourth part. Since Herder, an outstanding expert of the Old Testament and ancient Judaism, is considered a philosopher of the Enlightenment, the interpretation of these passages is controversial: According to the anti-Semitism researcher L√©on Poliakov, Herder \\"anticipated the statements of the racists of future generations\\". The German literary scholar Klaus L. Berghahn believes that Herder's sympathy was only for ancient Judaism: On the other hand he had, opposed the Jews their presence. The Polish Germanist Emil Adler, on the other hand, considers it possible - also in view of the positive remarks on Judaism a few pages before or after - that Herder only wanted to set an \\"apologetic counterweight\\": Also in other places of the ideas he had contrasted critical enlightenment formulations with conservative Orthodox thoughts and therefore weakened them in order not to endanger his position as General Superintendent of the Lutheran Church in Weimar. The Germanist Arndt Kremer points out that such language images in the 18th century were \\"not yet per se instrumentalized for anti-Semitic purposes\\". He contrasts them with Herder's argumentation that the alleged misdemeanours of Judaism could be explained by the anti-Jewish legislation of his time, which he described as \\"barbaric\\": \\"No v√∂lkisch anti-Semite of later times would argue like this\\". In 1804, the reviewer of an anti-Jewish work by the German Enlightenment writer Friedrich Buchholz (1768-1843) picked up on the metaphor of the Jew in the Neue allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek as \\"a parasitic plant that incessantly clings to a noble bush, nourishes itself from the juice\\". In 1834, the metaphor was directed against Jewish emancipation in an article in the journal Der Canonische W√§chter: The Jews would be ‚Äúa true plague of the peoples parasitically surround them‚Äù. In his polemic against Jewish emancipation, the Protestant pastor Robert Haas expressed which parasitic plant was concretely meant by this in his polemic: == Left Anti-Semitism in the 19th Century == Fourier. Lithograph by Charles Baugniet (1848) The idea of social parasitism - in the figurative sense - has long been present in socialism. It was adopted from the physiocracy of the 18th century, which called urban merchants and manufactory owners \\"class st√©rile\\" in contrast to the supposedly only productive farmers. The French early socialist Charles Fourier (1772-1837), for example, described the majority of all servants, women and children as \\"domestic parasites\\", to whom he added the \\"social parasites\\", namely merchants and sailors. To these \\"anti-productive\\" populations Fourier also counted the Jews. In his 1846 work Les Juifs, rois de l'√©poque : histoire de la f√©odalit√© financi√®re, his pupil Alphonse Toussenel (1803-1885) defined \\"the despised name of the Jew\\" as \\"any money dealer, any unproductive parasite who lives from the substance and work of others. For me, Jews, usurers, and money dealers are synonyms\\". The early socialist Pierre- Joseph Proudhon (1809-1865) pointed to Fourier's anti-Semitism and charged him with further stereotypes. He therefore accused the Jews of crucifying Jesus Christ, of founding the Roman Catholic Church which was rejected by Proudhon, of striving for world domination and of being a \\"human race\\" that could not be assimilated. He relied here on the philosopher of religion Ernest Renan (1823-1893), who held the view that the Hebrew language was incapable of abstract conceptualization and therefore of metaphysics. All in all, Proudhon saw the Jews as symbols of capitalism, which he criticized. He wrote in 1860: From this he concluded in 1847 that the Jews would either have to be expelled to Asia or destroyed. The French socialist Albert Regnard (1836-1903) saw parallels in 1890 between the antinomies of the capitalist and the proletarian on the one hand and the Jew and the Aryan on the other. The Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin (1814-1876) called the Jews \\"an exploitative sect, a people of leeches, a single-eating parasite\\" in 1871. They were commanded either by Karl Marx or by the Rothschilds, who equally despised by Bakunin. According to the political scientist Klaus von Beyme, this shows that Bakunin's anti-Semitism was not racially motivated, but anti-capitalistic. While the British Chartist movement in general supported the Jewish demand for equality, the situation was different in terms of its economic role. Jews were denounced by Chartists as parasites and embodiments of exploitation, who would join forces with other enemies of the working class. == Right-wing anti-Semitism in the 19th and early 20th centuries == In the right-wing political spectrum, the stereotype of the \\"Jewish parasite\\" was much more widespread than in the rest of the political spectrum. The political right-wing used the stereotype with a racist rather than an anti-capitalist thrust, although both motives were present. Each time it had the function of dressing ones own anti-Semitic suspicions in a scientific and therefore apparently objective concept. The German-language journalist Osman Bey wrote in 1873 in his conspiracy-theoretical work The Conquest of the World by the Jews that Jews were \\"largely unproductive parasites\\". When more and more Jews fled from Eastern Europe to Germany and Austria in the 1880s, the depiction of the Jewish parasite and disease vector became the topos of anti-Semitic literature. In 1881, in his social Darwinian work Bau und Leben des sozialen K√∂rpers, the German national economist Albert Sch√§ffle unfolded the concept of the \\"social parasite\\", who took advantage of the labor and wealth of his \\"host\\" without contributing anything to it himself. As a particularly dangerous part of this social parasitism, he described the \\"proliferating\\" Jews as active in the credit System. The meaning of the metaphor changed with the idea of a \\"peoples body\\", into which the Jewish parasite penetrated in order to harm him. If originally meanings from botany were added to it (as with Herder), it was increasingly associated with zoology or infectiology: Now one had to imagine leeches, lice, viruses or even vampires under \\"Jewish parasites\\", which would have to be fought ruthlessly. Adolf Stoecker. Photography (ca. 1890) The domestic chaplain Adolf Stoecker (1835-1909) - founder of the Christian Social Workers' Party ‚Äì wanted, in a 1880 debate in the Prussian House of Representatives only to grant the Jews a \\"parasitic existence\\" in Christian Europe and compared it with \\"leeches\\". In the following period he even considered a racial struggle and the use of force. The German national economist Eugen D√ºhring (1833-1921) wrote in his 1881 work, Die Judenfrage als Racen-, Sitten- und Culturfrage (The Jewish Question as a Question of Races, Morals and Culture) that Jewish parasites would feel particularly at home in an \\"already corrupted peoples body\\". The power of this \\"inner Carthago\\" would have to break the modern populous. In the posthumously published 6th edition of 1930, he pointed out this statement even further and called for a war against the Jews: Theodor Lessing referred to a statement by D√ºhring according to which Nordic people were obliged \\"to exterminate the parasitic races, as we exterminate threatening poisonous snakes and wild predators.\\" The librarian and folk song researcher Otto B√∂ckel (1859-1923), who sat in the Reichstag for the German Reform Party from 1887 to 1903, publicly stigmatized Jewish traders as \\"Jewish parasites\\" who had \\"eaten themselves into the German being\\". In a similar way, the German Orientalist Paul de Lagarde (1827-1891) called in 1887 for a \\"surgical intervention\\" to remove the \\"mass of pus\\" that would have accumulated in Europe as a result of the infestation with Jewish parasites: \\"Trichinae and bacilli are not negotiated with, nor are trichinae and bacilli educated, they are destroyed as quickly and thoroughly as possible\\". Whether Lagarde was thinking of a physical extermination of the Jews is controversial in research. In Alexander Bein's view, however, these are all still biologistic comparisons and metaphors: Lagarde had not yet spoken out in favour of the extermination of the Jews, he had spoken out in pictorial language for the expropriation of the Jews. Such natural metaphors were also used in the nineteenth century without anti-Semitic intentions, as for example by the ancient historian Theodor Mommsen (1817-1903), who described the ancient Jews as the \\"ferment of decomposition\\", that the formation of larger state entities beyond ethnic boundaries have allowed. The Austrian political scientist Michael Ley, on the other hand, assumes that Lagarde strived for the annihilation of Jews; for him, it was in the sense of a redemption anti- Semitism \\"a necessary step on the way of salvation of the German people\\". Oswald Spengler (undated photography) According to Bein, the change from metaphor to a real-naturalistic understanding of these terms did not take place until the 20th century, when the German cultural philosopher Oswald Spengler (1880-1936), for example, used natural terms such as \\"growth\\", \\"withering\\" or \\"decay\\" to describe states, peoples and cultures in his main work The Decline of the West. He described Judaism as a \\"decomposing element\\" which had a destructive effect \\"wherever it intervenes\\". Jews were incapable of adapting to Western civilization and constituted a foreign body in Europe. The repeated use of the term host people with reference to the nations in which Jews live suggests the idea that they are parasites, although Spengler himself dido not use the term. The journalist Theodor Fritsch (1852-1933), in his Handbuch der Judenfrage (Handbook of the Jewish Question), first published in 1907, painted the stereotype of the \\"Jewish parasite\\", who would endanger the life of his \\"host people\\" if he was not expelled. By insinuating that the alleged parasitic Jew was Mimicry in a further biologistic metaphor, he contributed to the fact that the hatred of the Jews was subsequently and also precisely directed against assimilated Jews. Artur Dinter. Photography by Christian Beitz (before 1935) A variant of anti-Semitic parasitology was offered by the v√∂lkisch writer Artur Dinter, who in 1917 developed the so- called impregnation theory in his novel Die S√ºnde gegen das Blut (The Sin Against the Blood), according to which Jews were also \\"pests on the German body of the people\\", meaning non-Jewish women who had once been pregnant by a Jew were no longer able to \\"give birth to children of their own race\\", even with a non-Jewish partner. This theory was later taken up and further developed by the Nazis and played an important role in the discussions that preceded the 1935 Nuremberg Race Laws. The stereotype was also disseminated in other countries. In France, for example, the journalist √âdouard Drumont (1844-1917) claimed in his conspiracy-theoretical work La France Juive, published in 1886, that the \\"Jewish parasite\\" spread infectious diseases among the Aryan, \\"noble races\\" against which he himself was immune, since \\"the chronic plague [him] inherent in him protected him from any acute infection\\". Unlike those Jews were not capable of creative achievements. Therefore they could survive only as parasites, namely as bankers and usurers who would weaken the French more and more. Drumont proposed an aryanization of Jewish property as the solution. In 1937, the anti-Semitic writer Louis-Ferdinand C√©line (1864-1961), in his Bagatelles pour un massacre, published in Germany in 1938 under the title Die Judenverschw√∂rung in Frankreich (The Jewish Conspiracy in France), took up the accusations of the early Socialists and denounced \\"the Jew\\" as \\"the most intransigent, most voracious, most corrosive parasite\\". He expanded the metaphor by equating it with a cuckoo, a breeding parasite that does not build its own nests, but hatches its young from other birds, raises them, and lets their young die. The stereotype was also widespread in the Russian Empire and served to justify acts of violence against Jews. During the expulsion of the Jews from Moscow in 1891, Konstantin Petrovich Pobedonostsev, a close advisor to Tsar Alexander III, to an English guest, declared: Around 1900, the journalist Pavel Alexandrovich Krushevan (1860-1909), a member of the Black Hundreds, regularly rioted against the Jews in the magazine Bessarabetz, calling them \\"bloodsuckers, fraudsters, parasites and exploiters of the Christian population\\". Against this background, an unsolved murder case, which he described as a Jewish ritual murder, led to a pogrom in Chi»ôinƒÉu in March 1903, in which about 46 Jews were killed. == Zionism == The description of Jews as parasites can be found under other notions since the beginning of the 20th century also in Zionism. Aharon David Gordon (1856-1922), an organizer of the Second Aliyah from the Ukrainian Zhytomyr, wrote: But it was not the Jews themselves who were to blame, but the exile in which they were forced to live. This polemic was fed by the idea that Jews could develop an independent culture and identity by moving to Israel alone. According to the Israeli political scientist Zeev Sternhell, hatred of diaspora culture was something like \\"a methodological necessity for Zionism\\". Gordon described as parasites all those who do not stand on their own two feet and live on their own hands for work. He also saw this inactivity spreading among the Yishuv, the Jewish population in Palestine. In order to form the Jewish nation, one had to \\"wage war\\" against it and against every other form of parasitism. Similarly, Zionists and \\"Halutzim,\\" the pioneers of Jewish repopulation, mystified the soil and the handiwork with which it was cultivated: In a travelogue, Hugo Herrmann (1887-1940) described the almost liberating zeal of the previous \\"airmen, parasites, traders and hagglers\\" after their entry into Eretz Israel. The co-founder of the Zionist World Organization Max Nordau (1849-1923) formulated the ideal of the \\"muscle Jew\\", whereby he did not fall back on the parasite metaphor, but according to the Austrian historian Gabriele Anderl his statements and those of other Zionist theorists can be understood \\"from todays point of view also as an internalization of the anti-Semitic caricature of the Jew as unproductive parasite\\". In Israel today the accusation of parasitism is sometimes made against ultra-Orthodox Jews who are exempt from military service. == National Socialism == Caricature from Der St√ºrmer, September 1944: A monstrous vermin, marked with a star of David, crawls over the earth. The text \\"Thou shalt eat the nations of the earth\\" was supposed to be a passage from the Old Testament National Socialism replaced the basic Marxist contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat with that between \\"worker\\" and \\"parasite\\". The identification of Jews with parasites, pests, germs, vermin, etc. is very common here. Its purpose was to dehumanize and segregate the Jewish population. Alexander Bein sees in the discourse of the \\"Jewish parasite\\", who understood his biologistic terminology not metaphorically but literally, one of the semantic causes of the Holocaust. Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) repeatedly picked up the stereotype 1924/25 in his program manifesto Mein Kampf. For example, he polemicized against the widespread idea in anti-Semitic literature that the Jews were nomads, as he himself had described them in a speech on August 13, 1920. Now he denied that this designation would be correct: In this argumentation any possibility of naturalization for Jews was excluded, because this would only allow the alleged parasite to penetrate deeper into the body of the people. The anti-Semitic weekly paper Der St√ºrmer used this sterotype in 1927 to deny Jews their right to life. The Jews were equated with locusts: Also in 1927, a National Socialist poster that advertised an event with Gregor Strasser, referred to the frequent objection that Jews were also human beings, and gave the cynical answer: \\"The flea is also an animal, though not a pleasant one\\". In the text of the poster, the equation with an insect that transmits diseases was further increased by describing Jews as vampires, i.e. not only as a nuisance, but as a deadly danger. In the same year, the National Socialist journalist Arno Schickedanz (1892-1945) unfolded the stereotype fin his scrip of Sozialparasitismus im V√∂lkerleben (Social parasitism in peoples' lives). It was cited by the ideologist of the NSDAP, Alfred Rosenberg (1892-1946), in 1930 in his Mythus of the 20th Century. In it he alleged that the Jews, supposedly on a \\"strictly scientific\\" basis, deliberately sought national weaknesses in order to be able to eat themselves through this \\"wound\\" into the body of the \\"host\\", as for instance the sack cancer used the anus of the edible crab to penetrate it and eat it from the inside. At the same time he identified the intruder with Ahasver, the Eternal Jew, who was condemned to homelessness, just waiting for his enemies to show themselves weak. He could therefore never lay aside his parasitic behavior: Reich Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels (1897-1945) expressed similar views in a speech on April 6, 1933: The Jews were \\"a completely foreign race\\" with \\"markedly parasitic characteristics\\". In a radio broadcast in January 1938, the National Socialist Walter Frank raised the conflict with the \\"parasite\\" Judaism to a religious level: It could not be understood without classifying it in the world- historical process \\"in which God and Satan, creation and decomposition lie in eternal struggle\\" Hitler himself depicted in a Reichstag speech on 26 April 1942 the globally perishable consequences of the Jews' alleged striving for world domination: On 16 May 1942, he used the stereotype as a counter-argument against bourgeois protests against the deportation of Jews from Germany in a table discussion: As a parasite, the Jew could live \\"in contrast to the German in Lapland just as well in the tropics\\", there was no reason at all for crocodile tears. The National Socialist discourse on the \\"Jewish parasite\\" was supplemented by further equations of Jews with pathogens, rats or vermin, as can be seen in Fritz Hippler's propaganda film Der ewige Jude from 1940. He therefore continued the anti-Jewish writings of Martin Luther (1483-1546), who had insulted the Jews as the \\"pestilence\\" of Christians. This accusation had been taken up in the 20th century by anti-Semites such as the Thule Society and also by Hitler himself, who during the war against the Soviet Union took advantage of the impending extermination of \\"this plague\\" (meant was the alleged Jewish Bolshevism) as a grateful achievement. In May 1943, in a conversation with Goebbels, he picked up the stereotype once again and varied it by another pest: this time he equated the Jews with potato beetles, which one could also ask oneself why they existed at all. He gave the answer himself in the social Darwinian sense: nature was dominated by the \\"law of struggle\\". Parasitic phenomena would \\"accelerate this struggle and intensify the selection process between the strong and the weak\\". But civilized high-ranking peoples would regularly underestimate this danger due to instinctive weakness: \\"So there is nothing left to the modern peoples but to exterminate the Jews\\". Title page of a training booklet of the Wehrmacht, 1944 Through this comparison with parasites, pests and diseases the Jews were systematically denied to be human beings. Nazi propaganda was able to tie in here with the medieval image of the Jew as a well poisoner. However, these comparisons became much more important as a result of the more widespread knowledge of medicine and hygiene in the 20th century. The only solution that remained in this logic was the physical extermination of the alleged pests, the Holocaust. In the National Socialist training literature, this consequence was repeatedly openly addressed. For example, in \\"Training Foundations for the Reich Themes of the NSDAP for the Year 1941/42\\" it was stated that a body infested with bacteria had to overcome these parasites, or it was overcome by them. He then had to take care to prevent a new infection in the future. This is also the case in people's lives: With the propaganda of the \\"Jews as world parasites\\", Wehrmacht members were indoctrinated hundreds of thousands of times by their Nazi command officers until the last months of the Second World War. As late as 1944, posters were stuck in the General government showing rats in front of a star of David with the inscription: \\"≈ªydzi powracajƒÖ wraz z bolszewizmen\\" (German: \\"Die Juden kehren mit dem Bolschewismus zur√ºck\\"). This was intended to mobilize anti-Semitic resentments of the Polish population against the advancing Red Army and to prevent further resistance against the German occupation. == Anti-Semitism after 1945 == The stereotype of the Jewish parasite can also be traced in anti-Semitism after 1945. In 1947 the Berliner Illustrierte interpreted the abbreviation \\"D.P.\\". (Displaced Persons, meaning people liberated from concentration camps and forced labour camps) as \\"Deutschlands Parasiten\\" (Germany's parasites). A linguistic analysis of letters to the Central Council of Jews in Germany and the Israeli Embassy in Berlin from 2002 to 2012 showed the unbroken liveliness of the stereotype of the Jewish parasite in the present Among neo-Nazis, these metaphors are widely used to describe Jews and foreigners. According to Bernhard P√∂rksen, such animal metaphors serve the attempt to \\"create disgust and lower inhibitions of Extermination\\" According to the 2007 analysis by Albert Scherr and Barbara Sch√§uble, the anti-Semitic \\"topos of parasites, impurities and blood\\", to which the stereotype \\"Jewish parasite\\" can be attributed, is also taken up in media discourses as well as by contemporary young people in narratives and argumentations. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Eurasianism gained influence in Russia, claiming that a genetic unity of the peoples of Eurasia had to be established, since they were threatened by chimerical, parasitic influences - namely by the Khazars, a medieval Turkic people of Jewish faith. The stereotype can also be found in anti-Semitism, which is widespread in Islamic countries in connection with the Middle East conflict. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, wealthy Jews in the country were accused of exploiting their Muslim workers as \\"bloodsuckers\\" and transferring the profits for arms purchases to Israel. The Iranian television series Zahra's Blue Eyes, first broadcast in 2004, claims that Jews steal the organs of Palestinian children. The Jewish organ recipients are portrayed as not viable without the body parts of their victims, which Klaus Holz and Michael Kiefer interpret as picking up the parasite stereotype. Jews par excellence would not be viable without the host people, just as parasites need a host. At the International Holocaust Cartoon Competition organized by the Iranian newspaper Hamshahri, a drawing was submitted in which Jews were portrayed as worms infesting an apple. == Literature == * Alexander Bein: ‚ÄûDer j√ºdische Parasit.

On the north, The Mbeya Mountains rise steeply to the northwest, and the lower Lupa upland further to the east.

The Great Ruaha River forms extensive wetlands, some seasonal, in the middle of the plain. Ruaha National Park occupies the eastern and central portion of the plain. ==People== Until the 1960s, the Sangu people were mostly pastoralists, grazing cattle on the plain with a communal form of land ownership. The Sangu were concentrated in the southern part of the plain, which was more amenable to cattle grazing. In the 1960s the Tanzanian government organized an irrigation project and developed three large rice farms on the plain, watered by streams originating in the western mountains. Some former communal grazing lands have been brought under state control. Now many Sangu make a living in agriculture.

Fueter was born in London, the youngest son of Daniel Christian Fueter, a goldsmith who had taken refuge in England for political reasons. His family moved to New York City around 1754, and afterwards resided at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where young Fueter received his first training in drawing. He returned to Switzerland in 1769 with his father and settled in Berne, where studied the art of engraving on steel and precious stones under the celebrated artist Johann Melchior Morikofer. He then went to Paris, where he worked for Graff, Schultze, the renowned painter Jean-Baptiste Greuze, and others. Fueter's skill as a gold- and silversmith, and talent as an engraver of seals and medals, made him suitable for the post of Master of the Mint at Bern, a position for which he was recommended by patrons and friends such men as Jenner von Brunnadern and the old magistrate von Steiger. As a preliminary, the government sent him to visit the mints of Strassburg, Frankfort, Augsburg, Munich, Nuremberg, Dresden, and London, to better perfect his technique. In 1791, Fueter returned to Bern and was duly installed as mint-master. In this role, he introduced the French system of currency to Bern and the Concordat-cantone at the end of the eighteenth century. When the Republic of Bern fell in 1798, Fueter was able to hide part of the Mint's treasury from the French. Upon creation of the Helvetic Republic, the new government reinstated the Mintmaster in his post. During his long career produced a large number of dies, mostly for coins. As a medallist, Fueter set Johann Carl Hedlinger before himself as a pattern. One of his earliest medals was engraved in 1786; it commemorates the inauguration of an orphanage. His well-known medals include one commemorating the Battle of Laupen, and one known as the \\"Insel-Medaille\\". his well-known medal of General Pasquale Paoli is executed in Hedlinger's style. At that time the currency for all of Switzerland was struck at Bern, Basle, and Soleure, and from the dies engraved by Fueter. Landolt ascribes to him the Thaler of the Helvetic Republic, struck at Bern in 1799, as well as the following coins of Appenzell : Thaler of 1812 (illustrated); Half-Thaler of 1812; Half Schweizer Franken of 1809, &c.; ; also : 10 Batzen, Batzen, and Angster of Lucerne, 1811, and Thaler of 1813, &c.; Fueter also distinguished himself also as a Gem-engraver; one of his best cameos is a portrait of Voltaire. == References == * This article is adapted from \\"Fueter, Christian\\" in the Biographical Dictionary of Medallists, Volume II, compiled by L.

Designed by Charles Edmund Giles, it was built in 1859-61 and has been a Grade II listed building since 1959. ==History== All Saints was built to replace the parish church of Isle Brewers, which had become dilapidated beyond repair and too small to serve the congregation. Furthermore, its location made it prone to flooding in the winter. In response, the vicar of Isle Brewers, Rev. Dr. Joseph Wolff, who had already provided the village with a schoolroom and parsonage, began raising funds for a new church by public subscription. Funding had reached ¬£200 by March 1858, and a half-acre plot of land, approximately a quarter of a mile from the existing church, was donated by General Sir John Michel. In August 1859, Rev. Wolff completed a tour of northern and central England, where he preached and lectured in the effort to raise funds for the new church. The plans for the church were drawn up by Mr. Charles Edmund Giles of London and Taunton, and Mr. John Spiller of Taunton hired as the builder. The foundation stone was laid by Hon. Henry Walpole on 22 September 1859. The ceremony was attended by members of the local clergy and the Archdeacon of Taunton, George Denison. Sir John Pakington was originally invited to lay the stone, but illness prevented his attendance. Approximately ¬£1,000 of the ¬£1,300 cost of the church had been collected at the time of the ceremony. The completed church was consecrated by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. Robert Eden, on 2 August 1861. In recent years, the church has been added to Historic England's Heritage at Risk register, owing to the poor condition of its roof and ceiling, along with two windows and the tower. The church was awarded ¬£250,000 by the National Lottery Heritage Fund in 2018. In addition to restoration, the funding is to be used to adapt the church for additional use as a community space. The pews are to be made moveable and a kitchen and toilets added. ==Architecture== All Saints is built of blue lias stone, with dressings in Hamstone and roofed with Bridgwater tiles, in the Early English style. It was designed to accommodate 170 persons and is made up of a three-bay nave, two-bay chancel, vestry, heating chamber and tower (incorporating the porch). The tower, in height, was originally fitted with the bells from the old parish church. The open roof is largely made of stained and varnished red deal, and the same material was also used for the pews except those in the chancel which were made from oak. The chancel window was gifted and painted by Mrs. Miles of Bingham Rectory. The tesselated pavement and stonework was supplied by Mr. Brinson of Curry Mallet. The church retains many of its original fittings including the pews, reredos, pulpit and lectern. The Norman font, along with two Jacobean coffin stools and an 18th-century chest, was transferred from the village's earlier church. ==References== Category:Churches in Somerset Category:Church of England church buildings in Somerset Category:Grade II listed churches in Somerset ","title":"All Saints Church, Isle Brewers"},{"id":"61728176","text":"Anthology is a 1998 compilation album by Deborah Allen, distributed by Renaissance Records, Franklin, TN.

In September, Sanford made several campaign stops in his home state of South Carolina (including Greenville, Columbia, and Mount Pleasant) wherein he \\"debated\\" with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump.

As a junior Mack made 137 tackles (30 for loss) and eight sacks, highlighted by a 30-tackle performance against Gilmer High School that included nine tackles for loss, and was named first-team All-Region 7-AAAA and the regional defensive player of the year. As a senior, he repeated as first-team all-region and the defensive player of the year after tallying 121 tackles, 21 for loss, and 29 quarterback pressures with four forced fumbles. He committed to play college football at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga over offers from Georgia Southern, Appalachian State, Eastern Kentucky, Georgia State, Coastal Carolina and Kennesaw State. ==College career== Mack was a member of the Chattanooga Mocs football team for five seasons, redshirting his freshman year. He became a starter on the Mocs defensive line in his redshirt freshman season, making 54 tackles, nine for a loss, 3.5 sacks and a forced fumble and was named to the Southern Conference (SoCon) All-Freshman team. As a redshirt sophomore, Mack made 36 tackles and finished fourth in the conference in both tackles for loss (14) and sacks (7.5). He was named second-team All-SoCon as a redshirt junior after recording 54 tackles, seven for a loss, and 1.5 sacks. Mack was named a first-team All-American by the Associated Press, first-team All-SoCon and the SoCon Defensive Player of the Year as a redshirt senior after tallying 78 tackles (11 for loss), 8.5 sacks, two passes defensed, two forced fumbles, and one fumble recovery. ==Professional career== Mack signed with the Tennessee Titans on April 28, 2019 and made the team out of training camp. ===2019 season: Rookie year=== Mack made his NFL debut in the season opener against the Cleveland Browns, recording one tackle in the 43-13 road victory. In the next game against the Indianapolis Colts, he recorded his first NFL sack after bringing down quarterback Jacoby Brissett in a narrow 19-17 loss. During Week 8 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Mack recovered a fumble lost by Jameis Winston in the 27-23 win. Mack finished his rookie year with eight tackles, a fumble recovery, and 1.5 sacks. ==References== ==External links== *Tennessee Titans bio *Chattanooga Mocs bio Category:Living people Category:1997 births Category:American football defensive tackles Category:Chattanooga Mocs football players Category:Tennessee Titans players Category:People from Whitfield County, Georgia Category:Players of American football from Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Isaiah Mack"},{"id":"61728348","text":"Peter Ivanovich Chelishchev (); August 14, 1745 ‚Äì September 25, 1811) was a Russian writer, ethnographer, traveler from the Chelishchev family. ==Biography== Peter Chelishchev was born on August 14, 1745 in the Smolensk province; was a second cousin to Senator Alexei Chelishchev. He had a brother Alexei, three of whose grandchildren rose to the rank of general (including Nikolai Chelishchev). Since 1757 he studied at the Moscow University Gymnasium. He graduated from the Page Corps in 1766. Then he was sent together with Alexander Radishchev and other pages to complete his education at the University of Leipzig, where he stayed from 1766 to 1770. Here he attended lectures on philosophy, sociology and physiology of Professor Ernst Platner. Upon his return from abroad, his service did not work out. On October 11, 1773 he was assigned to the Kurinsky Infantry Regiment. On May 18, 1774, he was transferred as lieutenant to the Life Guards Grenadier Regiment. On October 9, 1778 he submitted a report on the transfer to the Arkhangelsk Infantry Regiment, but in 1790 he retired with the rank of second major. He lived in Saint Petersburg, brought his estates (1100 souls of peasants) to an upset state (in 1798 it was taken away for debt). In 1773 he was a member of the Masonic Muz Lodge, which was led by Ivan Elagin. On the recommendation of the same Elagin, he was consecrated to the degree of a master freemason in the Urania Lodge, of which Alexander Radishchev was a member at the same time. His materials served as the basis for writing some chapters of \\"Journey from Saint Petersburg to Moscow\\". Pyotr Chelishchev was considered an accomplice of Alexander Radishchev in the compilation of his famous book \\"Journey from Saint Petersburg to Moscow\\", but, on the basis of the unprovenness of the prosecution, he escaped prosecution. In 1791 he traveled to the north of Russia (in the Olonets, Arkhangelsk, Vologda and Novgorod Governorates). There he collected material on history and ethnography, which he combined in the book \\"Traveling to the North of Russia in 1791\\", published in 1886 and 1889 (in 1889 it was published by the Society of Ancient Writing edited by Leonid Maykov). Despite the brevity of the presentation, the facts communicated by him, especially concerning the state of trade and industry, the spread of latrines and handicrafts, are of great historical significance. In addition to \\"Traveling to the North of Russia in 1791\\", he wrote the \\"Message to the Russian Academy\\", which contains a collection of a large number of North Russian provincialisms, and the Russian translation of the German dramatic cantata: \\"Feliza, Mutter der V√∂lker\\", which appeared in Saint Petersburg in 1793 (printed along with \\"Traveling to the North of Russia in 1791\\"). At the end of his life he became blind, died in poverty. He was buried at the Lazarevskoe Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in Saint Petersburg (now the first section of the 18th century Necropolis). ==Works== *Message to the Russian Academy ‚Äì Saint Petersburg, 1793 *Feliza, Mutter der V√∂lker / translated from German by Peter Chelishchev ‚Äì Saint Petersburg, 1793 *Traveling to the North of Russia in 1791 ‚Äì Saint Petersburg, 1886 ==Sources== *Petr Ivanovich Chelishchev // Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary: in 86 volumes (82 volumes and 4 additional) ‚Äì Saint Petersburg, 1890‚Äì1907 *Alexander Pypin.

He became recognized in the mid-19th century from his work in the fields of psychiatry and neurology. He published many of his works in a journal called Archives G√©n√©rales de M√©decine (Archives of General Medicine), in which he was an editor.Wartenberg, R. (1951). Las√®gue sign and Kernig sign: historical notes. AMA Archives of Neurology & Psychiatry, 66(1), 58-60. A few of his major contributions consisted of his work with delusions of persecutions, a concept coined \\"folie √† deux,\\" and his description of hysterical anorexia.Chabrol, H., & Corraze, J. (2001). Charles Las√®gue, 1809‚Äì1883. American Journal of Psychiatry, 158(1), 28-28. Aside from his publications, he worked various jobs before becoming the Chair of Clinical Medicine at Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital. He remained positioned there until dying at the age of 66 due to complications from diabetes.Vandereycken, W., & Deth, R. (1990). A Tribute to Las√®gue's Description of Anorexia Nervosa (1873), with Completion of its English Translation. British Journal of Psychiatry, 157(6), 902-908. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Ernest-Charles Las√®gue was born on September 5, 1816, in Paris, France. His father, Antoine Las√®gue, was a librarian and botanist. Recognizing his son's potential at an early age, he enrolled him at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris where Las√®gue quickly distinguished himself among his peers. He spoke fluent Latin, showed a great comprehension of the Greek language, and excelled in philosophy and rhetoric.Dalfardi, B., & Mahmoudi Nezhad, G. (2014). Ernest-Charles Las√®gue (1816‚Äì1883). Journal of Neurology, 261(11), 2247-2248. ===Education=== In 1838, Las√®gue was offered a teaching position at the lyc√©e by Victor Cousin, his philosophy teacher, which he accepted at the age of 22. Las√®gue met and became good friends with physiologist Claude Bernard and psychiatrist B√©n√©dict Morel. Interns at the time, both Bernard and Morel worked under the supervision of Jean-Pierre Falret at the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital.Streletski, C. (1908). Essai sur Ch. Las√®gue, 1816‚Äì1881. Steinheil: Paris. Influenced by his friends and Falret, Las√®gue enrolled in the Facult√© de M√©decine at the University of Paris in 1839 but it wasn't until he attended a lecture from Armand Trousseau at the H√¥pital Necker that he decided to abandon his studies in philosophy and pursue an education in medicine with a particular interest in psychiatry. Las√®gue became a favorite pupil of Trousseau, as well as a dear friend, and went on to collaborate with him on multiple publications. He received his doctoral degree in 1847.Vandereycken, W., & Van Deth, R. (1989). Who was the first to describe anorexia nervosa: Gull or Las√®gue? Psychological Medicine, 19(4), 837-845. That summer, he was summoned by the French government and sent to Southern Russia to study and research the cholera epidemic. === Occupations === Las√®gue became fascinated with medicine, especially psychiatry. His period of time at the Prefecture de Police working as a physician consultant further fostered that interest. During this line of work, he was responsible for analyzing people who committed crimes. Las√®gue wrote articles about abnormal behaviour when common patterns were found in the standardized notes he would take of his cases.Koehler, P. J., Bruyn, G. W., & Pearce, J. (2000). Neurological eponyms. New York: Oxford University Press. Las√®gue was also a physician at Piti√©- Salp√™tri√®re Hospital and H√¥tel Necker and was employed as Trousseau's Chef de Clinique from 1852 to 1854. In 1853, he obtained his agr√©gation with his thesis \\"De la paralysie g√©n√©rale progressive.\\" That same year, he became editor of the Archives g√©n√©rales de M√©dicine. He gave multiple lectures on mental and nervous diseases throughout the 1860s and became professor of clinical medicine at the H√¥tel Necker in 1867. In 1869 at the Piti√©- Salp√™tri√®re Hospital, he became the Chair of clinical medicine. Shortly afterwards, he was elected member of the Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine. He died on March 20, 1883 from complications relating to diabetes at the age of 66. == Contributions in medicine and psychiatry == ===General paralysis and thesis of aggregation=== In the year 1846, Las√®gue graduated from medicine and completed his thesis on vitalistic doctrine from the work done by George Stahl. Following this in 1853, he obtained his professorship and put forth his work on progressive generalized paralysis.Finn, M.R. (2005). Doctors, Malady, and Creativity in Rachilde. Nineteenth-Century French Studies 34(1), 121-133. Almost a decade later, he educated patients at Salpetriere about neurological and mental diseases through the course he taught. He also received another professorship in the 1860s, this time for General Pathology. Due to his work on general paralysis, Las√®gue was able to point out how varying determinants can manifest as the same symptom regardless being caused by brain disorders. This work was later published by Falret.Falret Goetz, C. G., Goetz, B. G., Bonduelle, M., & Gelfand, T. (1995). Charcot: constructing neurology. Oxford University Press on Demand. ===Delusions of persecution (aka \\"Lasegue Disease\\")=== In his 1852 publication \\"Delire de Persecutions\\", Las√®gue was the first to introduce the idea that typical persecutory delusions were a disorder of its own. He disagreed with both the view of new wave neurologists and old school theorists; he divided persecutory delusions into two categories: general and partial, and argued that further divisions were not unnecessary.Dowbiggin, I. (2000). Delusional diagnosis? The history of paranoia as a disease concept in the modern era. History of Psychiatry, 11(41), 037‚Äì069. He theorized that symptoms were not seen in people under the age of 28 and were more common in women. Additionally, he proposed that the cause of delusions was independent of socioeconomic status, intelligence, and mood. Contrary to popular belief at the time, he believed that auditory hallucinations were not necessarily the cause or effect of persecutory delusions.Berrios, G. E. (1996). The history of mental symptoms. Cambridge University Press. ===Earliest accounts of anorexia nervosa=== Las√®gue undertook many clinical observations therefore was one of the first to cultivate objective psychology. He firmly believed that in order to determine the cause of mental illnesses, it is crucial that a patient's history is recorded in detail. This is why he clearly established the roles of psychiatry and physiology as being complementary. Las√®gue took a great interest in psychosomatic disorders. In his classic paper \\"De l‚ÄôAnorexie Hyst√©rique\\" written in 1873, he described hysterical anorexia. Even though a description of a condition similar to anorexia called hysterical apepsia was published by a British physician named William Gull 5 years prior, their descriptions differed. This is because Las√®gue focused on aspects revolving around psychological systems, such as the role of family interactions and parental attitudes. Despite this however, both Las√®gue and Gull did not acknowledge the fear people have of weight gain and their overall body image which is actually classified as one of the diagnostic criteria today for anorexia nervosa. Again, Las√®gue provided more description in his work as he gathered information from eight cases and concluded that this mental illness involved gradually decreasing the amount of food consumed and also becoming more strict with food preferences.Soh, N., Walter, G., Robertson, M., & Malhi, G. S. (2010). Charles Las√®gue (1816‚Äì1883): beyond anorexie hyst√©rique. Acta Neuropsychiatrica, 22(6), 300-301. ===Concept of \\"folie √† deux\\" === In their 1877 publication \\"La folie a deux (ou folie communiquee)\\", Las√®gue alongside Falret were the first to introduce a term called Las√®gue‚ÄìFalret syndrome or \\"folie a deux\\", which translated to \\"insanity of two\\".Lazarus, A. (1985). Folie √† deux: psychosis by association or genetic determinism?. Comprehensive psychiatry, 26(2), 129-135. They described a shared psychological disorder in which delusional symptoms are transferred from one psychotic individual to one or multiple closely associated healthy individuals. Lasegue and Falret acknowledged that typical psychotic behaviour was not contagious. Therefore, they took an interest in the role of interpersonal communication in transferring psychosis. In their paper, they described communication between three pairs of closely associated individuals. The direction of communication was from: an adult to a child, an adult to an elderly individual, and an elderly individual to an adult. They theorized that the pairs‚Äô proximity of contact, duration of contact, and imbalance in intellect and suggestibility (the child being less intelligent and more gullible) allowed the syndrome to manifest.Lasegue, C. E., & Falret, J. (2016). La folie √† deux (ou folie communiqu√©e). Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental & Neuro Sciences, 9(2), 62‚Äì68. They also suggested that transference was more common among women who were living in confinement.Arnone, D., Patel, A., & Tan, G. M.-Y. (2006). The nosological significance of Folie √† Deux: a review of the literature. Ann Gen Psychiatry, 5(11). Their paper was only translated to English in 1964, despite being referenced several times. However, their coined term \\"folie a deux\\" is still commonly used internationally amongst the psychiatric vocabulary today. The Las√®gue's sign, also known as the straight leg raise, is a test used in the physical examination of patients with low back pain to determine the presence of sciatic pain. ===Eponym Las√®gue‚Äôs sign'=== One of Las√®gue's most well known contributions to neurology was termed \\"Las√®gue‚Äôs sign\\" otherwise known as \\"Las√®gue‚Äôs test.\\" In his publication he introduced effects that manifest from stretching the sciatic nerve by flexing the hip and extending the leg. In the field of clinical practice, it became the standard test. He actually stated in his 1864 paper that the level of pain will not increase from passively extending or flexing the leg. This means it was most likely that he had not tried it with the combination flexing the hip at the time. However, Las√®gue noted that he could tell malingerers apart from patients experiencing real sciatic pain by just conducting the leg raise test. Although Las√®gue was the one to emphasize its presence in sciatica and the importance it held for diagnostics, it was his student named Forst in 1881 who first described the sign.Passive Straight Leg Raise Test: Definition, Interpretation, Limitations and Utilization. (2014). Journal of Current Clinical Care , 4(6).Schmidt, Eder & Simanke, Richard. (2014). CHARLES LAS√àGUE: A RESISTANCE TO AN \\"ORGANICIST\\" ALIENISM 1. ===Described exhibitionism === In 1877, Las√®gue described the phenomenon of exhibitionism. Shortly after this, the term started to appear in literature with no significant changes being made of the description to date. Las√®gue believed that the behaviour of an exhibitionist was only typical of males, and was marked by an intense urge to display their genitals. Although Las√®gue described this phenomenon as impulsive, acts of this display typically seemed to occur at the same areas with the same victims.Myers, R. G., & Berah, E. F. (1983). Some features of Australian exhibitionists compared with pedophiles. Archives of sexual behavior, 12(6), 541-547. ===Study on alcoholism=== Las√®gue was recognized as one of the most prominent French specialists in alcoholism. His daily work routine consisted of a great number of alcoholic patients whom he studied and accessed in police hospitals. He conducted research on intoxicated patients and the sufferers‚Äô obsessions. His study on alcoholism lead him to the belief that alcoholic disorder, is in fact, a mental disorder. However, Las√®gue had several critics to his theory, as they argued that alcoholic delirium was \\"a vague concept that it filled asylums with people who were neither true alcoholics or true lunatics.\\" At last, doctors needed to revise and re-examine the classification and description of alcoholism, as it didn't fit the concept that all alcoholics are mentally ill.Prestwich, P.E. (1994). Drinkers, Drunkards, and Degenerates: The Alcoholic Population of a Parisian Asylum, 1867-1914. ===Scurvy=== Las√®gue described the conditions people faced in the scurvy epidemic from extreme food shortages in his publication. He accurately described the symptoms of scurvy while really focusing on the impact that the cold and nutritional deficits had. He believed these to be key factors, especially for the group of German prisoners at the H√¥pital de la Piti√© he cared for.Walusinski, O. (2016). Neurology and Neurologists during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871). War Neurology, 38(1), 77-92. Las√®gue, alongside another physician named Alexis Charles Legroux, when on to establish a correlation between cases of scurvy in German prisons and the lack of physical activity relative to the duration of enclosure.Magiorkinis, E., Beloukas, A., & Diamantis, A. (2011). Scurvy: past, present and future. European journal of internal medicine, 22(2), 147-152. ==Publications == Ernest-Charles Las√©gue had \\"published about 115 scientific papers on different medical topics in the areas of neurology, psychiatry, internal medicine, pediatrics, and the history of medicine.\\" His most prominent publications include: * Archives G√©n√©rales de M√©decine (Archives of General Medicine), 1823- issued majority of his papers here. * De l‚ÄôAnorexie Hyst√©rique (Hysterical Anorexia), 1873- Las√©gue speaks about Hysterical Anorexia and the psychological aspect of the disorder. * La folie a deux, 1877 (accompanied by Jean-Pierre Falret)- introduced the Las√©gue-Falret Syndrome, a psychological disorder and spoke in-depth about the disorder. * Les C√©r√©braux, 1880- Las√©gue addresses the significance of psychosomatic medicine associated with medicine overall. * Questions de therapeutique mentale, 1884- Las√©gue examines delusional ideas. ==References == Category:French psychiatrists Category:1816 births Category:1883 deaths Category:People from Paris Category:Chevaliers of the L√©gion d'honneur ","title":"Charles Las√®gue"},{"id":"61728376","text":"Rodenas may refer to: * R√≥denas, a municipality in Teruel, Spain * Roden√§s, a municipality in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany * Alejandra Rodenas (born 1963), Argentine lawyer, judge, professor, and politician * Clementina R√≥denas (born 1949), Spanish politician ==See also== * In√©s Rodena (1905‚Äì1985), Cuban writer ","title":"Rodenas"},{"id":"61728386","text":"In abstract algebra, Krull's separation lemma is a lemma in ring theory.

He had an older sister Alexandra and two brothers - Nikolai and Victor. Nikolai was a sailor and a notorious anarchist, Victor graduated from the Petrograd Naval School and served as the commander of the ship in the Baltic Fleet. His father died of a heart attack in May 1918 and his mother died in 1927. Anatoli enrolled in the Lefortovo military paramedic school, but in April 1912 he refused to go to the parade in honor of the empress‚Äôs name day, provoking his expulsion. He also failed at admission to the Kronstadt Naval College and began working in a pharmacy at a weaving mill in Bogorodsk, where his family had moved. He then went to Odessa and began working as a port worker, and then as a fireman in the merchant fleet. In the summer of 1915, he worked as a mechanic, where he first engaged in clandestine propaganda work. In October 1915 he was called up for military service and enrolled in the 2nd Baltic Fleet crew. In June 1916, fearing arrest, he deserted and began work as a fireman on the merchant ships of the Black Sea Fleet, hiding under the fictitious surname \\"Victorsky\\". ===Revolution and Civil War=== Drawing by Mikhail Artsybashev, a page from the album \\"Dictatorship of the proletariat\\" (1918). Anatoli Zhelezniakov is on the bottom-right. During the fall of the tsarist government in the 1917 February Revolution, the deserters of the tsarist era returned to the navy and ended up in Kronstadt, where Anatoli Grigorievich Zhelezniakov served on a minelayer. Being a staunch anarchist by this time, he did not recognize the Russian Provisional Government and often spoke at revolutionary rallies. In May 1917, he was elected a delegate to the 1st Congress of the Baltic Fleet. For several months following the revolution, anarchists and other revolutionaries turned the Dacha Durnovo, a private villa previously owned by Mikhail Bakunin, into a commune. In June, following an attempt by its occupants to occupy a local newspaper printing press, the Soviet government ordered the eviction of the Dacha Durnovo occupants. In response, Zhelezniakov and 49 other sailor‚Äìrevolutionaries joined the Durnovo occupants to defend against the eviction. After two weeks and another occupant attack to liberate a prison, the government ordered a raid on the Durnovo villa, which killed one anarchist. Zhelezniakov was imprisoned in the Preobrazhensky Regiment barracks and sentenced to 14 years of hard labor, but within weeks of the 1917 July Days, Zhelezniakov escaped. Zhelezniakov, who followed Kropotkin and Bakunin, organized Kronstadt sailors to demonstrate at the American embassy to protest results of the San Francisco Preparedness Day Bombing trial: both Tom Mooney's death sentence and the potential extradition of Alexander Berkman. Though he was the minelayer crew's delegate to the Second Congress of Soviets in October, he instead attended the assault on the Winter Palace with a crew of sailors, as part of the October Revolution. Zhelezniakov cooperated with the Bolshevik overthrow of the Russian Provisional Government and subsequently joined the Revolutionary Naval Committee. He also took part in battles against the Kerensky‚ÄìKrasnov uprising on the outskirts of Petrograd. In December 1917, he became deputy commander of a revolutionary detachment of sailors (450 people, 2 armored trains, 4 armored vehicles, about 40 machine guns and a searchlight team with two searchlights and a power station, commander - Nikolai Khovrin, chief of staff -Alexander Ilyin-Genevsky, Commissar - Ivan Pavlunovsky), who had already participated in the establishment of Soviet power in Petrograd, Moscow, Kharkov, and in battles near Belgorod and Chuguev. In the second half of December, part of the Khovrina-Zhelezniakov detachment returned to Petrograd and was housed in the 2nd Baltic Fleet Crew. The sailors of the detachment, distinguished by left radicalism and anarchism, were the initiators and supporters of tough measures in the fight against enemies of the Soviet government. In particular, the organizers of the later assassination of the former ministers Andrei Ivanovich Shingarev and Fyodor Kokoshkin. Lenin described the killing as \\"outrageous.\\" The detachment was used to disperse demonstrations in support of the All-Russian Constituent Assembly and was sent to the guard of the Tauride Palace, where the Constituent Assembly was held. Zhelezniakov was appointed head of the guard. On Bolshevik orders, Zhelezniakov was responsible for disbanding the Russian Constituent Assembly, telling the assembly on January 5, 1918, that, \\"The guard is tired.\\" Anarchists were known opponents of both parliamentary assembly and this specific configuration. The same detachment guarded the Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets at which Zhelezniakov greeted delegates on behalf of the Petrograd garrison, the revolutionary detachments of the army and navy. At the end of the congress, he was elected to lead the fight against the Romanian military intervention in Bessarabia and the evacuation of Russian troops and ships that were surrounded in the Danube region. He was instructed to take 5 million rubles for expenses, as well as money for the field treasury of the troops of the Romanian Front and the Black Sea Fleet. Upon arrival in the Odessa Soviet Republic, he boarded the destroyer \\"Daring\\" in Vilkovo, where the ships of the Romanian Danube Flotilla were located, and took part in the hostilities. Upon returning to Odessa in mid-February, he led a special detachment of naval forces for the defense of coastal approaches to the city. He led the arrests of hostages, captured Romanian ships, and spoke a lot at rallies. In March 1918 he was appointed commander of the fortifications at Podilsk, which included significant reserves and military units. Receiving direct instructions from the commander of the Southern Front Vladimir Antonov- Ovseyenko, he led a detachment of 1,500 sailors and soldiers and participated in the hostilities against the Austro-German forces, with the retreating forces evacuated to the rear. Upon his return to Petrograd, he was appointed a member of the Political Department of the Naval General Staff, but in mid-June he again went to the front, this time to the Tsaritsyn area, where he was appointed commander of the First Elansky Infantry Regiment and participated in fierce battles against the Cossack troops of Pyotr Krasnov. Zhelezniakov opposed Trotsky's Red Army reorganization, which abolished self-organization and put tsarist officers in charge, as regressive. The conflict ended with his removal from the command of the regiment and Podvoisky ordered the arrest of Zhelezniakov. He was subsequently outlawed by the Bolsheviks, along with the anarchist Black Guards and Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine. He escaped arrest, but was forced to return to Moscow, where the Soviet Executive Committee chairman attempted to reconcile what he considered a misunderstanding by offering Zhelezniakov a high-ranking role, which he turned down. In this same period, he married Elena Nikolaevna Vind, a teacher in the Red Army. In October 1918, under the name \\"Victor\\", he was sent to work underground in Hetmanate-controlled Odessa. Working as a mechanic at a ship repair plant and having been elected to the board of the seamen's trade union, he was actively engaged in underground campaigning and at the same time became close to Grigory Kotovsky‚Äôs fighting squad. He participated in the anti- imperialist uprising as the units of the Red Army approached. After the occupation of Odessa by the Red Army on April 6, 1919 he was elected chairman of the merchant seafarers union. At this post he concluded agreements with the owners of enterprises and facilitated the relocation of multi-family dugouts and barracks into apartments and houses vacated after mass emigration. In early May 1919 he was appointed to the post of commander of an armored train, which he helped repair. In May - June he took part in the fight against the uprising of Nikifor Grigoriev, in July he was assigned to the Denikin front, where he participated in battles near Zaporizhia and Yekaterinoslav. Denikin put a contract on Zhelezniakov. ===Death and funeral=== Monument to Anatoli Zhelezniakov in Noginsk. On July 25, 1919, in a battle with Andrei Shkuro‚Äôs troops, the armored train under Zhelezniakov's command was ambushed by Denikin's artillery outside Ekaterinoslav. At the very last moment of the battle, when the armored train, backing up, had already escaped from the ambush, Zhelezniakov was wounded in the chest. The wound was fatal and on July 26, Anatoli Zhelezniakov died at the age of 24. Political Journal - LIVING HISTORY - Stepsons of the Revolution On August 3, in Moscow, the coffin holding Zhelezniakov's body was transported in an armored car, accompanied by a large number of sailors, fighting friends, comrades, acquaintances and relatives. The funeral procession proceeded from Novinskiy Boulevard, where the last farewell took place, to Vagankovo Cemetery, where his body was buried with all military honors. == Legacy == The Soviets, who outlawed and ostracized Zhelezniakov during his life, lauded him as a hero posthumously. Speeches in Moscow accompanied his burial. The Bolsheviks later built a statue in Kronstadt to honor Zhelezniakov's role in the October Revolution. Multiple songs and poems have been penned in his honor, though his remembrance is limited to his role as a revolutionary and martyr, without mention of his anarchist affiliation. Though he has been claimed to belong to leftist groups, Zhelezniakov was an anarchist and never joined the Bolshevik party. == See also == * Soviet destroyer Zheleznyakov, for which Zhelezniakov was the namesake == References == Category:1919 deaths Category:People of the Russian Revolution Category:Russian anarchists Category:Russian revolutionaries Category:Russian sailors ","title":"Anatoli Zhelezniakov"},{"id":"61728395","text":"{ +USFS Pelican } USFS Pelican was an American fisheries science research ship and fishery patrol vessel that operated along the United States East Coast and the United States Gulf Coast and in the waters of the Territory of Alaska. She was part of the United States Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) fleet from 1930 to 1940. She then served as US FWS Pelican in the fleet of the Fish and Wildlife Service ‚Äì from 1956 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ‚Äì from 1940 to 1958. She served as a fishery patrol vessel while on loan to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife from 1958 to 1970, then briefly returned to the Fish and Wildlife Service's successor agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service. Her United States Government service ended when she was sold into proivate hands in 1972, and she remained extant as of 2010. In 2017 Captain Patrick Burns and Captain John (Johnny) Sylvester purchased the Pelican from Marilyn Masland. She is currently moored in Deer Harbor on Orcas Island, WA. In 2018 she was brought up the Inside Passage to Alaska and back to Washington. ==Bureau of Fisheries== === Construction and characteristics=== Seattle, Washington, naval architect Harold Cornelius Hanson designed a number of vessels for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, and Pelican was among them.NOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center AFSC Historical Corner: Pelican, Impressive Service Coast to Coast He designed her to meet a BOF requirement for a research vessel which could conduct scientific work on the continental shelf along the United States East Coast at depths of up to . The resulting design was nearly identical to that of the BOF fishery patrol vessel ‚Äì which Hanson also designed and which had joined the BOF fleet in 1927 ‚Äì except for a extension to the after portion of her deckhouse to accommodate an on-board fisheries science laboratory. Her deckhouse also housed the captain‚Ä≤s room, a radio room, and the crew's mess; the captain's room included a chart table. Some of the deckhouse compartments were separated from one another, with self- sealing, high-threshold doors to her outer side decks providing access between them. She was of heavily planked construction; the planks were made of U.S. East Coast longleaf yellow pine on a white oak frame with Douglas fir decking. Her six-cylinder direct-reversible Winton diesel engine was mounted on four wooden timbers. An air compressor started the engine. Boat Harbor Marine Railway in Newport News, Virginia, constructed Pelican and launched her in 1930. She quickly completed fitting-out and was commissioned into service with the BOF fleet the same year. ===Operational history=== Upon commissioning in 1930, Pelican proceeded immediately to Boothbay Harbor, Maine, where she replaced the BOF vessel in performing fish culture work at the BOF's Boothbay Harbor station. She spent most of 1932 supporting a special International Passamaquoddy Fisheries Commission study of the potential for the construction of proposed power dams in Cobscook Bay and Passamaquoddy Bay on the coast of Maine to harm the area's food fish populations. She completed that work on 17 October 1932, and in 1933 took part in fishery studies in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Maine. She was taken out of service later in 1933. While out of service, Pelican underwent overhaul and modifications, including a major overhaul of her engine at Portland, Maine. After her engine overhaul was complete, Pelican underwent repairs and alterations at Fairhaven, Massachusetts, in 1936, including the installation of deck fittings, a electric generator, and a hydrographic winch with of steel cable for oceanographic work. Pelican returned to service in 1937, departing Fairhaven on 10 January 1937 bound for a new assignment in the Gulf of Mexico. Along the way, she stopped at the United States Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay in Baltimore, Maryland, where the United States Coast Guard provided her with a radio and an electric generator to power it, which Coast Guard personnel installed aboard her. She then moved on to Brunswick, Georgia, where she arrived on 22 January 1937. There she received additional minor alterations and took aboard fishing gear and hydrographic equipment. She departed Brunswick on 30 January 1937 bound for New Orleans, Louisiana. Although her small size limited her to operations within of the United States Gulf Coast and precluded lengthy stays at sea, Pelican arrived at New Orleans well equipped for deep-water hydrographic and biological surveys thanks to the work performed on her at Fairhaven, Curtis Bay, and Brunswick. She set to work in 1937 on an investigation of shrimp populations in the Gulf of Mexico, which she continued until 1940. She operated all along the U.S. Gulf Coast from Florida to Texas during these years, using exploratory offshore trawling, plankton hauls, and analyses of seawater salinity and geological bottom core samples to develop a scientific understanding of shrimp biology in the hope of establishing a viable commercial shrimp fishery in the Gulf of Mexico that could make up for declining shrimp populations in the Atlantic Ocean. Searching for evidence to support a theory that shrimp move to deeper waters in the winter after disappearing in the autumn from fishing grounds closer to shore, Pelican found brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus) in deeper water off the coast of Louisiana in 1938; this discovery allowed the development of a viable commercial shrimp-fishing industry in the Gulf of Mexico. By early 1940, she had expanded her shrimp investigation into the Atlantic Ocean off the southeastern United States, conducting shrimp surveys along the coast between Florida and North Carolina. ==Fish and Wildlife Service== US FWS Pelican sometime in 1948 or 1950In 1939, the BOF was transferred from the United States Department of Commerce to the United States Department of the Interior, and on 30 June 1940, it merged with the Interior Department's Division of Biological Survey to form the new Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), The vessel thus became part of the FWS fleet as US FWS Pelican. In early 1941, Pelican was loaded aboard the United States Navy cargo ship at Newport News. Vega transported her to Puget Sound in Washington, delivering her there at the end of April 1941. After undergoing an overhaul, she proceeded to the Territory of Alaska for service as an FWS fishery patrol vessel. In addition to patrol duties, she often serviced FWS trap and stream watchmen ‚Äì temporary FWS employees in Southcentral and Southeast Alaska who patrolled important fishing grounds and maintained lights and free-floating fish trapsNOAA Fisheries Alaska Fisheries Science Center AFSC Historical Corner: Stream Watchmen ‚Äì with supplies. In late 1941, she towed the FWS fishery patrol vessel USFS Eider, which had suffered damage when she ran aground on 24 October 1941 ‚Äì from Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada, to Seattle, Washington, for repairs. During World War II, the United States Army took control of Pelican, basing her at Seward, Territory of Alaska, in 1943‚Äì1944 and using her to transport personnel and supplies to lookout stations on Montague Island in the Gulf of Alaska. During this period, her material condition declined and she often required repairs and maintenance. Pelican returned to FWS control after World War II. While she was in Seattle for an overhaul sometime around 1947 or 1948, her original engine was replaced by a six-cylinder direct-reversing Joshua Hendy Iron Works diesel engine. Started by an air compressor, her new engine consumed about of diesel fuel per nautical mile (1.15 miles, 1.85 km) and gave her a cruising speed of and a maximum speed of . Under a major reorganization in 1956, the FWS became the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and a new Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF) was created as a component of the USFWS. Seagoing USFWS vessels, including Pelican, came under the control of the USFWS's new BCF. By 1957, the USFWS had based her at Juneau, Territory of Alaska, where she supported management operations. ==Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife== In 1958, the FWS loaned Pelican to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. The State of Washington used her for fishery patrols off the Washington coast until 1970. She was Washington's largest patrol vessel and the state's first to be equipped with radar. During her years with the Washington fishery patrol fleet, her Joshua Hendy engine was replaced with another Joshua Hendy engine of the same model. ==National Marine Fisheries Service== On 3 October 1970, a major reorganization occurred which formed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the United States Department of Commerce. As part of the reorganization, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries was removed from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, reorganized, and placed under NOAA as the new National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and Pelican thus came under NMFS control when Washington returned her to the United States Government in 1970 or 1971.Guinan, John A., and Ralph E. Curtis, \\"A Century Of Conservation,\\" noaa.gov, April 1971 Retrieved August 22, 2018 At first, the major ships that were to form the new NOAA fleet ‚Äì seagoing ships of the BCF fleet and those which formerly made up the fleet of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, which had been disestablished upon the creation of NOAA ‚Äì reported to separate entities, with former Coast and Geodetic Survey ships subordinate to the National Ocean Survey (the Coast and Geodetic Survey's successor organization within NOAA), while former BCF ships like Pelican reported to the BCF's successor within NOAA, the NMFS. Although the ships were resubordinated during 1972 and 1973 to form the unified NOAA fleet,noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner - Timeline of Significant Events Retrieved August 23, 2018 this change still lay in the future when NOAA sold Pelican into private ownership in 1972, bringing her U.S. Government career to an end. ==Later career== In 1972, Mr. and Mrs. Walt Masland purchased Pelican from NOAA for about US$16,000 in a sealed-bid auction at Seattle. Pelican had only 800 operating hours on her engine at the time of her sale. Over at least the next 38 years, the Maslands spent thousands of man-hours on restoring Pelican to nearly her original condition and to maintain her in that condition. As of 2010, Pelicans home port was Port Angeles, Washington, the Maslands still owned her, and her Joshua Hendy engine still provided her propulsion. As of 2018, Pelicans home port is Deer Harbor, Orcas Island, WA, purchased from the Maslands by Captain Patrick Burns and Captain John Sylvester. == References == Category:Fishery protection vessels Category:Ships of the United States Bureau of Fisheries Category:Ships of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Category:Ships of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Category:Ships built in Newport News, Virginia Category:1930 ships ","title":"USFS Pelican"},{"id":"61728409","text":"Aryans College of Law is a private law school situated beside Chandigarh- Patiala National Highway National Highway 7 (India) at Rajpura, Patiala in the Indian state of Punjab.

'Declaration of Rebellion' \\"Declaration of Rebellion\\" at the Parliament Square, 31 October 2018 An assembly took place at Parliament Square, London on 31 October 2018, and drew more than a thousand people to hear the \\"Declaration of Rebellion\\" against the UK government and speeches by Donnachadh McCarthy, 15-year-old Greta Thunberg, the Swedish schoolgirl \\"on strike\\" from school over her own government's climate inaction, Julia Bradbury, and Green MEP Molly Scott Cato in the square. After a motion was proposed and agreed, the assembly moved to occupy the road, where Green MP Caroline Lucas, environmentalist George Monbiot, and other speakers and singers, including Seize the Day, continued from the reclaimed street directly in front of the Houses of Parliament. Following this, 15 campaigners were arrested for deliberately continuing the sit-in in the roadway. In the first two weeks of the movement in November 2018, more than 60 people were arrested for taking part in acts of civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion. On 12 November 2018, activists blockaded the UK's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and some glued their hands to the department's doors. Activists unveiled a \\"Climate Change... We're Fucked\\" banner over Westminster Bridge and glued themselves to the gates of Downing Street, near the Prime Minister's official residence, on 14 November. In the evening of 15 November a large group closed the access road to Trafalgar Square outside the Brazilian Embassy in an joint action with Brazilian Women against Fascism UK. 'Rebellion Day' \\"Rebellion Day\\" on Blackfriars Bridge, 17 November 2018 On 17 November 2018, in what was called \\"Rebellion Day\\", about 6,000 people took part in a coordinated action to block the five main bridges over the River Thames in London (Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster, and Lambeth) for several hours, causing major traffic disruption; 70 arrests were made. The Guardian described it as \\"one of the biggest acts of peaceful civil disobedience in the UK in decades\\". YBA artist Gavin Turk was one of the activists arrested for obstructing the public highway. Elsewhere in the UK there was a rally in Belfast, while internationally there were more actions. Extinction Rebellion protesters in Tower Hill, 23 November 2018 From 21 November 2018, beginning a campaign known as 'swarming' roadblocks (repeated roadblocks of approximately 7 minutes each), small groups of Extinction Rebellion activists carried out protests by occupying road junctions at Lambeth and Vauxhall Bridges, Elephant and Castle, Tower Bridge and Earl's Court, causing serious disruption to rush-hour traffic and continuing throughout the day. Similar actions continued for the next two days in London, with one group moving to Oxford Street on the afternoon of the discount shopping day Black Friday. On 23 November, in a first action outside London, an Extinction Rebellion group in York stopped traffic on Coppergate, Clifford Street, Pavement and Ouse Bridge, as well as holding a demo outside West Offices of the City of York Council. An Oxford XR group blocked traffic on Botley Road on the same day. 'Rebellion Day 2' On \\"Rebellion Day 2\\", a week after the first, Extinction Rebellion blocked the roads around Parliament Square, before a mock funeral march to Downing Street and then onto Buckingham Palace. XR co-founder Gail Bradbrook read out a letter to the Queen, and one activist glued herself to the gates of the Palace, before the procession returned to Parliament Square. On 24 November there were actions outside London by XR groups in Manchester, Sheffield, Machynlleth and Edinburgh. On 15 December 2018, a professor of psychology was arrested for a \\"climate change graffiti attack\\" on the Bristol Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) building, and a \\"die-in\\" was held at a local shopping center. On 21 December 2018, actions were staged at BBC locations across the UK by Extinction Rebellion calling for a change in editorial policy, perceiving a \\"failure to report\\" on the \\"climate emergency.\\" BBC headquarters in London was placed on lockdown. ===2019=== January ‚Äì council actions On 25 January 2019, about 40 members of Extinction Rebellion staged a peaceful one-hour occupation of the Scottish Parliament's debating chamber in Holyrood, Edinburgh. Council chambers were also occupied by XR groups in Norwich on 11 February, and Gloucestershire, on 13 February, which included a mock trial of the council's \\"criminal negligence\\". February ‚Äì London Fashion Week An Extinction Rebellion march during the London Fashion Week in London, 22 February 2019 During London Fashion Week in February, Extinction Rebellion organised actions to disrupt events, calling on the British Fashion Council organisers to declare a 'climate emergency' and for the industry to take a leading role in tackling climate change. 'Swarming' roadblocks were held outside several venues; a couple of rebels wore living grass coats. Later in the week, designer and XR co-founder Clare Farrell, was barred from a fashion show by a label in which she had been involved with production. March Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of the Portsmouth City Council, joining in an Extinction Rebellion protest in Portsmouth, 19 March 2019 On 9 March 2019, around 400 protesters staged a \\"Blood of Our Children\\" demonstration outside Downing Street, in which they poured buckets of fake blood on the road to represent the threatened lives of children. As Portsmouth City Council passed a climate emergency motion, the 49th in the UK, protestors confronted leader Gerald Vernon-Jackson outside Portsmouth Guildhall. April ‚Äì House of Commons naked demonstration On 1 April 2019, around 12 protesters were arrested after undressing and gluing themselves to the glass in the House of Commons viewing gallery during a debate on Britain's intended departure from the European Union, with two of the protesters wearing grey body paint and elephant masks to draw attention to \\"the elephant in the room\\". XR activists attributed inspiration for the direct action to a suffragette protest in Parliament in 1909, when (non-nude) protesters chained themselves to statues. April ‚Äì occupations in London The pink boat with a slogan \\"tell the truth\\", named after Berta Caceres, was located in Oxford Circus on 18 April Starting from Monday 15 April 2019, Extinction Rebellion organised demonstrations in London, focusing their attention on Oxford Circus, Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge and the area around Parliament Square. Activists fixed a pink boat named after murdered Honduran environmental activist Berta C√°ceres in the middle of the busy intersection of Oxford Street and Regent Street (Oxford Circus) and glued themselves to it, and also set up several gazebos, potted plants and trees, a mobile stage and a skate ramp whilst also occupying Waterloo Bridge. Five activists, including XR co-founder Simon Bramwell, were arrested for criminal damage when they targeted Shell's headquarters, near Waterloo. After the police imposed a 24-hour Section 14 condition at 18:55 requiring activists to move to Marble Arch the police tried to clear Waterloo Bridge arresting 113 people, without gaining control of the bridge. On the second day of actions on Waterloo Bridge police began making arrests of the activists at 12.40 pm, but stopped a few hours later, after running out of holding cells. By the end of Tuesday 16 April an estimated 500,000 people had been affected by the disruptions and 290 activists had been arrested in London. In Scotland, more than 1,000 protesters occupied the North Bridge for seven hours in Edinburgh, bringing one of the main routes into the city centre to a standstill. Police said they made 29 arrests. On the morning of Wednesday 17 April two activists climbed onto the roof of a Docklands Light Railway train at Canary Wharf station whilst another glued himself to the side, spreading disruption to railway services. The following day the three activists were charged with obstructing trains and after pleading not guilty sent to jail for four weeks, with no bail, whilst awaiting their next hearing. In response to the protests, the British Transport Police suspended access to public Wi-Fi at London Underground stations the same day. Towards the end of Wednesday a large force of police marched on the camp at Parliament Square, arresting people and partially removing roadblocks before it was retaken later the same night by protesters who arrived with a samba band and re-established the roadblocks. At the start of Thursday 18 April, the fourth day of continuous occupations at four locations, the arrest figure had risen to 428, the majority for breaching public order laws and obstructing a highway. During the morning of 18 April about 20 XR activists spread traffic disruption wider with a series of swarming (short duration) roadblocks on Vauxhall Bridge. A mural appeared at Marble Arch after the closing ceremony on 25 April and this was attributed to the artist Banksy. The slogan \\"From this moment despair ends and tactics begin\\" is a quotation from The Revolution of Everyday Life. On the morning of 19 April, after significant media speculation about a threat to Heathrow Airport, around a dozen teenagers, some aged 13 and 14, approached the access road holding a banner which read ‚ÄúAre we the last generation?‚Äù Some of the teenagers wept and hugged each other, as they were surrounded by a far larger squad of police. In the middle of the day police moved in force to surround the pink boat as Emma Thompson read poetry from the deck, eventually removing the people who were either locked-on or glued to it. After seven hours police had moved the boat without clearing Oxford Circus. By late evening police said that 682 people had thus far been arrested in London. On 25 April thirteen protesters blockaded the London Stock Exchange by gluing themselves across its entrances, wearing LED signs. Despite this, the operation of the market was not affected. Another 4 protesters climbed on to a Docklands Light Railway train at Canary Wharf, and held the banners, which resulted in a short delay between Bank and Monument station and Stratford/Lewisham station. 26 people were arrested. In the afternoon, the activists gathered at Hyde Park as the \\"closing ceremony\\" of the movement, which ended the 11-day demonstrations in London. A total of 1,130 people were arrested during the demonstrations. As of June 2019, one protester, Angie Zelter, has been convicted of a public order offence for taking part in the occupations. July ‚Äì \\"Summer Uprising\\" \\"Summer Uprising\\", blocking Bristol Bridge on 16 July 2019 On 13 and 14 July a weekend of protest was held in East London, with a series of seven-minute Dalston traffic blockades, a mass bike ride through the A10, Olympic park traffic blocks, a people's assembly outside Hackney Town Hall, and all-day talks and panels in London Fields. This was the predecessor to a \\"Summer Uprising\\" from 08:00 on 15 July to 11:00 on 20 July, in Bristol, Leeds, Cardiff, Glasgow and London. Protests in the different cities focused on different threats: rising sea levels, floods, wildfires, crop failures and extreme weather, with a different coloured boat marked \\"Act Now\\" and other messages in each location. There was significant disruption to traffic in protest locations. September ‚Äì London Fashion Week Extinction Rebellion targeted London Fashion Week (LFW) in September 2019 with a number of actions in order to raise awareness about the environmental damage caused by the fashion industry‚Äî\\"the United Nations has said it uses more energy than the aviation and shipping industry combined\\". XR held a die-in outside LFW's official venue on 13 September. On 15 September it targeted Victoria Beckham's show with a swarm and protestors holding placards. On 17 September, about 200 people held a funeral march from Trafalgar Square to a H&M; store and to an LFW venue on The Strand; and people gave speeches about the unsustainability of the fashion industry and fast fashion. September ‚Äì Port of Dover blockade The protesters blocked the Bristol Bridge on 21 September 2019 On 21 September Extinction Rebellion Dover tried to blockade the Port of Dover by holding a legal protest on the westbound carriageway of the A20, which police had temporarily designated for that purpose. Vehicles were diverted onto the A2, but activists also superglued themselves to that road, blocking traffic in one direction. Giant banners were hung from Dover Castle and from the White Cliffs of Dover. The \\"No Food on a Dying Planet\\" action, which was concerned with the potential for food shortages resulting from climate change, was specifically held at Britain's busiest port because of the UK's \\"dependency\\" on food imports. Ten, mostly elderly people, were arrested. October On 3 October 2019 XR protesters used a fire engine to spray fake blood onto and around HM Treasury in central London. On 6 October XR held an 'opening ceremony' at Marble Arch attended by more than a thousand demonstrators. On 7 October, several thousand people had blocked locations across Westminster district‚Äî135 demonstrators were arrested. Two days prior to a plan to shut down parts of central London for at least two weeks, police raided a former court building in Lambeth partially being used as a preparation area, arresting ten people and removing solar panels, toilets and other equipment. The police were criticised for the use of pre-emptive arrests who countered that Extinction Rebellion were being irresponsible in their action of attempting to overwhelm police resources and that officers were being taken away from their core responsibilities.  International Rebellion  As part of a two-week series of XR actions which they called \\"International Rebellion\\", to take place in more than 60 cities worldwide, events were planned around London from 7 to 19 October to demand the UK government take urgent action to tackle the climate crisis. Despite much, and sometimes heavy, rain throughout this period, the protests went ahead. On 6 October an 'opening ceremony' at Marble Arch was attended by more than a thousand people. On 7 October, several thousand people shut down parts of Westminster in central London, blocking Whitehall, the Mall, Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Bridge, Trafalgar Square, Downing Street and Victoria Embankment. On 10 October at London City Airport, a sit-in was held at the exit of its DLR railway station, with activists supergluing themselves to the floor. Two flights were delayed by activists who had purchased tickets. Other activists climbed onto the terminal roof while former paralympian cyclist James Brown climbed atop a British Airways aircraft, livestreaming the event online. On 11 October, XR activists obstructed access to the BBC's Broadcasting House main doors. Princess Marie-Esm√©ralda of Belgium demonstrated with XR in London in April 2019, and was arrested, and later released, on 10 October after joining a sit- in protest at Trafalgar Square. She said \\"The more people from all sections of society protest, the greater the impact will be\\", and that, having the ear of high-ranking people, she raised climate issues whenever possible. Over 1000 arrests had been made by 11 October. On 12 October, XR held a \\"funeral procession\\" along Oxford Street which it claimed had 20,000 participants. The same day, animal rights activists of the group Animal Rebellion (affiliated with XR) said 28 of their supporters were arrested while attempting to block access to Billingsgate Fish Market. Beginning early on Monday 14 October, hundreds of XR activists occupied Bank junction, outside the Bank of England in the City of London, London's financial district, focussing on the financial institutions \\"funding environmental destruction\\". That night police, controversially, banned all the Extinction Rebellion protests from the whole of London, starting at 9 pm. Around the same time, police began clearing people and tents that remained at the camp on Trafalgar Square, cutting free and arresting people who had locked themselves in place; police had until then allowed the Square to be occupied. XR continued with a protest at the Department for Transport at 8 am on 15 October, during which Gail Bradbrook stood on top of the building's entrance until she was arrested. Bradbrook \\"called on ministers to explain how their continued expansion of roads and airports fitted with a net-zero emissions target.\\" There was much criticism of the police ban, described as \\"chilling and unlawful\\", by individuals and organisations. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, who would normally expect to work with the police, appeared to distance himself from the ban. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said the ban was a \\"huge over-reach of police power\\"; Liberty said it was \\"a grossly disproportionate move by the Met and an assault on the right to protest\\". XR applied for urgent judicial review of the ban. On 16 October, mothers of infants held a sit-in outside Google's London headquarters in King's Cross, in protest at the company's funding of climate deniers. At the same building, XR Youth climbed on top of the entrance to YouTube, with a banner reading \\"YouTube, stop climate denial\\", relating to its hosting of climate change denial videos. George Monbiot and Jonathan Bartley were arrested on Whitehall. On 17 October, XR activists targeted rail and underground services near to the Canary Wharf financial district by climbing onto or gluing themselves to trains at Shadwell, Stratford and Canning Town stations. At Canning Town, a largely working-class neighbourhood, an activist was dragged from the top of a tube train and beaten by angry commuters. XR's lack of class and race awareness, and the confused message in blockading public transport, was highlighted by many in the media. In a statement, XR apologised; elsewhere, one XR spokesman said the protest was \\"a huge own goal\\" while others in XR appreciated the significant media attention that it generated. More than 3,700 people took part in an online poll in advance of the action with 72% against it \\"no matter how it is done\\". In response, some in the affinity groups planning the action pulled out while others continued. The group's decentralised structure allows individual groups to act on their own. On the morning of 18 October, the final day of the \\"International Rebellion\\", Oxford Circus was blocked using a pyramid structure made of wooden poles, to which some people locked themselves on to and others climbed up. Later, a protester free solo climbed halfway up Big Ben using the scaffolding currently surrounding it, and unfurled two large banners, reading: \\"No pride on a dead planet\\" and \\"Citizens Assembly\\". On 20 October, a protest performance piece was made in the National Portrait Gallery against its sponsorship by BP, who XR claims is \\"funding extinction\\". Three protestors lay on the gallery floor wearing only underwear while others poured fake oil over them; a monologue was given and information handed out. The protest was on the final day of the BP Portrait Award exhibition and in a room in which pieces sponsored by BP were on display. Hunger strike Some XR activists took part in a global hunger strike that began on 18 November, involving 526 people in 28 countries, 263 of whom were in the UK. The hunger strike was \\"intended to show how the climate crisis is already urgently affecting people in many parts of the world.\\" Although most ended their strike around 23/24 November, by 27 November a handful from Extinction Rebellion continued, stationed outside Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat party headquarters in London. Their request was for all political party leaders to agree to meet them and pledge support for XR's Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill. \\"Election Rebellion: Twelve Days Of Crisis\\" On 4 December about half a dozen activists dressed in yellow-and-black bee outfits held an action during Liberal Democrats' campaigning for the 2019 UK general election in Streatham, south London. One such activist glued himself to the windscreen of the Liberal Democrats' battle bus. On 9 December activists blockaded a central London road to demand the next government tackles air pollution in London. They wore gas masks and glued their hands to breeze blocks in the middle of Cranbourn Street, outside Leicester Square tube station. Activists also blockaded Great Ancoats Street in Manchester, a major route for commuters, during rush hour with a wooden construction and banners. ===2020=== On 17 February, Extinction Rebellion members of the University of Cambridge assembled to dig up a patch of lawn outside of Trinity College, as a protest against the College continuing to invest its endowments in oil and gas companies. The mud dug up was later taken to a local branch of Barclays Bank. == New York City actions == On 17 November 2018, in what was called \\"Rebellion Day\\", there was a rally in New York City. On January 26, 2019, the newly formed Extinction Rebellion NYC conducted its first action, with activists forming the Extinction Symbol with their bodies on the ice at the Rockefeller Center ice skating rink. An activist climbed and hung a banner on the large gold Prometheus statue reading \\"Climate Change = Mass Murder, Rebel for Life, Intl Rebellion Week April 15, 2019\\". Nine people were arrested. Die-in protest at New York City Hall, 17 April 2019 On April 17, 2019, over 60 activists were arrested at a die-in in the streets around New York City Hall. Two activists climbed light posts and hung a banner reading \\"Declare Climate Emergency\\" along with the Extinction Symbol. In addition to Extinction Rebellion's general demands, a specific demand of the action was that New York City formally declare a climate emergency and call for an emergency mobilization to ensure a safe climate. In this regard, the action was successful, in that on June 26, 2019, the New York City Council unanimously passed Resolution No. 0864‚Äì2019, declaring a climate emergency and calling for an emergency mobilization, becoming the first large US city to do so. On June 22, 2019, 70 activists with Extinction Rebellion NYC were arrested for blocking traffic outside of The New York Times headquarters in midtown Manhattan. Protesters formed the Extinction Symbol with their bodies on Eighth Avenue, rappelled from the roof of the Port Authority Bus Terminal with a banner that read \\"Climate Emergency\\" and climbed on top of the large glass awning of The New York Times Building with sound equipment and signage. The protest called for more urgent climate coverage by the New York Times and other media outlets, including through adherence to the group's publicly available media standards. Extinction Rebellion NYC continued to protest the quality of The New York Times' climate coverage through smaller actions outside the newspaper's headquarters, with particular focus on the Times' proposed sponsorship of an oil industry conference, Oil and Money 2019, scheduled for fall 2019 in London. In response, on September 3, 2019, the New York Times dropped its sponsorship of this conference, on the basis that the subject matter \\"gives us cause for concern.\\" Protesters at the Wall Street, 7 October 2019 Beginning in the summer of 2019, Extinction Rebellion NYC members began a campaign of raising awareness of the climate crisis by making speeches and circulating information in subway cars. On August 10, 2019, over 100 people were arrested at a protest demanding that RXR Realty evict the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) from the Starrett‚ÄìLehigh Building due to the human rights abuses occurring at the US-Mexico border and ICE's role in mass deportations. This action, which involved protesters shutting down the West Side Highway, was co-sponsored by Extinction Rebellion NYC, Movimiento Cosecha, the NYC DSA Immigration Justice Working Group, and the Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council. On September 5, 2019, members of Extinction Rebellion blocked traffic at multiple intersections in midtown Manhattan and performed dance routines to bring attention to the ongoing fires in Amazonia. On September 6, 2019, an activist with Extinction Rebellion became the first person in over 40 years to climb the Unisphere, a 140-foot- high (43m) stainless steel globe in Queens, New York. He hung a banner saying ‚ÄúZERO CO2 2025, CLIMATE JUSTICE NOW‚Äù, along with the Extinction Symbol, over South America to draw attention to the fires ravaging Amazonia. On October 7, 2019, Extinction Rebellion activists threw fake blood over Wall Street's Charging Bull sculpture. ==Australian actions== \\"Declaration Day\\" at the Victorian State Government, 22 March 2019 Extinction Rebellion Australia held a 'Declaration Day' on 22 March 2019 in Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney, and Brisbane. Demonstrators assembled and protested to demand that governments and media declare a state of climate emergency. On the eve of international Rebellion Day, 15 April, an XR group occupied the Parliament of Australia's lower house, the House of Representatives. On 19 April XR activists disrupted a railway line in Brisbane. ==Actions elsewhere== On 17 November 2018 there was a \\"Rebellion Day\\" action by the XR group in Stockholm, as well as rallies in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Copenhagen, Berlin, and Madrid. On 15 April 2019, XR activists occupied part of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, forming human chains before being arrested. Similar actions were organised by XR groups in Berlin, Heidelberg, Brussels, Lausanne, Madrid, and Denver. On 11 September 2019, the Zurich wing of Extinction Rebellion dyed the Limmat river, the main river that flows through the centre of the Swiss city, luminous green. XR activists floated face up and motionless in the river, and floated downstream in imitation of dead bodies. The action was done to highlight the various ways global warming threatens water. On 23 September 2019, at least 8 people were arrested during a Denver XR protest at the intersection of Speer Blvd. and Broadway for disrupting traffic to raise awareness of the group. On the same day, an XR protest in Los Angeles closed Sunset Boulevard for evening rush hour, with no arrests reported. On 10 October 2019 five activists, one woman and four men were arrested after chaining themselves to the gates of the Irish parliament, the Dail Eireann. On 29 November 2019, on a pseudo-holiday known as \\"Black Friday, traffic outside the Cherry Creek Mall in Denver was brought to a standstill at the hands of protesters. Extinction Rebellion Colorado blocked traffic by positioning a sleigh in the middle of East 1st Avenue, and locking people to the sleigh by their necks. The protest was aimed at showing the correlation between consumerism and environmental impact. The protest blocked traffic for three hours, as police and firefighters worked to safely detach the protesters from the sleigh they were locked to. Instead of cutting the locks around their necks, firefighters sawed off the poles to the sleigh, freeing the protesters from their position. Four people were arrested and cited for impeding a roadway and disobedience to a lawful officer. ==Notes== ==References== == External links == * * XR Declaration ‚Äì The Extinction Rebellion \\"Declaration of Rebellion\\" live from Parliament Square with Greta Thunberg, Donnachadh McCarthy, George Monbiot, Molly Scott and Dr Gail Bradbrook ‚Äì 31 October 2018 Category:2018 protests Category:2019 protests Category:Demonstrations Category:Direct action Category:Ongoing protests Category:Radical environmentalism Category:Extinction Rebellion ","title":"Timeline of Extinction Rebellion actions"},{"id":"61728498","text":"Weng Zuliang (; born July 1963) is a Chinese politician, serving since 2016 as the Communist Party Secretary of Pudong New Area, a major economic development zone in Shanghai. ==Life and career== Weng was born in Fuqing County, Fujian.

It is the headquarters of Lincolnshire County Council. ==History== The frontage of Newland House, a Grade II listed building, which forms part of the northern elevation of the northern quadrangle In the late 19th century and early 20th century meetings of Lindsey County Council were held at County Hall, Lincoln Castle. After deciding the old county hall was inadequate for their needs, county leaders chose to procure a new county headquarters: the site selected they selected was the substantial grounds of a house known as Newland House which had been designed by William Hayward in the classical style and completed in 1824. Council officials purchased the estate from the executors of the local coal merchant, William John Warrener. Construction started with the demolition of everything except the original facade of Newland House in 1926. The new building was designed by Scorer and Gamble in a Neo-Georgian style and was officially opened by the chairman of the county council, George Edward Heneage, 2nd Baron Heneage, in 1932. The new structure was built around two quadrangles. The first phase was the northern facade and quadrangle (which incorporated the original facade of Newland House) and the second phase was the southern facade and quadrangle which was built with red brick and innovative concrete dressings. The third phase involved inserting an Art Deco staircase into Newland House.Lincoln City Building applications. 6219, 8 February 1926; 6863 18 November 1930, 7136, 21 August 1933 The design for the main building involved a symmetrical main frontage with fifteen bays facing onto Newland with the end bays slighted projected forwards; the central section featured a portico with paired Doric Order columns and balustraded parapet; there were sash windows on the first and second floors with a stone surround which extended to both floors. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber. Pevsner described the building as \\"all somewhat dry and academic\\". Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1972, the building became the headquarters of the newly-created Lincolnshire County Council in 1974. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in Lincolnshire L Category:Government buildings completed in 1932 ","title":"County Offices, Lincoln"},{"id":"61728705","text":"Leonard Oscroft Lindley (22 February 1861 ‚Äì 3 May 1915) was an English first- class cricketer and footballer.

Leonhardt, born October 12, 1952 -- is a German scientist in the fields of International Relations and economic history, especially in the realm of cartel history and theory. He was born in Manila (Philippines) the son of Brigitte and Arno Leonhardt.Leonhardt: Die Europ√§ische Wirtschafts- und W√§hrungsgemeinschaft als Sanierungsgemeinschaft. In: Michael Gehler et alii (ed.): Banken, Finanzen und Wirtschaft im Kontext europ√§ischer und globaler Krisen. Hildesheim [u.a.] 2015, p. 689. Arno became a German expatriate since 1930, moving up the career ladder from accountant to vice director in the branch office of an American paper machine company in Manila. Brigitte came from a liberal merchant family in Saxony (Germany) holding critical distance to the Nazi regime.Leonhardt: Die Europ√§ische Wirtschafts- und W√§hrungsgemeinschaft als Sanierungsgemeinschaft. In: Michael Gehler et alii (ed.): Banken, Finanzen und Wirtschaft im Kontext europ√§ischer und globaler Krisen. Hildesheim [u.a.] 2015, p. 689. == Education and early scientific work == Leonhardt studied politics, sociology, economic theory and public law at the German universities of G√∂ttingen and Hannover. In 1983, he completed his PhD at University of Bremen with a work on ¬´political conflicts in the European Community 1950‚Äì1983¬ª. Subsequently, he published a number of subject- related articles. == Professional life as an academic librarian == To make a living, Leonhardt started to be educated and to work as an academic librarian (1985‚Äì2018). His professional thesis of 1987 was about the distinction of archival, librarian und museum materials.Leonhardt: Was ist Bibliotheks-, was Archiv- und Museumsgut? Ein Beitrag zur Katalogisierung von Dokumentationsgut und -institutionen. In: Bibliotheksdienst 23 (1989), pp. 891‚Äì904. Since 1989 he was occupied at the Library of Hildesheim University, where he more and more concentrated on subject cataloguing. 2015‚Äì2018, he created a new type of library classification for cultural studies to be able to classify books according to a multiple-arts cultural aesthetics.Leonhardt: Systematik ‚Äû√Ñsthetische Kulturwissenschaft ‚Äúan der Universit√§tsbibliothek Hildesheim. Ein Innovationsbericht. In: o-bib. Das offene Bibliotheksjournal 5 (2018), issue 3, pp. 118‚Äì134 == Later academic research == From 2007 on, Leonhardt continued active research work shifting to the field of economic history and economic organization. Since the 1970s, he became interested in cartels as a special phenomenon of social organization. For this comeback to research, Leonhardt has been advised by the Hildesheim historian Michael Gehler from the Institute of History at Hildesheim University.Michael Gehler: Vorwort des Reihenherausgebers. In: Leonhardt: Kartelltheorie und Internationale Beziehungen. Theoriegeschichtliche Studien. Hildesheim 2013, pp. 17‚Äì25. Since 2008, Leonhardt again published several subject related articles and in 2013 a comprehensive work on ¬´Cartel theory and International Relations¬ª being ¬´theory-historical studies¬ª. == Research profile and methodology == Leonhardt has worked interdisciplinary combining social, economic, juridical and cultural sciences. He has applied a structural-functional method of analysis. In his recent studies he additionally used ideology-critical and linguistic methods for the deconstruction of scientific concepts and tenets.e.g. Leonhardt: Kartelltheorie und Internationale Beziehungen. Theoriegeschichtliche Studien. Hildesheim 2013, pp. 743‚Äì758. In terms of rule and power, he has applied marxist argumentations of class rule, political hegemony and imperialism. Leonhardt has a favourite research perspective: the competition or rivalry between social actors. Already in his study about the European community, he used the inter-governmental rivalry about power potentials (economic, military and political factors) as leading concept.Leonhardt: Europa konstitutionell. Politische Machtk√§mpfe in der EG 1950‚Äì1983. pp. 28‚Äì37. Later. In his engagement for cartel theory, he focused on the internal competition between the cartel members.Leonhardt: Kartelltheorie und Internationale Beziehungen. Theoriegeschichtliche Studien. Hildesheim 2013, p. 115, 132, 137, 196, 428, 455, 749. Particularly for international relations, he gave examples about relevant analytical gaps which other authors had left out of recognition. == Central results and theses == * Cartels = a wide-spread social constellation - Social actors almost never have exactly the same interests, but more or less tensions among each other. Thus, the perspective of competition and (for an organized solution) of cartel building can be applied. The author stands for a wide definition of ‚Äπcartel‚Ä∫ in the sense of an ‚Äπalliance of rivals‚Ä∫. To him, all coalitions to pursue special interests can be analyzed as cartels.Leonhardt: Kartelltheorie und Internationale Beziehungen. Theoriegeschichtliche Studien. Hildesheim 2013, pp. 193‚Äì199. Typical for such associations, the economic as well as the non- economic ones, is their permanent management of conflicts and interests. * IGOs = cartels - International inter-governmental organizations can be set equal with cartels. For Leonhardt this is true for organizations like the United Nations, the European Union and the NATO.Particularly on EU: Leonhardt: Die Europ√§ische Union im 21. Jahrhundert. Ein Staatenkartell auf dem Weg zum Bundesstaat? . In: Michael Gehler (ed.), From Common Market to European Union Building. 50 years of the Rome Treaties 1957‚Äì2007, Wien 2009, pp. 702‚Äì715. * Some NGOs = cartels - Also international NGOs (if non-hierarchical) can be set equal with cartels. Among them the International Federation of Association Football or the World Council of Churches can be named as examples.Leonhardt: Kartelltheorie und Internationale Beziehungen. Theoriegeschichtliche Studien. Hildesheim 2013, p. 197. * Not all so-called ‚Äûcartels‚Äú are cartels ‚Äì An inflexible scientific understanding has led to difficulties in differentiation. Subsequently, complex structures like price fixing of the second level have been simplified to a ‚Äûcartel‚Äú.Leonhardt: Kartelltheorie und Internationale Beziehungen. Theoriegeschichtliche Studien. Hildesheim 2013, p. 130. Similarly, state controlled formations have been named ‚Äûcartels‚Äú, when they set prices and quantities, such as the ‚Äûcompulsory cartels‚Äú working for govermental targets. * \\"Cartel\\" stands unter ideological suppression - The subject ‚Äòcartel‚Äô underwent a diffamation process or negative ideological turn since the end of WW II: ‚ÄúAfter World War II, cartels were ‚Äì according to the American antitrust norm of ‚Äπtrade restrictions‚Ä∫ ‚Äì criminalized rather soon and then were generally declared as obsolete. The word ‚Äπcartel‚Ä∫ became a formula for condemnation, used for instance for ‚Äπdrug cartels‚Ä∫ or for the assertion, Auschwitz had been run by a cartel, namely the ‚ÄπI.G. Farben Industries‚Ä∫ (which actually was no cartel, but a corporate group).‚Ä∫.‚ÄùLeonhardt: The development of cartel+ theory between 1883 and the 1930s. Hildesheim 2018, p. 76. Because of this, an unbiased debate and scientific work on cartels is difficult to reach. * Cartel buildings are excluded from monument protection - The rejection of the subject ‚Äòcartel‚Äô has gone so far that the historical heritage is in danger: there is almost no monument protection of former cartel buildings as a historical heritage. Leonhardt complaints that occasionally such business facilities have been torn down without much thought. The former central-selling-syndicates for commodities may have employed hundreds of office workers for marketing operations and sales administration. So, these bodies often domiciled in large and representative premises which might be historically informative now. But: ‚ÄúOn none of those former cartel headquarters there is a commemorative plaque telling: Here, in bygone times, there had been a sales cartel for steel, coal, potash ...‚ÄùLeonhardt: The development of cartel+ theory between 1883 and the 1930s. Hildesheim 2018, p. 4. * A novel cartel theory? ‚Äì Has Leonhardt set up a new cartel theory? - This is not really clear from the statements of the scholarly scene. - Leonhardt himself only claimed to have made some necessary adjustments to the self- contradictory corpus of classical cartel theory.Leonhardt: Kartelltheorie und Internationale Beziehungen. Theoriegeschichtliche Studien. Hildesheim 2013, p. 140-205. However, he did make profiled and original statements about the nature of intergovernmental organizations and international relations, but again he referred to older thinkers like Karl Kautsky and others who had already outlined the vision of an ultra-imperialism or a cartel of mighty states in the early 20th century. Anyhow, interested scientists like Kleinschmidt, Roelevink, Schroeter and Berghahn actually understood Leonhardt's endeavor as a trial of a \\"new theory\\" or theoretical improvements.; Eva-Maria Roelevink (2016): Warum weniger eine neue Theorie als vielmehr eine neue empirische Kartellforschung notwendig ist. In: Zeitschrift f√ºr Unternehmensgeschichte/Journal of Business History, vol. 61, issue 1, p. 116‚Äì120; Harm G. Schroeter (2017): Quo vadis Kartelldiskurs?.

A comment on the discussions between Leonhardt, Roelevink and Berghahn. In: Zeitschrift f√ºr Unternehmensgeschichte/Journal of Business History, vol. 62, issue 2, p. 299-301. == The directional dispute about Cartel History Studies == In his 2013 book about cartel theory, Leonhardt had criticized the newer cartel history studies as affected by neoliberal influence. In the broad average, the intellectual level of the formerly famous and brilliant German cartel theory had not been maintained. Analytic and conceptual flaws were to be found in a number of post-war publications. The research perspectives often suffered from an uncritical attitude to the American anti-cartel policy since Second World War. This criticism became an issue in a counter-critical review by Eva Maria Roelevink, who vetoed strongly.Roelevink, Eva-Maria (2015): [Review of] Holm A. Leonhardt: Kartelltheorie und Internationale Beziehungen. Hildesheim, Vol. 60, issue 1, p. 110-112. In a response to her utterances, Leonhardt attributed her to a ‚ÄúBochum school‚Äù of business history, which was to him the leading network, which stood for a more or less biased understanding of cartels and cartel history. Leonhardt, Holm Arno (2016): Erwiderung auf die Rezension von Eva-Maria Roelevink in ZUG 1/60/2015, S. 110-112: Holm A. Leonhardt, Kartelltheorie und Internationale Beziehungen.

Causal for this, he contended, was an unreflected proximity to the doctrines of neoliberalism and American scientific leadership. This dispute led in 2016/17 to a series of five articles by Leonhardt, Roelevink and the three senior scholars Volker Berghahn, Harm Schr√∂ter and Martin Shanahan (Univ. of Australia). Several positions of the Leonhardt book were taken up in these articles.Holm Arno Leonhardt: Zum Richtungsstreit in der Kartellgeschichtsforschung (On the directional dispute in cartel history research).

It is a few miles from Abeokuta. It is home to one of the oldest churches in the area, St. Michael's Anglican Church, and home to Odegbami International College and Sports Academy. ==History== The name Wasinmi comes from the phrase in the Yoruba language, w√°√† ·π£e isimi, which means come and rest. It was shortened to Wasinmi, and it was founded between the years 1845-1880.https://www.jstor.org/stable/41971356?seq=1 It started as a small farming settlement for mostly Egba people of Abeokuta. When the town of Abeokuta was founded in 1830, there were many waves of migrants from all over Yorubaland that arrived in Abeokuta. This included Owu refugees from the Owu- Ibadan Wars, Saros from Sierra Leone that returned after being kidnapped and taken nto slavery, and Christian missionaries. Though the area was occupied by Egba people from Abeokuta already, it served as more of a market place than a permanent place of residence. Many men and women then sought to establish plantations and farms that were unavailable in the mostly urban town of Abeokuta. A certain group of people, who also included Christians seeking a separate place to practice their faith, founded Wasinmi and established several farms and churches.https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/41971356.pdfhttps://research- information.bris.ac.uk/files/34504889/511681.pdf Wasinmi is one of the 72 townships under Gbagura. The Egba Gbagura people are one of the 4 subsections of Abeokuta, which includes Oke-Ona Egba, Egba Ake, and Owu, but Wasinmi has a mix of other Egbas besides Gbagura. The Gbagura people originated from Ile-Ife like many other Yoruba sub-ethnic groups. They then migrated along what is now the Ibadan-Oyo-Offa Road and Ibadan-Owo Road and met the other groups at the Egba Forest outside what is now Abeokuta in 1834.In the early 1900s, the British administration built a train station in the village, which was a major site of the Adubi War in 1918, also known as the Egba Uprising. St. Michael's Anglican Church was the first church built in the village by newly converted natives, most likely in c. 1920. Odafin Odegbami (c. 1842-1934), ancestor to Amos Tutuola, the Ogunbiyi family, and Odegbami family (including Segun Odegbami and Wole Odegbami) which are very prominent and influential families in Wasinmi, was a spiritual leader and appointed administrator as detailed in Tutuola's book The Palm Wine Drinkard, and was most likely one of the founders of Wasinmi.

Anderson (February 18, 1926 - March 24, 2017) was a Choctaw author and indigenous rights activist. Though Anderson has published two books, Jamestown Commitment: The Episcopal Church and the American Indian and 400 Years: Anglican/Episcopal Mission Among American Indians, and co-authored multiple other publications, she is most recognized for her work with the Native American Ministries of the Episcopal Church as well as for her achievements in improving the lives of indigenous peoples, especially women. Anderson held a variety of jobs throughout her professional career that focused on expanding women's access to healthcare as well as their educational and professional opportunities. == Early life == Owanah Patricia Anderson was born on February 18, 1926 in Choctaw County, Oklahoma to parents Samantha (Jones) and John Boyt Pickens. She had a brother, Lon Michael Pickens, and attended high school in Boswell, Oklahoma, where she was elected as valedictorian of her graduating class. She then went on to earn a degree in journalism at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma with the financial aid of a merit-based scholarship. == Career and activism == === For indigenous women === Anderson participated in the 1977 National Women's Conference in Houston, Texas by acting as co- chairperson of the Texas executive committee for the state conference preceding the national one. Efforts of the women involved led to the National Women's Agenda's approval. The comprehensive agenda called for reproductive freedom, action against rape and violence, action in support of lesbian rights and the rights of women of color, and the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Following her involvement in the 1977 Women's Conference, she worked to raise awareness on Native American women's issues regarding access to healthcare and educational opportunities by serving on the Committee on Rights and Responsibilities of Women formed by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for about three years until 1980. From 1978 to 1981, Anderson also served on President Jimmy Carter's Advisory Committee on Women. In 1979, she founded and directed the Ohoyo Resource Center for the U.S. Department of Education to provide women with resources needed to network and advance their careers. Ohoyo is actually the Choctaw word for \\"woman\\", and the resource guide Anderson co-authored, Ohoyo One Thousand: Resource Guide of American Indian and Alaska Native Women, definitely positively impacted indigenous women's lives, especially when it helped keep the women connected to their networks when the center closed down in 1983. Furthermore, during her time working with the Association on American Indian Affairs, she directed the National Women's Development Program. === With the Episcopal Church === Anderson moved to New York in 1983 following the Ohoyo Research Center's closing to join the National Committee on Indian Affairs of the Episcopal Church as chairperson, where she was in charge of the annual $1.5 million budget allocated to fund Episcopal missions for Native American communities until her retirement in 1998. She also assisted in the development of the Anglican Indigenous People's Network of the Pacific Rim, which created a network that enabled diverse groups of indigenous peoples of many different countries around the Pacific, such as Hawaii, Australia, and New Zealand to come together, connect, and learn from and about each other. === For indigenous peoples === In 1980, Anderson was the only Native American representative for the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe that was held that year in Madrid, Spain. Anderson was an active member of the Association on American Indian Affairs from 1985 to 2000, which is a non- profit organization that focuses on advocating for Native American and Alaska Native peoples' rights and welfare. She dedicated fifteen years of her life to this specific organization and mission, for most of which she served on the board of directors. In the late 1980's, she also became involved with the national treaty rights organization HONOR, which works to ensure that the many existing tribal treaties are honored by the U.S. government. == Works authored == *In 1980, Anderson compiled and edited the Resource Guide of American Indian and Alaska Native Women along with co-author Sedelta D. Verble, which was published in 1981. The document listed more than six hundred prominent Native American and Alaska Native women of over one hundred and fifty tribes throughout the United States and provided the women's names, tribal affiliation, addresses, contact information, current employment information, activities and involvement in advocacy, educational backgrounds, and professional interests as a strong networking tool. In 1982, the document was republished as Ohoyo One Thousand: Resource Guide of American Indian and Alaska Native Women as an expanded edition with now more than one thousand women listed and two hundred and thirty one tribes represented. *In 1988, Anderson published Jamestown Commitment: The Episcopal Church and the American Indian about the Episcopal Church's missions in the early years of interaction between European colonists and Native American communities. The book paints early requests made by tribal leaders for missionaries to educate tribes on Christianity and the English language as significant parts of Native American history that should be remembered. *In 1992, she published her book 100 Years: Good Shepherd Mission in the Navajo Nation 1892-1992, which elaborated on Episcopal missionary efforts specifically in relation to the Navajo Nation. * In 1997, Anderson's book, 400 Years: Anglican/Episcopal Mission Among American Indians, was published as an expansion on her previous book, Jamestown Commitment. == Awards and honors == * Anderson received the 1981 Anne Roe Award for public service from the Harvard University Graduate School of Education. * In 1984, she became a member of the North Texas Women's Hall of Fame. * In 1987, Anderson was honored by the National Coalition of Women of Color. * In 1989, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Seabury-Western Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church in Evanston, Illinois. *In 2014, the Association on American Indian Affairs (AAIA) named a merit-based scholarship after her. == Scholarship == In recognition of Anderson's strong leadership and 15-year commitment to the Association on American Indian Affairs (AAIA), the non-profit organization decided to name an annual merit- based scholarship after her. The scholarship, first awarded for the 2014-2015 academic year, provides funding to indigenous women who are enrolled tribal citizens of the continental United States or Alaska for pursuing an Associate's degree or higher as full time students. To be eligible, students must at least have a 2.5 out of 4.0 GPA and be enrolled in a tribe, regardless of whether it is recognized at federal or state levels. == Personal life == Sometime after graduating high school, Anderson married her first husband and had a son, Steven Shelton, who she raised on her own. The couple divorced, and later she met Henry Anderson, an attorney in Wichita Falls, Texas, whose children she helped raise. In 1983, Henry Anderson passed away, and Owanah Anderson moved to New York to become chairperson of the National Committee on Indian Affairs of the Episcopal Church. == Death == Owanah Anderson died on March 24, 2017 in Wichita Falls, Texas after a decade of declining health, at 91 years old. She was surrounded by her son, Steven Shelton and others during her last moments and was buried at All Saints' Church in Wichita Falls at 10 AM on Wednesday, March 27, 2017. She is survived by her son, two grandsons, three great grandchildren, two stepdaughters, stepson, sister-in-law, and many step grandchildren, all of whom she loved. == References == Category:Choctaw people Category:Native Americans' rights activists Category:1926 births Category:2017 deaths Category:American women activists Category:Activists from Oklahoma Category:People from Choctaw County, Oklahoma Category:20th-century American Episcopalians Category:21st-century American Episcopalians Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:20th-century American women writers Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:University of Oklahoma alumni Category:Native American women writers ","title":"Owanah Anderson"},{"id":"61728976","text":"La clemenza di Tito is a 127-minute studio album of the opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, performed by Dame Janet Baker, Stuart Burrows, Robert Lloyd. Yvonne Minton, Lucia Popp and Frederica von Stade with the Chorus and Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, under the direction of Sir Colin Davis. It was released in 1977. ==Background== The album was taped a few years after theatrical performances of La clemenza di Tito at Covent Garden in which Baker, Burrows, Lloyd and Minton sang the same roles as they do on the recording, and in which Davis was also the conductor. The staging, first seen in 1973, was produced by Antony Besch and designed by John Stoddart.http://www.rohcollections.org.uk/production.aspx?production=4198&row;=0http://www.rohcollections.org.uk/performance.aspx?performance=119248&row;=0Gramophone, April 1992, p. 160Gramophone, November 1977, pp. 886-893 The album does not present an entirely complete version of the opera, several passages of recitativo secco being omitted. The Covent Garden orchestra plays with modern instruments rather than the kind that were used in Mozart's own era. ==Recording== The album was recorded using analogue technology in July 1976 at an unspecified location in London.W. A. Mozart: La clemenza di Tito, cond. Colin Davis, Philips CD, 420 097-2, 1987 ==Packaging== The cover of the first CD issue of the album is the work of Akamori Ralf Krieger. ==Critical reception== ===Reviews=== The Emperor Titus Vespasianus imagined by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema in 1885 The musicologist Stanley Sadie reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in November 1977. Philips's casting of Dame Janet Baker and Yvonne Minton had given the recording \\"immense strength and dramatic vitality at its centre\\", he wrote. As Vitellia, the bitter daughter of a deposed emperor trying to manipulate her lover into murdering her father's successor, Baker was by turns subtle or domineering as the moment required. She sang with a \\"marvellous firmness and evenness of tone and steadiness of line\\", falling into imperfection only when Mozart took her higher up the stave than she was comfortable with. In the castrato role of Sesto, the infatuated instrument of Vitellia's scheming, Yvonne Minton delivered a performance that was arguably more impressive still. She was equally successful at portraying both sides of Sesto's character: the youth besotted with his vengeful mistress, and the \\"Roman of the highest standards of honour, courage and resolve\\" torn by the competing claims of duty and desire. And as well as singing with \\"real dramatic power\\", Minton displayed \\"virtuosity of a high order\\". Pure, superb and magnificent were just some of the accolades that Sadie bestowed on her vocalism, although he acknowledged that sometimes. like Baker, she perpetrated an imperfect note which should have been mended by a retake. Stuart Burrows was scarcely less good as the third of the opera's principals, \\"a strong Tito, lyrical when he [was] being gentle and merciful, yet with a force ... in the more imperial music that [made] him a plausible figure as a Roman emperor.\\" Frederica von Stade did splendidly in another Mozart en travesti role to set beside her Cherubino, singing Annio with force and true rhetorical power in the scene where the young man advised Sesto to throw himself on Tito's mercy. In the other secondary roles, Lucia Popp was affecting as an argent-bright Servilia and Robert Lloyd was \\"properly sturdy\\" as the Praetorian soldier, Publio. Covent Garden's orchestra played splendidly, with the opera's famous obbligato clarinet and basset-horn obbligatos both dispatched with distinction. Conducting, Davis infused the album with all the energy of a live performance, eliciting \\"taut rhythms, firm accents [and] a general urgency\\". It was obvious that Davis, his orchestra and several of his soloists had profited greatly having presented Tito at Covent Garden. Well recorded and well balanced, the album was certainly the best version of the opera yet committed to disc. Pietro Metastasio, in a portrait attributed to Batoni Eric Salzman reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in May 1978. Janet Baker, he wrote, sang with \\"a good deal of passion - a quality not always associated with her beautiful and sometimes remote vocal sound - as Vitellia\\". Stuart Burrows's Tito was \\"strong\\", Lucia Popp's Servilia \\"stunning\\", Yvonne Minton's Sesto \\"ably interpreted\\" and Frederica von Stade's Annio \\"quite adorable\\" despite \\"a tight little vibrato\\". The orchestra's playing was \\"excellent\\", and Colin Davis's conducting \\"strong\\" too. This was not to say that the album had no weaknesses. Firstly, the presence of three mezzo-sopranos in its dramatis personae made for a degree of monotony. Secondly, none of the singers had interpolated appoggiaturas and other ornaments in the way that Mozart would have expected them to. Thirdly, the opera itself had its negatives. Although its music was brisk, concise, emphatic and full of feeling, its characters were cardboard and its story chilly and dull. But all in all, the album was \\"superb both in performance and recording\\", and one that certainly deserved to be heard.Stereo Review, May 1978, pp. 88-89 J. B. Steane reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in January 1980, comparing it with a more recent version of the opera conducted by Karl B√∂hm.W. A. Mozart: La clemenza di Tito, cond. Karl B√∂hm, Deutsche Grammophon LP, 2709 092, 1979 Both recordings had points in their favour, he thought. In one of Vitellia's arias, for example, Janet Baker's \\"noble anger\\" was preferable to the \\"shrewish huff\\" of B√∂hm's Julia Varady, while in another, Baker's superior technique was countered by Varady's greater delicacy and eloquence. In a duet for Annio and Sesto, Frederica von Stade and Yvonne Minton sang with more \\"charm and lightness\\" than B√∂hm's Marga Schiml and Teresa Berganza. And as Tito, Stuart Burrows was \\"more agreeable to listen to\\" than B√∂hm's Peter Schreier. On the other hand, B√∂hm himself sometimes conducted better than Davis, delivering a livelier Overture and a statelier March and allowing Tito more time to meditate in his dark night of the soul.Gramophone, January 1980, p. 1121 The Estates Theatre in Prague, where La clemenza di Tito was premiered Hilary Finch reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in September 1987. She conceded that La clemenza di Tito had a rebarbative reputation, but suggested that Davis's recording could win some converts to its cause. She judged Janet Baker's Vitellia to be good with reservations. Vocally, Baker showed signs of her advancing years in both her higher notes and her lower. Dramatically, she offered more sternness and less glitter than some people might wish. But she painted a compelling portrait of her character with no little psychological acuity. As Sesto, Yvonne Minton was in no way Baker's inferior, delivering a \\"truly great portrayal\\" with \\"dignity and power\\" and a voice still strong at the bottom of the stave. Lucia Popp and Frederica von Stade made something \\"delightful\\" out of their love duet. The only soloist who was disappointing was Stuart Burrows as the emperor. He supplied a photograph of Tito, as it were, when what was needed was a movie. He \\"never quite [touched] the greatness of voice and of heart demanded by the role\\", although the orchestra revealed much about the emperor that he was unable to show us. The hallmark of the album as a whole was its kinetic energy, exemplified by the five minutes of \\"electrifying\\" recitative (accompanied by an excellent harpsichordist) at its very beginning. Its vitality was chiefly attributable to Colin Davis's conducting. \\"Throughout it is his excitement and admiration for the score which is palpably transferred to the listener.\\"Gramophone, September 1987, p. 481 Sir Colin Davis in 2007 Alan Blyth reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in April 1992. He admitted that Janet Baker's voice bleached when it climbed into the ledger lines, but he applauded her for her \\"splendidly vicious, calculating and alluring Vitellia\\". He thought that Yvonne Minton's Sesto had set the gold standard for the part - \\"a handsome, authoritative performance, creamy and firm in tone, secure in character\\". He did not share Finch's poor opinion of Stuart Burrows's contribution, acclaiming Burrows's Mozartian musicianship and arguing that he made Tito's acts of forgiveness easy to believe in. Lucia Popp and Frederica von Stade had happily been cast when \\"both in their absolute prime\\". He shared Finch's perception that Colin Davis patently loved Mozart's score.Gramophone, April 1992, p. 160 Richard Wigmore discussed the album in a survey of the La clemenza de Tito discography in Gramophone in October 2010. He too noticed that Janet Baker's voice deteriorated above the stave, but this mattered little when set against her achievement as a singing actress in bringing Vitellia to life. She was \\"probably the most vicious, obsessively driven Vitellia on disc\\", until, after her epiphany of repentance, she sang her rondo of remorse \\"with an intense, traumatized inwardness and nobility of line\\". Her only failing was her inability to convey Vitellia's sexual magnetism. Yvonne Minton sang her Sesto attractively, intelligently and eloquently, although not always with an entirely perfect technique. Wigmore's assessment of Stuart Burrows's Tito was equivocal. Burrows had the right timbre for the part, with a \\"hint of metal in the velvet\\", and his well- schooled virtuosity made for praiseworthy phrasing and meticulously accurate coloratura. But his Tito did not adequately express the grief and doubt that tormented the emperor after Sesto had betrayed him. In the secondary roles, Lucia Popp was \\"enchanting\\", Frederica von Stade \\"urgent and plangent\\" and the \\"oaken-voiced\\" Robert Lloyd the best Publio on disc.Gramophone, October 2010, p. 64 ===Accolades=== In May 1978, Stereo Review included the album in its \\"Best Recordings of the Month\\" pages. Discussing the album in his Gramophone survey in October 2010, Richard Wigmore concluded that it was the finest of all the recordings of the opera that had been performed with modern instruments. \\"Baker's vicious Vitellia attains a tragic gravitas in her final scene,\\" he wrote, \\"while Yvonne Minton's intensely 'lived' Sesto vindicates Davis's broad tempi, characteristic of the elegiac tinta he brings to Mozart's score.\\" ==Track listing, CD1== Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) La clemenza di Tito, opera seria in due atti (Prague, 1791), K. 621, with a libretto by Caterino Mazzol√† (1745-1806) after Pietro Metastasio (1698-1782) * 1 (4:56) Ouverture Act One * 2 (2:04) Recitativo: \\"Ma che sempre l'istesso\\" (Vitellia, Sesto) * 3 (3:03) No. 1 Duetto: \\"Come ti piace imponi\\" (Sesto, Vitellia) * 4 (1:29) Recitativo: \\"Amico, il passo affretta\\" (Annio, Vitellia, Sesto) * 5 (5:32) No. 2 Aria: \\"Deh si piacer mi vuoi...

A climate apocalypse (also called a climate dystopia and a climate-induced collapse, among other names) is a hypothetical scenario involving the global collapse of human civilization and potential human extinction as either a direct or indirect result of anthropogenic climate change. The scenario posits some or all of the Earth being rendered uninhabitable as a result of extreme temperatures, severe weather events, an inability to grow crops, and an altered composition of the Earth's atmosphere. == Etymology and usage == Rhetoric and belief centered on apocalypticism has deep roots in religious contexts, and similar rhetorical approaches undergird secular apocalyptic interpretations of climate. Historical interpretations fall into two visions of apocalypse: the tragic and the comic. Tragic apocalypticism frames a clearly divided good and evil, with preordained events. In contrast, comic framing emphasizes flawed human agency, and it tends to be characterized by an open-ended, episodic, and ongoing timeline. Some of the most significant books in environmentalism make use of either the tragic or comic apocalyptic framing: Carson's Silent Spring (1962), Ehrlich's The Population Bomb (1972), and Al Gore's Earth in the Balance (1992). There is no single agreed term used to describe an environmental and ecological collapse as either a direct or indirect result of anthropogenic climate change, however such an event has been explored in both fiction and non-fiction for many years. Jules Verne's 1889 novel The Purchase of the North Pole imagines climate change due to a deliberate tilting of Earth's axis. Since World War II, there has been continual discussion of environmental destruction due to nuclear war.Miller, Perry (April 1951). \\"The End of the World\\".

Green culture : environmental rhetoric in contemporary America. University of Wisconsin Press. pp. 21‚Äì45. . == Apocalyptic impacts of climate change and ecological breakdown == === Atmosphere === Global warming reduces the capacity of the oceans to absorb oxygen. Biomarkers and geologic evidence suggests that oxygen-deprived oceans resulting from high carbon dioxide concentrations may have contributed to the five previous mass extinction events in Earth's history. Geoscientists have found that anaerobic microbes would have thrived in these conditions and produced vast amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas. Hydrogen sulfide is toxic, and its lethality increases with temperature. At a critical threshold, this toxic gas would have been released into the atmosphere, causing plant and animal extinctions both in the ocean and on land. Models suggest that this would also have damaged the ozone layer, exposing life on Earth to harmful levels of UV radiation. Deformities found in fossil spores in Greenland provides evidence that this may have occurred during the Permian extinction event. At the end of the Paleocene and Triassic eras, mass extinctions occurred at carbon dioxide concentrations of around 1,000 ppm. If these concentrations were reached again in the future, either as a result of anthropogenic or naturally occurring greenhouse gas emissions, it is possible that such an event could be repeated. === Disease === Rising temperatures increase the risk of an epidemic or pandemic. As the climate changes, distributors of infectious diseases such as mosquitoes and ticks spread to new areas and transmit illnesses to regions which may not have experienced them otherwise. Epidemics are also made more likely after severe weather events, such as heavy rainfall or flooding. Food scarcity may lead some communities to a more meat-based diet, which raises the risk of outbreaks of diseases such as ebola. Melting permafrost also threatens to release diseases that have been dormant for many years, as was the case in August 2016 when a thawed reindeer carcass that was almost a century old infected several individuals in Siberia with anthrax. === Food scarcity === Many plants have a maximum temperature at which they can grow, and climate change may mean that new pests are introduced to areas where it was too cold for them to survive before. Extreme weather events and more frequent droughts will also affect crop production as the Earth approaches and surpasses 2¬∞C (3.6¬∞F) above pre- industrial levels. A global decline in food availability could lead to severe impacts on public health. If the Earth's temperature increases to 2¬∞C above pre-industrial levels by 2050, some models predict that global food availability would be 3.2 percent lower than if no climate change occurred, resulting in an additional 529,000 deaths worldwide.Springmann, Marco (March 2, 2016). \\"Global and regional health effects of future food production under climate change: a modelling study\\". The Lancet. 387: 1937‚Äì1946. === Heat deaths === The combination of heat and humidity can impair the human body's ability to cool itself, leading to hyperthermia, a potentially life- threatening condition. A 2017 review considered research over past decades and predicted that under the high-end RCP 8.5 scenario given in the 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (which predicts a 3.2¬∞C-5.4¬∞C (5.76-9.72¬∞F) increase in global average temperatures by the end of the century compared to pre- industrial levels), by 2100, around 73.9% of the human population would live in environments of lethal heat illness for routine human life, compared with around 30.6% in 2000. === Mass displacement === As regions become too hot to inhabit or grow crops, as water becomes more scarce, as sea levels rise and as extreme weather events grow more frequent and more severe, it is likely that more people will be displaced from their homes, which could result in social instability and conflict when these people move to new areas. According to the 2019 Global Report on Internal Displacement by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, 61% of all new internal displacement in 2018 was caused by natural disasters, totalling 17.2 million people. Some predict that as the number of migrants from poorer nations increases, wealthier nations will impose higher restrictions on immigration and governments will become increasingly authoritarian and populist. Some areas, such as Europe, are more vulnerable to the stresses of increased migration as a result of their geographical location as well as diplomatic relations with bordering nations. === Mass extinction === The Earth is currently undergoing its sixth mass extinction event as a result of human activity. During the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event 250 million years ago, the Earth was approximately 6¬∞C higher than the pre-industrial baseline. At this time, 95% of living species were wiped out and sea life suffocated due to a lack of oxygen in the ocean. During the previous mass extinction around 66 million years ago, evidence shows that an asteroid or comet collided with the Earth, drastically altering the planet's climate and wiping out the dinosaurs as well as around 75% of all plant and animal species on the planet. === Natural disasters === Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including droughts, storms and flooding. Although it is not possible to determine whether or not a specific natural disaster occurred because of climate change, it is possible to state how much more likely a natural disaster was as a result of climate change. === Sea-level rise === As temperatures increase, glaciers and ice sheets melt and the ocean expands which causes a rise in sea levels. Sea levels have risen by about 23 cm since 1880 and are currently rising at around 3.2 mm each year. It is difficult to predict amounts of sea-level rise over the next century, although the ice sheets are melting earlier than predicted which makes a high-end scenario of 2 metres of sea-level rise by 2100 increasingly plausible. If the entire Greenland ice sheet were to melt, the world's oceans could rise by more than 6 metres. In the past, at times when the Earth has been 6¬∞C above the pre- industrial baseline, sea levels were 20 metres higher than today. If all the ice on land and at the poles melted, sea levels would rise by more than 65 metres. Rising sea levels result in forced migration and threaten services like the Internet, since much of the Internet's key infrastructure is built near coastlines and is not built to be permanently submerged in water. === Shutdown of ocean currents === Abrupt climate changes have occurred in the past, most clearly recorded in climate records from glacial ice on Greenland. There have been several explanations put forward for these changes, but the prevailing paradigm is that these changes were a result of changes in ocean currents, specifically the northward transport of heat by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). One example of this is the Younger Dryas, in which a rapid decline in temperature, recorded in Greenland as a drop of 4 to 10¬∞C (7.2 to 18¬∞F) over just a few decades, is thought to have been caused by the melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet providing extra freshwater to the North Atlantic and interrupting the AMOC. It is believed that recent climate change has caused a 15-20% slowing of the Gulf Stream, a current which transports warm water from the Gulf of Mexico towards north-west Europe, due to a melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet resulting in large amounts of freshwater pouring into the North Atlantic. Although it is likely to continue to slow, it is unproven whether the Gulf Stream could come to a complete halt this century, if ever. However if it does, this would have profound impacts upon large parts of the Earth's climate. In the UK, for example, temperatures would drop by an average of 3.4¬∞C (6.1¬∞F) and more so in Scotland. Rainfall during the growing season would also drop by 123 mm. This would reduce the UK's arable land from 32 percent to just 7 percent and it is uncertain if there would be enough water to offset this through irrigation, resulting in food shortages. === Societal collapse === Research has shown that aside from worsening income inequality and the strain of an increased population exceeding the carrying capacity of an environment, another important factor which may lead to global collapse is ecological strain. Climate change increases the strain on the planet's ecology, especially in terms of resource depletion. Climate change has contributed to the collapse of civilisations in the past. A 200-year drought caused cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation to be abandoned; the Khmer Empire collapsed as a result of successive droughts and monsoon floods which led to political and social unrest; and a period of cooling called the Little Ice Age made it more difficult for Vikings to farm in Greenland, which was one of the reasons that they were forced to abandon their settlements. More recently, a severe drought in the late 2000s which is likely to have been intensified by anthropogenic climate change contributed to failing agricultural production in Syria, leading to high unemployment, large amounts of internal displacement, heightened ethnic tensions and increased violence. Poor governance and neoliberal economic policies also contributed to the resulting civil war and societal collapse in 2011. Although the entire planet is affected by climate change, the worst impacts will be felt by the world's poorest countries, and these countries are both more likely to face the effects of societal collapse and more likely to face such effects sooner. This is one of the moral issues described within the climate justice movement of climate change activism. As societal collapse becomes more likely, it is possible that denial and anti- intellectualism will increase as well, or that people will assign blame for the crisis on communities other than their own. As localised violence increases, societal collapse also becomes more likely. === War === The risk of global conflict, especially in more vulnerable regions, rises with global warming. Studies have shown that extreme weather events can damage economies, lower food production and raise inequality, which can increase risks of violence when combined with other factors. One study found that climate change has influenced between 3% and 20% of armed conflict in the last century, that an increase of 2¬∞C above pre-industrial levels more than doubles the current risk of conflict, increasing it to 13%, and that an increase of 4¬∞C multiplies the risk by five, up to a 26% risk. A report by the Global Peace Index found that 971 million people lived in areas with either a high or very high climate change exposure and that 400 million of those people lived in countries with low levels of peacefulness. It warned that climate change can increase the likelihood of violent conflict by impacting upon resource availability, job security, and by causing forced migration. Scientists struggle to reach a consensus on the likelihood of war as a result of climate change as future climate change is likely to be very different from what humanity has experienced previously and the ability of societies to adapt is unclear. == Research shortcomings == Large-scale changes to the Earth system such as tipping points and possible abrupt climate change are usually not included in climate models and impact assessments. This means that many scientific reports, including the IPCC Assessment Reports, have often underestimated the impacts of climate change effects.Spratt, David; Dunlop, Ian T. (May 2019). \\"Existential climate-related security risk: A scenario approach\\". breakthroughonline.org.au. Breakthrough - National Centre for Climate Restoration. Climate scientists may also downplay potentially disastrous scenarios in favor of more restrained predictions that are less likely to be rejected as alarmist or fatalist. Discussions of 'tail-end' risks of temperatures rising beyond 3¬∞C (5.4¬∞F) are also often neglected in research more generally. == Rate of warming == Current levels of global warming are often calculated in terms of the global average increase in the Earth's temperature compared with levels prior to the Industrial Revolution. In 2016, the Earth is likely to have reached 1.1¬∞C (1.98¬∞F) above pre-industrial levels. The rate of global warming is influenced by the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, which has so far led to a linear increase in global warming. However global warming is non-linear, and is subject to acceleration when certain tipping points are crossed in the Earth's climate system, or as atmospheric pollution disappears from the atmosphere. These may also lead to abrupt climate change. As of December 2019, current global climate policies could take the planet to between 2.3¬∞C and 4.1¬∞C (4.14-7.38¬∞F) above pre-industrial levels by 2100, while current pledges and targets would take the planet to between 2.3¬∞C and 3.5¬∞C (4.14-6.3¬∞F). If all of the fossil fuels on Earth were burned, lower-end estimates calculate that 5 trillion tonnes of carbon emissions would be released into the atmosphere, resulting in a possible 10¬∞C of warming relative to 1986-2005 by the year 2300. === Tipping points === It is more likely that the Earth will cross tipping points and/or trigger abrupt climate change as it approaches and surpasses 2¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. Some of these tipping points may lead to accelerated global warming and runaway climate change. In the event that warming is limited to 2¬∞C by 2100, these carbon cycle feedbacks could still cause an additional 0.24-0.66¬∞C (0.432-1.188¬∞F) of warming by that year. These tipping points could be triggered much earlier, and could continue to warm the planet for hundreds or even thousands of years. === Global dimming === During the 1950s and 60s, scientists determined that the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth had dropped. This was labelled the global dimming effect and has since been proven to have a strong relationship to atmospheric pollution, the particles of which directly absorb energy from the sun before reflecting it back into space. This has many impacts including the cooling of the Earth and oceans leading to lower rainfall and more droughts. These pollutants also lead to the formation of smog and acid rain and cause various respiratory diseases. Global dimming may also cause heat waves and runaway fires, while the decrease of sunlight negatively impacts plant growth, endangering animal populations. As carbon emissions are reduced and the amount of pollution in the atmosphere disappears, the most widely credited studies indicate that there will be an increase of about 0.5¬∞C in global average temperature, however some studies have indicated that up to 1.1¬∞C is possible. Some solutions to this dilemma would be to use natural geoengineering solutions such as mass rewilding and biochar alongside a reduction of carbon emissions. Other potential solutions could be much more dangerous and unpredictable, such as artificially injecting additional sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. This could lead to disproportionately negative impacts on certain regions over others, causing droughts, flooding or desertification. == Climate collapse == === Hothouse Earth === A paper published in the journal PNAS in August 2018 entitled \\"Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene\\" described a threshold which, if crossed, could trigger multiple tipping points and self-reinforcing feedback loops that would prevent stabilization of the climate, causing much greater warming and sea-level rises and leading to severe disruption to ecosystems, society, and economies. It described this as the \\"Hothouse Earth\\" scenario and proposed a threshold of around 2¬∞C above pre-industrial levels, arguing that decisions taken over the next decade could influence the climate of the planet for tens to hundreds of thousands of years and potentially even lead to conditions which are inhospitable to current human societies. The report also states that there is a possibility of a cascade of tipping points being triggered even if the goal outlined in the Paris Agreement to limit warming to 1.5-2.0¬∞C (2.7-3.6¬∞F) is achieved. === Point of collapse === Even in mid-range scenarios of around 3¬∞C above pre-industrial levels, extreme weather events, large-scale loss of agricultural land and freshwater sources, and collapsing ecosystems could lead to widespread suffering and instability and over a billion people who currently live in major coastal cities would need to be relocated due to sea- level rise. One report published by the Global Challenges Foundation wrote that the potential destruction of high-end scenarios are beyond their capacity to model, but that there is a high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end. The report states that we are currently in a position where we can reduce the risk of civilization collapse due to climate change, and possibly avoid it. Although runaway climate change may be triggered at 2¬∞C or even lower, societal collapse in different regions may not happen until later, although there is no consensus as to when this may happen. Some scientists and institutions such as the World Bank have argued that it is uncertain whether adaptation to a 4¬∞C world is possible, and that such an increase in temperature is incompatible with an organised global community. ==Attempt to lessen apocalypse== Grist advised that although some people describe an expectation of a horrible Climate Apocalypse, the effects of climate change could be lessened or worsened depending upon when a coordinated response to lessen the damage develops. KQED reported that the scientific consensus is to take whatever action possible, wherever possible, even when there are reports of a coming Climate Apocalypse. Scientists commenting in The Atlantic said that the Representative Concentration Pathway was an important measurement to watch, and that as of 2018 this measurement predicts a worst-case scenario for the world. Stratospheric aerosol injection, a hypothetical process for blocking sunlight from the earth, is proposed as a desperate technological response to reduce existential risk. == Predictions == === What if we stopped pretending? === An article written for The New Yorker by Jonathan Franzen in September 2019 argued that those under the age of sixty at time of publishing were likely to see the radical destabilization of life on earth due to crop failures, fires, crashing economies, flooding, and hundreds of millions of climate refugees, while those under the age of thirty were almost certain to see it. The article attracted huge controversy for arguing that humanity must now accept that a climate apocalypse is inevitable, and was heavily criticized for being defeatist, as well as for drawing false scientific conclusions that such a scenario was inevitable, rather than possible. === The Age of Consequences === A report published in November 2007 by various authors including former director of the CIA R. James Woolsey Jr., former national security advisor to Al Gore Leon Fuerth, and former chief of staff for President Bill Clinton John Podesta entitled \\"The Age of Consequences: The Foreign Policy and National Security Implications of Global Climate Change\\" describes both a \\"severe\\" and a \\"catastrophic\\" scenario in which global warming reaches 1.6¬∞C (2.88¬∞F) above pre-industrial levels by 2040 and 5.6¬∞C (10.08¬∞F) by 2100 respectively.Campbell, K.M., et al. 2007. The Age of Consequences: The foreign policy and national security implications of global climate change, Washington DC, Centre for Strategic and International Studies/Center for New American Security, 7. In the \\"severe\\" scenario, nonlinear climate change has devastating impacts on society including a possible pandemic; societal instability due to large increases in migration and food and water shortages; threatened identities of global communities as a result of rising sea levels and coastal flooding; likely conflict over resources and possible nuclear war. The authors write that in this scenario climate change causes humanity to undergo a permanent shift in its relationship to nature. In the \\"catastrophic\\" scenario, the authors write that human society would struggle to adapt, and note that this scenario is so extreme that its impacts are difficult to imagine. The authors encourage readers to compare the scenario to the threat of terrorism, emphasising that the solution to both threats relies on a transformation of the world's energy economy. === \\"The 2050 scenario\\" === In May 2019, Breakthrough - National Centre for Climate Restoration released a report which argued that climate change represents an existential threat to human civilisation in the near to mid-term, calling for a wartime level of response to combat it.Spratt, David; Dunlop, Ian T. (May 2019). \\"Existential climate-related security risk: A scenario approach\\". breakthroughonline.org.au. Breakthrough - National Centre for Climate Restoration. The report featured heavily in the media due to the gravity of its message. The report described a \\"2050 scenario\\" which the authors define as a way of thinking at the high-end of the range of possibilities rather than a scientific projection. Within this scenario, policy-makers fail to act sufficiently and global emissions do not peak until 2030. Climate feedbacks are triggered which lead to global warming of 1.6¬∞C above pre-industrial levels by 2030, and 3¬∞C by 2050, leading the Earth into the \\"hothouse Earth\\" scenario. Sea levels increase by 2-3 metres by 2100, with an eventual 25 metres of sea-level rise locked in. Some regions become unlivable due to the intense heat and lack of adaptive capacity and around a billion people are displaced, while two billion people suffer from water shortages. There is not enough food to feed the global population and many of the world's most populous cities are abandoned due to sea level rise. === Famous figures === In an interview for The Ecologist, the Emeritus Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber warned that if we continue as we are now, then over the next century we may bring civilization to an end. He predicted that humans would survive somehow, but that almost everything which had been built up over the past two thousand years would be destroyed. He rated chances of success in the fight against climate change as more than 5% but definitely less than 50%. In his 2019 BBC documentary Climate Change ‚Äì The Facts, Sir David Attenborough warns that dramatic action needed to be taken against climate change within the next decade to avoid irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of human societies. In a 2019 Channel 4 interview with Jon Snow, Attenborough states that the worst outcome of climate change that could be experienced within the next seventy years would be civil unrest and mass migration on a great scale. He predicts that humans will continue to find enough food, but that their diets will be forced to change. Professor Emeritus of climate strategy at the BI Norwegian Business School J√∏rgen Randers predicts that we will fail to meet the pledges of the Paris Agreement as in the short-term it is cheaper to continue acting as usual. As a lifelong environmentalist, Prince Charles has given speeches warning that climate change could bring unimaginable horrors and that it calls into question our future survival on the planet. Pope Francis has stated that climate change threatens the future of the human family and that we must take action to protect future generations and the world's poorest who will suffer the most from humanity's actions. He has also stated that our choice of energy has the potential to destroy our civilization and that this must be avoided. In an interview, the Secretary-General of the United Nations Ant√≥nio Guterres warned that the world was losing the fight against climate change, and described lack of action on climate change as \\"suicide\\". In a September 2020 presentation to the United Nations, Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama described the present situation as an environmental armageddon. == Adapting to a collapse == According to Professor Jem Bendell, Deep Adaptation is the concept purporting that humanity needs to prepare for fundamental disruption of its current civilisation paradigms, due to climate change, with a likelihood of complete societal collapse. Unlike climate change adaptation, which aims to adapt societies gradually to the effects of climate change, Deep Adaptation is premised on accepting abrupt transformation of the environment as a consideration for making decisions today. In 2019, Jem Bendell started the Deep Adaptation Forum. According to the website, the Deep Adaptation Forum is an \\"international online space to connect people, in all spheres of life, to foster mutual support; collaboration; and professional development in the process of facing societal collapse.\\" Bendell also created a Deep Adaptation Facebook group for discussing these topics. ==Narratives of climate change== ===Social critique of literature=== Various academic publications describe how political discourse, the media, and scientific studies address the idea of a potential climate apocalypse. People in various cultures at various times have told stories about climate change. Among all cultures and times which tell these stories, patterns in the stories which repeat include questioning whether humans caused the change, the relationship between short-term local experiences and longer term global records, people of common cultures producing images of climate change which align with others in their culture but not with those outside their culture, designating certain classes of institutions like laboratories as being reliable sources of information, and the modification of reliable reports to create a more desirable narrative of how the information ought to lead to a particular community changing their behavior. Discussion of climate change is unusual for having attracted unusually diverse participation of communities which strongly present their own view. Those communities include citizens engaged in public participation, academic sectors, any non-academic professional sector asserting knowledge, participants in popular culture, advocates for Indigenous peoples, anyone negotiating the powers of capitalism, those practicing a religion, and anyone responding to public opinion. Sources of information about climate change tell various categories of stories, including personal experiences, community experiences, scientific models, economic forecasts, and prophecies of apocalypse. Some researchers have speculated that society cannot comprehend an accurate end of the world prediction, and instead, more governments would be willing to respond productively to prevent catastrophe if reports framed the matter as a smaller problem than it actually is. Talking about potential disaster can have a broad impact upon society by making many people feel that if the situation were truly horrible, then there must be good plans to prevent it so no further action is needed. As climate apocalypse becomes more real, the media presents many imagined apocalypse scenarios in a way that conflates them all. ===Contemporary narratives=== Political conversations about climate apocalypse tend to describe how preventing it in the future would bring zero value for today, therefore the value of doing something today is zero. The lack of response to climate change despite it being an existential risk may be an indication that human society lacks an ability to understand a threat of this magnitude without some radical change in perspective. Esquire described how since 1990 climate scientists have communicated urgent warnings while simultaneously experiencing the media converting their statements into sensational entertainment. A 2013 report described how incorporating the concept of preventing catastrophe into public policy seems unprecedented and challenging to accomplish. ===In popular culture=== Climate fiction is a popular media genre which frequently features stories of climate apocalypse. Examples include Ismael, a 1992 philosophical novel, and Mad Max: Fury Road, a 2015 action film. Concern over a climate apocalypse has been the subject of articles of satirical news features. One theme is popular revolt against power brokers. Another is the desire of youth to have a liveable environment in adulthood. Another are fantasies about the romance and adventure of people experiencing the chaos of ecological and societal collapse. ==See also== *Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction *Climate crisis *Collapsology *Economic collapse *Effects of global warming on humans *End time *Extinction risk from global warming *Failed state ==References== ==Further consideration== * * Category:Doomsday scenarios Category:Effects of climate change Category:Consensus Category:Apocalypticism Category:Last events Category:Societal collapse ","title":"Climate apocalypse"},{"id":"61728997","text":"Gerald Ullrich (born 23 December 23 1962 in Schmalkalden) is a German electronics engineer and politician of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) who has been a member of the German Bundestag since 2017. ==Early life and career== Ullrich obtained an intermediate school-leaving certificate at a polytechnic school in 1979.

The first is a reconstructed shot of children jumping into the lake, included on disc 4 of a National Library DVD collection documenting the history of Venezuelan cinema; other images from the film were also included, on disc 3.:66, 91-2 Later, for the 120th anniversary of the premiere in January 2017, the Venezuelan Association of Film Exhibitors produced some reconstructed film of both Un celebre especialista... and Muchachos ba√±andose.... The group collected frames from the 1890s stored in the Zulia Photographic Archive, restoring and colorizing the images to recreate the approximate look of the films. Emiliano Far√≠a directed the effort, with Abdel G√ºerere writing and producing. == Screening == Newspaper clipping announcing the showing of filmsThe clipping reads: Estreno del portentoso aparato El Cinemat√≥grafo (Vitascope perfeccionado).

Less than six months after Venezuela saw the arrival of the first Vitascope, Venezuelan film as a national industry began on 28 January 1897 at exactly 7:00 pm,:9 with the screening of two films produced in the country‚ÄîUn c√©lebre especialista sacando muelas en el gran Hotel Europa and Muchachos ba√±andose en la laguna de Maracaibo. This screening was held at the Teatro Baralt in Maracaibo, where the first films to be shown in the country, imported American shorts, had been shown previously.:xxxi Two other films, both French, were shown in the same screening. The first was a short film showing a race down the Champs-√âlys√©es. The other, shown last of the four, was L'Arriv√©e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat; both French films were by the Lumi√®re brothers and, according to Peter Rist, were projected in Maracaibo by Gabriel Veyre.:2 Un c√©lebre especialista sacando muelas en el gran Hotel Europa showed a dentist perform an extraction at a famous hotel. Venezuelan film historian and critic Rodolfo Izaguirre has suggested that in addition to the Venezuelan and French films, some American films by Thomas Edison were shown as well.:752 The films were screened following a performance of Gaetano Donizetti's opera La favorita.:107‚Äì120:29 The screening may not have gone very well. Reports suggest the public reception was both cautiously intrigued at moving images, but indifferent to the films themselves.:13 A contemporary review, in El Cronista, noted the films seemed well-shot, but the actual screening was not well executed. The reviewer noted the running of the tapes was initially irregular, and the lighting of the theatre was too bright to show films, making it hard to see images. However, he also reports that the film \\"of the kids bathing in the lake\\" was met with loud applause.:28Review text: \\"el descorrer de la cinta adolec√≠a de alguna irregularidad y que la luz que daba sobre el bastidor no pareci√≥ bien dispuesta: as√≠ se borraban o confund√≠an lastimosamente las figuras (aunque) los cuadros del Cinemat√≥grafo parecieron buenos, muy particularmente el de los muchachos ba√±√°ndose en el lago, que fue ruidosamente aplaudido\\" In English: \\"the drawing of the tape suffered from some irregularity and the light that it gave on the frame did not seem well disposed: this way the figures were erased or confused pitifully (though) the pictures of the cinematographer seemed good, very particularly that of the kids bathing in the lake, which was loudly applauded\\" == Production and identity of director == The film is widely stated to have been made by Manuel Trujillo Dur√°n, a view that persisted even after it was determined the film pioneer did not bring the Vitascope to Venezuela.:47 For many years, sources suggested that it was Trujillo, with or without his brother Guillermo, who made the early films.:242:22:14 Debate still continues, with Venezuelan film scholars variously suggesting different likelihoods that Trujillo was the director. To support the opinion he was not the director, there is evidence that Trujillo probably did not have a motion picture camera with which to make the film, and was in T√°chira at the time.:54 Those who feel Trujillo could be the director rely on his proximity to film at its inception in Venezuela and his relationship with American camera companies.:337 Even Rodolfo Izaguirre, veteran Venezuelan film critic and inveterate supporter of Trujillo, says the films are only \\"presumed\\" to be made by him,:752 with Venezuelan film histories that support Trujillo noting that \\"it is said\\" he was the pioneer.:337 Alexis Fern√°ndez, film scholar and lecturer, and a biographer of Trujillo, discussed the production of the first films in a television interview in 2013, agreeing that there is nothing tangible to prove who the director was. While it is generally accepted that Trujillo did not make the film,:2060 in both local and national Venezuelan news and culture, however, the belief that Trujillo effectively and single-handedly started Venezuelan cinema persists. An article in the pro-Maduro newspaper √öltimas Noticias about National Film Day events in January 2019 celebrated Trujillo for not only making and projecting the film himself, but also being personally responsible for outfitting the Baralt Theatre so the films could be shown. In 2018, historians Jes√∫s √Ångel Sempr√∫n Parra and suggested that Veyre, the French camera operator and filmmaker, was more likely to be the director. While Trujillo left Maracaibo at the start of January 1897 to travel to Colombia to present films there, Veyre and C.F. Bernard arrived in Venezuela at the same time as part of their filmmaking tour of Latin America and the Caribbean.:528 == Modern critical views == Azuaga Garc√≠a writes that the film falls into one of the two main categories of film at its time; he explains that in Venezuelan early cinema there were typically either government-focused or tourism films, Muchachos ba√±andose... is the latter, and may have inspired Julio Soto's films of the 1910s, Tomas del Lago and Revista de Maracaibo.:35 Discussing the success of these first films of the nation, Michelle Leigh Farrell questions the Venezuelan film industry's influence; though leading in the 1890s by virtue of having some of the earliest films in Latin America, its output was lacking compared to other South American countries through the 20th century. She proposes that being a frontrunner in filmmaking was cause for the government to take over the industry for the purpose of self-promotion, stymying general cinema production.:21 Michael Chanan instead notes that after the first films, it was typical of the Latin American markets to slow down production, though he also suggests there may be many lost and forgotten films from the early to mid century.:427-435 Elisa Mart√≠nez de Badra compares the film and its pair to their few predecessors, writing that the Edison films shown in Maracaibo in 1896 were \\"theatrical spectacle\\" but that Muchachos ba√±andose... was not; Mart√≠nez describes it as a \\"new media\\". She also says that Muchachos ba√±andose... together with Un c√©lebre especialista... are one of two factors leading to the development of a narrative approach in Venezuelan cinema‚Äîthe other was the working partnership of Carlos Ruiz Chapell√≠n and W.O. Wolcopt creating slapstick comedy.:67 == Notes == == References == Category:1897 films Category:Cinema of Venezuela Category:Venezuelan black-and-white films Category:Venezuelan short films Category:Venezuelan silent films Category:1890s documentary films Category:Black-and-white documentary films Category:Venezuelan films Category:Venezuelan documentary films Category:Works of unknown authorship Category:Films set on beaches ","title":"Muchachos ba√±√°ndose en la laguna de Maracaibo"},{"id":"61729052","text":"William Brooks Drew (December 11, 1908 ‚Äì December 14, 1997) was an American botanist and professor. ==Career== Drew received his B.S. degree from Massachusetts Agricultural College in 1930.

She retired in November 2002 and is now living in Satellite Beach, Florida. == Early life== Jeanne Lee Crews was born in 1940. Jeanne Lee Crews's interest in space and science began when she was about 8 years old. She loved all kinds of science. Jeanne first believed she would be an astronomer. Her father was a pilot in the Air Force. Both her mother and father were supportive of her love for science and supplied her with telescopes, microscopes, or anything she had an interest in. Sputnik and the space race ignited her passion for space even further. Jeanne began acquiring her college degree at the University of Texas with a major in Aerospace engineering. Jeanne was one of ten engineering freshman who was invited to take a physical chemistry course with graduate students. She then finished getting her B.S. in aerospace engineering at the University of Florida. In September 1964, Jeanne was hired at NASA as an engineer. She was one of the first women engineers hired there. Jeanne expressed in an oral interview, \\"... I really had to work hard to get the responsibility. Everybody wanted to hold my hand. Now, I know that sounds, ‚ÄúWell, isn‚Äôt that nice?‚Äù But it isn't when you're really trying to prove yourself... I didn't blame them; I really didn't. They just didn't know how to handle me.\\" Once hired, she went to Houston, Texas. Warren J. North was her division chief. James R. Brickel was the section head. Jeanne worked alongside Dean F. Grimm on her initial projects. Before her career at NASA, Crews was employed at Patrick Air Force Base as a junior mathematician, where her father was the Inspector General of Patrick Air Force Base. == Career at NASA == Crews worked on the Apollo landmarks as the zero gravity flights were taking place. She later worked on projects such as Skylab and Apollo]. Jeanne took flight in the zero gravity plane. Other than nurses who were asked to come on the plane, Jeanne was one of the first women on the zero-G plane. Jeanne created the hyper velocity laboratory where her work was focused on protecting Spacecraft and satellites from impacts from space debris and meteoroids. The multi shock shield was a project Jeanne invented. This layered shield Repeatedly shocked impacting particles in order to protect the spacecraft. She created a shield from fabric to make it weigh less, yet have more strength. This is known as the flexible multi-shock shield. It is still in use today on the International Space Station. The shield Is designed to protect from impacts of debris with densities of 2.7 g/cm3, as well as impact velocities of 16 km/s. While working at NASA, Crews was able to fly some of the training simulators. She could do so as long as no reporters saw her get in or out of the simulators. Donald K. Slayton told Jeanne she should not be photographed because they did not want anyone thinking that there was a woman astronaut. Throughout Jeanne's years at NASA, she was an engineer, contract monitor, and a researcher at Space and Life Sciences. Towards the end of her career, she was the Assistant to the Division Chief. In November 2002, Crews retired from NASA. == Awards == In 1990, Jeanne was awarded a Patent For the multi-shock shield along with her co-inventor Burton G. Cour- Palais. In 1992, she was awarded the Tech Brief Award, along with Cour- Palais and Eric Christiansen. She was also awarded the Women in Aerospace Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1993, she won the Board Award, otherwise known as a NASA Headquarters Space Act Award, as well as the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. In 1995, she won the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal. That same year, she was also awarded the Board Award for Debris Shield, Board Award for Weight Reduction Design, and the Patent Award, again. In 1998, she won the Tech Brief Award, again. In 1999, she won the Silver Snoopy Award as well as the Tech Brief Award. in 2006, Jeanne was honored for \\"Far-Reaching Inventions.\\" ==References== Category:American women engineers Category:NASA people Category:1939 births Category:University of Texas alumni Category:University of Florida alumni Category:Living people ","title":"Jeanne Lee Crews"},{"id":"61729125","text":"Lucky Ali Malik (born 20 October 2003) is a Danish cricketer.

After World War II, he had a prominent role in founding the World Health Organization (WHO), including the drafting of its constitution. ==Family== He was born in Huddersfield to Emma Mackenzie n√©e Beaumont and Frederick Lumsden Mackenzie,a University of Edinburgh medical graduate and general practitioner, in a family who were originally from St Andrews. In 1934 he married Caroline n√©e Faith Mackay, daughter of Beatrice and Robert Mackay. ==Life== He was educated at Almondbury Grammar School, Huddersfield College School and Epsom College. He received his medical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. ==Career== His first professional work after qualification in 1912 was in his father's practice in Huddersfield. In 1916 he was commissioned in the Royal Army Medical Corps and was appointed Captain and posted to Mesopotamia, where he developed expertise in the control of typhus fever After demobilisation, he returned in 1919 to general practice in Huddersfield. Mackenzie left his practice in 1920 to seek further training, receiving a doctorate from the University of London with a thesis titled:The Prevention of Typhus and relapsing fever in Mesopotamia during the War. He obtained Diplomas in Tropical Medicine at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and iPublic Health at Durham University. In July 1921, he took the post of assistant medical officer at Newcastle upon Tyne, and later the same year, assistant port health officer at Liverpool. Mackenzie then travelled to Russia in 1922 to organise relief work in the Russian famine of 1921-1922. He was recruited by Ruth Fry, director of the Russian Famine Relief Fund, sponsored by the Quakers. Working in the Buzuluk region of Russia, he organised feeding centres for distribution of supplies donated to the fund. He introduced measures for the control of infectious diseases, particularly typhus and malaria, and he introduced the practice of combining relief with the reconstruction of health services. Mackenzie returned to England as an invalid in 1923 suffering from simultaneous infections with Malaria and Typhus fever. After convalescence he visited Germany in 1924 with a paediatrician Helen Mackay, to investigate the health of German schoolchildren. In 1925 he moved to the British Ministry of Health as medical officer. ==International career== Mackenzie's career in international health started in 1928 when he was invited to join the health section of the League of Nations, under the direction of Ludwik Rajchman. In the same year he went to Greece to advise on the control of a severe epidemic of Dengue fever and returned the following year as Secretary of an International Commission to advise the Greek government to plan Hellenic health services. Later he also advised the government of Bulgaria on the control of endemic syphilis and the Czech and Romanian governments on the establishment of health centres. In 1930 he visited Spain to advise the government on Health Service Organization.Letters in Wellcome Library Archive PP/MDM In April 1930, Mackenzie travelled to Bolivia with a Spanish epidemiologist, Marcelino Pascua, to develop plans to re-organise health services. Mackenzie and Pascua carried out, over three months, a comprehensive survey of economic, social and health issues, including malaria and other tropical diseases in the Jungle, and tuberculosis together with other diseases on the Andean plateau.Wellcome archive Mackenzie travelled to Liberia in 1931 with M. Brunot to investigate the prevalence and incidence of Infectious diseases. At the time Liberia was faced with many political problems, including a discontented repressed rural population and hostility between tribes over land and fishing rights. The following year he was designated by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Sir Eric Drummond, to return to Liberia to mediate in some of the areas of contention. He intervened in local conflicts to establish boundaries and fishing rights, and mediated between the rural population and the government. He also attempted, with partial success, to disarm the population. On a return visit in 1933 he was disappointed in the lack of follow up on his actions. In 1934 Mackenzie reported and made recommendations on the health and hospital services in Ireland. In 1936 he was appointed director of the League of Nations epidemiological bureau in Singapore where he remained for one year. During the 2nd Sino-Japanese war Mackenzie flew to China in 1939 as special commissioner of the Secretary General of the League of Nations to co-ordinate technical cooperation and was present at the bombing of Chongqingc This experience of bombing raids and public health problems associated with air raid shelters was relevant in Mackenzie‚Äôa later wartime appointment as principal Medical Officer for London. Mackenzie left the League of Nations in 1940 and returned to Britain to the post of principal medical officer for London, driving across France with his family from Geneva to London, just escaping being caught by the advancing Nazi occupation forces. In 1943 he was appointed British delegate to UNRRA and remained in this position until its 1947 dissolution. Mackenzie attended the first International Health Conference in New York in 1946. He was elected chairman of the central drafting committee, and signed the constitution of the World Health Organization on behalf of the United Kingdom as plenipotentiary representative of the British government. The following year he was also appointed representative of the British government to the World Health Assembly. He attended six subsequent plenary sessions of World Health Organisation as the British delegate. In 1948 Mackenzie was elected chair of the UNICEF/WHO Joint Committee on Health Policy. He was chair of the WHO Executive Board in 1953 and 1954. In his final working years he toured the Middle East three times on behalf of the UK Foreign Office to advise on medical service development. He also advised the Jamaican and Trinidad governments on control of a poliomyelitis epidemic in 1954. His final mission was to advise on public health measures following the 1960 Agadir earthquake. ==Death== Melville Mackenzie died on 1 December 1972, survived by his widow, two sons and a daughter.

In 2005 Barran began her street food career selling chocolate out of an old ice cream van. She has since transformed London's street food scene. As of 2019, KERB has five sites across London, which serve more than 10,000 dishes a week. == Education and early career == Barran grew up in Suffolk. She has also lived in Africa and Italy, and became interested in food during her childhood. Barran had a recipe book from Sainsbury's, from which she cooked every item. She was first introduced to street food at the age of ten in Mexico. Her first job was in a local tearoom. Barran studied American Studies at the University of Manchester and earned a bachelor's degree in 1999. After graduating, Barran became interested in chocolate, and trained alongside the chocolatier Pierre Marcolini. From 2005 Barran sold chocolates out of an old ice cream van (named Jimmy) that she used to take to markets and events around the United Kingdom. She toured the United Kingdom, exchanging chocolate pudding for a bed for the night. Choc Star became an \\"acclaimed mobile chocolatier\\", selling hot chocolate, brownie fudge sundaes and Rocky Road. At a small festival that Choc Star was due to appear at, despite Barran having pitched and paid the fees, the festival folded days before it opened. When Barran learned that she could not be reimbursed, she became determined to not let this happen to anyone else, and came up with the idea of building a street food collective. In 2005 Barran joined up with two other street food companies and form Eat Street in 2009, which became a collective of 32 traders that opened in locations around London. In 2010, whilst on holiday in New York City, Barran decided to study for a master's degree in Urban Studies. She wanted to make cities more interesting through food. She retired her van Jimmy in 2011. That year Barran was selected as one of The Independent Ten People Who Changed The World. She completed her master's degree at University College London in 2013. She was part of the University College London Urban Laboratory, which is part of The Bartlett and the Department of Geography. == KERB == Barran launched KERB in 2012. She was determined to make the street food movement accessible for everyone. KERB is a community of street food providers whose customers include permanent London markets and corporate event organisers. She provides professional and logistical support for the vendors, as well as encouraging informal mentoring between them. She set up an incubator scheme inKERBator, which discovers and supports new street food providers. The incubator is a three-month programme, and KERB takes on around 5% of the intakes. Barran even created a magazine, the KERB manual, which provides information on the organisational structure and branding, as well as providing advice to people interested in starting a food truck. She has hosted theme festivals including events dedicated to fried chicken, vegan food and nostalgia. Several popular KERB businesses have gone on to become restaurants, including Pizza Pilgrims, Bleecker Burger and Bao. As of July 2019, KERB street food markets sell over 10,000 dishes a week at 5 markets across London. Barran called for Boris Johnson (then Mayor of London) to help people sell street food around London. Barran delivered a TEDxLondon talk where she discussed how street food benefited society. KERB has several partnerships, including Street Child, supporting mothers in West Africa to set up their own businesses to fund school uniforms and supplies. In 2019 KERB opened a permanent resident at Seven Dials market in London. The site will host 25 vendors and features a cheese conveyor belt. === Awards and honours === Her awards and honours include; * 2011 The Independent Ten People Who Changed The World * 2012 Evening Standard Most Influential People * 2015 Evening Standard Most Influential People == References == Category:Living people Category:British businesspeople Category:Women founders Category:Women chief executives Category:Street food Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester Category:People from Suffolk Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Petra Barran"},{"id":"61729242","text":"Juan Gerson's religious paintings in the Franciscan church of Tecamachalco, Puebla, 1562.

Her father was Justice of the peace for Charleville in Queen's Co. (Laois), and Deputy lieutenant of Queen's Co. and Justice of the peace for King's Co. (Offaly). Her mother was Elizabeth Rossall from Lancaster, England. White was born while they lived in County Laois. An Anglo- Irish Protestant, she was educated by governesses before going to Alexandra College in Dublin and to study history in Newnham College, Cambridge. White became the Principal of Alexandra College in 1890. She worked in the position until 1932 when she retired. During her leadership Alexandra College became one of the places where a woman could get an education towards a college degree. There were multiple lectureships endowed - these included art history in 1895 and Irish civilization in 1902. ==Advocacy== White was one of the women in Dublin advocating for university education for women. She believed in the idea of separate women's colleges and hoped to have Alexandra College become one such. She gave evidence to the Robertson commission about this on 27 September 1901. However White also understood that a college education was not the only option needed by women in Ireland and once the decision was made to grant women equal access to the existing colleges in Ireland, rather than to separate women's colleges, Alexandra college focused on some of those other options. She created secretarial, housecraft and teacher training departments for both secondary and third level qualifications. During her career she was involved in the various appropriate organisations. She was president of the International Federation of University Women in Ireland from 1925 to 1929. She was also involved with the Irish Schoolmistresses Association and a member of the Irish Registration Council from 1915 to 1930. White was on the viceregal committee on intermediate education in 1919 and from 1921 to 1922 she was on the central committee on women's training and employment. She was also interested on the right of women to work and ensure they had appropriate rights. She was a member of the National Union of Women Workers of Great Britain and Ireland where she was a regular speaker at the conferences. She began the Alexandra College Guild in 1897 for both students and alumni. White also founded a hostel in Dublin in 1913 for girls working in the city and later, during the First World War she ran one for Belgian refugees. She founded the Soldiers‚Äô Wives Club in 1915 and organised people to knit socks for the soldiers. A Protestant and a conservative, the archbishop of Dublin Dr John Gregg described her as > a pioneer but not a revolutionary despite her campaign to admit women to lay offices in the Church of Ireland. ==Horticulture== Despite all the work on education and working women's rights, White's real love was horticulture. Her specialty was pelargonium. She was known for her town garden at the college. She worked to convince the keeper of the Royal (later National) Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, Frederick W. Moore to allow women to get an education in the horticulture school. In 1903 he agreed to allow two women a year to attend. ==Legacy== In 1905 White was only the second woman to be awarded an honorary LLD from the University of Dublin. There were two portraits completed of her during her time as Principal. One was in 1901. The other was done in 1931 by Sir William Orpen. Both are kept in Alexandra college. She died at home 16 July 1936 in Dublin. There was a public memorial service 25 September 1936 at St Ann's church. A Hall was built and named in her honour in the school in 1939. ==References and sources== Category:1856 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Irish gardeners Category:Irish women activists ","title":"Henrietta White"},{"id":"61729278","text":"Harry Viljoen is a South African former rugby coach and player.

The software program was developed with aid from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to aid prosecutors' offices in tracking; in 1982 (by which time Inslaw became a for-profit entity) Inslaw received a $10 million contract by the Justice Department to develop an improved PROMIS application for U.S. attorneys' offices. Having previously developed a 16-bit version of PROMIS, Inslaw developed a 32-bit version, for various operating systems, specifically VAX, UNIX, IBM's AS400, and (in the 1990s) Windows NT. The Hamiltons and the Justice Department engaged in an \\"unusually bitter contract dispute\\" over the software, and Inslaw entered bankruptcy.In re Inslaw, Inc., 97 B.R. 685 (D.D.C. 1989). The Hamiltons sued the federal government, alleging that the Justice Department had dishonestly conspired to \\"drive Inslaw out of business 'through trickery, fraud and deceit'\\" by withholding payments to Inslaw and then pirating the software.Jeffrey A. Frank, The Inslaw File, Washington Post (June 14, 1992). A bankruptcy court and federal district court agreed with the Hamiltons, although these rulings were later vacated by a court of appeals for jurisdictional reasons. Hamilton and others asserted that the Justice Department had done so in order to modify PROMIS, originally created to manage legal cases, to become a monitoring software for intelligence operations. Affidavits created over the course of the Inslaw affair stated that \\"PROMIS was then given or sold at a profit to Israel and as many as 80 other countries by Earl W.

In September 1992, a House Judiciary Committee report raised \\"serious concerns\\" that Justice Department officials had schemed \\"to destroy Inslaw and co-opt the rights to its PROMIS software\\" and had misappropriated the software. The report was the outgrowth of a three-year investigation led by Jack Brooks, the committee's chairman, who had launched in investigation in 1989. The report faulted the Justice Department for a lack of cooperation in the investigation and found that \\"There appears to be strong evidence, as indicated by the findings in two Federal Court proceedings as well as by the committee investigation, that the Department of Justice 'acted willfully and fraudulently,' and 'took, converted and stole,' Inslaw's Enhanced PROMIS by 'trickery fraud and deceit.'\\" A book written in 1997 by Fabrizio Calvi and Thierry Pfister claimed that the National Security Agency (NSA) had been \\"seeding computers abroad with PROMIS- embedded SMART (Systems Management Automated Reasoning Tools) chips, code- named Petrie, capable of covertly downloading data and transmitting it, using electrical wiring as an antenna, to U.S. intelligence satellites\\" as part of an espionage operation. ==Further reading== *Ryan Gallagher, Dirtier than Watergate: The Reagan-era espionage system that has managed to stay under the radar., New Statesman (April 20, 2011). *James J.

In 1831 he was appointed professor of dogmatics at the Major Seminary of Ghent, leaving in 1833 to take up a position as secretary to Mgr Boussen, administrator apostolic of West Flanders (and from 1834 bishop of the reconstituted diocese of Bruges). In September 1833 he was appointed president of the Major Seminary, Bruges. Appointed as bishop of Ghent on 13 September 1838, he was consecrated on 4 November. On 21 December 1838, he prohibited the clergy of his diocese from any involvement with periodicals disseminating the democratic ideas of Lamennais. This is thought to have had an impact on the outcome of the legislative elections of 1839. Other measures taken included the setting up of a synodal council for clerical appointments, the drawing up of new statutes for the diocesan clergy and the cathedral chapter, encouraging the establishment of Sunday schools, and the publication of a new edition of the propers of saints of the diocese. In 1839 he founded a normal school in Sint- Niklaas to train primary teachers, and between 1839 and 1862 he founded diocesan secondary schools in eight towns in East Flanders. He became involved in attempts to reform philosophy teaching at the Catholic University of Leuven. In September 1856 he caused consternation with a pastoral letter advising parents against sending their children to the University of Ghent, given its non-Catholic academic climate, and warning against the secular ethos of some secondary schools. The controversy to which this gave rise is thought to have helped the Liberal Party to victory in the 1857 elections. He submitted his resignation in 1858, but was convinced to remain in his position. He supported the papal promulgation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception in 1854, and in 1859 reintroduced Peter's Pence in his diocese. He also encouraged lay apostolates for the sick and the poor, as well as for doctrinal instruction, and was active in relieving food shortages during the potato blight of 1846‚Äì1848.

A Canadian geologist from Inco further prospected the existing deposits and in 1934 exploration efforts from a Dutch mining firm began. Initial production began in 1936 to 1941, with operations being expanded during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. After the independence of Indonesia, the American Freeport Sulphur Company attempted to establish operations, but failed due to security concerns. NV Perto, a local company, took over operations then until it was taken over by the Indonesian government. Following the takeover, the company was restructured by the government as PN Pertambangan Nikel Indonesia in 1961. It was later merged into Aneka Tambang, which began exporting nickel ore to Japan by 1969. The International Nickel Company also began establishing metallurgical operations in the 1970s, with commercial nickel production commencing in 1978. In January 2014, the Indonesian government announced a ban on the export on a range of mineral ores, including nickel, in an attempt to develop local smelter industries. The ban was rolled back in 2017, with the Indonesian government initially noting that mining companies would be permitted to export ore until 2022, but in 2019, the deadline was moved back to January 2020. Government minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan stated that the government intended for Indonesian firms to enter the supply chain for lithium batteries - which utilizes nickel in its production. The ban's announcement resulted in the world nickel price jumping by 8.8% to its highest in five years. In April 2020, a regulation to set a minimum price of nickel was issued, effective in 13 May. The regulation was requested by the Indonesian Nickel Miners Association (APNI) to protect small miners. It was criticized by a representative of the Processing and Smelting Companies Association (AP3I) for limiting the ability to adjust for fluctuations in price. In June 2020, 20% of Vale Indonesia was acquired by Mind Id, a state-owned mining holding company, for $390 million. ==Production== Nickel production in Indonesia is primarily conducted by Vale's PT Vale Indonesia and Aneka Tambang, which combined employed 5,820 employees in 2017, not accounting for jobs related to processing and in metallurgical industries. Indonesia is the largest nickel producer in the world, with 800,000 tonnes of nickel produced in 2019, up from 606,000 tonnes in 2018. In 2020, production is expected to drop due to the export ban. The largest production sites for nickel are located in the provinces of South Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi and North Maluku. Outside of the mentioned provinces, there are also nickel mines operating in Paser Regency (East Kalimantan), Raja Ampat Regency (West Papua) and in West Seram Regency (Maluku). Further reserves in Papua has also been explored. ==Ore== The most important Indonesian nickel ores are lateritic, primarily located in Sulawesi and Halmahera with mining operations centered at ultramafic rock outcrops. While the lateritic nickel ores are more difficult to smelt compared to nickel sulfide ores, it is more extractable due to its location on the surface. In 2019, it was reported that Indonesia possessed proven reserves of 698 million tonnes of nickel ore, with a potential 2.8 billion tonnes when accounting for unproven reserves. The United States Geological Service reported Indonesia's nickel reserves to be 21 million tonnes, compared to the global reserve of 89 million tonnes in 2018. Indonesia's laterite deposits are estimated to comprise 15 percent of the global reserves. ==References== ","title":"Nickel mining in Indonesia"},{"id":"61729532","text":"The Jonesboro U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is a former federal building located at 524 South Church Street, in downtown Jonesboro, Arkansas.

The estate was from 1774 to 1993 owned by members of the Raben/Raben-Levetzau family. The two-storey main building from 1561 and a large, half-timbered barn from the 1710s were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. ==History== ===Early history=== Drawing of the relief of Joachim Beck and his wife on his grave in F√∏rslev Church The first known owner of Beldringe was Joseph Nielsen Blade in 1360. The ownership of the estate is then unclear until 1522 when it was acquired by Joachim Beck (ca. 1500‚Äì72) through his marriage to Anne Ravensberg who had inherited it after her parents. In 1537, Beck was appointed as royal treasurer (rentemester) of Eastern Denmark. He was in the same time granted considerable holdings of land on Zealand and was therefore able to expand Beldringe with nine additional tenant farms. Joachim Beck was also the owner of F√∏rslevgaard. Joachim Beck's son Lauge Beck (c. 1530-1607), inherited Beldringe and G√∏rslevgaard after his father's death in 1572. After Lauge Beck's death in 1607, Beldringe passed to his son Jacob Beck while F√∏rslevgaard went to his other son Sivert Beck (1566-1623). ===1521-1774: Royal ownership=== Prince George In 1621, Jacob Beck ceded Beldringe to Christian IV in exchange for Gladsaxe in Scania. Christian IV's interest in the estate was due to its location in the middle of one of his hunting grounds. At this point, Beldringe consisted of the manor and a total of 52 tenant farms. In 1622, Christian IV placed the land that had belonged to Beldringe Rectory as well as 32 tenant farms from the Fief of Tryggev√¶lde under Beldringe. He also renovated the main building and constructed a new stable for his horses as well as new farm buildings. In his will of 1665, Frederick III bequeathed Vordingborg Castle and the manors of Beldringe and Lekkende to his youngest son, Prince George. After Prince George's death in 1708, all his holdings reverted to the Crown and was then included in the newly established Vordingborg Cavalry District. ===1774‚Äì1993: The Raben- Levetzau family=== Carl Vilhelm Raben-Levetzau In 1769, it was decided to sell Vordingborg Cavalry District. A commission proposed to divide the manors into smaller parcels and sell them in public auction. These plans were, however, met with opposition. In 1774, Beldringe was instead sold to Frederik Sophus Raben (1745‚Äì1820). He undertook a comprehensive refurbishment of the main building. Raben's son, Carl Vilhelm Raben (1789-1870), inherited Beldringe after his father's death in 1820. He had served as a diplomat in the Hague for many years but returned to Denmark to manage his estate. In 1834, he was granted royal permission to assume the surname Raben-Levetzau. Having no children, Carl Vilhelm Raben-Levetzau and his wife Julia Adelaide Harriet Bornemann established Den Raben-Levetsauske Fond. After Julia Adelaide Harriet Bornemann's death in 1888, Beldringe passed to the nephew Frederik Christoffer Otto Raben-Levetzau (1850-1933). He owned it until his death. He began his career in the foreign diplomacy but was in 1905 appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Jens Christian Christensen. In 1908, he handed in his resignation and retired from politics. Frederik Christoffer Otto Raben-Levetzaus was succeeded on the estate by his son Johan Otto Raben-Levetzau. It was passed to his daughter in 1992. She sold it in 1993. Beldringe's main building, constructed by Joachim Beck ca. 1560 ==Architecture== The two storey main building is from 1561. It is constructed in red brick with bands of partly white-washed limestone. It stands on a foundation of field stones and has a base of finely cut granite ashlars. Most of the farm buildings were destroyed in a fire in 1910. The most notable exception is a large, half-timbered barn from 1715. The barn is 30 bays long and 14 bays wide. The main building and the half-timbered barn were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. The scope of the heritage listing was expanded in 1990. Most of the other farm buildings date from after the fire. The entrance to the complex is marked by a gatehouse. ==Today== Beldringe is today owned by Beldringe Gods ApS.

Hajek is an American entomologist with a focus in insect-microbe interactions. She is a Professor of Entomology at Cornell University. ==Early life and education== Hajek was born in San Francisco, California, in 1952. In the 1970s, she attended University of California, Davis for two years then relocated to the UC Berkeley where she studied and worked as a practicing entomologist and science writer prior to obtaining her Ph.D. in entomology in 1974. While studying at the Division of Biological Control, Hajek earned her M.S. and Ph.D. in 1980 and 1984 respectively. ==Career== Following graduation, Hajek moved to Ithaca, New York where she was hired by the Boyce Thompson Institute as an insect pathologist. She remained there until 1994, when she got a position at the Department of Entomology of Cornell University. While there, Hajek worked through the ranks, obtaining associate in 2000 and full professor of entomology in 2005. During her academic career at Cornell, Hajek ran an active research program in both laboratory and field studies and led as many as 200 people. She has also taught courses at Cornell on invertebrate pathology, symbiosis, biological control, and invasion ecology and graduated as many as two M.S. and 10 Ph.D. students, and was a mentor to 14 postdocs and eight visiting scientists. From 2008 to 2011 she served as Adjunct Professor at Anhui Agricultural University in Hefei, China and then was a visiting and honorary Professor of Zoology at the University of Copenhagen. She also is an active member of the Society for Invertebrate Pathology and a speaker at U.S. states and 14 countries. ==Research== In 1999, Ann E. Hajek published her study on Entomophaga maimaiga and how it can be used to control the spread of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). In 2019, Prof. Hajek along with fellow scientists from Ohio State University studied spotted lanternfly which is an abundant pest known to damage grape and apple crops in China, Taiwan, and Vietnam and had invaded South Korea and Japan. The species was found in Pennsylvania in 2014 and has spread to six neighboring states. Unfortunately, the species has few natural enemies. While studying how the insect feeds on the tree of heaven, Hajek and her team discovered an outbreak of Beauveria bassiana and Batkoa major, two species of native fungal pathogens, which appear to have potential to control the growing populations of lanthernflies; Batkoa major killed lanternflies on trees while Beauveria bassiana killed those on the ground, with only a few viable egg masses produced in the fungal outbreak area. ==Personal life== Ann Hajek is married to James K. Liebherr, a systematic entomology professor since 1984. They have a daughter, Lisa, who is a lawyer in Seattle, Washington. Their son Jonathan is specializing in spatial analysis and works in Rochester, New York. ==Works== Ann Hajek is an author of at least two books and many book chapters. The books that she written are Ecology of Invertebrate Diseases and Natural Enemies while the book chapters that she wrote can be found in the books Advances in Microbial Ecology (titled \\"Ecology of Terrestrial Fungal Entomopathogens\\"), as well as her co-authorship with Bernard Papierok on \\"Chapter V-2 - Fungi: Entomophthorales\\" in Manual of Techniques in Insect Pathology, a 1997 publication of Academic Press and \\"Chapter 5: Evaluating Non-target Effects of Pathogens Used for Management of Arthropods\\" with M.S.

After completing his primary education at the gymnasium in Leszno (then Polnisch Lissa), he was briefly a member of a cadet corps. At the age of twenty, he went to Potsdam and became an officer in the 1st Foot Guards, but served for only a short time, having decided on a career in art. From 1840 to 1844, he studied with Gustav Wegener, then went to Berlin, where he studied with and Karl Eduard Biermann. In 1845 he married Anna Eleanor Cauer (1829-1881), daughter of the sculptor . That same year, he moved again, this time to D√ºsseldorf, enrolling at the Kunstakademie and studying with Johann Wilhelm Schirmer from 1846 to 1849. Upon completing the program there, he settled in Cologne for two years, then returned to D√ºsseldorf for more lessons with Schirmer until 1853. During these years, he also took study trips to Switzerland, the Pyrenees, France and Italy; financed by a government stipend. At the end of his copious studies, King Friedrich Wilhelm IV named him a Professor. In 1858, he went to Weimar and was instrumental in creating the Grand-Ducal Saxon Art School; becoming its first Director in 1860 at a grand opening ceremony attended by the King. He quickly devoted himself to establishing a faculty composed of progressive artists. In 1876, he retired and moved to Bad Kreuznach, his wife Anna's hometown. In 1883, two years after her death, he moved to Munich, where he died. His son, Leopold, and daughter, Maria also became well-known painters.

In 1849 he was found guilty of desertion and theft and was sentenced to transportation for seven years to Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania, Australia). A reward was posted for Bannon's capture after he escaped from a prison in Van Diemen's Land and, following his capture, he was transported to Norfolk Island before returning to Australia. \\"Murdering Gully Rd\\" at Table Cape, Tasmania is named after a murder that Bannon was accused of committing in 1858. Over his life, along with being found guilty on charges of desertion, theft, prison escape, extortion, and running an illegal distillery, Bannon was charged and acquitted of various crimes including murder and firearms offences. He was also the police‚Äôs main suspect for various thefts. On one occasion Bannon secured his acquittal when the jury believed his testimony over that of the police, and on another occasion Bannon was able to personally convince the Governor of Tasmania he should be released from prison. Bannon went on to become a successful and well respected farmer in Tasmania. He married and had nine children. His descendants include the former leader of the Greens political party in Australia, prominent Tasmanian criminal barrister Cameron Scott, and a grandchild who gave his life as an ANZAC at Gallipoli. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Bannon was born in Ballymahon in the County Longford, Ireland in . He had two brothers, John and Thomas. His mother's name was Margaret, and the family was Catholic. Bannon was recruited into the 65th Regiment of Foot and travelled on the Java merchant ship to New Zealand to fight in the New Zealand Wars that were taking place between the MƒÅori people and the British Colonial Government. Bannon departed Woolwich in May 1846 on the Java, arriving initially in Hobart Town Van Diemen's Land on 5 October 1846, before travelling to Sydney, and then on to New Zealand in November 1846. ===Transportation to Van Diemen's Land=== While serving at Whanganui in January 1849, Bannon was found guilty of desertion and was sentenced to four months. In December 1849 Bannon was tried in the Supreme Court for the theft of a number of items from the property of Captain James Lewis Smith at Te Aro. The theft included ¬£25, a gold chain, a breguet key, and two gold pins. He was found guilty of the crime and sentenced to seven years to be served in Van Diemens Land . Newspaper reports around the time of Bannon‚Äôs crimes noted that a private in the 65th Regiment had purportedly committed several robberies with the intention of being transported to Van Diemen‚Äôs Land due to the favourable reports of previously transported soldiers. Bannon traveled from Wellington on board the Sisters ship, arriving in Hobart Town via Sydney on 23 January 1850. There were two other prisoners on board . He was 23 years old at the time and, according to convict records, Bannon was unable to read or write . ===Transportation to Norfolk Island=== Bannon was moved to the Cascades Probation Station, a penal institution on the Tasman Peninsular near Port Arthur. Bannon was able to escape to the mainland through the infamous 'dog- line' at Eaglehawk Neck. The dog-line was a line of savage dogs guarding the small isthmus between the Tasman Peninsular and the mainland that Thomas J. Lempriere, a commissary officer at Port Arthur, declared as 'impassable‚Äò. The 15 October 1850 Government Gazette declared a reward was available for Bannon's capture. Bannon was eventually captured and was sentenced to 18 months hard labour to be served on Norfolk Island. Bannon sailed on the ‚ÄòFranklin‚Äô arriving at Norfolk Island on 9 December 1850. At the time of Bannon's arrival Norfolk Island had been reopened for the second time as a penal settlement and was under the governorship of John Giles Price. Price was well known for his brutal and somewhat extreme management of prison discipline. While on Norfolk Island Bannon was sentenced to numerous infringements relating to disobedience, resulting in months of hard labour while chained. ===Return to Van Diemen's Land=== The Lord Auckland arrived at Port Arthur, Tasmania in April 1853, returning Bannon to Van Diemen's Land along with 61 other male convicts . Bannon was subsequently moved to the Prison Barracks at Hobart, prior to being allowed into private service. While in private service Bannon was found guilty of seeking to extort additional wages and was sentenced to 14 days solitary. He was returned to gaol for an additional offense in December 1853, ultimately settling near Table Cape. ===Ticket of Leave and Conditional Pardon=== Bannon's Ticket of Leave was issued 9 January 1855, and a Conditional Pardon was issued 20 March 1856. ===Murder: Murdering Gully Road - Tasmania=== Samuel Oaks was found murdered on 5 May 1858 on what was then known as \\"New Road\\" at Table Cape Tasmania. The man had been shot, brutally beaten and partially burned . William Bannon was known to be on disagreeable terms with the murdered man and was subsequently tried for Oaks' murder. Bannon was found 'Not Guilty' and was released. The location of the murder is close to what is now called \\"Murdering Gully Road\\" . No one else was ever charged with the murder. ===Distillery and Imprisonment=== During the 1860s the local police continued to have an interest in Bannon. In February 1866 he was held in Launceston Gaol prior to trial, accused of wounding horses, before the charges were dismissed and Bannon was released . In April 1869 the local police accused Bannon of stealing four small pigs, again without a prosecution . In July 1870, Bannon was once again imprisoned at Launceston Gaol. The charges were for 'illicit distillation' and unlawfully aiming a firearm at the police. On 21 July 1870, at the Torquay Police Court, Bannon plead not guilty to the distillery charge. The co-accused on the distillation charge, William Foster, plead guilty. Bannon and Foster were found guilty. Bannon was fined ¬£200 and Foster ¬£50 . Both were unable to pay their fines and were kept at the Launceston Gaol until the fines could be paid. At the subsequent court case on the firearm charge the jury did not believe the police testimony and Bannon was found not guilty of the firearm offence . As Bannon was still unable to pay the ¬£200 fine for the illegal distillery he remained in custody. The Governor of Tasmania Sir Charles Du Cane visited the prison and Bannon appealed directly to his Excellency for his release . Bannon was subsequently released by order of the Governor in December 1870 . A number of letters were sent to local papers about the injustice of Bannon‚Äôs case and concerns about police behaviour. A letter from ‚ÄòJustitia‚Äô, a reference to Lady Justice, written while Bannon was still in gaol, called for him to be released, pointing to the ‚Äònot guilty‚Äô verdict and the impact on Bannon‚Äôs young family . Bannon himself wrote a letter to the press following his release detailing accusations of poor police behaviour. The editor called for a ‚Äòmore rigid sort of investigation‚Äô into the complaints raised, indicating a pattern of poor behaviour by the local police . Bannon wrote a second letter in February 1871 noting that the police refused to return his clothing that had been taken at the time of his arrest . It is noteworthy that a reward of 100 pounds had previously been approved for the Torquay Chief District Constable John Reynolds for the conviction of William Bannon on the distillery. This reward further brought into question the motivation of the police involved. ===Stealing Charge=== In 1879 Bannon was charged with stealing a pair of bullock yokes, and a pair of bows, together valued at ten shillings. Edward Hancox, also an ex-convict and the local blacksmith, appeared as a witness for Bannon, testifying that he'd made Bannon the yokes that had been found in his possession. Bannon was found not guilty . Hancox's son (John Hancox) would later marry Bannon's daughter (Sarah Jane Bannon). In October 1880 Bannon still remained the focus of local police and was considered a suspect in the theft of a number of sheep . ===Family=== William and Harriet Bannon, with Florence and Mary Hancox (grandchildren) William Bannon married Harriet Shattock in 1857. Harriet was a servant, originally from Somerset, who travelled from Plymouth with a family on board the Blackwall Clipper ‚ÄòSussex' via Port Phillip Bay, arriving October 1855. Harriet and William had nine children, including Sarah Jane Hancox (n√©e Bannon). Sarah, his first child, was born within months of his acquittal for the murder of Samuel Oaks in 1858. According to her grave headstone, Harriet Bannon, his sixth child, died on Christmas Day 1870, which was within a week of his release from Launceston Gaol on the distillery issue. Harriet Bannon was one year old at the time of her death. Bannon also had a small dog named Jack. Harriet and William were understood to have separated for a period, with Bannon placing advertisements in the local press cautioning storekeepers not to extend credit to Harriet. Bannon died within a year of this 'caution' notice, with Bannon family records indicating the couple reconciled prior to Bannon's death. On her death in 1915 Harriet chose not to be buried with Bannon. ===Later life and death=== Bannon went on to become a widely known and respected farmer . The distinctive ‚ÄúStone House\\" at Sassafras, said to be one of the better known landmarks in the area for over 70 years, was built for Bannon using sandstone quarried near his property. The \\"Stone House\\", also referred to as the \\"Haunted House\\", was torn down in 1948. The Bannon family folklore is that the property was built over a well, causing strange sounds from debris falling into the well. Bannon passed away at his residence in Latrobe, Tasmania on 27 February 1904. He was buried at the Latrobe Cemetery (Catholic). His wife Harriet was buried at the Railton, Tasmania Cemetery (Anglican). ===Notable Relatives=== Bannon's grandson, John Hancox, was Sarah Jane Hancox‚Äôs son. He died at Gallipoli on 19 May 1915 while fighting for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps in the Gallipoli campaign https://www.aif.adfa.edu.au/showPerson?pid=125206 The AIF Project University of NSW, Sydney.

He was known mainly for playing acoustic steel string guitars, but he also played other acoustic string instruments, such the sambur, the mandola, the buzuki, as well as synthesizers. Gauriloff grew up in Mustola, Inari, in the vicinity of Nellim. He lost his mother in an act of murder, which upset the whole village. He was then raised by his grandmother, from whom he learnt the Skolt S√°mi language. Gauriloff built his first guitar from particle board, and he would amplify the sound by pressing it against the boiling pot of the sauna. There were others, too, in the family who had an active interest in cultural matters. Music became the choice of career for Leo Gauriloff and his older brother Jaakko (b. 1939). Their niece Katja Gauriloff became a well-known film director. Hopes were placed in Leo Gauriloff that he would become the first Skolt S√°mi teacher and that we would take up teaching the language at Sevettij√§rvi. After he had completed his high school studies in the Kuopio Senior High of Music and Dance, he began his studies at Oulu University. However, he never completed them, and he ended up in Tampere and the local music circles. He never forgot his Skolt S√°mi roots and he would sometimes sing in Skolt S√°mi, along with Finnish. He would borrow the musical form from various forms of popular music, e.g. the blues, but his scale in singing was wide, and included ditties and ethic music. Leo Gauriloff toured with Nils- Aslak Valkeap√§√§ ja Paroni Paakkunainen. He played the guitar on Valkeap√§√§'s records entitled S√°mi eatnan duoddariid (1978) and Davas ja Geassai (1982). Gauriloff was known especially for performing together with Mikko Perkoila. He played on seven of Perkoila's album releases. But he also played with Heikki Lund and Kiti Neuvonen and had a short stint with Piirpauke in 1984. Gauriloff also played with Jukka Tervo in the guitar duo Tervo & Gauriloff in the 1970s and 1980s, both in clubs and on major festivals in Finland, such as Provinssirock in Sein√§joki in 1980 and in the Suistomaan soittop√§iv√§t in Pori in 1981. Gauriloff also played second guitar in the documentary film called Kurki josta ei tullut lintua (‚ÄòThe crane that never became a bird‚Äô, 1981). Juice Leskinen Grand Slam released a single with the pseudonym of Trio Jyrkk√§kallio, a single with the title ‚ÄúKissa ja korttipakka‚Äù (‚ÄòThe cat and a pack of cards‚Äô) (1985). Gauriloff composed the music to the play Skoavdnji, which told about the fate of the Skolt S√°mi in World War II and which was premiered in the S√°mi theatre Beaivv√°≈° in 1994. During 1992‚Äì1993 Gauriloff worked with Ahaa Teatteri, which is specialized in children's and youth theater. Around the turn of the millennia Gauriloff moved to Stockholm, where he worked as a musician as well as in day care centers.

It begins with Bureau of Corrections Director General Nicanor Faeldon and several other government officials signing the document containing the release of former Calauan, Laguna Mayor Antonio Sanchez, the prime suspect in the rape and murder of Eileen Sarmenta and her friend Allan Gomez in 1993, and the release of Josman Aznar, Ariel Balansag, Alberto Ca√±o and James Anthony Uy, the 4 suspects in the rape and murder of sisters Marijoy and Jacqueline Chiong in 1997, citing \\"good conduct.\\" The aftermath of release of convicts through GCTA subsequently led to investigation regarding the GCTA and to the BuCor personnel involved in the controversy. ==Background== The Good Conduct Time Allowance bill, also known as Republic Act No. 10592, was approved by the Congress and was signed by then-President Benigno Aquino III on May 29, 2013. ==Controversies== 180px ===Planned release of Antonio Sanchez=== In August 2019, news reports stated that former Calauan, Laguna Mayor Antonio Sanchez, the suspect of raping and murdering Eileen Sarmenta and Allan Gomez in 1993, could have walked free from prison after spending 25 years in prison, according to a document bearing the signature of Bureau of Corrections director Nicanor Faeldon. The document said the release order was for one Antonio Leyza Sanchez, \\"who was found to have served 40 years upon retroactive application of RA No. 10592 and was certified to have no other legal cause to be further detained, shall be released from confinement.\\" RA 10592 is the law allowing convicts an early release based on good conduct time allowance (GCTA). On August 22, 2019, Sanchez, wearing formal outfit, is seen walking inside the prison alongside with the bodyguards. Note: At 5:20 A social media post also claimed that Sanchez is spotted in his house in Calauan, Laguna two months ago. The impending release of Sanchez sparked nationwide outrage and condemnation. Prior to the issue, questions were raised over how could he qualify for good conduct when he was caught of seizing various items inside the prison such as P1.5 million worth of methamphetamine (shabu) hidden in a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 2010 and an air-conditioning unit and flat-screen TV in 2015. Despite the outrage, BuCor Director General Nicanor Faeldon has changed tune and said Sanchez may be disqualified from the good conduct and time allowance (GCTA) rule based on several grounds. On August 23, University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os, the alma mater of Sarmenta and Gomez, held a rally to oppose the Sanchez's release. Among there present is the mother of Allan Gomez. Despite the Duterte administration denies the role of Sanchez release, Duterte's name can be seen written on their placards. The Supreme Court of the Philippines (SC), in a statement by spokesperson Brian Hosaka, denied ordering the release of Sanchez when it ruled on the retroactive application of RA 10592. Sanchez has maintained his innocence for the 1993 rape-slay of Sarmenta and the murder of Gomez and said he deserved to be freed. On August 26, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra and Bureau of Corrections chief Nicanor Faeldon not to release convicted rapist-murderer Antonio Sanchez. On September 2, 2019, The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee holds a joint probe into the supposed early release of rape and murder convict Former Mayor Antonio Sanchez and the controversial Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) Law. Bureau of Corrections chief Nicanor Faeldon confirms that George Medialdea, Rogelio Corcolon and Zoilo Ama, the three men who were convicted for the June 1993 rape and killing of Sarmenta and Gomez were already dead in jail. Senator Risa Hontiveros said that there are indications of GCTA system \\"is being corrupted\\" like the case of Sanchez. On September 3, 2019, The family of rape and murder convict and former Calauan, Laguna Mayor Antonio Sanchez showed up at the Senate for the resumption of the probe into the controversy surrounding the possible release of their patriarch. The Sanchez family has maintain their intention that they will not pay the ‚Ç±12.6-million court-mandated damages to the families of Eileen Sarmenta and Allan Gomez who were murdered in 1993. Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP) executive director Reynaldo Bayang revealed in a Senate inquiry that Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo, who served as Sanchez's defense counsel in the high-profile 1993 Sarmenta-Gomez rape-slay case, wrote the BPP regarding Sanchez's application for executive clemency in a letter dated February 26. Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo has confirmed a meeting with the family of his former client, convicted rapist- killer Antonio Sanchez, in Malaca√±ang earlier this year. President Rodrigo Duterte has fired Bureau of Corrections chief Nicanor Faeldon after the latter approved the release of Sanchez. ===The release of Chiong murders suspects=== On August 30, 2019, Senator Panfilo Lacson stated that some of the convicts of the 1997 murder of the Chiong sisters are now out of prison. Faeldon has confirmed the release of Josman Aznar, Ariel Balansag, Alberto Ca√±o and James Anthony Uy, the four persons who were convicted for the 1997 murder of the Chiong sisters. On September 4, President Rodrigo Duterte has fired Bureau of Corrections chief Nicanor Faeldon after the latter approved the release of three convicts in the murder case. On September 5, Chiong sisters' parents has called Duterte to return the three convicts back to prison. Eventually, the Chiong sisters' parents thanked to the President when the news of Duterte announcing that surrender of the released convicts for good conduct. The parents are also called for the investigation of Faeldon for his actions, in which Faeldon would be fired from his post by President Duterte. On September 6, Ariel Balansag and Alberto Ca√±o, the two of the three convicts of the Chiong sisters rape-slay case, who were released by virtue of the controversial Good Conduct Time Allowance Law, has been surrendered to the authorities. On September 18, James Anthony Uy and Josman Aznar, the last two of the four convicts of the Chiong sisters rape-slay case, has finally surrendered to the authorities. === Absolute pardon of Joseph Scott Pemberton === The GCTA would also play a role in a different case several years later, as lawyer Rowena Garcia-Flores filed an urgent motion to the Olongapo City Regional Trial Court Branch 74 in late August 2020, requesting the release of Joseph Scott Pemberton, a US Marine convicted in the homicide of Filipino national Jennifer Laude in 2014. The grounds of the urgent motion stated that Pemberton should have been released from prison on July 31st, 2020 after serving more than half of his 10-year sentence for displaying good conduct. This basis was provided by computations done by the BuCor, showing that the former US Marine has served a total sentence of eight years and ten months. In addition to this, Flores also stated that the BuCor did not give Pemberton any good conduct time allowances (GCTA) for over a year from October 22nd, 2014, to November 2015, stating that Pemberton did not receive any GCTA credits for the actual time he served from October 22 to December 18 in 2014, and for the months of June and July in 2020. However, the Laude family is opposed to the early release of Pemberton, stating that Pemberton was placed under solitary confinement, which does not count towards GCTA accreditation, and thus could not reasonably and justifiably claim good conduct. Aside from the Laude family, the pardon sparked outrage in the LGBT community, as well as high- profile personalities from senators to celebrities. The hashtag #JusticeForJenniferLaude landed on the top trending spot in social media, where majority of the posts were critical of Duterte. Despite this, President Rodrigo Duterte officially gave Pemberton an absolute pardon on September 7, 2020. On September 11, 2020, several LGBT communities held a rally to protest Duterte's absolute of pardon of Joseph Scott Pemberton. Note: Go to 8:27-9:27 for the story. ===Other releases=== Faeldon confirmed that at least 200 convicts have been released since June 2019. The data from BuCor showed that out of total 22,049 prisoners were freed since 2014 due to good conduct, there 1,914 prisoners who were been convicted with heinous crimes have been released. On September 4, 2019 Duterte ordered all 1,914 convicts to surrender themselves, giving an ultimatum of 15 days, otherwise the police will hunt them down. On September 10, the police reported that 180 convicts who were released based on the good conduct have been surrendered. On September 17, Duterte has offered a reward of P1 million to those who could capture the freed convicts \\"dead or alive\\". On September 20, the DOJ ordered to stop the re-arrests of freed convicts after discovering the errors on the list submitted to the BuCor. Over 2,000 convicts have voluntarily surrendered to the government out of listed 1,914 individuals. Explaining the erroneous data, Justice Undersecretary Markk Perete said that 41 of whom \\"were freed with no legal obstacle\\" or not via GCTA. The record also shows that 354 inmates were released under the Aquino administration while 1,429 inmates under the Duterte administration. == Investigations regarding the GCTA == On September 6, an inmate's wife named Yolanda Camilon claimed that she was asked by BuCor employees a P50,000 in exchange for her husband's release from prison. On September 19, Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Officer 3 Veronica Bu√±o revealed that she exchanged conversation with Camilon via text messaging. On September 9, Ombudsman Samuel Martires has suspended BuCor officials for a period of six months. == Reactions == On September 4, 2019, Duterte fired Faeldon from his duty for his actions. He was replaced by former Manila jail warden Gerald Bantag. On September 18, Senator Leila de Lima said that the agency needs a real leader who can fight against corruption. == References == Category:2019 in the Philippines Category:2019 controversies Category:Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte Category:Penal system in the Philippines ","title":"Good Conduct Time Allowance controversy"},{"id":"61730452","text":"Opytnoye Khozyaystvo () is a rural locality (a village) in Krasnoyarsky Selsoviet, Ufimsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

He was named in the Indian contingent for the 2018 Commonwealth Games but had to pull out 10 days before the April event after being diagnosed with appendicitis.

Two months later, he participated in the 2018 Asian Junior Athletics Championships in Gifu despite having \\"less strength, speed and focus\\" from before the illness and won bronze with a jump of 7.47 metres. At the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, he \\"struggled with run-up issues\\" and finished sixth in the final with 7.95 metres. In September 2018, Sreeshankar broke the national record at the National Open Athletics Championships in Bhubaneswar where he achieved a jump of 8.20 metres. It was also the world leading jump of the season among under-20 athletes and made him the first Indian athlete to qualify for the 2019 World Athletics Championships scheduled to be held in September‚ÄìOctober in Doha. ==Personal life== Sreeshankar was a state-level under-10 champion in 50 metres and 100 metres, but switched from sprinting to long jump at the age of 13.

She had a younger sister, Mary Martha. After winning a beauty contest at Clarksville's Capitol Theatre in 1933 as a teenager, Wood earned a trip to Hollywood, where she was cast in Roman Scandals (1933). She then returned to Clarksville to finish high school; upon her return to Hollywood after graduation, she signed a contract with MGM. She reportedly spent $4,000 on a vocal coach who helped her drop her Southern accent. She later signed at 20th Century Fox, where she was made to compete for parts against fellow actresses Rita Hayworth (then Margarita Cansino) and Dixie Dunbar. On-screen, she was frequently paired with actor Thomas Beck. Supposedly she had to back out of a big role due to an illness early on in her career. She worked in radio after her on-screen roles dried up in the late 1930s. In 1942, she married Earl Henriksen. == Selected filmography == * Roman Scandals (1933) * Moulin Rouge (1934) * Kid Millions (1934) * Gold Diggers of 1935 (1935) * Mary Jane's Pa (1935) * In Caliente (1935) * Anna Karenina (1935) * She Married Her Boss (1935) * The Goose and the Gander (1935) * A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935) * My Marriage (1936) * Champagne Charlie (1936) * High Tension (1936) * Charlie Chan at the Race Track (1936) * Sing, Baby, Sing (1936) * Can This Be Dixie?

She was the county's first female county commissioner. Known for her strong environmentalist views, she served on the state board of the Nature Conservancy and on the Governor's Commission for a Sustainable South Florida. When Hurchalla learned that the company Lake Point, owned by George Lindemann Jr., was planning on developing a rock mining site in Martin County, she wrote twenty-three emails to county commissioners expressing her objections to the plans based on environmental concerns. Lake Point made deals with South Florida Water Management District in 2008 and Martin County in 2009 for water storage, but both deals were canceled in 2012. Lake Point said that Hurchalla was the reason the contracts were canceled and sued her in 2013 for tortious interference. In February 2018, the trial took place and was decided in favor of Lake Point.

The Columbian armed schooner Centinella, Captain Hopner, had towed her off. Hopner put an officer and some men aboard Waterloo and they brought her into Savannah.LL ‚Ññ5169. On 22 May 1824, in the case Jackson and others vs. Strong, the insurers brought a petition for relief, which the Admiralty Court denied. It appeared that when Waterloo ran aground some five boats of fishermen or wreckers saved her from destruction. However, the Columbian national ship Centella, Captain C.C. Hopner had arrived and Thomas Partridge turned Waterloo over to him, stating that she was too damaged and her crew too sickly, to sail her safely to England. Hopner put an officer and six men aboard Waterloo who took her into Savannah. There she was repaired and the Admiralty Court of the District awarded Hopner and his crew $12,000 for salvage. Partridge did not have the money or credit so he sold the cargo, at great loss. The insurers suspected that Partridge had conspired with Hopner to have Waterloo taken to a US port that would award excessive salvage, with Hopner providing a side payment to Partridge. { class=\\"sortable \\" - !

His father, Pierre-Fran√ßois M√©zi√®re came from Dijon where he was a lawyer and notary. He emigrated to French Canada towards the end of the French Regime. His mother was Michel Archangel Campeau. He had 14 brothers and sisters, 6 of whom died before reaching adulthood. From 1782 to 1788, he studied at St. Raphael College in Montreal. By his own account, M√©zi√®re wrote, \\"a college entrusted to ignorant clerics was the tomb of my youthful years.\\" In January 1788, he published his first poetry in The Montreal Gazette, a journal founded by Fleury Mesplet. In 1791, Resplet published an account of a meeting of young men who celebrated the Constitutional Act 1791 with revolutionary toasts. In the following year, M√©zi√®re felt that the situation in Montreal was untenable for him and in May 1793 he left for the United States. After passing through New York, he reached Philadelphia and got in touch with Edmond-Charles Genet, ambassador of the French First Republic. Since it declared war on Great Britain on February 1, France sought to foment rebellion amongst the population of Upper Canada and Lower Canada against the British colonial government. In June, M√©zi√®re submitted a text entitled \\"Comment on the current state of Canada and on the political dispositions of its inhabitants\\", in which it stated that British troops are spread thin across a 200-mile frontier but that for the Canadian population to rise up against the British authorities they would need the help of France. The embassy then instructed him to open a reliable correspondence with Canada from the United States and to distribute \\"patriotic papers, songs, convention ballots and an address prepared by the Embassy and entitled \\"French free to their brothers the Canadians\\". He was paid 1200 livres and instructed to return to Montreal with assorted pamphlets and propaganda material. He travelled to Lake Champlain where he enlisted the help of an agent, Jacques Rous, who went to Montreal in September 1793 but received little support even from his Meziere's radical friends. Rous may have been a double agent because the colonial authorities became aware of M√©zi√®re's presence. Rous reported back that Quebec was ripe for capture and that there were no naval assets to protect Lower Canada. After accomplishing this mission, he was designated a \\"political agent\\" and took part in a military operation against Halifax. L'Eole, a French ship under the command of Rear-Admiral Sercey, was unable to accomplish its mission, which was abandoned. The ship, with M√©zi√®re still on board, finally crossed the Atlantic and docked at Brest on November 2, 1793. On January 4, 1794, he submitted a memoir on the situation of Canada and the United States to Jean Dalbarade, then Minister of the Navy. He was imprisoned briefly due to mistaken identity after which he found a job as a civil servant in the city of Bordeaux. He left France for New York following the Restoration of 1816. He survived by teaching French and with the help of his sisters and his friend Louis-Charles Foucher, he returned to Montreal on September 3. He signed a declaration of repentance for his collaboration with France and swore fidelity to the British crown before justice of the peace Jean-Marie Mondelet. In February 1817, he became co-owner of the newspaper Le Spectateur canadien with Charles-Bernard Pasteuret. M√©zi√®re left the newspaper following a disagreement with his partner. On August 1, 1818, he began to publish a bi- monthly newspaper, L'Abeille canadienne (The Canadian Bee), which mainly covered the content of French periodicals, among others La Ruche d'Aquitaine. Meziere wrote only a few articles as well as the prospectus. The paper lasted only six months until January 15, 1819. M√©zi√®re returned to France after his wife inherited land and income and he did not return to America. He died in 1846, in Bordeaux, France. ==Publications== * L'Abeille canadienne (The Canadian Bee), 1818-1819, 12 issues. ==References== ===Further reading=== * ==External links== * Category:1771 births Category:1846 deaths Category:19th- century Canadian journalists Category:Canadian male journalists Category:Journalists from Quebec Category:People from Montreal ","title":"Henri-Antoine M√©zi√®re"},{"id":"61731190","text":"was a Sengoku period yamashiro-style Japanese castle located in what is now part of the city of Shimada, Shizuoka prefecture, Japan. The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1975. ==Overview== Suwahara Castle is located at the edge of cliff, commanding the location where the ≈åi River crosses the T≈çkaid≈ç highway. At the time the castle was constructed, the river was closer to the cliff face, so that the castle was strategically important for controlling both the highway and the river. The inner bailey of the castle is a square-shaped area, 100 meters on a side, which is backed against a steep cliff. Two enclosures spread in concentric circles from the inner bailey, each protected by a moat and wall. The second bailey is approximately 100 meters long by 80 meters die, and the third bailey is approximately 200 meters long by 80 meters wide. In the middle of both the second and third bailey is a large semi-circular fort, called an \\"Umadashi\\", which is a construct unique to Takeda clan designs. Each \\"umadashi\\" is a 40 meter semi-circular wall, protected by a dry moat, with a gate on either end, from which the defenders could protect the flanks of the wall, the gates, and to stage counterattacks. total size of the castle was about 300 meter long and 200 meter wide. ==History== Following the death of the warlord Takeda Shingen, his son Takeda Katsuyori attempted to pursue his father's legacy and unify the clan by pursuing a highly aggressive policy against Mikawa-based Tokugawa Ieyasu. As part of this campaign, Katsuyori ordered his general Baba Nobuharu to construct a castle at this location in 1573 in order the facilitate the Takeda invasion of T≈çt≈çmi Province and capture of Takatenjin Castle. It was named after a Suwa shrine brought to this site by the Takeda clan from Shinano Province, as the Suwa kami were the tutelary kami of the Takeda. In 1575, following their victory at the Battle of Nagashino, the Tokugawa swept through T≈çt≈çmi Province, and overran Suwahara Castle. The castle was renamed Makino Castle and used as the Tokugawa base of operations against the Takeda in the Siege of Takatenjin Castle in 1581. After Tokugawa clan was relocated to the Kant≈ç region by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590, Suwahara Castle was abandoned. Despite having been used for only less than 10 years, original plan of this castle clearly remains. The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017. ==See also== *List of Historic Sites of Japan (Shizuoka) == References == * == External links == Suwahara Castle at JCastle Info homepage Category:Castles in Shizuoka Prefecture Category:Ruined castles in Japan Category:History of Shizuoka Prefecture Category:1570s establishments in Japan Category:Shimada, Shizuoka Category:Historic Sites of Japan Category:T≈çt≈çmi Province Category:Takeda clan ","title":"Suwahara Castle"},{"id":"61731196","text":"Yuji Kitagawa (born 11 August 1986) is a Japanese rugby union player who played as a lock represented Japan internationally from 2007 to 2011 and played for Panasonic Wild Knights in the Japanese Top League.

In 2004, he received the International Dairy Federation Award. ==Early life and education== Born in Christchurch on 23 October 1937, Creamer was the son of Gladys Henrietta Creamer (n√©e Hopkins) and William Henry Creamer. He was educated at Christchurch Boys' High School, and went on to study chemistry at Canterbury University College, graduating Master of Science with second-class honours in 1961. He completed a PhD at the same institution, by then called the University of Canterbury, in 1963; the title of his doctoral thesis, supervised by Jack Vaughan and Alfred Fischer, was The Ladenburg rearrangement. ==Research career== Creamer joined the New Zealand Dairy Research Institute (DRI), later part of Fonterra, in Palmerston North in 1963, and between 1964 and 1966 he undertook protein research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Returning to DRI, he rose to become a principal research scientist in 1990. He led a research team that investigated the chemistry of milk proteins and their interactions. His research covered both fundamental chemistry and practical aspects of the manufacturing of dairy products. His early work resulted in improvements to the manufacture and consistency of cheese and milk powders. He carried out research into milk protein structures, and the effect of heat on milk and the aggregation of the proteins in whey. As a result, whey proteins, previously only used as animal feed, became ingredients in a range of food products. His research into casein hydrolysis in cheese led to greater understanding of the relationship between cheese composition, texture and flavour. The current system under which New Zealand dairy farmers are paid for their milk based on its content of milk fat and protein solids was a direct result of work by Creamer. From the 1990s, much of Creamer's research was on the structure of the whey protein Œ≤-lactoglobulin, how it is affected by heat, and its ability to bind vitamins. His research found that the structure of Œ≤-lactoglobulin is altered at high temperature, forming a new protein that reacts with smaller milk proteins. ==Honours and awards== In 1973, Creamer received the ICI New Zealand Prize, for outstanding achievement in chemical research, and the following year he was elected a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry. In 1984, the American Dairy Science Association awarded him the Miles-Marschall International ADSA Award, for research outside of North America leading to improved dairy products; he was, at the time, the youngest ever recipient of the award. Creamer was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1995, and won the society's Scott Medal in 1999, for pre-eminence in fundamental, strategic and applied New Zealand dairy science and technology. In 2004, Creamer received the world's top dairy honour, the International Dairy Federation Award, in recognition of his contributions to the dairy industry over more than 40 years. == Selected works== * * * ==Death== Creamer died in Wellington on 7 September 2019 at the age of 81. ==References== Category:1937 births Category:2019 deaths Category:20th-century New Zealand scientists Category:21st-century New Zealand scientists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of New Zealand Category:New Zealand chemists Category:New Zealand justices of the peace Category:People educated at Christchurch Boys' High School Category:People from Christchurch Category:University of Canterbury alumni ","title":"Lawrie Creamer"},{"id":"61731320","text":"James \\"Bull\\" Draper was an American football player and coach.

He is regarded as the first artist to have sung popular music in the Skolt S√°mi language and is said to be the first S√°mi to have published an album in Finland when he published his first record at the end of the 1960s. Although he is mostly known as a schlager singer, he can also sing traditional Skolt S√°mi leu πdds. == Early life == Gauriloff was born in the village of Suonikyl√§ (), Petsamo Province, Finland, a few months before the Winter War broke out. The family had to be evacuated, and Gauriloff was put in a sledge to which a reindeer was harnessed to pull it. For some reason, the reindeer started, and the sledge and young Gauriloff flipped upside down into a snowbank. In spite of all this, Gauriloff did not even wake up, the sledge was righted, and the evacuation journey to the Oulu region could begin. During the truce period, the family returned home, where Gauriloff listened to Olavi Virta and Tatu Pekkarinen on his grandfather's gramophone. In 1944, after the Continuation War, the Suonikyl√§ Skolts were once again evacuated. This time, they were resettled in the Sevettij√§rvi area of Inari. Gauriloff's parents did not want to settle there, and thus house no. 1 in Sevettij√§rvi was left empty. In 1956, they received a house in Nilij√§rvi, near Nellim, where they settled down. Gauriloff became even more interested in music in the 1950s when he listened to records by Olavi Virta and Veikko Tuomi at home. \\"I learned to sing all those songs, 'Hopeinen kuu' and everything\\", he later said. When he heard that Olavi Virta was coming to perform in Ivalo, he went there to see him, travelling the on his bicycle. Having seen the concert, Gauriloff decided to become a singer, too. He started singing at the age of 15 and won a schlager competition that was held in Sodankyl√§ in 1961, which he had entered on a bet with his friends. Three years later, he placed third in the Finnish Schlager Championships. ==Career== Gauriloff's success in the Finnish championships was noted by the magazine Suosikki, which ran a story on him, calling him \\"the James Dean of Nellim\\" and \\"the world's northernmost schlager singer\\", and his popularity went skyrocketing. He began to receive fan mail in Nellim. \\"It was terrible. I could no longer have my peace and quiet\\", he says of those times. He was asked to go to Helsinki, and indeed went there, but did not like it, explaining: \\"I was not cut out for city life. I could not stay there and stare at those apartment buildings\\". Back in the north, he was offered a two-week tour in Northern Finland together with Olavi Virta. In 1970, Gauriloff moved to Rovaniemi and founded a band named Kaamos ('Polar Night'). This is when he began to sing in Skolt S√°mi. In the early 1970s, Gauriloff performed on the television for the first time. He also toured with Nils-Aslak Valkeap√§√§ and √Ösa Blind. The three artists released an album titled De ƒç√°bba niegut runiidit in 1976. The album got mixed reviews, for example, Helsingin Sanomat did not consider the album to represent genuine S√°mi music. In 1981, Gauriloff recorded the world's first reggae single in Saami called \\"Tanja\\", which placed second in voting on the popular Finnish television show Levyraati. From 1984 to 1989, Gauriloff served as the provincial artist for S√°mi culture. While in the Soviet Union, he met Ilpo Saastamoinen, who was there on a tour. In 1991, Saastamoinen and Gauriloff visited the Kola Peninsula twice, collecting material, some of which was released on Gauriloff's 1992 album Ku√§ πckkem su√§jai vue πlnn. Between 1994 and 1997, the two travelled around the Kola Peninsula recording more music from the S√°mi people there for the Kola S√°mi Musical Tradition project of the University of Troms√∏. From 1993 to 1999, Gauriloff sang the lead role in the opera trilogy Velho in √Ñk√§slompolo. He has also performed in many countries in Europe as well as in the United States and Japan. In addition to schlager and folk music, Gauriloff has sung on an album titled Finlande in 2002. In November 2013, the S√°mi Parliament of Finland presented Gauriloff with an award on his 50th anniversary as an artist. ==Family== Guitarist Leo Gauriloff was Jaakko Gauriloff's younger brother.

Left: Papanicolaou stain; right: Oil Red O stain. Lipid-laden alveolar macrophages, also known as pulmonary foam cells, are cells found in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens that consist of macrophages containing deposits of lipids (fats). The lipid content of the macrophages can be demonstrated using a lipid targeting stain like Oil Red O or Nile red. Increased levels of lipid-laden alveolar macrophages are associated with various respiratory conditions, including chronic smoking, gastroesophageal reflux, lipoid pneumonia, fat embolism, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and pulmonary aspiration. Lipid-laden alveolar macrophages have been reported in cases of vaping-associated pulmonary injury. The lipid-laden macrophage index (LLMI) can be calculated by counting 100 macrophages in a BAL specimen treated with a lipid stain and scoring each macrophage from 0 to 4 based on the amount of lipids present in the cell. A LLMI score greater than 100 is considered positive for pulmonary aspiration.

She was a leader, contributor, activist, and supportive teacher throughout her life as a suffragist. Fannie Hopkins Hamilton will continue to inspire women today with her courageous and intelligent works as a suffragist. == Background == Fannie Hopkins Hamilton Grave Picture Fannie Hopkins Hamilton was the founding treasurer of the Wilmington Equal Suffrage Study Group. She was born in 1882 in Queen Anne's County, Maryland, but later moved to Wilmington at age eight. Her father was a minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Fannie married George W. Hamilton, a fireman, in 1901. Together, they had two daughters: Katherine and Georgina. During her years as a mother, Fannie sought an occupation as a seamstress and a dressmaker, later traveling to Philadelphia to pursue advanced training at Drexel University. Soon, she developed her own shop. She also began teaching classes at Wilmington ‚Äúcolored‚Äù schools and encountered Alice Moore Dunbar, who was an African American political activist and poet during the Harlem Renaissance. Equipped with this contact, Fannie began to contribute to the Organization of Business and Professional Women in Wilmington. She later volunteered herself as treasurer of the Wilmington Equal Suffrage Study Club, which organized Wilmington‚Äôs first big suffrage parade. After the 19th amendment was ratified, the group redefined themselves as the Colored Women‚Äôs Republican Committee. As a member, Fannie actively encouraged voter registration. She also gave her time to the Red Circle Community Association, which raised funds to improve African American children‚Äôs playgrounds. Additionally, Fannie managed recreational programs and gave budgeting advice to people at the ‚ÄúWalnut Street Y‚Äù- an African American branch of the YMCA.For broad context on Delaware's African American community, see Annette Woolard-Provine, Integrating Delaware: The Reddings of Wilmington (Newark, DE: University of Delaware Press, 2003); Carol Hoffecker and Annette Woolard, \\"Black Women in Delaware's History,\\" http://www1.udel.edu/BlackHistory/blackwomen.html; and Pauline A.

Hopkins, served on Wilmington‚Äôs City Council and often disputed racial segregation policies. He later founded a theatre to accommodate the black community, where Fannie helped organize events. Fannie Hopkins Hamilton died in 1964 and was married to George for 62 years.\\"1910 Census\\". www.ancestryclassroom.com. Retrieved 2019-10-15. == Early life == Fannie Hopkins Hamilton was born in 1882 in Queen‚Äôs Anne‚Äôs County, Maryland and moved to Wilmington, Delaware when she was eight with her widowed mother. Her father, Rev. Oliver Hopkins, died when she was young and he was a Minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.Fannie Hamilton's work settling family probate and property matters can be traced through family wills found at the New Castle County Register of Wills Office in Wilmington, Delaware.

Hull (New York: W.W. Norton, 1984). Her stepfather, Benjamin Briggs, was also a minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. == Education == Fannie Hopkins Hamilton went to local public schools as a young girl in Wilmington, Delaware. During her years as a mother, Fannie was seeking an occupation as a seamstress and a dress maker, later traveling to Philadelphia to pursue advanced training at Drexel University. Soon, she developed her own shop. She also began teaching classes at Wilmington ‚Äúcolored‚Äù schools and encountered Alice Moore Dunbar, who was an African American political activist and poet during the Harlem Renaissance. Equipped with this contact, Fannie began to contribute to the Organization of Business and Professional Women in Wilmington.Significant newspaper articles on Fannie Hopkins Hamilton's activism and career include: \\"Neighborhood House Opened,\\" Morning News, October 19, 1911, p.1; \\"Mrs. Hamilton Graduate of Drexel\\" Evening Journal, June 11, 1908, p. 8; \\"Negro Women to Study Suffrage,\\" Morning News, March 21, 1914, p. 2; \\"Classes in Dressmaking,\\" Evening Journal, October 26, 1915, p. 4; \\"Ask $2500 for Social Centre,\\" ibid., September 22, 1921, p. 14; \\"Registration Boards Named,\\" ibid., June 16, 1926, pp. 1-2; \\"Woman's Day at Big Bethel Church,\\" ibid., April 9, 1927, p. 4; \\"Class Entertains Teacher,\\" Wilmington Evening Journal-Every Evening, April 8, 1935, p. 11; \\"‚ÄòY.W' Unit Plans Drive for Funds,\\" Morning News, April 8, 1942, p. 12; \\"Consumers Institute to Open September 3,\\" ibid., August 22, 1942, p. 2; \\"Recreation Program for Negro Youth Urged,\\" ibid., August 5, 1943, p. 6.

She represents an overlooked figure as an African American suffragist, and also offers insight into how women encouraged others to become politically active after earning the right to vote. History often earmarks the 19th amendment as a significant gain for women, but little know about how half the population was activated to use this right. Although Fannie mainly improved her town of Wilmington, her work embodies the lives of many women who dedicated their time to upholding their communities. == Uplifting the African American Community == After the 19th amendment was ratified, the group, Equal Suffrage Study Club, redefined themselves as the Colored Women‚Äôs Republican Committee. As a member, Fannie actively encouraged voter registration. She also gave her time to the Red Circle Community Association, which raised funds to improve African American children‚Äôs playgrounds. Additionally, Fannie managed recreational programs and gave budgeting advice to people at the ‚ÄúWalnut Street Y‚Äù- an African American branch of the YMCA. == Personal life == Fannie was married to George W Hamilton for 62 years.\\"George Hamilton in the 1940 Census\\". www.ancestryclassroom.com.Retrieved 2019-10-15. They had two daughters together: Katherine Lorraine Hamilton and Elizabeth Anderson Parker. She had a granddaughter and three great grandchildren as well. == Final years == During her final years, Fannie continued to pursue her career as a dressmaker, businesswoman, suffragist, and civil rights activist. Once her health started to fail, she died at the age of 81 in 1964. == Legacy == Her role in creating the Organization of Business and Professional Women in Wilmington lived on as well as her mentorship in teaching dressmaking at Wilmington schools. Fannie would donate her time to help families plan their wartime clothing budgets, work to provide foster homes and recreational programs for black children, and fund-raising for the Red Cross. A large portion of the community relied on Fannie‚Äôs business and economic skills. ==References== Category:1882 births Category:1964 deaths Category:American suffragists Category:American women's rights activists Category:African- American feminists Category:American feminists Category:People from Queen Anne's County, Maryland Category:African-American suffragists ","title":"Fannie Hopkins Hamilton"},{"id":"61731532","text":"Renaud Ewaldt van Neel (born 23 May 1988) is a former Namibian rugby union player who played as a lock represented Namibia internationally from 2011 to 2012 and played for the University of Namibia where he also finished his graduation.

It is situated at the back of the Pikit Municipal Hall on a hill facing the National Highway. ==History== Fort Pikit was built in 1893 by Spanish conquistadors at the time the Spanish colonial government is actively launching a campaign against the Moro in Mindanao. When the United States took over the administration of the Philippines from Spain, the American colonial government gained control of the fort in 1902 and used it their own campaign in Mindanao. Still within the American colonial period, the Philippine Constabulary assumed control of the fort. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines of World War II the fort was seized by Imperial Japanese forces. The Allied forces regained control of the fort as part of their Eastern Mindanao campaign. After the war, the fort was used by the Philippine Army and later the Philippine Marines.

This is evident in the very fact that the Utah Constitution granted women the right to vote‚Äî20 years before the 19th Amendment was passed nationally. Despite high levels of female participation in politics and government, the issue of women's suffrage saw both support by Utah women and opposition by many other Utah women. == Women's political clubs == === The League of Women Voters of Salt Lake City === The League of Women Voters of Salt Lake City is a local branch of The League of Women Voters, a bipartisan political organization. This group's current aims are as follows: ensure voter access, mobilize voters, ensure voter education, promote transparency and accountability in government. In the early-to-mid 1900s, the league was extensively involved in improving the infrastructure and environmental health of Salt Lake City, two major concerns of inhabitants of the region at that time. The league published several booklets of information pertaining to this work, including data from commissioned scientists ran regarding what was needed to improve local infrastructure and the environment, as well as the results of the work done, which were favorable. Another objective of The League of Women Voters of Salt Lake City was to amend the state of public schools in the area. The booklet containing this information, as did first, relied on scientific data to buttress their claims about how increasing the allocation of funds to local public schools would improve the state of local elementary education. === Utah Woman's Suffrage Association === The Utah Woman's Suffrage Association was an affiliate of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, another bipartisan political organization. It was founded by Susan B. Anthony. Members of the association included prominent female political participants of the time, including Dr. Martha Hughes Cannon, the first female state senator and Emmeline B. Wells, a suffragist activist.  Emmeline B. Wells, suffragist  Emmeline B. Wells was born in 1829 in Petersham, Massachusetts. From 1877 to 1914, Wells was the editor of the Woman's Exponent, a popular Mormon women's magazine printed out of Salt Lake City, Utah. Wells began expressing her support for the woman's suffrage movement and for females in governmental positions to a public audience in her writings for the Woman's Exponent under a pen name. Having been one of the first women to vote when Utah Women were first granted suffrage, Wells worked on a national level to garner support for woman's suffrage by sending large petitions to the United States capital at Washington D.C. At the requests of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, Wells represented Utah and spoke at the 1879 National Woman's Suffrage Association convention in Washington. Near the end of her life, in 1910, Wells became the General President of the Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, holding that position of service for 11 years. === Women's Republican Club of Salt Lake City === The Women's Republican Club of Salt Lake City is a branch of the National Federation of Republican Women (NFRW). The club was organized in 1899 and was formally incorporated in 1903. === Women's Democratic Club of Utah === The Women's Democratic Club of Utah (WDC) officially began in 1896 and claims to have been founded by women who assisted in the drafting of the Utah State Constitution. == Women in office == === Dr. Martha Hughes Cannon === Dr. Martha Hughes Cannon Born in 1857, Dr. Martha Hughes Cannon was the first female state senator. She was elected to the Utah State legislature as a Democrat in 1896, the year the United States Federal Government gave the women of Utah the right to vote. Cannon immigrated with her family to Utah from Wales as Latter-Day Saints. She achieved a chemistry degree at the University of Deseret, now University of Utah, and a medical degree at the University or Michigan in 1881 and a degree in pharmaceuticals at the University of Pennsylvania in 1882. At the National School of Elocution and Oratory in Philadelphia, she earned a degree for her public speaking skill. In Salt Lake City, she was the resident physician at Deseret Hospital and became involved in the woman suffrage movement before being elected to the Utah State Legislature. In her time on the legislature, Cannon championed for women to balance home life and life in the public sphere, and presented several bills having to do with public health. === Lora Loretta Woodland Tanner === Born June 10, 1857, Lora Tanner was a member of the Utah State Legislator from 1927-1928 and 1931-1932. Having studied at Brigham Young College, Logan, she became the first female graduate of the college in 1887 and went on to pursue her continued education at Brigham Young University and the University of Utah. As a state legislator, she was the chairman for the House Steering Committee and sponsor for the Kindergarten Bill. She was a member and leader in several female and co-ed political organizations in the Salt Lake City Area, including the Women's Civic Center, The Utah Congress of PTA's (member for 20 years and president from 1919 to 1922), Republican Women for the Payson Celebration (president for the occasion of Utah being granted statehood), the City Recreation Committee, the Health and Education Committee, the Child Welfare Committee of the City Council Defense Committee, Utah Pioneers Central Camp Vice President, and on a national level she was a member of the Herbert Hoover National Food Distribution Relief Committee. Her husband, Henry Smith Tanner was Salt Lake City, Utah's first state judge. She was remembered as an \\"ex-teacher, woman legislator\\" in her obituary. == Notable events == === International Women's Year Conference === The International Women's Year Conference (IWY) was held in the summer of 1977, every U.S. state held a conference to discuss Women's rights. Utah's conference was the largest, with over 8,000 more women in attendance than the second biggest assembly in California. The conference was only expecting a couple thousand people to show up, but were inundated with over 14,000 women. The equal rights amendment (ERA) was the main topic for the conferences across the nation. The ERA \\"proposed equality of rights under the law regardless of sex\\". It had been passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and only needed three more states to be ratified into the United States Constitution. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints called for ten women from every congregation across the state to attend and vote against the amendment. The women, who were more than ninety percent Latter Day Saint, overwhelmingly voted against it. A small political group, Mormons for ERA, only had around 1000 members throughout the country and did not in any way measure up to the rest of the LDS population. These events ultimately caused the failure of the ratification of the equal rights amendment in 1982. == Regional context == === The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints === Latter Day Saint Women are most commonly responsible for community and home care. In the 19th and 20th centuries, LDS women were directly taught that their work was in the home, caring for children and their husbands, as well as helping in their children's schools and in church \\"callings\\" (a specific job or responsibility given to a member of the church). These women were not expected to participate in state politics, so they started PTA's (Parent Teacher Association) for schools and were the voice for change in their smaller communities. Many women though, went to school, got professional jobs or ran for office and became voices for Utah Women. Eventually, women were better represented in state legislators in Utah than in any other state. The Relief Society was organized in Utah in 1867. Its purpose was to provide relief and created a unifying society for LDS women to carry out service projects and church services. It became a space for women to act politically, both liberally and conservatively. The main topics of conversation in this period were Women's Suffrage in Utah and gender equality in politics and within the church. They also provided magazines for women such as The Relief Society Magazine that was run by female editors, and discussed Women's suffrage as well as relief projects and spiritual subjects.left  Amy Brown Lyman  Amy Brown Lyman was born in Pleasant Grove, Utah into a polygamist Latter Day Saint Family in February 1872. She was the twenty-third out of twenty-five children to her father with three wives. They lived on a small farm and she grew up doing chores and learning maternal skills. Her parents were involved in community affairs, which allowed Lyman to observe and learn how to solve issues within the church and in the community. She was in church leadership positions since she was eleven years old and acted as the secretary of the Primary Association in her area, giving speeches for the group. She always hoped to grow up to become a teacher. She studied to become a teacher at the formerly known Brigham Young Academy with her older sister. Lyman taught at Brigham Young Academy as well as the University of Utah. At that same time, she served as the first director of the LDS Social Services Department and was a part of the LDS Relief Society presidency for thirty-five years, serving as the president for five years in the early 1940s. She was given assignments from Joseph F. Smith, the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, to transition the Relief Society into the new century. She took part in created the first teaching manuals and church magazines. Her most notable achievement was creating the LDS Social Services Department. Lyman extended service to those of other faiths and communities, working with government relief systems. She was passionate about the government's responsibility to aid the people. She petitioned the Salt Lake County Government to recognize its role in providing relief to its citizens, which led to more money spent on welfare, as well as a drop in infant and mother mortality rates in the 1920s. These actions led the Relief Society to become a national and eventually world-wide source of aid. Amy B. Lyman received the Brigham Young University Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1937. She died on December 4, 1959. == References == Category:Politics of Utah ","title":"Utah women's political organizations"},{"id":"61731780","text":"Dorysthenes zivettaThomson J (1877) Typi cerambycidarum musei Thomsoniani.

Rarely seen in public without his trademark bow tie, his dedication to improving Wellington's airport was second to none. ==Biography== ===Early life and career=== Duff was born in Wellington on 2 November 1908. He was educated at Wellington College. After leaving school in 1925 he moved to Eketahuna and worked on a local dairy farm for one year. He then began a career in the advertising industry which would last 43 consecutive years, first as a salesman then as copy writer. In 1933 he married Isobel Roberta Williams. By virtue of his advertising career, he was a member of the Wellington Publicity Club. He then joined the New Zealand Broadcasting Service as advertising manager and was later station director. He then became the managing director of the Dormer Beck advertising company. In 1964 he was appointed a Justice of the peace. His career was briefly interrupted during World War II he spent two years overseas serving with the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) from 1943 to 1945. Even after he \\"retired\\" in 1969, he still worked over 40 hours a week for the many private and community causes he was affiliated with. From 1976 to 1979 he was President of the New Zealand Electrical Supply Authority. He was also President of the Electrical Development Association, Chairman of the Airport Authorities of New Zealand, deputy chairman of the Wellington Regional Water Board and a board member of the Wellington District Licensing Committee and an executive member of the New Zealand Traffic Institute. He was Chairman of Directors of the Wellington Coca-Cola Bottlers Limited and patron of both the Wellington Surfcasting Club and Wellington Angling Club. ===Political career=== In 1959 Duff was elected to the Wellington City Council on a Citizens' Association ticket and held a seat continuously until he retired from the council in 1980. At the time of his retirement in 1980 he was Wellington's longest ever serving city councillor, 21 years over seven terms. Wellington Mayor Sir Michael Fowler later described Duff as an \\"extremely good\\" councillor. Duff was considered for the position of deputy mayor following the 1974 election, for which the media speculated him as the frontrunner due to his seniority. However second term councillor Ian Lawrence was instead chosen. Duff was acting Mayor for one month in 1977 while both Fowler and his deputy Lawrence were overseas, the first time in decades that both the mayor and deputy were overseas at the same time. Duff was a member of the National Party. Following the announcement of the retirement of MP Dan Riddiford Duff was approached to stand in the seat as the National Party candidate to succeed Riddiford. Ultimately he did not end up standing. He often took a non-partisan line and went against his Citizens' colleagues more than once notably on the city-wide electricity price hike and the conversion of both Cuba Street and Manners Street into pedestrian malls. Duff was most famous for his perpetual advocacy for Wellington International Airport which he thought was the city's most important asset and was for many years the Chairman of the Wellington Airport Authority. In 1978 he waged a successful public campaign to stop Air New Zealand being renamed 'New Zealand Airlines'. Duff was also a member of the Wellington Harbour Board. He was first elected in 1968 and was elected for four further terms, remaining a member until his death. He supported the establishment of the Wellington Regional Council and later became a foundation member of the Regional Council, elected at the inaugural election in 1980, \\"topping the poll\\" with more votes than any other candidate. ===Death and legacy=== Stewart Duff Drive, an access road which passes through the airport linking Strathmore with Moa Point, was named after him in 1977 in recognition of his advocacy for the airport. Also in 1977, Duff was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, and in the 1981 New Year Honours he was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. Despite declining health he continued his public service, though he decided to stand down from the city council after suffering a heart attack in 1979, though was still on the Harbour Board and regional council (which met less regularly). Duff died at his home in Oriental Bay, Wellington on 29 July 1981 aged 72. He was survived by his wife Roberta and daughter Diana. ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:1908 births Category:1981 deaths Category:People educated at Wellington College (New Zealand) Category:20th-century New Zealand businesspeople Category:Royal New Zealand Air Force personnel Category:New Zealand military personnel of World War II Category:Wellington City Councillors Category:Wellington Harbour Board members Category:Wellington regional councillors Category:New Zealand National Party politicians Category:20th-century New Zealand politicians Category:Companions of the Queen's Service Order Category:New Zealand justices of the peace ","title":"Stewart Duff"},{"id":"61731910","text":"Galiakhmerovo () is a rural locality (a village) in Amangildinsky Selsoviet, Uchalinsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

The roughly sixteen-acre area opened in 1996 for the park's 20th anniversary, and was the largest expansion since its opening in 1976. It is exclusive to Great America in Gurnee, though a similarly-themed land of the same name could once be found at Six Flags America. ==History== ===The Great Southwest=== During the initial planning of Marriott's Great America in Gurnee, a seventh themed land, The Great Southwest, was intended to be added the park as its first major expansion after opening. The land was planned to open in 1979, but the plans never materialized. Early signs of another land came in 1977, the park's second season, with the addition of the Southern Cross Skyride. Manufactured by the Swiss firm Von Roll, the Southern Cross was one of the tallest and longest gondola rides that the company ever produced for an amusement park, at 125 feet in the air. The reason for the height was that the Southern Cross intersected perpendicularly and also passed over the Delta Flyer/Eagle's Flight skyride. The Southern Cross was a round trip to the future plot of The Great Southwest, which was just a large pile of dirt. After the park missed its intended 1979 opening for the land, the Southern Cross operated for just three more seasons before being removed after the 1982 season. The Giant Drop, one of the attractions in Southwest Territory ===Southwest Territory expansion phases (1995-1997)=== After year of planning, Six Flags finally began to develop The Great Southwest in time for the park's 20th anniversary, now known as Southwest Territory. Although not announced, the park would open Southwest Territory in three annual phases from 1995 until 1997. The first of these phases was Viper, an all-new wooden roller coaster. It was the first roller coaster to be designed and installed directly by Six Flags. It was modeled after the Coney Island Cyclone, and constructed from 700,000 board-feet of southern pine. The ride's station is themed after Colonel Peabody‚Äôs Snake Oil Elixir Pharmaceutical Factory, a facility which was abandoned and overrun with snakes, hence the ride's name. As Southwest Territory was still relatively a secret, Viper was listed as being part of Hometown Square. For the 1996 season, the second phase of the Southwest Territory expansion came in the form of an eleven-acre themed land that opened adjacent to Viper. The Old West Town featured 1800s-themed western-style retail stores and restaurants, as well as a saloon split across two sides of a single block. The front part of the area's signature Spanish Mission opened, with the back part with the Chubasco tea cups still under construction. For the 1997 season, the Giant Drop debuted as the third and final phase of Southwest Territory. It is a 227-foot tall Intamin drop tower, themed after an \\"Ore excavator\\" owned by the Loco Diablo Mining Company. As part of the ride's opening ceremony, 200 couples from throughout the Midwest participated in a wedding ceremony on the ride. The couples were pronounced husband and wife just before they dropped, and the wedding ceremony was held in the Southwest Territory Amphitheater. The mass wedding ceremony took place in the Southwest Amphitheater. Also that year, the backside of the Spanish Mission was completed. ===Raging Bull (1999)=== For the 1999 season, Raging Bull was introduced. It became the park's tallest roller coaster, which it remains to be today. The ride is named after the ferocious beast that once terrorized the citizens of Southwest Territory, and it travels throughout the entire land. It was the world's first \\"hyper-twister\\" roller coaster, and is the most popular ride in the park. ==Attractions and entertainment== *Viper *Chubasco *Ricochet *River Rocker *Giant Drop *Raging Bull ===Former attractions=== *Trailblazer (1996-2006) ==Restaurants== *Fiesta Fries Cantina *Waterin' Hole *The Oasis *Six Below *JB's Barbecue and Sports Bar ===Former restaurants=== *Crazy Buffalo Saloon (1996-2010s) ==Southwest Territory Amphitheater== The Southwest Territory Amphitheater was a large, outdoor stunt arena that was built in 1993 for The Batman Stunt Show. With the debut of Southwest Territory in 1996, the theater received a renovation to fit in with the new land, and was renamed the Southwest Territory Amphitheater. That year, it featured the Warner Bros. Western Stunt Show, a crossover show that features characters from many different Western films and television shows, including Maverick, F Troop, and Blazing Saddles. In 2007, the theater's last major production came in the form of Operation SpyGirl, a stunt show created by Joel Surnow, co-creator of the TV series 24. After that, the theater was mostly unused, sometimes being utilized for Fright Fest haunted attractions or events. In 2014, it was finally demolished to make way for Justice League: Battle for Metropolis and the new Metropolis Plaza area. ==References== Category:Gurnee, Illinois ","title":"Southwest Territory (Six Flags Great America)"},{"id":"61732171","text":"Kazakkulovo () is a rural locality (a village) in Mindyaksky Selsoviet, Uchalinsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

Contrary to the police state ‚Äì where the law is arbitrary, unequally applied, and its making outside of non-state control ‚Äì and to the Rechtsstaat ‚Äì in which constitutional rights are viewed as preceding and superseding the authority of the law ‚Äì the √©tat l√©gal is a form of rule of law where the law is applied equally ‚Äì i.e. to the people and to the state ‚Äì as it is decided, that is without or with reduced constitutional limits to the will of the law maker. In democratic regimes enforcing universal suffrage, the √©tat l√©gal gives absolute primacy to the decision of the majority of the voters ‚Äì generally via their elected representatives ‚Äì which can lead to decisions possibly detrimental to the rights of minorities or contrary to human rights. As defined by constitutional jurist Dominique Rousseau, the √©tat l√©gal \\"subjects the executive power, administration and justice to the rule of law passed by Parliament, a rule which, as the expression of the general will, is indisputable and cannot therefore be judged.\\" == Concept == The concept of √©tat l√©gal was theorized by French jurist Raymond Carr√© de Malberg in his 1920 book Contribution √† la th√©orie g√©n√©rale de l'√âtat. He distinguished three differents forms of states: the police state, in which the power acts freely in an arbitrary way; the \\"state of rights\\" (√©tat de droits or Rechtsstaat), where the authority of the law is limited by constitutional rights; and the \\"legal state\\" (√©tat l√©gal), a rule of law which gives primacy to the authority of the law over constitutional rights. In a democratic state, where the power is entrusted to the people ‚Äì generally via universal suffrage ‚Äì the difference between the √©tat l√©gal and the Rechtsstaat has a significant consequence. In the first situation, the decision of the majority is set in law as decided, and thereafter applied by the state; whereas in the Rechsstaat, the state (or the majority) is limited in the nature of the laws it is able to introduce by a set of rules protecting fundamental rights and minorities (e.g., the American constitutional amendments, or the German constitutional fundamental rights). == References == Category:Forms of government Category:Philosophy of law Category:Theories of law ","title":"√âtat l√©gal"},{"id":"61732393","text":"Juni Wadsa (lit.

Graduate of the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de Saint-Cloud (science), he was Director of the Laboratory of Linear Accelerator in Orsay from 1985 to 1994. Winner of the Gentner-Kastler Prize in 1994, he was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences (Physics section) in 1996. He was appointed senior member of the Institut universitaire de France in 1991 for a five-year term, renewed in 1996.Arr√™t√© du 8 ao√ªt 1996 portant nomination des membres seniors et juniors de l'Institut universitaire de France, JORF no 191 du 17 ao√ªt 1996, p. 12453, NOR MENK9602306A, sur L√©gifrance. He has been teaching physics since 1975 at the Paris-Sud University at the Centre scientifique d'Orsay. == Biography == Originally from Amb√©rieu-en-Bugey (Ain), Michel Davier studied at the Lyc√©e Lalande in Bourg-en-Bresse, at the √âcole Normale d'instituteurs in the same city, and then at the √âcole Normale d'instituteurs in Lyon. After a year of preparatory classes at the Lyc√©e Chaptal in Paris in 1960-61, he entered the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de Saint-Cloud where he obtained a degree in physics and chemistry. Admitted to the first agr√©gation in physics in 1965, he chose to focus on higher education and research in elementary particle physics. Having joined the Laboratory of Linear Accelerator (LAL) founded in Orsay by the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure as an assistant at the University of Paris-Sud, he did his doctoral work on the photoproduction of vector mesons at Stanford University in California at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), which he defended in 1969 in Orsay. After a two-year stay at the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, he joined Stanford University and SLAC as an assistant professor, then associate professor in 1973 where he conducted hadronic diffusion experiments. He returned to France in 1975 to take up the professorship left vacant by the untimely death of Andr√© Lagarrigue. He launched a research program on electron-positron annihilation at the highest energies available at the PETRA collider installed at the DESY laboratory in Hamburg. He is one of the founders of the ALEPH experiment that continues this research at CERN on the LEP collider from 1989, providing precision measurements that will establish the Standard Model of Fundamental Interactions. In 2001, he joined the international collaboration that operates the BABAR detector at SLAC to launch an original precision measurement program. In parallel with his activities in particle physics, he strongly supports the Franco-Italian Virgo project for the research of gravitational waves and welcomed Alain Brillet's team to the LAL in 1991. He actively participates in the construction of the interferometer and data analysis by creating his own group. He directed the Linear Accelerator Laboratory from 1985 to 1993. Senior member of the Institut Universitaire de France since 1991, corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1994, he was elected member in 1996. He has been a member of numerous international scientific councils: SLAC (Stanford), LAL (Orsay), CERN (Geneva), DESY (Hamburg), LNF (Frascati), IHEP (Beijing), KEK (Tokyo), APPEC (Europe), LIGO (Caltech, MIT, Hanford, Livingston), Scientific Guidelines Committee (SPC, CERN), National Committee and CNRS Scientific Council (2001‚Äì05), Helmholtz Gemeinschaft (Berlin). The dual aspect of university education, at the University of Paris-Sud, the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and the √âcole Polytechnique, and the training of young researchers represents an important investment in Michel Davier's career. He has actively supervised many doctoral theses. In this field, he has maintained a privileged relationship with China since 1988 through close collaboration with the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP, Beijing), for the training of Chinese doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows in Orsay, many of whom are now professors and scientific leaders in China. == Scientific works == Michel Davier's research has led to significant advances in the physics of strong and electroweak interactions through the construction and operation of large detectors, CELLO in Hamburg, ALEPH at CERN and BABAR at SLAC: * Demonstration of electroweak interference for the electron, muon and lepton tau (universality of couplings). * Precision tests of the Electroweak Standard Model, in particular by accurately measuring the polarization of the tau lepton by an optimal method, allowing an indirect determination of the mass of the Higgs boson, in accordance with the direct measurement at the LHC. * Study of the lepton tau: clarification of disintegration modes, measurement of spectral functions and precise tests of quantum chromodynamics (determination of the variation of the strong coupling with energy between the mass of the tau and that of the boson Z in accordance with the property of \\"asymptotic freedom\\"). * Evaluation of hadronic contributions to vacuum polarization, in particular for the calculation of the magnetic moment of the muon. The observation of a deviation at 3.6 standard deviations between the theoretical prediction and the direct measurement could indicate a fault in the Standard Model. * New precision measurements of the electron-positron annihilation in hadrons, a fundamental ingredient to evaluate the dispersion relationship required to calculate the vacuum polarization. The construction, development and analysis of the Virgo interferometer data involved a colossal effort through international collaboration in which the group founded by Michel Davier at the LAL took a significant part: * Construction and controls of the ultra-high vacuum enclosure of the two 3 km arms of the interferometer. * Overall control of the lengths of the kilometric optical cavities. * Development of detection algorithms. * Discovery with Advanced-LIGO data of gravitational waves emitted during the coalescence of binary black hole systems (2015) of masses several dozen times the solar mass. It is the first direct demonstration of a dynamic of relativistic compact objects in a strong gravitational field, in accordance with General Relativity. * Precise location in the sky thanks to the network of two Advanced-LIGO and Advanced-Virgo instruments marking the beginning of gravitational astronomy.B.

Prince Mahendrasimha was his close friend, who also helped him get back to his kingdom after he was once lost. The legend notes that Sanatkumara was once riding a horse that was not trained well and lost his track and reached Manasa lake wherein he faced various troubles and fought and won battles. He married many women and eventually was made king of Vidyadharas. Mahendrasimha then found Sanatkumara and brought him back to Hastinapur. After his father Asvasena renounced his kingdom to become a monk, Sanatkumara took over and became Chakravartin. Sanatkumara, in his times, was also popular for his beauty that even the god Indra once praised in his court. Two gods hence descended on earth to look for themselves how handsome Sanatkumara was. While Sanatkumara had just finished practicing wrestling, he was about to bathe and get ready. The gods were awestruck by his beauty and admired it. When Sanatkumara realized that gods had arrived to adore him, with pride he asked them to wait in the court till he bathes and dresses up in all his royal attire and ornaments, post which they could appreciate his beauty more. However, when Sanatkumara reached his court, the gods had changed their mind upon second meeting. Surprised to see the change, Sanatkumara questioned them and received the answer that his body was mortal and all wealth and health would one day vanish. He realized how false his pride about his beauty was and he ordained to be a monk and went for tapa to attain knowledge. Post long penance, he was placed in the heaven as a god.

In 1500, the Land Assembly approved the Vladislav Land Establishment, named after the king, which gave the Czech lords and peasants an extensive share in political co- decision and is also considered to be the oldest written Czech constitution. The chairman of the assembly was called the Supreme Burgrave (Czech: Nejvy≈°≈°√≠ purkrab√≠, German: Oberstburggraf ). He led talks with eight jurors appointed by the assembly, two from each state. After the defeat of the Czech estates in the Battle of the White Mountain, Ferdinand II would proclaim in 1627 for Bohemia and 1628 for Moravia the Renewed Regional Code, in which the monopoly position of the states was abolished in favour of the provincial government. Despite these limitations, the Diet and its committees, like the Diets in Austria, remained an effective means of political co-decision. In their meetings, usually once a year, the estates could, through the amount of taxes, resist the lords of the land. All direct and indirect taxes, with the exception of the collection of customs duties, remained within the competence of the estates. The Diet was thus a relic of the estate power rather than an absolutist instrument and even by the 1830s, the diet was again a base for organizing the opposition and a place of political friction. Only during the reign of Maria Theresa was the strong share of states in power permanently limited.Karl Bosl: Bohemia as a paradigm of professional representation from the 14th to the 17th centuries.

At the end of its existence in 1848, the diet had 214 members. The diet met at Prague Castle until 1801. From 1801 he was based in the Palais Thun on the Lesser Town of Prague. This conference location remained the same until 1913.

His project was accepted by the city government in 1894.Metzger, Rainer, Vienne des An√©es 1900 (2018) Wagner was very critical of the historicism of the buildings which lined the Ringstrasse, the famous circular main boulevard of Vienna, which he termed a \\"stylistic masked ball\\". He presented his new ideas in an essay entitled Modern Architecture, published in 1896, calling for a new architecture whose forms expressed their functions. He had already designed several stations in the new style for the Vienna transit system. He now proposed two residential buildings in the new style.Metzger, Rainer, Vienne des An√©es 1900 (2018) p. 38 === Majolica House, Linke Wienzeile 40 (1898-99) === The most famous of these is the Majolikahaus or Majolica House, at Linke Wienzeile 40. Its facade is entirely covered with majolica, or colorful glazed earthenware tiles in the floral designs which characterized the early Vienna Secession. The facade decoration was made by his student . The facade was not only decorative, but had a practical purpose; the tile facade could be easily cleaned by using fire hoses.

He died there in 1854 when Dobie was three years old, and his widow Ellen Dobie travelled back to England with Dobie and her siblings. Ellen settled in Irthington, Cumbria to raise her family of three daughters and three sons. When she was 21 years old, Dobie moved to London and enrolled in the Female School of Art in Bloomsbury. In 1875, Dobie's older brother Herbert emigrated to New Zealand, and in 1877, Dobie and her mother and sister Bertha travelled first-class on the May Queen to visit him, arriving in January 1878. Dobie and Bertha kept detailed diaries of the journey and Dobie made sketches and drawings, which were later edited and published as The Voyage of the May Queen. Herbert had purchased a cottage in Parnell, Auckland, and the three visitors stayed with him there while also enjoying trips to attractions such as the famed Pink and White Terraces. In 1879 Dobie and her sister travelled to Samoa and Fiji for more sightseeing. During this time, Dobie sketched and painted scenes depicting her travels, some of which were published in the London Graphic magazine. She also worked on the illustrations for Herbert's book New Zealand Ferns, which, on publication, became the standard book on the subject and was re-printed five times. In November 1880 Dobie visited her sister in her new home in Opunake, Taranaki; Bertha had married a constabulary officer who had been transferred to the fortified town due to tensions and fighting between the local MƒÅori people and the British settlers. Dobie and Bertha explored the area together, including a visit to the nearby village of Parihaka, where Dobie sketched the village and its leader Te Whiti o Rongomai. When she was out sketching one afternoon at Te Namu Bay she was confronted by a man, Tuhiata, who demanded money from her. Dobie gave him what she had, but when she said she would report Tuhiata to the British authorities, he attacked her and killed her. Her body was found around 9.30p.m. that evening by her brother-in-law and a search party of fellow constabulary. Tuhiata confessed to the crime and was tried and found guilty. He was sentenced to death by hanging, which was carried out on 29 December in Wellington. ==References== Category:1850 births Category:1880 deaths Category:People from Cumbria Category:1880s murders in New Zealand Category:19th-century women artists Category:British expatriates in New Zealand ","title":"Mary Dobie"},{"id":"61733277","text":"Fisht Al Eij is a piece of land located within Kuwait's territorial water near border of Iraq. ==References== Category:Landforms of Kuwait ","title":"Fisht Al Eij"},{"id":"61733280","text":"ABC plan (also known as the Nimetz initiative) was a proposed settlement of the Cyprus dispute, presented by the USA but co-authored by Britain and Canada as well, hence the abbreviation ABC (American-British-Canadian).

Individuals who create protest art are commonly referred to as the \\"publicity group\\" (). Creating protest art is seen as a peaceful, alternative way for citizens to express their views without participating in protests. Most members work under pseudonyms in order to protect their identity and stay in line with the movement's leaderless nature. During the protests, numerous original artworks inspired by pop culture and fine arts, as well as derivative works were created. They served as subversive criticisms of the police and the government, and offered comedic relief during tense times. Much of Hong Kong's protest artwork was inspired by Japanese anime and favoured dystopic and anti- authoritarian themes. Several notable protesters, Pepe the Frog, and Lady Liberty Hong Kong became icons of the protests. In addition, the protests have inspired the creation of \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\", which was then adopted as the movement's unofficial anthem. The protest art in Hong Kong helped sustain the momentum of the 2019-20 Hong Kong protests due to its creativity and its distribution methods. It was widely distributed using social media channels like AirDrop and Telegram, while printed posters were plastered on Lennon Walls. These protest artworks were then re-disseminated through photos of Lennon Walls shared online. These distribution methods created a level of fluidity that was previously unseen in Hong Kong. Some of the protest arts, such as crowdfunded advertisements, helped drew international attention, while performative protests such as flash mob singing of Glory to Hong Kong at shopping malls created iconic and viral moments during the protest movement. ==Language== ===Cantonese language play=== Due to the existence of homophones in Cantonese, Hong Kong's language allows great potential for wordplay. Replacing characters with similar tones or pitch patterns can significantly change a phrase's meaning. An early slang term for the protest, \\"sending to China\\" (), which is a homonym for \\"to see off a dying relative\\", quickly gained attention. Another popular slang term \\"Railway of the Communist Party\\" () is a wordplay of MTR Corporation because they sound phonetically similar. To deter online trolls and alleged Chinese spies monitoring the forum, some netizens communicated using phonetically-spelled Cantonese words, which are difficult for mainland Chinese to understand. A variety of Cantonese slang also developed during the protest; for instance, when protesters recount the events of their \\"dreams\\" (), they are recounting their experiences during the protests. When protesters deploy \\"fire magic\\" (), they are throwing petrol bombs. When a protester chants \\"it is raining\\" (), fellow protesters will unfurl their umbrellas to hide the group in action. Fellow protesters were called \\"hands and feet\\" (), which conveyed the idea of unity. Protesters also ridiculed statements by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the police. According to the Japan Times, \\"the legions of tech-savvy youngsters never miss an opportunity to invent new chants, memes, banners and slogans that often turn the criticism against the movement on its head\\". As a result, the protests led to the creation of caustic memes such as \\"reporter your mother\\" () and \\"freedom hai\\" (), which mocked the police's use of profanity against reporters and protesters respectively. The latter phrase is derogatory because the word \\"hai\\" is one of \\"the five great Cantonese profanities\\" but the protesters embraced the term with pride then turned them into WhatsApp stickers and printed them on T-shirts and banners. Artists created a variation of the \\"Bingo\\" mini-game that allows people to guess what Lam may say during a press conference to mock her condemnations of the protests; Lam often used the same set of words or four-character idioms to describe the protest. ===Common themes=== The slogan \\"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\\" displayed at the Hong Kong International Airport, August 2019 The slogan \\"Five demands, not one less\\" displayed in Tsim Sha Tsui, October 2019 A graffiti inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The quote originates from the film Avengers: Endgame. The slogan \\"Hong Kong, add oil\\" on a yellow ball in Sha Tin, July 2019 A common protest gesture which represents the slogan \\"five demands, not one less\\". The Hong Kong protesters have created a variety of slogans to raise awareness and express their solidarity; these were chanted during mass marches and from their apartments at 10:00 pm as part of the \\"Million Scream\\" campaign. The slogans were generally used to express dissatisfaction with the government, boost morale, reiterate demands and the key principles of the movement. They included the following: * \\"Hongkongers, add oil\\" (); initially a rallying cry for the protesters to encourage each other and to gain strength and support, the slogan changed to \\"Hongkongers, resist\\" following the implementation of the anti-mask ban. As protests continued to escalate, it changed to \\"Hongkongers, revenge\\" following the death of Chow Tsz-lok. * \\"Five demands, not one less\\" (); a slogan used to iterate the protesters' five core demands and affirm their determination not to stop until the government met all of them. It was often used during the protests but especially after Mayor Carrie Lam agreed to answer one demand by withdrawing the extradition bill. * \\"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\\" (); first introduced by pro-independence activist Edward Leung as his campaign theme for the Legislative Council by-election in 2016, the slogan gained more popularity as the protests escalated. Lam said the protests were a series of separatist riots though Ma Ngok, a political scientist at Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the slogan has much room for interpretation and its rise in popularity was due mainly to people's belief the authorities have lost their moral basis of power. Election officers asked several candidates standing for the District Council election the meaning of the slogan before they validated their qualification. Following the passing of the National Security Law by the NPCSC for Hong Kong, the HKSAR government declared that anyone shouting or displaying this slogan may have breached the law. Protesters have since found workarounds and created other altneratives. * \\"We go up and down together\\" (); following several suicides, the protesters have chanted this rallying cry to raise people's mental-health awareness and express unity among themselves. There were also several slogans that fostered solidarity within the protester camp, including \\"no splitting and no severing of ties\\" (), and \\"brothers climbing mountains, each offering one's efforts\\" (). A hyperbolic version of the former slogan emerged following the Airport protests in mid August, with protesters declaring that they would not severe ties \\"even with a nuclear blast\\". * \\"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong\\"; the slogan was used to call for the international community, the US in particular, to support the ongoing protest movement. When Daryl Morey tweeted his support, China temporarily suspended all NBA broadcasts. * \\"There are no rioters, there's only a tyrannical regime\\" (); after police characterised the protest on 12 June as a riot, protesters demanded the government retract the classification. Protesters have often taken inspiration from historical events and pop culture. This includes the phrase \\"give me liberty or give me death\\" from Patrick Henry's speech during the American Revolution, and \\"If we burn, you burn with us\\", a quotation from Suzanne Collins's novel Mockingjay; the latter phrase was among the graffiti sprayed during the storming of the Legislative Council Complex on 1 July 2019. Analysts believed it reflects the more desperate tone of the protests compared with that of the Umbrella Revolution. Protesters frequently call members of the police force \\"dogs\\", \\"triads\\", \\"popo\\", and \\"Black Police\\". Police officers have called the protesters \\"cockroaches\\". Graffiti that cursed the police has also been depicted. Counter-protesters and pro-Beijing activists have widely circulated the slogan \\"I support Hong Kong police, you can hit me now\\" () on Sina Weibo after protesters cornered and assaulted a reporter from the Global Times at Hong Kong International Airport on 13 August 2019. After Liu Yifei shared the phrase on her Weibo page, there were calls to boycott her upcoming film Mulan. === Literature === Hong Kong-based Australian lawyer‚Äìauthor Antony Dapiran penned a book entitled City on Fire. His prologue, called \\"City of Tears\\", describes how police had unleashed in excess of 16,000 canisters of tear gas during the protests, including more than 2,330 on a single day in November. It begins: \\"Tear gas rounds describe a graceful arc as they drop down out of the blue sky, trailing feathery tails of smoke like streamers\\". ==Art== ===Protest art=== Protesters create posters to promote upcoming protests and rallies that sometimes serve as subversive criticism of the police, the government, and others. They are sometimes meant to provide light, comedic relief by satirising recent events. Art is also created to show the unity among protesters, encourage fellow activists, and raise mental-health awareness. Posters are seen as a peaceful, alternative way for citizens to express their views without participating in protests. Most artists remain anonymous or used a pseudonym in line with the movement's leaderless nature. Ideas for their designs were crowdsourced using the forum LIHKG, where users vote for the best for wide distribution, typically via Lennon Walls erected throughout the city, Telegram's channels and Apple's AirDrop features. Satirical images and caricatures of political figures, in particular Carrie Lam, were very common, as artists vented their frustration and anger through producing these drawings. One of the more notable images was a parody of My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love, which replaces the original characters with Lam and Xi Jinping. Protesters have typically adopted the Japanese anime art style. The themes of some Japanese anime also resonated with the protesters, as the narratives of these anime mirror the situation in Hong Kong. For instance, arts inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion became popular among the artists as it revolves around idealistic teenagers who rise up to challenge adults who are perceived to be corrupt, echoing the situation in Hong Kong. One Pieces emphasis on unity also made it an inspiration when the artists were creating posters to urge citizens to stay united and not to sever ties with the more radical protesters. TV producer Peter Tsi added that Japanese pop culture had a profound influence on youths who were born following the handover of Hong Kong. Values in these anime shows, such as \\"upholding one's ideals, resistance to authorities, and unity\\", as well as resisting \\"hypocritical, corrupted, and selfish\\" adults or superiors, became deep-rooted in young people's minds. Inspiration was taken from various other pop culture media. When the Student Union president of the Hong Kong Baptist University was arrested for possessing laser pointers, described by the police as \\"laser guns,\\" protesters created a series of posters incorporating a variety of Star Wars themes and elements such as lightsabers. Dan Barrett noted that protesters favoured dystopic and anti-authoritarian themes in their designs. According to him \\"(Genres depicting) heroes and heroines defeating evil totalitarian regimes and rulers, despite insurmountable odds, appear to be particularly motivating among the younger generation of Hong Kongers on the frontline of the resistance movement.\\" Many protest art designs resemble album covers or Hollywood movie posters. Several notable people from the protests were subjects of artworks, including Marco Leung (who fell to his death on 15 June 2019 while wearing a yellow raincoat, which became emblematic), a woman whose eye was bleeding (alluding to the 11 August 2019 incident where a female protester's eye was allegedly injured by a bean bag round), and Chan Yi-chun, a protester arrested during the 15 September 2019 North Point conflict, were common characters found in protest art. The yellow hard hat protesters commonly worn as part of their \\"full gear\\" also became the symbol of the movement and appeared in many protest arts. Traditional Chinese elements were also incorporated into the designs. Hell money and joss papers imprinted with key government officials' faces were also created and burned as the protesters followed the traditions of the Hungry Ghost Festival. Some protest posters replicate the design of a traditional Chinese almanac. Protesters created \\"elder memes\\" (), which aimed to inform senior citizens about the events in the city to sway them to their cause. Elder memes are images that use bright and colourful graphics with usually outdated fonts, overlaid with pictures of flowers or religious symbols. A large variety of derivative works were also created in the protests. The design of the MTR's warning signage was reworked to a set of \\"Mind the Thug\\" cards using the same typography, referencing the Yuen Long attack. Artists have also reworked several historical paintings to fit the Hong Kong context. For instance, the French revolutionaries portrayed in Liberty Leading the People by Eug√®ne Delacroix were changed to people donning the protesters' attire. The Creation of Adam by Michaelangelo was also reinterpreted to portray secondary school students participating in a human chain outside their schools. Photos taken by journalists have also been converted into artworks. Some art was also inspired by wartime recruitment posters. Pro-Beijing activists have also created their own protest art, mainly portraying protesters as an insolent group of rioters and depicting the police as a group of \\"righteous\\" heroes maintaining the city's order. Protesters were also depicted as \\"cockroaches\\" after the police begun using the term to describe them. === Neighbourhood Lennon walls === Austin Station, 9 July 2019 Inspired by the Lennon Wall in Prague, Czech Republic, a banner reading \\"Lennon Wall Hong Kong\\" was set on the outside wall of an Admiralty district staircase, turning the wall into one of the landmarks of the occupied district. The original Lennon Wall was set up in front of the Hong Kong Central Government Offices staircase. During June and July 2019, Lennon Walls covered with colourful post-it messages about freedom and democracy \\"blossomed everywhere\\" (), appearing throughout the city. They are typically found on the walls of underpasses and pedestrian bridges, on shopfronts, and inside government offices. Protesters have also plastered protest posters, derivative works, and illustrations on Lennon Walls to spread awareness. Pictures of police brutality were highlighted to broadcast the protesters' interpretation of the events. Protesters used post-it notes to create Chinese characters and diagrams. For the protesters, the Lennon Walls serve as a symbol of hope and support between like-minded individuals. After the passing of the Hong Kong national security law on 30 June 2020, notes on Lennon Walls were replaced by blank notes to maintain a form of protest that was not punishable by the law. Portraits of pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho plastered on the ground near a Lennon Wall. Hundreds of portraits of key government supporters and officials were plastered on the ground on footbridges and underpasses, allowing pedestrians to step on them as a way to vent their anger. On some Lennon Walls, citizens can use a slipper hung by protesters to strike the portrait in a manner that resembles something called \\"villain hitting\\". Areas near Lennon Walls became sites for art exhibitions; protest art was pasted on the wall, the ground, and/or roofs. Lennon Walls led to conflicts between pro-democracy and pro-Beijing citizens, some of whom attempted to tear messages off the walls and physically assaulted pro-democracy activists. Police removed officers' personal information from a wall in Tai Po. Protesters declared they would put up hundreds more Lennon Walls for each one removed (). To prevent walls from being torn down easily, protesters covered them with sheets of transparent plastic. During marches, some protesters turned themselves into \\"Lennon Man\\" as other protesters stuck post-it notes on their clothes. Lennon Walls can also be commonly seen in shops supporing the yellow economic circle. According to a crowd-sourced map of Hong Kong, there are over 150 Lennon Walls throughout the region. Messages of solidarity for the movement have been added to the original Lennon Wall in Prague. Lennon Walls have also appeared in Toronto, Vancouver, Tokyo, Taipei, Berlin, London, Manchester, Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland. As the protests started to fade during the COVID-19 pandemic, graffiti, Lennon Walls, and posters were removed and torn down by cleaners contracted by the government. Despite this, marks of the protests remained largely visible and indelible. Several artists started a campaign named \\"Paper Over the Cracks\\", in which they used tapes of different color to frame the government's repair work. One of the initiators, Giraffe Leung added that the repair work was a \\"half-hearted\\" effort and that \\"the government is cleaning up are only on the surface, they have little intention to solve the underlying issues\\". The campaign aimed at reminding Hong Kong people the importance of the protests, despite its significance fading away during the pandemic period. Following the passing of the national security law, many shops, under political pressure, reluctantly removes the Lennon Walls inside their shops. Some kept their Lennon Walls but replaced the messages with empty post-it notes in order to keep the spirit alive without breaching the law. Protest arts were replaced with blank paper to reflect the \\"white terror\\" brought by the law. ===Protest mascots=== The LIHKG website pig and dog (a shiba inu) became the protests' unofficial mascots; these ideographs were conceived as emoticons to celebrate the beginning of the year of the dog and year of the pig and quickly gained popularity as LIHKG, a Reddit-like Internet forum, became a key communication channel for protesters. An internet meme based around the character Pepe the Frog has been widely used as a symbol of liberty and resistance, and has gained international media attention. Protesters created Whatsapp stickers showing the character dressed in protesters' attire, turning it into a pro-democracy everyman that quickly gained popularity as the protests' unofficial mascot. Many other versions, such as Pepe in riot police uniforms or as Carrie Lam have been created. While the character is typically associated with far-right ideology and was viewed as a hate symbol in the US, Pepe has a different reputation in Hong Kong, of being the expressive \\"sad/smug/funny/angry/resigned frog.\\" With Pepe being so \\"rehabilitated,\\" the character's creator Matt Furie expressed his delight about the cartoon frog's new role, writing \\"This is great news! Pepe for the People!\\". Several Hong Kong bakeries adopted the mascots as options with which customers can choose to decorate their cakes. They were also made into toys and sprayed as graffiti. Protesters crowdfunded a tall pro-democracy statue named Lady Liberty Hong Kong. The statue's design originates from the reverse delivery demonstrator's costume. The statue is clothed in a yellow helmet, eye mask, and respirator; its right hand holds an umbrella and the left a flag that reads, \\"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\\". ===Songs and anthems=== A group of Christians singing \\"Sing Hallelujah to the Lord\\" near the Central Government Complex, June 2019 People singing \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" at Times Square, Causeway Bay, September 2019 A 1974 Christian hymn called \\"Sing Hallelujah to the Lord\\" became the \\"unofficial anthem\\" of the anti- extradition protests and was heard at the many protest sites. On 11 June 2019, a group of Christians began to sing the four-line-verse and simple melody at the Central Government Complex as they held a public prayer meeting the night before the Legislative Council was scheduled to begin the second reading of the extradition bill. On the morning of 12 June, led by pastors, they stood between the crowd and police to help prevent violence and pray for the city with the hymn. Under Hong Kong's Public Order Ordinance, religious gatherings are exempt from the definition of a \\"gathering\\" or \\"assembly\\" and therefore more difficult to police. The song was sung repeatedly over the course of 10 hours and a video of the event quickly became popular online. Hong Kong's local ministries, many of whom support underground churches in China, supported the protests. Most city churches tend to avoid political involvement but many were worried about the effects of the extradition bill on Christians because mainland China does not have religious freedom laws. \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\", the unofficial anthem of the Umbrella Movement in 2014, was commonly sung during the protest. It was also sung by protesters during a friendly football game between Manchester City and Kitchee on 24 July at Hong Kong Stadium to obscure the playing of the Chinese national anthem and to raise foreign awareness of the situation in the city. A group of anonymous composers wrote the song \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\" (), which became a theme of the protest and was regarded as the city's unofficial national anthem by protestors. On 10 September 2019, supporters sang the song at a football match for the first time during a FIFA World Cup qualification match against Iran. On the same night, the song was publicly sung at more than a dozen shopping malls across Hong Kong. Composed by Thomas dgx, the song has since been translated into several languages. Its lyrics, include the phrase \\"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our time\\", were mainly written by users of LIHKG. The song's music video includes demonstration scenes and was uploaded to YouTube on 31 August 2019. Several covers, including a Cantonese opera rendition, were released. A version featuring a 150-person orchestra became YouTube's most viewed music video in 2019 in Hong Kong. Protesters have also sung the British national anthem \\"God Save the Queen\\" and the American national anthem \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" while demonstrating outside those countries' consulates-general to appeal to their governments for help. Hong Kongers have also composed several pieces of original music. Local rappers and bands have released songs that criticise the government and the police. The ninth-most-popular music video on YouTube in the city was a protest theme named \\"Wo Nei Fei\\" (), which has an introspective tone and focuses on the depression and exhaustion protesters have faced during the protests. The lyrics urge protesters to stay united in a time of difficulty. The song's name alludes to the July 2019 sit-in at Hong Kong International Airport that was named \\"Fly with you\\", itself a wordplay of \\"peaceful, rational and non-violent protesters\\". A remix of Sia's song \\"Chandelier\\" titled \\"Fat Mama Has Something To Say\\" () quickly gained local attention. It was remixed using a speech given by Maria Cordero at a pro-police rally, edited, rearranged and auto-tuned to bend her pitch to the song, with the lyrics replaced with anti-police rhetoric. Singer-songwriter Charmaine Fong released her own composition, \\"Explicit Comment ()\\" in late 2019. Its lyrics expressed her stance toward the anti-government protests explicitly. Although the music video stirred controversy with its extensive use of protest footage featuring scenes of police brutality, it was highly popular upon release, attracting more than 400 thousand views by the second day of release. It was viewed a million times after one month, and earned Fong an online poll as Best Singer and Best Song. === Hill-top vertical protest banners=== In a manner similar to what happened during the Umbrella Revolution, activists scaled the Lion Rock, an iconic natural landmark overlooking Kowloon that carries with it Hong Kong's special identity and displayed massive vertical protest banners. In June 2019, the League of Social Democrats (LSD) displayed a banner denouncing the extradition bill. On 20 August that year, another group of protesters pinned a banner reading \\"Oppose institutional violence, I want true universal suffrage\\" on the mountain; the banner was removed by firefighters. The statue Lady Liberty Hong Kong was displayed on the top of Lion Rock on 14 October before being dismantled by pro-Beijing activists the following day. Other banners were displayed on Beacon Hill, Devil's Peak, and Kowloon Peak. ===Flags and symbols=== Hong Kong protestors with United States flags \\"Chinazi\\" flag Some protesters waved the flag of the United States in support of the prospective introduction of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a bill proposed by the US Congress. Others waved the flags of the United Kingdom, the Republic of China (Taiwan), and South Africa. The Dragon and Lion flag used by Hong Kong during the colonial era was also seen during the protests, though its use has often been criticised. Some protestors, claiming inspiration from the Ukrainian Revolution in 2014, have also waved the Ukrainian flag. Another that frequently appears is the Estelada, the unofficial flag of Catalonia's independence movement, which has been a source of inspiration; parallel rallies expressing solidarity between the movements have been held in the two regions. Protesters created a version of the regional Hong Kong flag depicting a wilted or bloodied bauhinia flower. A black and white version of the Hong Kong flag, referred to as \\"Black Bauhinia\\", has also been seen in protests. Badiucao, a Chinese cartoonist and political dissident, designed a number of poster images of those harmed in the protests, such as one of Carrie Lam wearing a necklace with a dangling ear, a ring with an eyeball inset; a Bruce Lee-inspired \\"Be Water\\" image; the Lennon Wall Flag, a symbol of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. According to him, the flag was inspired by the Lennon Wall in Hong Kong. It consists of 96 coloured squares that symbolise the post- it notes on the walls: The number 96 represents 1996, the year before the handover of Hong Kong. \\"Every colour on the flag is a different voice. And every individual voice deserves its place in Hong Kong,\\" he said. The \\"Chinazi\\" () flag ‚Äì a portmanteau of \\"China\\" and \\"Nazi\\" ‚Äî was created by combining the flag of the People's Republic of China and that of the Nazi Party to draw comparisons between the Chinese and the 1933‚Äì1945 German Nazi governments. Variations include golden stars forming a Nazi swastika on a red background and Nazi swastikas replacing the golden stars on the Chinese flag. American journalist and political commentator Nicholas Kristof mentioned graffiti in Hong Kong using the ‚ÄòChinazi‚Äô label to denounce the influence of the Chinese government, he reported in The New York Times. Barrister Lawrence Ma, a Shanxi committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPPC) with Australian nationality, said the person using the flag violated Section 4 of the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance. Pro- Beijing counter-protesters used the Chinese national flag as their main symbol. Several Hong Kong and mainland celebrities declared themselves \\"flag protectors\\" after protesters threw several Chinese flags into the sea in August 2019. ===Lights display=== The use of laser pointers gained popularity following the arrest of HKBU's Student Union president Fong Chung-yin. On 7 August 2019, a group of protesters gathered at Hong Kong Space Museum and shone laser pointers on a wall of the museum; some chanted slogans like \\"laser pointer revolution\\" and joked \\"Is the building on fire yet?\\". The laser rally was held after the police concluded laser pointers are \\"offensive weapons\\" that can cause fire. Some protesters displayed Star Wars lightsaber toys to mock the police's description of laser pointers as \\"laser guns\\". During the Hong Kong Way human chain campaign and the Mid-autumn festival period, hikers and trail runners scaled Lion Rock and shone lights at the city using cellphone flashlights and laser pointers. During a #MeToo rally in August 2019, protesters shone purple flashlights using their phones to show their support victims. === Protest masks and handicrafts === Protesters began folding origami cranes named \\"freenix\\" (), viewed as a symbol of peace and hope. During the Mid-autumn festivals, Hong Kong residents crafted lanterns bearing messages encouraging the protesters. After the government implemented a ban on face masks using the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, protesters continued to wear masks in rallies and protests. In addition to common surgical masks, protesters wore masks depicting Chief Executive Carrie Lam, China's Paramount leader Xi Jinping, and cartoon characters such as Pepe the Frog and Winnie the Pooh, which was banned in China after internet users compared Xi's likeness with Disney's depiction of A.A. Milne's character. Protesters wore the smiling Guy Fawkes masks depicted in the graphic novel V for Vendetta, which has become an inspiration and the mask regarded as an anti-authoritarian symbol. For a march on Human Rights Day, 8 December 2019, a group of activists led by Simon Lau joined the crowds wearing colourful masks featuring Pepe, a pig, a and shiba inu. Over a 10-day period, Lau's team cast 117 oversized fibreglass masks, each bearing \\"a story of Hong Kong people's suffering\\". === Photography === The protests have inspired many of the 33 entries shortlisted for the 2020 Human Rights Art Prize, organised by the Hong Kong Justice Centre in a display at Goethe-Institute. The winning work by photographer Magus Yuen Kam-wa, and entitled \\"Hong Kong Symposium 2019‚Ä≥ ‚Äì depicts a flower in a gas canister ‚Äì examines basic human rights by exploring the impact of tear gas during the protests. Photographer Ko Chung-ming participated in the 2020 Sony World Photography Awards with a series named Wounds of Hong Kong. The series, which consists of photos of 24 victims of police brutality, highlights the scars and injuries they have sustained during the protests. Ko won the first prize in the award's documentary section. === Film === A documentary produced by Sue Williams, Denise Ho: Becoming the Song is released on 1 July ‚Äì the 23rd anniversary of Britain's handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997 ‚Äì in solidarity with the protest. Citizens had held community screening for three films: Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom, Lost in the Fumes and Ten Years. Winter on Fire documents the Ukrainian revolution in 2014, which was often cited as an inspiration for the Hong Kong protesters. Lost in the Fumes follows the story of localist leader Edward Leung before his imprisonment in 2018. The documentary resonated with the protesters as Leung, despite being \\"another young person in Hong Kong\\", managed to cause a political awakening for many young people following his election campaign in the 2016 Legislative Council by-election and his participation in the 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest, leading to the rise of localism in Hong Kong. Ten Years is a dystopian speculative fiction anthology film which explores a possible future in Hong Kong in 2025 which sees the city's freedom and human rights being eroded by the Chinese government as it further exerts its influence. ==Gallery== ===Protest art=== File:Hong Kong IMG 2323 (48599874122).jpgArtwork that alludes to the August 11 incident when a female protester's eye was allegedly injured by a bean-bag round shot by the police File:Incendo IMG 20190803 210734 (48448487247).jpgProtest message written using balloon modelling, August 2019 File:00100lPORTRAIT 00100 BURST20190803173138587 COVER 2 (48448332151).jpgProtest artworks attached to backpacks, August 2019.
