Company founder Laurenz Lamberts Glasfabrik in the year 1887 The Glasfabrik production plant today Aerial view of the company site in Wunsiedel  History  Laurenz Lamberts bought the company premises on 23 May 1887 and founded the Glasfabrik in the same year. He did not choose Wunsiedel at random. One reason for the location was the regionally available raw materials. Even today the resources used for production come directly from the region. The second important reason was the expansion of the railway line between Regensburg and Hof and the connection to Holenbrunn. The station was essential for the company in terms of transporting its glass products.  Production  Glasfabrik Lamberts is the only independent manufacturer of cast glass to produce profile glass, ornamental glass, wired glass and antimony-free solar glass. Since 1996 the company has manufactured all its types of glass with the aid of an oxygen-fired glass melting furnace and sold them as EcoGlass, and it still the only producer of architectural glass to do so. Up to 50% waste glass is used in the various glass products and 100% of the glass waste is recycled.

In 1776, he also merged the villages of Gryndese, Rorup and Fornerup into another manor named Grønnessegaard. The manors produced food for the workers at his factory and at the same time played an important role as a labour reserve. Johan Frederik Classen died in 1792.

He was a member of the German and Prussian parliament and the Weimar National Assembly representing the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. Early life and education Cohn was born in Guttentag, Silesia, Kingdom of Prussia (Dobrodzień, Poland), the eleventh child of Bernhard Cohn (1827–1903) and Charlotte née Dresdner (1831–1908). His family were religious but largely assimilated German Jews, his grandfather was an honorary citizen of Guttentag. He attended school in Brieg (Brzeg) and started to study medicine at the University of Berlin. After two semesters he switched his studies to law and continued at the University of Greifswald, in Munich, and again in Berlin. As a student he came in contact with Otto Landsberg and Wilhelm Liebknecht. Career In 1892 Cohn obtained his doctorate and served in the Prussian Army in 1892/93. In 1897 he started to practise as a lawyer in Berlin and joined the law-office of Karl and Theodor Liebknecht in 1899; as a lawyer working in Berlin, Cohn also co-operated with Wolfgang Heine. In 1909 he became a member of Berlin's city council for the Tiergarten district for the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In 1912 Cohn was elected a member of the German Reichstag representing Nordhausen. In World War I Cohn served as a guard in prisoner of war camps in Alsace, Guben, Lithuania, and Courland from April 1915 to June 1917; during this time he had his first significant contact with Eastern European Jewry.Heid (2002), pp. 31, 49 Cohn was regularly exempted from military service to take part in Reichstag sessions. When news about the Tel Aviv and Jaffa deportation reached Berlin, Cohn brought up the issue in the Reichstag on 7 May 1917. On 14 May he applied a parliamentary interpellation to intervene in the policy of Djemal Pasha in Palestine.Heid (2002), pp. 80 ff. The deportations were finally stopped by Erich von Falkenhayn. Cohn joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) in 1917 and was a member of the USPD delegation at the Stockholm Peace Conference of June 1917. Along with Hugo Haase, Karl Kautsky, and Luise Zietz, he met Angelica Balabanoff and the Russian delegation on 3 July 1917. Here in Stockholm he also came in contact with Ber Borochov and the Poale Zion movement.Heid (2002) pp. 173, 178 After the restoration of diplomatic relations between Germany and Russia, Cohn became legal advisor of the Russian delegation in Berlin. In early November 1918, the Russian delegation was expelled on charges of preparing a Communist uprising in Germany. On the night of 5 to 6 November, Adolph Joffe, the Russian ambassador in Berlin, rendered him about 1 million Mark and a 10.5 million Russian ruble mandate for a bank account at Mendelssohn & Co. After the delegation returned to Russia, Joffe claimed to have paid this money to the USPD to support the revolutionary activities and to purchase weapons.Heid (2002), pp. 238 ff. While the leading USPD politicians Hugo Haase and Emil Barth denied the payment, Cohn admitted the receipt and regretted that he was not able yet to spend the complete sum to spread the idea of the revolution.Heid (2002) pp.230, 234: \\"Genosse Joffe hat mir das Geld in der Nacht vom 5. zum 6. November gegeben...Ich habe das Geld seinem Zwecke zugeführt, nämlich der Verbreitung des Gedankens der Revolution und bedaure nur, dass es mir die Umstände unmöglich gemacht haben, die ganze Summe schon aufzubrauchen.\\" He explicitly denied receiving the money to acquire weapons; instead he had used most of the cash money to support employees of the embassy and Russian nationals in Germany. Because he could not use the bank account for formal reasons (the Mendelssohn bank refused the mandate), only 50,000 Mark were used to support a socialist uprising in Germany.Heid (2002) pp. 238 ff. Cohn also justified the receipt because the SPD had provided money to Russian socialists in the 1905 Russian Revolution in a similar way. He was however criticised, also by socialist newspapers like Die Freiheit and Vorwärts, because his actions stood in contrast to a USPD party resolution, which ruled out the acceptance of foreign money for revolutionary purposes.Heid (2002) p. 231 These payments led to the demission of Wilhelm Solf as German minister of foreign affairs, who refused further cooperation with the USPD.Heid (2002) p. 231 Later on they were regularly used to discredit Cohn publicly—for instance the nationalist politician Karl Helfferich refused to answer any question asked by Cohn in a Reichstag investigatory committee.Heid (2002) pp. 281 ff. Weimar National Assembly, Cohn standing on the far left After the November Revolution, Cohn became undersecretary in the Reich Ministry of Justice. In January 1919, Cohn was elected a member of the Weimar National Assembly. His motions to replace the term \\"Reich\\" by \\"Republic\\" and to address German Jews as a national minority in the Weimar Constitution were denied by the Assembly.Heid (2002) p. 93 In November 1919, Cohn became a member of the so-called \\"Schücking Commission\\", an official commission to investigate Allied allegations of illegal treatment of prisoners of war in Germany, named after its chairman Walther Schücking. In the case of Charles Fryatt, who had been executed by German authorities in 1916, Cohn and Eduard Bernstein dissented from the commission's verdict and publicly declared that they regarded the execution as a severe infringement of international law and an \\"inexcusable judicial murder\\". From 1920 on, he represented Poale Zion in the Jewish community of Berlin, especially advocating the equal status of eastern european Jewish immigrants. In 1922 Cohn re-joined the SPD; he left politics in 1924 and focused on religious affairs in Berlin. He continued to work as a lawyer in Berlin and became a member of the German League for Human Rights.Heid (2002), pp. 36, 326 ff. Cohn managed to escape from Berlin the day after the Reichstag fire of February 1933. He moved to Paris where he worked for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HICEM). In August 1934, Cohn took part in a conference of the World Jewish Congress in Geneva. While in Switzerland, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died in Geneva and was buried in Degania Alef, a kibbutz in northern Israel. The funeral orations were given by Zionists Nahum Goldmann and Yosef Sprinzak.Heid (2002), pp. 43, 407 Remembrance The Oskar-Cohn- Straße in Nordhausen is named in his honour. In 1934 Arnold Zweig reported the \\"Oskar-Cohn-library\\" in Neve Haim, the library however does not exist anymore, its fate is unknown.Heid (2002) pp. 405 ff.

It is one of the six AIIMSs that started operation in 2019. History The All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMSs) are set up as part of the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) initiative, announced by the Government of India in 2003 and officially launched in March 2006, for the purpose of \\"correcting regional imbalances in the availability of affordable/reliable tertiary healthcare services\\", through setting up AIIMS Delhi-like institutions and upgrading government medical colleges. As an outcome of the Bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and the creation of Telangana in June 2014, the central government was mandated through the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 to create an AIIMS in Andhra Pradesh, which was to become All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Mangalagiri in 2018. While the act does not mention an AIIMS in Telangana, the central government has assured the government of Telangana in 2014 that it will consider such an institute in Telangana as well. As early as July 2014, the government of Telangana has toyed with the idea of offering the yet-to-be-operational Bibinagar campus of Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) for establishing said AIIMS, a decision which was announced in January 2015. In September 2016 a contradictory announcement was made, stating that the AIIMS was to be established at Bhongir instead, due to higher availability of land. In February 2017, in the budget presentation for 2017–2018, the Minister of Finance Arun Jaitley announced two AIIMSs, in Jharkhand and Gujarat, but an institute in Telangana was not mentioned. A week later, Jaitley rectified this and officially announced at the parliament that an AIIMS will be set in Telangana as well. In April 2018, the central government has given an in- principle approval for the institute and the state government was asked to identify three of four possible locations for the AIIMS. The state government offered the Bibinagar campus, and following an inspection visit the location was approved in July, under conditions that an additional 49-acre of land will be acquired and that some infrastructure improvements are made. Finally, the official approval by the union cabinet was made on 17 December 2018 at an estimated cost of . The institute was later denoted as \\"Phase-VII\\" of PMSSY. The land for the AIIMS was officially handed over to the central government in February 2019 and in May it was announced that classes will start in August, from the Bibinagar campus. The institute became operational with the first batch of 50 MBBS students, which started in August 2019, one of the six AIIMSs to become operational in 2019. AIIMS Bhopal was set as the mentoring institution, and its director, Sarman Singh, also acting as director in charge. In December 2019 the mentoring institution changed to Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER). Vikas Bhatia was appointed director in March 2020. Campus and hospital AIIMS occupies the former Bibinagar campus of Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), which , is still under construction. Outpatient services (OP) were expected to start in December 2019, with inpatient services in March 2020. However, due to the change of mentorship, OP opening was postponed to February 2020, a date which was also missed. The hospital is expected to be fully operational in September 2022.

Events In the afternoon of 25 January 1946, a group of newly enrolled Indonesian Military Academy cadets in Tangerang led by Major Daan Mogot went to a Japanese base in Lengkong, in what is today South Tangerang, in order to discuss disarmament of the Japanese troops and acquire their weapons. The negotiations, which began with the transfer of some Gurkha prisoners of war, initially went well and the cadets began collecting the weapons, when a shot was fired – the culprit was unknown, with an account describing one of the Gurkhas having accidentally fired the weapon and another describing one of the cadets' weapons firing on accident. After the shot, Japanese soldiers retook the seized weapons and began attacking the cadets. In the ensuing shootout, 33 cadets and 3 of their officers, including Daan Mogot, were killed. The Indonesian Army later threatened to send in soldiers to Lengkong, prompting the Japanese garrison to surrender. Aftermath The dead cadets and officers were buried in a nearby forest, though they were later reburied on a plot of land near Tangerang's regimental headquarters, and the burial site is today known as the Cadet Heroes' Cemetery (). A monument was erected at the site of the incident in 1993, and in 2005 Army Chief of Staff Ryamizard Ryacudu set 25 January, the date of the incident, as a commemoration day for the Military Academy.

The 306th episode overall of the series, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on December 4, 2019. The episode centers upon the character Scott Malkinson, and features an opening title sequence for that purpose. In the story, Scott's efforts to court a new classmate hinge upon his ability to acquire access to streaming media, which his father, a lazy cable company technician, detests. The plot parodies the competition between traditional cable television and streaming media, and references the Disney+ series The Mandalorian, as well as the October 2019 acquisition by HBO Max of the streaming rights to South Park previously held by Hulu. Plot Fourth grader Scott Malkinson asks his father Clark, a technician for Park County Cable, if they can subscribe to the streaming service Disney+. Clark rebukes him for again making this request, telling him that the cable television they have is sufficient, and that he is tired of the growing popularity of streaming media. As Clark storms off to work, Scott, who has type 1 diabetes, realizes that the stress of his father's rant has caused his blood sugar to rise, and self-administers a shot of insulin. At South Park Elementary, the fourth grade class learns that the newest student, a girl named Sophie Gray, also has diabetes. As Scott's friends are always ridiculing him for having diabetes, Scott believes she is perfect for him, and declares that he is in love with her. When the other boys also express an interest in her, Scott angrily resolves that he will not allow them to ruin this opportunity for him. He begins sabotaging the efforts of other boys to court her in order to woo her himself. When he learns that she is an avid fan of the Disney+ series The Mandalorian, he feigns interest in it. When she suggests watching the next episode at Scott's house, Scott agrees, despite not having Disney+. Clark receives word of a job. Despite the fact that business has been suffering in part because of customer complaints of slow service, Clark spends his day leisurely eating his lunch at the park, and going bowling. This laxness and procrastination he displays in the face of important obligations serves as a recurring gag in the episode. When he arrives at the residence of Stephen and Linda Stotch 15 minutes after the end of a five-hour estimated service window, an irritated Stephen Stotch complains and threatens to quit cable in favor of streaming. When Scott again asks his father for a Disney+ subscription for his date with Sophie, Clark again refuses, and contacts his coworkers to conspire to sabotage the streaming services in South Park, though he arranges to meet with them at some point during a four-hour window. Clark rallies his co-workers about the damage that streaming has done to their business. He also points out that the streaming services use the cable that they laid throughout the town, and says they should disrupt that infrastructure in order to show the townsfolk how much they still need them. When Clark's coworkers agree, he delegates assignments to each of them, but says they should meet at a designated point sometime during a three-hour window. The cable repairmen take advantage of this window by engaging in a number of personal activities. This angers Clark, who repeatedly tells them that they should not make a practice of keeping appointments at the very end of windows several hours long, but Clark nonetheless continues this habit himself. Scott buys a black market Disney+ login for his date with Sophie, but as Clark and his colleagues vandalize the cable lines running throughout town, Scott's account stops working. Sophie suggests going to Jimmy Valmer's house, where their other classmates are gathered to watch the show, though Scott fears this may threaten his attempts to woo Sophie. However, Jimmy's streaming service also malfunctions, as do those of everyone else in town. When the boys attempt to ingratiate themselves to Sophie, Scott threateningly brandishes several hypodermic needles, warning the other boys to stay away from his \\"girlfriend\\". Sophie, however, informs Scott that having diabetes does not make her his girlfriend, as she is more than just that condition. This prompts a dejected Scott to retreat to a playground to mope. A sympathetic Sophie follows him to commiserate with him over the difficulties diabetics like them live with each day. She tells him that she is glad she now has a friend that who understands these issues, and that even though she missed the latest episode of The Mandalorian, she somewhat likes The Scott Malkinson Show. A closing title card informs the viewer that the streaming rights for The Scott Malkinson Show are now available, complete with an actual phone number with which prospective buyers can contact Trey Parker, much to the frustration of Clark. Critical reception Ryan Parker of The Hollywood Reporter noted the \\"ultra meta direction\\" of the episode, in particular Clark Malkinson's complaint of shows lacking in ideas that employ shows within shows, a practice that Parker observed South Park had made throughout the season, including in this episode. Parker thought the closing title card was the best gag in the episode. He related that the phone number provided was a real Fairplay, Colorado number to a recording of Trey Parker providing buying options for the faux series seen during the season; a reference to the then-recent $500 million acquisition by HBO Max of the American streaming rights to South Park, which were previously held by Hulu.

He joined the navy via the Royal Australian Naval College at HMAS Creswell in 1984, and spent his early career with the Clearance Diving Branch before training as a Principal Warfare Officer. He captained on operations in the Persian Gulf from 2006 to 2007 during the Iraq War and commanded Combined Task Force 150, overseeing maritime counter- terrorism operations around the Arabian Peninsula and Horn of Africa, from 2011 to 2012. He served as Head of Navy Capability from 2015 to 2017, and was appointed Commander Australian Fleet on 19 January 2018. Early life Jonathan Dallas Mead was born in Melbourne, Victoria, on 3 November 1964 to Dallas Charles Cardiff Mead and Joan Mary Reidy. His father had served in the Royal Australian Air Force during the Second World War, rising to the rank of flight sergeant, while a grandfather had fought on the Western Front with the Australian Imperial Force in the First World War. Mead was educated at St Bede's College, a Catholic secondary school in the inner Melbourne suburb of Mentone. He was an active sportsman who particularly excelled at water sports. As a youth he would explore the wreck of HMAS Cerberus, a breastwork monitor sunk as a breakwater off Half Moon Bay in Port Phillip. Naval career Mead was commissioned a midshipman and entered the Royal Australian Naval College at HMAS Creswell for junior officer training on 16 January 1984. He graduated from the college as a sub-lieutenant and with a Diploma of Applied Science in 1986 and undertook further training in bridge watchkeeping and clearance diving, specialising in Mine Warfare and Explosive Ordnance Disposal. Mead later described his service with the Clearance Diving Branch, culminating with his appointment as executive officer of Clearance Diving Team One, as \\"some of the happiest days of my career.\\" Seeking to enhance his future career prospects, Mead trained as a Principal Warfare Officer specialising in Anti- Submarine Warfare. He also read for a Master of Arts in International Relations at Deakin University and, later, a Master of Management at the University of Canberra. A series of seagoing appointments followed, including as Anti-Submarine Warfare Officer aboard and in , and as Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Officer.

The frigate deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Catalyst, Australia's contribution to the Iraq War, in October 2005. During the six- month deployment, Parramattas crew carried out 186 vessel boardings and security patrols and were involved in training other coalition and Iraqi warships. Parramatta returned to Sydney in April 2006. Mead and his crew were subsequently recognised with a Meritorious Unit Citation for Parramattas \\"meritorious operational service\\" in the Persian Gulf, while Mead was additionally honoured with appointment as a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2007 Australia Day Honours for his \\"exceptional service in warlike operations\\".

A student and friend of Jack Tworkov, she was a second-generation abstract expressionist who developed a personal style that set her apart from the Color School movement of her time. She was known for abstract landscapes having bold colors and employing gestural brushwork. She was also said to possess an ability to create the illusion of depth without employing graphical perspective. As well as painting, Herzbrun enjoyed a long career gallery administrator and professor of art at American University. Early life and training Herzbrun was born in Chicago on October 5, 1921. Her birth name was recorded as Helen Eichenbaum. She became Helene McKinsey after her first marriage in 1942 and then Helene Herzbrun after her second marriage in 1961. After graduating from Hirsch High School in Chicago, she briefly attended Beloit College and subsequently the University of Chicago where she studied art and from which she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. She also took classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. In the late 1940s she worked as an advertising copy writer and designer. In the early 1950s, now living in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, she studied at American University under Jack Tworkov, Robert Gates, and Joe Summerford, all of whom became colleagues and friends during her subsequent career. Gates and Summerford were year-round instructors at the school while Tworkov taught there during the summer months between 1948 and 1951. Career in art In 1952, during the last year of her studies at American University, Herzbrun participated in a group a group exhibition at the Whyte Gallery in Washington. The gallery's owner assembled the show by soliciting recommendations from local newspaper art critics. At the time a critic for the Washington Post wrote that Herzbrun's painting, \\"Andante,\\" was a well-composed abstraction. Another critic said she showed \\"unusual competence and understanding of a difficult medium.\\" In 1953 she was the only Washingtonian to have work included in the 23rd Corcoran Biennial held that year. In 1954 she showed a small group of paintings in a suburban movie theater, an exhibition that was notable only in the review it drew from a local critic who called Herzbrun an outstanding artist. Two years later she was featured in a two-artist exhibition at the Watkins Gallery. In 1957 Herzbrun helped found an artists' cooperative called the Jefferson Place Gallery. She and a fellow student at American University originally came up with the idea for what became the first gallery in Washington to be collectively owned and run by local artists. Eight others joined with them, all of them abstract artists. At the time, Herzbrun wrote Tworkov that the venture was an \\"honorable\\" place to exhibit: a gallery run by artists among the city's bookshops, espresso cafés, and jewelry stores. Herzbrun participated in group and solo exhibitions in the gallery from the time it opened until 1974 when it closed. Between 1953 and 1958 Herzbrun managed American University's Watkins Gallery Thereafter she joined the art faculty at the university, beginning a career that lasted until her death in 1984. In 1958 she was given a solo exhibition at the Stable Gallery in New York. The following year her paintings appeared in a three- person exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in which almost all her paintings were either sold or reserved by collectors. A year later the Poindexter Gallery gave her a solo show that resulted in the sale of a big painting to Lila Wallace for the Reader's Digest art collection. In 1969, roughly at the midpoint of her career, Herzbrun expressed her dislike for the commercial requirements of a career in art. On December 7 of that year she wrote Jack Tworkov \\"After a year--to change subject abruptly--I almost have enough paintings for a show, some of which I'm really pleased about. But I have doubts about showing them, only because I really don't want the guff. I hate to have to argue their value or defend their merit having done all I could by painting them. But I probably will.\\" The following year one of Herzbrun's paintings was included in a Baltimore Museum of Art exhibition that was intended to give a comprehensive overview of the Washington scene over the previous two decades. Paul Richard, a critic for the Washington Post, gave this show an intemperate review, calling it insensitive, haphazard, and incoherent. In it he said Herzbrun's painting was an \\"eye-curdling canvas.\\" His view of a solo exhibition of hers some four years later was considerably more positive, describing the show as a happy one and her paintings as \\"colorful and free and bright.\\" Two years later the Corcoran chose Herzbrun along with John Robinson and Alma Thomas for a show called \\"Contemporary Washington Art\\" that was sponsored by the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration. In 1978 she was given a solo exhibition and in 1980 a three- person exhibition at D.C.'s Rasmussen Gallery. The following year cancer forced her to give up painting. Although she made collages for a time, the disease did not leave her and eventually brought about her death in 1984. Posthumous exhibitions include a retrospective at the Watkins Gallery and a 2019 presentation called \\"Grace Hartigan and Helene Herzbrun: Reframing Abstract Expressionism\\" at the American University Art Museum. Artistic style Helene Herzbrun, Landscape (Rising from Purple), about 1958 , oil on canvas, 50 1/4 x 68 1/4 inches Helene Herzbrun, Aeroplat, 1970, acrylic on canvas, 70 x 73 2/4 inches Helene Herzbrun, Counter Plane, 1977, acrylic on canvas, 50 x 44 inches Herzbrun made gestural painting in an abstract expressionist style. When a painting of hers was selected for the 23rd Biennial held at the Corcoran Gallery in 1953 critics commented on the circumstances--as noted above, she was the only local artist selected--but not on her style. Three years later, however, a critic for the Washington Post gave a thorough examination to Herzbrun's technique in reviewing a two-person exhibition at the Watkins Gallery. She recognized that, despite their abstraction, the paintings derived from a lyrical view of natural subjects. While earlier ones had possessed \\"a quality of light and sunshine, with flickering, rapidly moving patters,\\" she said the more recent ones were looser and more expressionist, having bolder patterns and stronger color. Regarding a three-person show at the Corcoran in 1959 this critic commented on Herzbrun's ability to establish the illusion of depth without employing graphical perspective. She said, \\"Every brush stroke counts as it describes a push-and- pull of tensions in space. She achieves a great sense of depth and distance without recourse to receding planes or colors in the academic sense.\\" A year later a critic for the New York Times saw an \\"innate refinement\\" in her work despite an obvious affinity for the loose organization and casual brushwork of the abstract expressionists. Her early painting, \\"Landscape (Rising from Purple),\\" shows both the freedom of her gestural brushwork and her ability to convey the illusion of depth (shown at left). A later painting, \\"Aeroplat,\\" (1970, at right) shows her handling of bold patterns and bright colors, while \\"Counter Plane\\" (1977, at left) demonstrates her use of receding planes of color. In 1961 Herzbrun said she wanted to be more definite in her approach in order to bring out \\"the idea that's hiding\\" in her paintings. Regarding a two- person exhibition at Jefferson Place Gallery, held two years later, the Washington Post critic said Herzbrun's work showed integrity and was \\"unchanged and uninfluenced by the new little 'isms' that sweep the art world each season.\\" She stressed the confidence with which Herzbrun remained committed to her painterly approach with its fresh, clear color and \\"strong slashing brush strokes\\" and noted her ability to \\"create a world of her own\\" and make it work. Regarding a solo show a few years later a critic for the Washington Star admired the joyful spirit of Herzbrun's abstract landscapes and saw in them \\"the broad strokes of totally confident painting echoing the ancient simplicities of fold, fallow and field.\\" Commenting on this show, another critic stressed her technique, saying that Herzbrun produced a fresh surface of bright colors using \\"matte finish, glazes, impasto areas and delicate lines\\" all on the same canvas without sacrificing unity. During the following decade Herzbrun turned from painting on canvas to a printing technique called monotyping in which each sheet pulled was unique. She painted on glass and applied paper to the surface while the pigments were still wet. A review praised the resulting prints as fresh, colorful, free, and bright. Beginning in 1981, after cancer and subsequent surgery prevented her from painting or making monotypes, she created collages for a time. The disease continued to attack, however, and on March March 14, 1984, it brought about her death. Art teacher In 1958, after completing her studies and ending her service as head of the Watkins Gallery, Herzbrun joined faculty of American University as an art instructor. She advanced to assistant professor and professor and was granted emerita status after her death in 1984. She served as head of the art department in 1962, 1966 to 1968, 1972 to 1974 and 1976 to 1978. After her death her husband, Philip, established the Helene M. Herzbrun Art Scholarship to provide financial support to art students selected by the art faculty. Personal life and family Herzbrun was born in Chicago on October 5, 1921. Her father was Edward Eichenbaum (1894-1982), an architect known for designing 1920s movie palaces and for his skill at dramatic readings. Her mother was Lillian Smith Eichenbaum (born about 1891, died 1969), a housewife and officer of the South Shore Women's Club. She had no brothers or sisters. A transcription of her birth certificate gives her name as Helen Ruth Eichenbaum. In 1941 Herzbrun, then known as Helene Eichenbaum, was an artist and member of the Ida Noyes Council at the University of Chicago, an organization that staged the university's annual student art show. In 1942 she married a fellow student, Robert James McKinsey, in a chapel on campus at the university of Chicago. He was then studying for a law degree. He later earned his living as a lawyer and raced sports cars as an avocation. In the summer of 1961 she divorced McKinsey and that fall married Philip Herzbrun, an English professor at Georgetown University. Herzbrun wrote her friend Tworkov that when she provoked the divorce, McKinsey was nice about it and there were few recriminations. The ceremony, which took place in Moorefield, West Virginia, drew attention as the first civil ceremony ever performed in that state. As noted above, Herzbrun was afflicted with cancer in 1981, underwent surgery, and, on March 14, 1984, succumbed to the disease. Other names Although Helen sometimes appeared in print as Herzbrun's given name, Helene was more common. During her first marriage she was called Helene McKinsey. During the second one she was called either Helene Herzbrun or Helene McKinsey Herzbrun. If she had a middle name, it was either Ruth, as shown on the transcribed birth certificate, or Marie, as given in a legal notice from her estate in 1983 and on the West Virginia wedding registry.

A total of 77 units are to be built, comprising 51 two-car units and 26 three-car units. Externally, these trains will look like a hybrid of both previous Civity UK designs; the Class 196 units that are being built for West Midlands Trains and Northern's Class 195 units. The layout of doors and windows along each side will be similar to the Class 195, but the cab ends will be fitted with unit-end gangways like the Class 196. Additionally, the three types can be distinguished by livery (due to being procured by different operators) and the fact that no 3-car Class 196s or 4-car 195s/197s have been ordered. History The current Wales & Borders rail franchise, operated by KeolisAmey, commenced on 14 October 2018. During the franchise period, the operator will oversee a full fleet replacement. A batch of 77 brand new diesel multiple units (DMUs) has been ordered from CAF to form part of the replacement fleet (which also includes other new fleets and a small number of trains cascaded from other UK operators). It was announced that final assembly for these new DMUs would take place at CAF’s factory in Newport and that they would join the fleet between 2021 and 2023. In 2019, the class numbers for TfW's various new fleets were revealed, with the 77 DMUs identified as Class 197s. The first Class 197 Driving Motor carriage vehicle bodyshell had been assembled, welded and painted in Beasain, Spain by 12 February 2020; the bodyshells will be shipped to Newport for fitment of all components. Operators Transport for Wales When built, Transport for Wales intend to deploy the Class 197 fleet to replace and units which operate various regional and regional express routes between Wales and England, such as the Cambrian Lines. They are also expected to replace / units on the Conwy Valley line and allow extension of Liverpool Lime Street to Chester services into North Wales and south to Cardiff Central. 21 of the 2-car units will be fitted with ETCS signalling equipment to enable them to operate on the Cambrian lines; since late 2010, only ETCS-fitted trains can operate over the route.https://web.archive.org/web/20110929042530/http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=5009&NewsAreaID;=2 Cambrian ETCS fitment Fleet details {  !Class !Operator !Number !Year Built !Cars !Unit nos. - !rowspan=2Class 197 rowspan=2Transport for Wales align=center51 align=center rowspan=\\"2\\"TBC align=center2 TBC-TBC - align=center26 align=center3 TBC-TBC } Variants Four variants of the Class 197 have been ordered, it is not yet known whether these will be given separate subclasses. The planned fleet breakdown is as follows: * 21 units formed of 2 carriages (one DMSL and one DMS) and fitted with ETCS to allow operation on the Cambrian Lines * 30 units formed of 2 carriages (one DMSL and one DMS) * 14 units formed of 3 carriages (one DMSL, one MSL and one DMC) primarily for use between Swansea and Manchester – the DMC (Driving Motor Composite) carriage will contain a small first class section * 12 units formed of 3 carriages (one DMSL, one MSL and one DMS) Specification controversy In January 2020, it was revealed that franchise holder Keolis Amey Operations had specified Fainsa Comrail seats for the Class 197s, which are fitted to Thameslink’s trains and Northern’s units. The seats are described by some as \\"ironing boards\\" and have been criticised as uncomfortable to sit in for extended periods of time. The government-owned Transport for Wales intervened with £1.9m of additional funding to allow the specification to be changed. Following this intervention, the Class 197s will now be fitted with Fainsa Sophia seats instead of the Fainsa Comrails originally planned. The Class 197 trains will also have fewer toilets than the and trains they are intended to replace. Both the 158s and the 175s have a toilet in every carriage (ie. 2 toilets per 2-car unit and 3 toilets per 3-car unit). The Class 197s will have only 1 toilet in each 2-car unit and 2 toilets on a 3-car unit, meaning they will fail to meet the rail industry’s minimum standards for inter-urban services (which set a limit of 85 seats per toilet, which compares to 116 seats per toilet on a 2-car Class 197). While TfW have claimed that this downgrade is “in line with toilet provision on new fleets being delivered to other operators”, TransPennine Express have recently introduced new ‘Nova’ trains (, and Mark 5a coaches) with less than 85 seats per toilet. TfW have claimed that ‘carriages will be bright, airy with open window space. We have carefully chosen a layout to ensure that customers have a comfortable journey, and, where possible, this includes aligning seats with windows so that customers can enjoy the beautiful countryside.’ However, the published seat plans show at least one table with the view almost entirely blocked by a window pillar and many other seats with a restricted view.

Roles The singing roles in the opera are: Belisario (tenor), Cinna (tenor), Clelia (soprano), Desbo (alto) Floro (soprano), first Isaurian (soprano), second Isaurian (alto), Lepidus (soprano), Marzia (soprano), Publicola (alto), Servio (bass), Theodatus (bass), Totila (soprano), Vitige (mezzo soprano). Plot The action is set in the Gothic Wars and is based on the conflict between king Totila of the Ostrogoths and the Byzantine general Belisarius. In reality Totila sacked Rome twice, in 546 and again in 550 but the libretto is not specific about whether the action is meant to take place in either of these two events or in an amalgam of them. In the first act, set in Rome under siege, Clelia, wife of the consul Publicola, plans to resist Vitige and shows that she is willing to kill her in order not to fall into the hands of the Goths, she is willing to kill her sleeping child to prevent him falling into the hands of the invaders. There is a spectacular scene in which the Goths put Rome to the torch. Marzia throws herself from a window and falls into the arms of Totila, who falls in love with her and has her father senator Servius arrested. A comic interlude follows in which the servant Desbo mistakenly informs Publicola that Clelia is dead; he then loses his mind and rails against poor Desbo, who tries to defend herself. Clelia, meanwhile, has decided to offer herself to Vitige in return for her freedom, but he is moved to spare her. The first act ends with spectacular stage effects as a trumpet sounds, a giant elephant opens, and Belisario, Lepido and Cinna come out. The second act opens with a scene of Publicola’s melancholy and madness. Another scene depicts Marzia boarding Totila's ship. When she rejects his advances her had her bound to the mast.The woman makes fun of Totila but, when he tries to kiss her, she rejects him. Totila, furious, then has Marzia bind to a ship's mast. Belisario and Lepido arrive and do battle with Totila as a storm rages. Totila’s ship sinks and Marzia is rescued by Lepidus. Clelia, disguised as a soldier, challenges Vitige to a duel but he recognizes her and declares his love; again she rejects him. Belisario imprisons Vitige and frees Servius, while Totila is believed to be dead. In the third act Totila, in disguise, orders Vitige to kill Belisario but he refuses, moved by the general's magnanimity. Publicola and Desbo appear in another comic interlude: in his delusion Publicola mistakes Desbo for Narciso and tries to seduce him. Desbo escapes, pursued by Publicola who, armed with a bow, wounds Totila. Belisarius arrives but, instead of killing Totila, helps him. Clelia and Publicola reunite, while Belisario and Lepido declare themselves willing to renounce their love for Marzia, if Totila will become a vassal of Giustiniano. Music Legrenzi’s writing for the opera has several noteworthy points, including the expression of jealousy through the juxtaposition of a constant bass overlapping with a slower-moving vocal line, and the use of trumpet arias as well as vocal imitations of them to reflect the military setting of the action. He also managed to include elements of comedy within an opera seria. Legrenzi’s music depicts the four leading roles as distinctive types. Belisarius embodies generosity and magnanimity and his arias are heroic in character while Totila, his opposite, is prone to violence. The delineation of the female lead roles is similarly clear. Clelia’s conduct is unwaveringly moral; in contrast Marzia makes fun of Totila and mocks her own destiny, but eventually surrenders to both.

It is a sister school of the Beacon School in Taguig, Metro Manila. The Beacon Academy brands itself as \\"an international school rooted in Filipino culture and ethos.\\"  History  The Beacon Academy was founded in 2009 by architect Leandro Locsin Jr., son of the late National Artist of the Philippines for Architecture Leandro Locsin, and his wife Mailin Paterno- Locsin. The school was established to serve as the high school extension of its sister school, the Beacon School, located along Chino Roces Avenue in Taguig. According to the junior Locsin, the Beacon Academy aimed to continue the Beacon School's success of providing an internationally-recognized curriculum that would provide Filipino parents an option for their children to maximize their potential as national and global citizens. Locsin added that its establishment was also a response to the rise of international schools in the country aiming to do the same. The school's campus opened in August 2010. Then Education Secretary Armin Luistro and then Biñan Mayor Marlyn Alonte- Naguiat were among the guests of honor during the school's opening rites. Locsin currently serves as the Beacon Academy's board chairman. The Beacon Academy was accredited by the IB on April 20, 2011.  Campus  The campus of the Beacon Academy measures , located approximately south of Metro Manila. Heavily surrounded by greenery, it is situated on land donated by the Locsin family, the same land where the De La Salle University Science and Technology Complex is situated on. It is also near the Ayala Westgrove Heights subdivision in Silang, Cavite and the Nuvali mixed-use residential development in Calamba, Laguna. The Beacon Academy has two two-storey buildings; the main building containing 11 state-of-the-art classrooms, including four laboratories, and the secondary building containing seven classrooms, including a music room and a visual arts studio, as well as an auditorium and a gallery. The Beacon Academy's facilities also include an eight-lane Olympic- size swimming pool, a basketball court, a football pitch, a fitness room, and a climbing wall.  Faculty and students  Branding itself as a \\"Filipino international school\\", the Beacon Academy community consists of mostly Filipinos. The school accepts foreign-based students and faculty, regardless of ethnic or religious background. An average class size is between 12 to 15 but not more than 20, as the school emphasizes its desire to cater more effectively to its students in an environment of personalized learning. Its faculty are secondary school teachers who have prior experience teaching in other secondary schools in the Philippines or abroad, some of whom also have experience teaching in colleges or universities. Its teachers regularly undergo extensive training programs to enhance their capabilities in effectively delivering the IB program to students.  Educational curriculum  The Beacon Academy specializes in the application of the Harkness method of teaching and learning in its curriculum. Most of the school's classrooms contain an oval-discussion table or a similar setup where students sit facing each other. The Beacon Academy's curriculum utilizes discussion-based learning as a form of independent study in order to foster critical thinking and collaborative skills amongst its students. Leandro Locsin Jr., the school's co-founder, was an alumnus of the Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, where the method was developed. The Beacon Academy describes its curriculum as an \\"extensive\\" curriculum designed to effectively help its students enter the colleges and universities of their choice, either local or international, that is ideally the \\"best fit\\" for them. The curriculum of the Beacon Academy follows the framework of the IB. Its partnership with the Beacon School is the only educational institution in the Philippines accredited by the IB to offer their three main educational programs (IB Primary Years Programme, IB Middle Years Programme, and IB Diploma Programme). The Beacon School offers the IB Primary Years Programme and the first three years of the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP), while the Beacon Academy offers the last two years of MYP and the IB Diploma Programme (DP). The Beacon School–Beacon Academy partnership is also the only educational institution in the country to offer the IB MYP. The Beacon Academy, however, only offers the following subjects in IB DP (listed per IB DP subject groups): * Group 1: English language and literature, English literature, Filipino literature, Japanese literature * Group 2: Chinese, Spanish, Spanish ab initio * Group 3: anthropology, business management, economics, psychology * Group 4: biology, chemistry, environmental systems and societies, physics * Group 5: mathematical studies, mathematics * Group 6: visual arts  Extracurricular activities  A member of the League of Southern Manila Schools and the Manila International Schools Athletic Association, the Beacon Academy has varsity teams in badminton, basketball, chess, football, swimming, and volleyball that compete locally and regionally. The school also participates in local and regional Model United Nations conferences and actively competes in the World Scholar's Cup internationally. The Griffin Post is the official student publication of the Beacon Academy. As of April 2019, the Performing Arts Club was established, featuring two original student-led plays. The first of which, Disaster on Big Bertha was released on May 30, 2019 while a direct sequel named The Sophomore Slump was released on December 12, 2019.

He started his music career as an R&B; artist before making a guest appearance on Emma Smith's single \\"I Want to Go\\". DenG rose to prominence after being featured on Queen V's 2013 hit single \\"Jue You Bad\\". Following the success of \\"Jue You Bad\\", he switched from R&B; to Afro pop. Music career A descendant of the Kpelle tribe, Daniel Tom George was born on September 1, 1984, in Bong County, Liberia. He developed an interest in music at a young age and joined his church's choir. DenG's family relocated to Ghana during Liberia's second civil war; he attended Achimota School while living in Ghana. DenG returned to Liberia and studied business at the United Methodist University. He started his music career as an R&B; artist before venturing into Afro pop music, and was featured on Emma Smith's single \\"I Want to Go\\". DenG gained prominence in 2013 after being featured on Queen V's hit single \\"Jue You Bad\\", which also features vocals by Tan Tan. In 2014, he released the single \\"They Vex\\", a song that addresses the jealousy associated with fame and recognition. His management team announced a tee-shirt collection, featuring the phrase \\"If they vex, let them buss\\", would arrive in Liberia. DenG collaborated with F.A and Soul Fresh to record \\"Ebola is Real\\", a hipco track that informs Liberians about ways they can protect and prevent the spread of Ebola. Recorded in colloquial English, \\"Ebola is Real\\" was created in partnership with Liberia's Ministry of Health & Social Welfare and the radio station Hott FM. In 2015, DenG won Artist of the Year and Song of the Year for \\"They Vex\\" at the 2015 Liberia Music Awards. He also won Best Artist and Song of the Year for \\"They Vex\\" at the 2015 Liberian Entertainment Awards. DenG signed a $50,000 endorsement deal with Novafone Liberia, a GSM carrier. He released \\"Kemah\\" in 2015; it earned him a nomination for Best New Artist at the African Entertainment Awards that same year. In January 2016, DenG posted a note on his Facebook page, expressing his desire to quit music. However, in a telephone interview with LIB Life, he clarified his post was intended to find out whether Liberians still had interest in his career. The music video for DenG's \\"Put Foot\\" was released in January 2016. DenG first announced plans for the video's release earlier that month. He accused his manager Alice Yawo of downgrading the video's quality after she thanked a fan, who belittled the video, for their comments. In June 2016, DenG and Yawo had a fallout from their unwillingness to communicate. DenG was nominated for Listener's Choice at the 2016 MTV Africa Music Awards, becoming the first Liberian artist to receive a MAMA nomination. In late 2016, he performed alongside Christoph the Change, Kcee and Tekno at Beach Jam, a concert sponsored by Lonestar Cell. On June 9, 2017, DenG released the Sarkodie-assisted track \\"Janjay\\". It was jointly produced by Liberia's Stone Luckshine and Ghana's Possigee. Described as a Liberian highlife song, \\"Janjay\\" contains lyrics about a girl's dream. Prior to the song's release, DenG enlisted Kcee to appear on his track \\"Make Dem Talk\\". In July 2017, Emma Smith recruited DenG to lent vocals to her single \\"Hold Ground\\", an up-tempo track that has elements of Afrobeat and dancehall. In May 2018, DenG organized the first leg of his American tour; it concluded with a concert in Washington DC. In August 2018, he performed at the One Africa Music Fest, becoming the first Liberian act to perform at the festival. Held at the Ford Amphitheater at Coney Island, the festival featured additional performances from Wizkid, Flavour N'abania, Tekno, Sarkodie, Cassper Nyovest and Diamond Platnumz. DenG was one of the Liberian acts who performed at a concert headlined by Nigerian singer Davido; the concert was held at the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex in November 2018. Personal life In January 2018, The New Dawn newspaper reported DenG's brother Smith George died in Margibi County. George's body was discovered with foam around his mouth.

The statue, which is an important artefact of the Art of Mathura, is now visible in the Mathura Museum. It has been identified as the Yaksha deity Manibhadra, a popular deity in ancient India. Date The Parkham Yaksha is datable to period 200 BCE – 50 BCE on paleographic and stylistic grounds. It has also been dated more precisely by Heinrich Lüders, who gives it a mid-2nd century date, and Sonya Rhie Quintanilla who dates it to circa 150 BCE.Dated 150 BCE in Fig. 15-17, general comments p.26-27 in Inscription The statue is 2.6 meters tall, including its base of about 30 centimeters. The badly corroded inscription in early Brahmi script on the top side of the base reads: This inscription thus indicates that the statue represents the Yaksa Manibhadra, and the title \\"Bhagavat\\" (\\"Lord\\" or \\"Holy One\\") suggests that the statue represents a divinity in its own right, which was the subject of worship, independently of Buddhism or Jainism with which it was later associated. Style The analysis of the statue has suggested that the Parkham Yaksha probably held his left arm akimbo, while holding a bag filled with square coins, as seen in the Manibhadra statue of Pawaya. According to John Boardman, the hem of the dress is derived from Greek art. Describing a similar statue, John Boardman writes: \\"It has no local antecedents and looks most like a Greek Late Archaic mannerism\\". Similar folds can be seen in the Bharhut Yavana. The Parkham Yaksha is one of four known occurrences of the Yaksha Manibhadra in inscriptions: one in Parkham near Mathura, one in Pawaya near Gwalior, one in Masharfa and one in Bhītā near Kausambi. It appears Manibhadra was considered as a protector of itenerant merchants, a provider of wealth, and a protector against smallpox.

SEC, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case from the October 2018 term. The Supreme Court held that someone who disseminates false statements to potential investors with the intent to defraud those investors can be held liable under subsection b of Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, even if they personally were not the ones who drafted the false statements., 139 S. Ct. 1094 (2019). This decision clarifies the applicability of the 2011 holding in Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First Derivative Traders to individuals who disseminate false statements made by others. That decision had held that subsection (b) of Rule 10b-5 (which prohibits \\"mak[ing] any untrue statement of a material fact\\") applies only to the individual who personally drafted the false statements; this decision clarifies that other individuals who participate in the fraud scheme can be held liable under other subsections of Rule 10b-5. It also marked one of the rare recent occasions in which the Securities and Exchange Commission prevailed in front of the Supreme Court, after defeats in prior cases including Gabelli v. SEC (2013), Kokesh v. SEC (2016), and Lucia v. SEC (2018).  Background  Francis V. Lorenzo was the former director of investment banking at Charles Vista LLC, a broker-dealer in Staten Island, New York. Lorenzo's only client at the time was a company called Waste2Energy Holdings Inc., a firm which claimed to be developing technology to transform solid waste into clean energy. In early 2009, Lorenzo was tasked with attempting to sell $15 million worth of convertible debentures (debt securities) issued by Waste2Energy. By October 2009, however, Waste2Energy had disclosed to the public and to Lorenzo that its intellectual property was worthless and that it had written off all of its intangible assets. Its remaining assets were worth approximately $370,000, far less than the value of its proposed debenture offering. Despite this, Lorenzo continued attempting to sell the debentures on the market, sending emails to prospective investors which stated that the company had $10 million in 'confirmed assets', which would protect investors against losses. According to Lorenzo, his boss at Charles Vista LLC had supplied the content of the emails and approved their dissemination to investors. Throughout 2009 and 2010, investors purchased the debentures. When Waste2Energy Holdings eventually collapsed and filed for bankruptcy in 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an administrative case against Charles Vista, Lorenzo, and his former boss for violating section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5. Charles Vista was also charged with violating the Exchange Act's Section 15(c) and rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All three entities were charged with being 'primary violators' of Rule 10b-5. Lorenzo's boss and Charles Vista agreed to settle the case, but Lorenzo himself went to trial before an administrative law judge at the SEC. In the hearing, Lorenzo insisted that he simply cut-and-pasted language given to him by his boss and that, under existing Supreme Court precedent, he should not be held liable for merely passing on someone else's false statements. The SEC administrative law judge who heard the case accepted Lorenzo's claim that he had sent the fraudulent emails without really reading them or thinking about the contents. However, the administrative law judge still found that Lorenzo had willfully violated securities laws by making fraudulent misstatements and by participating in a scheme to defraud potential investors. Lorenzo was barred from the securities industry for life and fined $15,000.. The full SEC affirmed the ALJ's decision but formally rejected his claim that he had sent the emails without reading them. Lorenzo appealed the SEC's decision to federal court. As allowed by the Securities Exchange Act, Lorenzo was permitted to appeal the Commission's ruling before either the DC Circuit Court of Appeals or the Circuit Court of Appeals in which he principally did business.  In lower courts   Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit  Lorenzo's appeal was first heard by a three-judge panel United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which comprised circuit judges Sri Srinivasan, Brett Kavanaugh, and Thomas Griffith. Lorenzo's argument before the DC Circuit was that he could not be held liable for passing on false statements made by another person. By applying the decision from Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First Derivative Traders, the DC Circuit ruled that Lorenzo did not violate subsection b of Rule 10b-5, holding the primary liability under that subsection can only be applied to the person who held 'ultimate authority' over the statement, including its content and whether and how it should be communicated. They affirmed Lorenzo's contention that his boss was the true 'maker' of the false statements since he was the one who asked Lorenzo to send the emails and was the one who supplied the content. However, by a 2-to-1 vote (with Judge Kavanaugh dissenting), the DC Circuit held that Lorenzo was liable under subsections a and c of Rule 10b-5, which cover liability for participating in a fraud scheme (also known as \\"scheme\\" liability). Because the court ruled against the SEC on the Rule 10b-5 subsection b ruling, it vacated the penalties levied against Lorenzo by the SEC and sent the case back to the Commission to reconsider Lorenzo's punishment in light of the ruling. In his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh claimed that the majority opinion endorsed the SEC's efforts to \\"end-run the Supreme Court\\" by expanding primary liability for securities fraud. He stated the conduct described in Lorenzo's case may have been considered 'aiding and abetting' but that Lorenzo should not be considered a primary violator for passing along misstatements from his boss. He emphasized the distinction between primary liability and aiding and abetting, noting that prior Supreme Court cases (2008's Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. and 1994's Central Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A.) had limited the ability of private plaintiffs to file suit against secondary actors (accused aiders and abettors) in a fraud case. Kavanaugh argued that the Court of Appeals's opinion here would have the effect of converting these secondary actors into primary violators through \\"scheme\\" liability, exposing them to additional liability (contradicting the Supreme Court's past rulings). The DC Circuit's decision exacerbated a circuit split regarding this issue. Since 2005, the Second, Eighth, and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal had each held that fraudulent misstatements could not by themselves create \\"scheme\\" liability while the Eleventh Circuit had been more open to the idea.  Appeal to the Supreme Court  Lorenzo appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in January 2018. In June 2018, the Supreme Court granted his writ of certiorari agreeing to hear the case. The case was argued on December 3, 2018. Robert Heim, an attorney with the firm of Meyers & Heim LLP, argued the case on behalf of Lorenzo. Assistant Solicitor General Christopher Michel argued the case on behalf of the United States government. Because he was on the DC Circuit panel which heard the original case, Justice Brett Kavanaugh recused himself from participating in this case.  Supreme Court opinion  The Supreme Court affirmed the DC Circuit's decision to impose \\"scheme\\" liability on Lorenzo. Writing for a 6-2 majority, Justice Stephen Breyer found that the language in subsections a and c of Rule 10b-5 were sufficiently broad to encompass Lorenzo's dissemination of false information with the intent to defraud. The majority opinion held that merely disseminating false statements was not enough to create \\"scheme\\" liability; it argued that the fraudulent course of conduct (planning the debenture sales, development of the fraud scheme, etc.) was part of the pattern of conduct needed to impose primary liability. In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas (joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch) argued that the majority opinion would render the Supreme Courts precedent in Janus a \\"dead letter\\". This decision is noteworthy because it expanded the scope of primary liability for securities fraud, which is controversial in the securities industry. One potential repercussion of the ruling is that private plaintiffs may use the Lorenzo precedent to argue for expanded liability for deep-pocketed peripheral players in fraud schemes, such as accountants and attorneys, who otherwise would have been protected under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

The composer Georges Bizet (who died in 1875 when Jacques was not quite three) was his father. His mother was the literary hostess, born Geneviève Halévy. The essayist-historian Daniel Halévy (1872 – 1962) was a cousin. Biography Jacques Bizet was born in Paris. His father's sudden and early death seems to have encouraged his particularly close attachment to his mother, who in 1886 remarried. Her second husband was a wealthy lawyer and passionate art collector called Émile Straus (1844–1929). The close relationship between mother and son does not seem to have been unduly affected by the mother's remarriage. According to one source, when someone asked the vivacious widowed socialite why on earth she had married the ill-tempered balding attorney, she replied that it had been \\"the only way to get rid of him\\". Geneviève Straus ran a lively literary salon, which helped to stave off the depression towards which she tended, and which her son seems to have inherited. Running the salon meant that the boy came to know many of the Parisian artistic and literary celebrities of the day. Georges Bizet was virtually unknown at the time of his death, but the posthumous success of his work, and in particular the huge success of his opera Carmen, meant that by the time he enrolled at an exclusive primary school that followed the curriculum created by Marie Pape- Carpantier, Jacques Bizet had become the son of a famous composer. His cousin and contemporary Daniel Halévy started at the same school at the same time: he was a large child and soon established himself as the school bully. Another pupil, a year senior to the cousins, but physically relatively puny, was Marcel Proust. In some ways all three boys had similar backgrounds: at a time when racial identity was rising up the socio-political agenda, they would all have been regarded as half-Jewish, but the parents of all three had nevertheless had them baptised into Christian churches. When the time came for secondary school the cousins moved on to the prestigious Lycée Condorcet. Contemporaries who would later achieve a measure of notability included Robert Dreyfus and Fernand Gregh. One year ahead, as before, was Marcel Proust. The relationship between the cousins and the future iconic novelist were affected by Proust's curiously guileless homosexuality. He wrote a succession of letters to the cousins expressing his feelings with an openness that shocked and unsettled them. There was no sense that his feelings of attraction were ever reciprocated. The result in the immediate term seems to have been that, more than ever, Proust became a target of mocking, mistreatment and bullying by Bizet, Halévy and the gang that formed around them. In his diary entry on a poem by Proust which he perceived as homoerotic, the young Daniel Halévy confided that he thought Proust \\"more gifted than anyone\\", but the talented poet was also \\"young and weak, [and] not enough of a boy for us\\". At one point Geneviève Straus became so exasperated by Proust's homoerotic fixation on her son and his cousin, that she refused to allow the gifted young writer admission to the literary salon that doubled as her family home. There were nevertheless forces in the relationship between the cousins and Proust that sustained it in more positive ways. In addition to their physical attractions, Proust seems to have been somewhat in awe of the cousins' family connections. Daniel's father, Ludovic Halévy, was a versatile author and dramatist whose fame among Parisian intellectuals at the time would have been quite as great as that of the composer Georges Bizet. It is also more than possible that as a teenager Proust was already becoming aware of the extent to which he would be able to copy, adapt and incorporate physical, psychological and behavioural traits in his school contemporaries and their family members in future novels. For their part, Halévy and Bizet were genuinely in awe of Proust's precocious and formidable talent. Their family backgrounds predisposed them to a love for literature: they were not without their own ambitions in that respect. By the time the boys left school the bullying had ended. All the boys were destined to inhabit the same haute-bourgeois milieu of Parisian intellectuals: friendship between Marcel Proust and Jacques Bizet would endure. Before that, while still at school Halévy and Bizet teamed up to found two small scale literary reviews, \\"Revue Verte\\" and \\"Revue Lilas\\". Proust and Gregh joined in with the projects. Three years later Fernand Gregh founded another review magazine, Le Banquet, which was published monthly between March 1892 and March 1893. Leading members of the twentieth century literary establishment were among the contributors, including Gaston Arman de Caillavet, Robert de Flers Daniel Halévy and Marcel Proust. Another contributor, Léon Blum, later became Prime Minister of France. Jacques Bizet authored a number of the articles. The sudden closure of Le Banquet after only a year came as a surprise. Jacques Bizet now wrote several subsequently forgotten theatre pieces, influenced by the plays of Pierre de Marivaux and Oscar Wilde. By the end of 1893, however, while still rebutting the unwanted advances of his friend Marcel Proust, Jacques Bizet had to some extent distanced himself from the literary scene and enrolled at the University of Paris as a medical student. The study of medicine did not cause Bizet entirely to break away from the world of the arts. During his second and, as matters turned out, final student year he joined with Jacques-Émile Blanche to set up a Théâtre d'ombres review. By this time Marcel Proust's exclusion from the home of Geneviève Straus had long since been rescinded, and he was again one of the \\"men of letters\\" who frequented the salon where, according to several commentators, he found a rich pool of characters who would find their way into his novels, their habits and features not necessarily much modified. In the increasingly politicised atmosphere of the times the salon was naturally ardently pro-Dreyfus, perhaps taking a lead from the half-Jewish hostess and her Jewish husband, who was frequently rumoured to be an illegitimate half-brother to the Rothschild brothers. Like Proust, Jacques Bizet signed the famous pro-Dreyfus petition which appeared in Le Temps on 15 January 1898 in response to Émile Zola's incendiary open letter under the headline \\"J'Accuse…!\\" which had appeared in L'Aurore two days earlier. The political and social polarisation provoked by the Dreyfus affair was nevertheless followed by a decline in popularity for the salon of Mme. Straus, as people avoided being seen in the company of those who had taken an opposite position in the affair. A few years later, in 1902, Bizet was provoked into challenging the dramaturge André Picard to a duel. A tragic denouement was narrowly avoided. Meanwhile the motor industry was booming. In 1903 France remained the world's leading automaker, producing 30,124 cars (nearly 49% of the world total) as against 11,235 cars produced in the USA.Histoire mondiale de l’automobile (in French) (Flammarion ed.). 1998. p. 18. . Jacques Bizet joined the bandwagon, becoming a director of \\"Taximètres Unic de Monaco\\", a substantial taxi business that had been founded by the Rothschilds. Marcel Proust became one of the company's most devoted customers, taking long taxi trips into the Normandy countryside which provided the backdrop for some of his best known novels. It was indeed as a result of this arrangement that Proust came to know Alfred Agostinelli, who in 1913 exchanged the life of a (by this point unemployed) taxi driver for a job as Proust's secretary-stenographer, although some sources indicate that in making the appointment Proust was driven primarily by romantic considerations. Agostinelli is important to Proust scholars because he is generally seen as the basis for the character of \\"Albertine\\" who features prominently in several volumes of \\"À la recherche du temps perdu\\". Bizet also worked with the Paris automobile manufacturer Georges Richard. Richard was extensively funded by the Rothschilds, with whom Jacques Bizet was believed to have family connections. According to one source Bizet ran a dealership selling cars for Richard. In 1905 the two men teamed up (with others) to launch Unic cars. It was through Georges Richard that Jacques Bizet met Jules Salomon. In 1909 Salomon left to set up business independently of Richard: Bizet joined up with him to establish the automobile manufacturer known to posterity as Le Zèbre. Salomon was the engineer-entrepreneur while Bizet was the principal source of funds for the enterprise. In the early days all the cars produced were badged under the names \\"Bizet\\" or \\"Bizet Automobiles\\". Over the next few years Bizet became increasingly irascible. In 1912, three days after a disagreement in a theatre foyer which ended with Bizet slapping Count Hubert de Pierredon across the face, he and de Pierredon, albeit without either causing the other lasting damage. Two years the outbreak of war found him serving as a military physician at the Saint-Martin Hospital. Later during the war he managed a munitions factory. Personal On 1 June 1898 Jacques Bizet married a distant cousin, Madeleine Breguet (1878 – 1900), in Paris. She died on 15 October 1900 while undergoing an operation under the surgeon-gynecologist Samuel Jean de Pozzi, a former lover of Bizet's mother. Jacques Bitzet's second marriage, to Alice Franckel (1862 – ?), took place in 1904. It was a second marriage for both of them. Alice Franckel had been born in Hamburg: it is not known when or how she moved to Paris. In 1919 Jacques Bizet's second marriage ended in divorce. According to at least one source Jacques Bizet was crushed by the family environment into which he had been born. During his final years he became an alcoholic and a morphine addict. In the end he committed suicide, shooting himself in the head, over matters involving his mistress, a couple of weeks before the death of his life-long friend Marcel Proust.

The design was based upon Morgan's Sabre, a one-off racing boat that was successful in competition, winning Class C 1964 Southern Ocean Racing Circuit (SORC) and second place overall. Sabre was derived from the racing ketch Paper Tiger which was the overall winner of the 1961 and 1962 SORC racing series. Production The design was built by Columbia Yachts in the United States. The company built 55 examples of the type from 1964 to 1969. Design The factory sales brochure described the design goals, \\"A real yacht designed to go to sea in comfort while giving top performance.\\" The Columbia 40 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a steel frame molded into the fiberglass structure. It has a masthead sloop rig, or optional yawl rig, with the additional of a mizzen mast. Features include a raked stem , a raised counter transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed long keel with a hydraulically raised, retractable centerboard. It displaces and carries of ballast. The steel tube frame was designed to take the standing rigging loads and pass them through the steel structure to the hull bulkheads and the deck structure. This allowed very high tensions on the cabling, for example on the forestay and allowed a very precise sail shape, providing better performance in light and heavier winds. The boat has a draft of with the centreboard extended and with it retracted. Being hydraulically actuated, the centerboard was intended to be raised when sailing downwind to reduce whetted area and drag, as in dinghy sailing. The boat is fitted with a Universal Atomic 4 gasoline engine for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The galley is located on the port side at the bottom of the companionway steps, and includes a three-burner stove. The head is located forward, just aft of the bow \\"V\\"-berth, and has a privacy door. Additional sleeping accommodation is provided in the main cabin, including a dinette table that can be dropped to form a double berth, and a single berth. The Columbia 34 was created in 1966 with the addition of a deck adapted from the Columbia 40 mated to the hull of the Columbia 33 Caribbean design. The Columbia 38 was also developed from the Columbia 40. Operational history The design was used to win the 1966 SORC Miami-Nassau race and also took second, third and fifth places in SORC Class C.

She was married to BAE illustrator and photographer De Lancey Walker Gill.  Early life  Mary Wright Gill was born on May 19, 1867 in Washington, D.C. She was the daughter of Minna Wright (d. 1908) and had a brother, John Newton Wright. As a girl, due to health issues, she was taken out of school and enrolled in the School of Design at the University of Cincinnati, and became the youngest student ever to enroll in that program. When she returned to Washington, she began drawing on contract with the BAE under the direction of John Wesley Powell. Some of her early work was featured as part of the Smithsonian's contributions to the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States. In 1891, her work was featured in an exhibition for the Society of Washington Artists in the Woodward & Lothrop gallery. In an article about the exhibition, a reporter noted that (then) Mary Irwin Wright, through paid black and white illustrations for magazines like the Century and St. Nicholas and commissioned works while abroad in London, \\"has already made considerable reputation and enough money to buy a house on Capitol Hill.\\" She graduated from the University of Cincinnati School of Design with a degree in drawing and design in 1893. She also studied in New York with Kenyon Cox and in Washington with Edwin H. Blashfield.  Career  Bread for Making the Feast, Plate XC, The Zuni Indians, Matilda Coxe Stevenson Child with Broken Leg in Splints, Plate C, The Zuni Indians, Matilda Coxe Stevenson Mary Wright Gill was renowned for her drawings of \\"fidelity and accuracy.\\" She worked as a contract artist for the Bureau of American Ethnology and produced many of the illustrations used in the BAE's annual reports, such as Matilda Coxe Stevenson's The Zuni Indians. She worked primarily in pen and ink, graphite, and watercolor. Her watercolor illustrations were sometimes composites based on series of photographs, lending them a hyperreal quality. Some of her illustrations, like the photographs taken by Stevenson, were not made with the same ethical protocols observed by ethnographers and documentarians today, and are considered culturally sensitive by contemporary Pueblo communities. In addition to those for the BAE, she illustrated many notable publications and books, including the Manual of the Grasses, by Albert Spear Hitchcock.

Kroeger (1913-1998) was a pioneer in the health food and alternative medicine movements in the U.S. She operated a variety of businesses including a health food store, restaurant, and wholesale herb business in Boulder, Colorado between 1957 and her death.  Early life and family  Hanna Ursula Zimmer was born October 5, 1913 in Attabey, Turkey, to German missionaries who ran an orphanage. Her father, Max, communicated with Alice Bailey, an esoteric wisdom teacher; her mother, Hannah, was an herbal medicine practitioner. Kroeger was the youngest of six children. She grew up watching her parents help the less fortunate. Hanna Zimmer married Rudolph Kroeger, a mechanical engineer. They had five children: sons Klaus, Heinz and Albrecht; daughters Gisela and Anneliese. Rudolph was imprisoned for five years in a Russian labor camp after WWII. After his release he wanted to take his family as far from Russia as he could. They tried for years to immigrate to the U.S. and finally found sponsors, allowing them to immigrate in 1953. They traveled for 3 years before settling in Boulder in 1956.  Education  Hanna studied nursing at her parents’ mission hospital in Turkey. She later graduated from a German nursing school and became an RN. She then worked at a Dresden hospital where she learned natural healing techniques.  Career  Approximately a year after her arrival in Boulder Kroeger took over a tea and coffee company from the owner who was retiring. She added healing teas, baked goods, seeds, nuts, raisins, oils and other items to the store’s offerings and renamed it Imperial Tea and Health Foods. A few years later she purchased a building at 1122 Pearl, renamed the store “New Age Foods,” and added vitamins. Later a vegetarian restaurant was added upstairs. In addition to selling vitamins and health food Kroeger offered health advice. She sometimes used a method called “dowsing’ whereby she would suspend a pendulum and observe its motions to diagnose illness. Kroeger also started the Kroeger Herb Wholesale Product Company (still operating as Kroeger Herb Products Co., Inc.) that sold hundreds of lines of herbs and homeopathic treatments carried in stores all over the world. She developed over 200 homeopathic remedies. She was the author of over 20 books, mostly dealing with herbal therapies that she largely obtained from traditional European and Native American teachings. In 1967 Kroeger and her family started a health resort, Peaceful Meadow. The resort followed the model of popular European health resorts. Her family also started the Chapel of Miracles on their property. Later in her life Kroeger ministered each Sunday to approximately 100 congregants.  Legal proceedings  On April 16, 1971, Kroeger was indicted on 11 counts of practicing medicine without a license. District Attorney Stanley Johnson claimed she received compensation for treating patients without the required qualifications. The trial began November 15, 1971. Undercover Pinkerton agents hired by the State Board of Medical Examiners testified that Kroeger had provided advice to them about various fabricated ailments. She was found guilty of 5 charges but granted a new trial because her defense attorneys were denied access to grand jury testimony. The case was dismissed in May 1972 after she agreed to stop giving medical advice. Kroeger felt the DA targeted her because she was an immigrant and because she had many hippie customers. Protesters gathered outside the trial with signs stating, “Natural Healing is Not Quackery,” “Suggesting Good Food is Not Practicing Medicine,” “Herbs and Vitamins are Not Drugs,” among others. In February 1989 the State Board of Medical Examiners filed a complaint asking the Boulder District Court to prohibit Kroeger from practicing medicine. She agreed to give up her practice to avoid a trial. She continued to offer advice by phone and at her chapel.  Death  Kroeger died on May 7, 1998 in Boulder. Following her death her daughter Gisela left a career as a mathematics professor and database designer to take over Kroeger’s business. References  External links  * Kroeger Herb Products Co., Inc.

She is best known as the owner of the sewing pattern company and blog Grainline Studio. She is a graduate of Columbia College where she studied fashion design with a focus on pattern making and technical design. Grainline Studio started as a blog where Beeman, then a freelance pattern maker, wrote about her experience designing and sewing her own clothes. She began working on the site full-time after realizing there was a modern design gap in the offerings of the commercial pattern making industry. Beeman worked with her partner John Krohn, a graphic designer, to lay out her first commercial patterns. Krohn joined the company full-time in 2015 overseeing graphic design and shipping. The motivation behind Grainline Studio patterns was described by Beeman in a 2017 interview with Making as \\"clean, modern designs that women can wear every day and that can be made again and again\\". Her Archer Shirt pattern won the PatternReview.com award for Best Woven Top four years in a row (2014-2017). In addition to selling patterns, Beeman provides step by step tutorials and pattern variations, and hosts sewalongs as part of Grainline Studios online offerings. In a 2014 Marketplace interview about disappearing jobs, Beeman talked about the human element of pattern making and the impact of mechanized production explaining that: \\"We're so removed from how our garments or products in general are made that they never assume that there's a person who does that\\". Beeman has also talked openly about her experience operating a small business. She appeared on the podcast Love To Sew in 2017 where she discussed balancing professional and personal demands while running a company.

Arsenal won the match 11–1, setting a new FA WSL record scoreline, surpassing the 9–0 win set by Liverpool Ladies over Doncaster Rovers Belles in 2013. Dutch striker Vivianne Miedema was involved in 10 of the 11 goals scored while she was on the pitch, scoring six times and registering four assists, which broke her own FA WSL record for single-game goal involvements originally set at five in September 2018 against Liverpool (three goals, two assists). The goal tally also took Miedema's all- time FA WSL goals total to 36 goals, overtaking Ji So-yun as the highest- scoring non-British player in league history. Background Arsenal begun the match in third, level with Manchester City on 18 points but behind on goal difference by seven. Winless Bristol City were in 10th place, tied on 3 points with Birmingham City but slightly ahead on goal difference. The two teams had met ten days previously in the League Cup with Arsenal emerging 7–0 winners. Arsenal's lineup contained four changes from the League Cup clash while Bristol City only made two with both teams having also been in league action during the intermediate weekend. Match Summary Lisa Evans opened the scoring in the 7th minute before Leah Williamson doubled Arsenal's advantage three minutes later, both assisted by Vivianne Miedema. The assists turned into goals as Miedema scored a hat-trick in the space of 21 minutes to send Arsenal into the half-time break with a 5–0 lead. Miedema resumed scoring six minutes into the second half, betting her fourth of the day and Arsenal's sixth before Jordan Nobbs became the fourth goalscorer of the game to make it 7–0 in the 54th minute. Two minutes later Miedema once again netted before claiming her fourth assist on the hour mark as Evans scored got her brace to make it 9–0. Miedema scored her sixth and final goal of the day four minutes later to send Arsenal to double figures before Emma Mitchell scored one with an assist from Beth Mead. Bristol City were awarded a late penalty after Belgian striker Yana Daniëls was brought down in the box by Arsenal's goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger. Daniëls tucked away the rebound in the 85th minute after Zinsberger had saved the original penalty before the final whistle confirmed the largest victory in WSL history.

Henderson (August 25, 1920 – June 2, 1998) was a United States Army colonel who commanded the 11th Infantry Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division during the Vietnam War and later served as head of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency in the late 1970s. He is most famous for his role in the My Lai massacre where he served as brigade commander for the units involved in the killings, ultimately being charged and acquitted of dereliction of duty for failing to carry out an adequate investigation and lying to Army investigators. He was the highest-ranking Army officer to be tried in connection with the killings. Prior to the Vietnam War, Henderson had served as an infantry officer in World War II and the Korean War. Early life Henderson was born on 25 August, 1920 in Indianapolis, Indiana. He entered the Army in 1941 and served in World War II, and the Korean War as an infantry officer, being wounded in both conflicts. My Lai and trial On 16 March 1968, Henderson took over as commander for the 11th Infantry Brigade. He would oversee a battalion-sized operation to clear Viet Cong forces from the Sơn Tịnh District, ordering his men to \\"go in there aggressively, close with the enemy and wipe them out for good\\". During the operation, soldiers under his command massacred hundreds of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians near the village of Sơn Mỹ in what would later be known as the My Lai massacre. At the time of the massacre, Henderson was flying over the villages in a helicopter. Henderson was the first to interview Warrant Officer (WO1) Hugh Thompson, Jr., a helicopter pilot who had intervened in the massacre and issued an official report describing what he saw.Angers (1999), pp. 219–20. Despite the report, Henderson issued a commendation for Captain Ernest Medina, the commander of one of the companies involved in the killings and even after interviewing several soldiers involved in the operation, issued a report stating only twenty civilians had been inadvertently killed by artillery fire. In his report, Henderson called widespread reports that hundreds of civilians had been killed \\"propaganda\\" to discredit U.S. and ARVN forces. In 1970, three charges were brought against Henderson to include failing to carry out a thorough investigation of the killings, failing to report possible war crimes to his division commander Brigadier General Samuel W. Koster, and lying to a Pentagon inquiry. In the case, Henderson's defense counsel argued that he had conducted an honest investigation but was misled by his subordinates including Captain Medina while prosecutors contended he hid evidence in order to preserve his rank and command. On 18 December 1971, after a 62-day trial in Fort George G. Meade which heard 106 witnesses, Henderson was acquitted by a jury of two generals and five colonels. After his acquittal, he stated that the verdict \\"reaffirms the confidence any Army man can have in the military system.\\" Later life After leaving the Army, Henderson became head of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, where he oversaw responses to devastating floods in 1977 and the Three Mile Island accident. He recommended a radius evacuation in response and later testified to Congress regarding the incident. Death Henderson died of pancreatic cancer on 2 June 1998 in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.

Australian membership in the World Bank Group (WBG) is motivated by both 1) efforts to aid and assist the developing nations of the world and 2) to promote Australian regional interests throughout the East Asian, Southeast Asian, and greater Oceania regions. Examples of this include the multiple projects co-financed by Australia and the World Bank Group in the East Asian and Pacific regions that include the development of “infrastructure, health, education, and private sector development”. Australian membership has led to countless successful foreign aid and development projects totaling hundreds of millions; in 2012-13 alone, Australia provided close to $552.6 million to the World Bank Group.  Introduction  According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Australian foreign aid and World Bank Group contributions has led to achievements in three major areas concerning Growth, Inclusiveness, and Sustainability & Resilience. Australian and World Bank Group efforts have resulted in both economic development and urban development in the Growth sector, education, sustainable development, and welfare program development in the Inclusiveness sector, and other successful projects in the Sustainability & Resilience sector that include environmental protection. Among the five organizations of the World Bank Group, Australia maintains an especially close partnership with the International Development Association (IDA), as Australia and the IDA share similar perspectives on global aid and development projects ranging from “aid program priorities, promoting the private sector development, boosting female economic empowerment, effective governance, supporting fragile states, and tackling climate change”.  Australia & The World Bank Group Partnership   Regional Interests  A map of the region of Oceania including the four subregions of Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia in the Pacific Ocean. This map represents the Indo- Pacific biogeographic region. Australia is a continental-nation located in the heart of the Indo-Pacific region, which includes East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania (including Micronesia, Australasia, Melanesia, and Polynesia), and is among that of the wealthiest, and potentially most influential, nations in the region. Being so, Australia has the potential to assert great influence over the region, and thus has many interests and priorities regarding the region. Australian contributions to the World Bank Group, as close as the partnership is between the two, is primarily motivated by Australian interests and priorities in the Indo-Pacific region. Through Australian World Bank Group membership and contributions, Australia is able to promote and influence World Bank Group development, aid, and project policies and priorities to focus more on that of the Indo-Pacific region, allowing for more economic development and growth throughout the region.  Australian Partnership with the International Development Association  The Australian-IDA partnership is highlighted by the contributions made by the Australian Government towards IDA18 replenishments. IDA18 replenishments is a $774.45 million Australian dollar global, but primarily Pacific regional, effort aimed at increasing the value of currency in the region, increasing regional economic development and aid to benefit growth and infrastructure, increasing sustainable development, and other mutual projects that support both Australian regional interests and the World Bank Group agenda over the course of 9 nine years.  Contributions & Donations  Between 1994 to 2013, Australia contributed 134 donations towards The World Bank Group and their funds, of which include thirteen funds across six different sectors and themes. These contributions range from as little as $12,904.67(USD) to as much as $62,287,176.00. Below is a table of Australian contributions towards World Bank funds and their corresponding World Bank sectors between 1994 through 2013, according to the World Bank date provided in their Contributions to FIF (Financial Intermediary Funds) - Australia as of 2013. {  +Australian World Bank Group Funds Contributions (with Sectors) Between 1994-2013 !Funds !Sector - AgResults Agriculture & Food Security - CGIAR Fund (Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research) Agriculture & Food Security - Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Agriculture & Food Security - Global Partnership for Education Fund Education - Clean Technology Fund Environment/Climate Change - Global Environment Facility Environment/Climate Change - Green Climate Fund Trust Fund Environment/Climate Change - Strategic Climate Fund Environment/Climate Change - Trust Fund for the Least Developed Countries Fund for Climate Change Environment/Climate Change - International Finance Facility for Immunization/GFA Health - The Global Fund to Fight AIDs, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Health - Haiti Reconstruction Fund Natural Disasters - Debt Relief Trust Fund Other } Commonwealth Bank logo  Commonwealth Bank of Australia & The World Bank Group  In 2018, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) announced the release of a new bond sales technology designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the World Bank Group bond sales management, oversight, and administration by utilizing blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it was called – “bond-i”. Bond-i stands for Blockchain Operated New Debt Instrument, and is solely managed and pioneered by CBA itself. While there have been previous, private blockchain bond projects, Bond-i is the first global, public, bond sales processing system to be developed wholly and completely from blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. As well as the first to be created, managed, and in which bond trade activities and actions are recorded using distributed ledger technology. This is all in efforts to relieve the extremely outdated documented process of bond trading and issuance, allowing for a more effective, efficient, and economic trade process that will, in turn, increase the speed of trades while simultaneously decreasing the costs spent in processing these trades and bonds. The bond was spearhead by CBA, through investments from King & Wood Mallesons, Mark-it, Microsoft and Toronto Dominion Securities, in efforts to simplify “raising capital and trading securities, improve operational efficiencies, and enhance regulatory oversight”. Although Bond-i utilizes blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, the currencies of these bond exchanges is neither in cryptocurrency nor in bitcoin, but instead in the Australia dollar., partly because the Australian dollar is among the most highly traded currencies in the world.  World Bank Group Regional Climate Change Activism  The nation of Tuvalu in respects to Polynesia and greater Oceania. Tuvalu was one of the first islands to be affected. A map of the Republic of Kiribati located in Polynesia of the Oceania region. Kiribati was one of the first islands to be affected by climate change and global warming. In 2017, the World Bank Group in their policy paper “PacificPossible” argued and advocated for both Australia and New Zealand to allow open migration to Pacific Islanders who were and are threatened by the global disaster of climate change. Numerous islands in the Pacific either have been engulfed, or are soon to be engulfed, by the Pacific Ocean due to the rising seas from climate change and global warming. The World Bank Group argued that allowing mass and open migration would not only be a humanitarian effort that would prevent a forced migration of Pacific Islanders in the future as a result of climate change, but the open access would also significantly boost both Australian and New Zealand economies. This economic theory was further supported by Australian thinktanks and multiple Australian research institutes. In a Lowy Institute published report titled \\"The Development Benefits of Expanding Pacific Access to Australia's Labor Market\\", Leon Berkelmans and Jonathan Pryke present how allowing mass, open and free migration of Pacific island civilians to Australia would be both extremely beneficial towards the region but also beneficial towards the Australian economy as well. First, Berkelmans and Pryke proposed two avenues of mass, open and free migration: 1) the uncapped model and 2) the capped model. The uncapped model would call for Australia to establish a new special visa category in which there would not be a limit as to the number of civilians migrating to Australia. Through this model, it is projected that Australia would annually admit 900,000 immigrants, which would total to about 6.04 million by the year 2040. It should not be either assumed or misunderstood that the uncapped model either suggests or calls for unregulated and uncontrolled migration, the Pacific island civilians would still be subject to immigration tests, such as that of health and character tests. Next, would be the capped model, which would allow for more Australian Government oversight and regulation of the immigration process. This model projects that Australia would annually admit 215,000 immigrants each year, which would total to about 5.16 million by the 2040. Per Berkelmans and Pryke, one of the more significant and notable of the anticipated benefits for Australian open mass and free migration would be that of increased annual incomes for individuals and households, as Australian regional aid to the Indo-Pacific and Oceania regions was $600 million (2005 PPP adjusted US$). They further noted that should these Pacific island civilians be allowed to immigrate and work in Australia, the combined annual income increases is projected to be $25 billion (2005 PPP adjusted US$), 40 times that of the Australian regional aid program budget. Not only has it been suggested that opening free and mass migration be beneficial for the Pacific island civilians, but it has been suggested that these civilians, a majority of which are low-skilled, low and uneducated individuals, would be able to fill the voids in the Australia labor force shortages, especially in low-skilled professions. However, one of the detriments to this mass, open and free migration is that it would significantly undermine the Australian immigration initiative of attracting and admitting skilled workers to boost the Australian economy and improve the society and nation in general. Also, it is suggested that if so many Pacific island civilians emigrated from their homelands, their nations would be left worse off due to labor force shortages and declining economies, consequently. Despite the presented projections and proposals, neither governments have acted upon The World Bank PacificPossible. Instead, have both governments have instead reasserted their respective global climate change and environmental protection agendas, interests, and priorities. In a comment by the DFAT Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop, the Madam Minister stated that “Australia believes that the best response to climate change impacts, where feasible, is effective adaptation and well-supported internal relocation rather than resettlement.”  References  Category:World Bank Category:World Bank Group Category:Economy of Australia Category:World Bank Group relations ","title":"Australia and the World Bank"},{"id":"62484246","text":"Reverse mission is a Christian missiological concept focusing on the late-20th-century reversal of early missionizing efforts, whereby Christians from Africa, Asia, and Latin America send missionaries to Europe and North America.  History  The modern missionary movement has tended to focus on the late-18th-century William Carey, as the \\"father of modern missions\\", until the early 20th century finding its peak in Edinburgh 1910. The focus of mission was largely a movement from Europe and North America to Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The second half of the 20th century has seen the shift of world Christianity, from Europe and North America to Africa, Asia, and Latin America. However, African, Asian, and Latin American Christians have migrated to the West, bringing with them their Christianity. This has been termed \\"reverse mission,\\" as it emphasizes the reversing of the direction of earlier missionary efforts. Reverse missionaries from African have sought to reintroduce Christianity to the United Kingdom, as have Koreans bringing Christianity to the United States. In 1989, the Third World Missions Association was established in Portland, Oregon, as a forum to train sending agencies of reverse missionaries from Africa, Asia, and Latin American.  Criticisms  Some have criticized the terminology as a rhetoric more than reality, given that the success in mission is less in converting Europeans and North Americans, but in leading immigrant church populations in these lands. Others have noted that the language arose alongside the decolonization of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and has been used to emphasize the shift of power from the West to the majority world. An alternative paradigm has been suggested in terms of return mission, whereby diasporic Christians in Europe and North America return to evangelize the lands of their ancestral origins, especially in Africa and Asia.

Early life Dickerman was born on January 4, 1846 in Mount Carmel, Connecticut. He was the ninth and youngest child of son of Ezra Dickerman (1800–1860) and Sarah (née Jones) Dickerman (1806–1890). Among his siblings were brothers George Sherwood, Henry Street and Ezra Day Dickerman. He was educated at Williston Seminary, a prep school established in 1841 in Easthampton, Massachusetts. Career Watson Dickerson Dickerman began his finance and banking career as a young employee and trainee of Jacob Bunn in the J. Bunn Bank of Springfield, Illinois before coming to New York City in 1868 and joining the Open Board of Brokers, which was consolidated with the New York Stock Exchange in 1869. On June 15, 1870, he formed the stock brokerage firm of Dominick & Dickerman with Chicago-born William Gayer Dominick. Dominick had purchased membership on the New York Stock Exchange in 1869 where he met Dickerman. Dominick's brothers, George and Bayard Dominick, also joined the Exchange and became partners in the firm. In 1889, the firm opened its first branch in Cincinnati where it was one of only two exchange members. From 1889 to 1891, Dickerson was Receiver of the Norfolk Southern Railway, until its reorganization in 1891 when he began serving as its president from 1891 to 1899. He also served as a director of the Long Island Loan & Trust Company. In 1890, Dickerman left his firm when he was elected to succeed William L. Bull as president of the New York Stock Exchange. He served as president of the Exchange from 1890 to 1892, after which Frank K. Sturgis became president and he was again elected a Governor of the Exchange. In 1892, Dickerman returned to the firm and three years later, his co-founder William Dominick died of typhoid fever in 1895. In 1899, William C. Sheldon & Co. and Dickerman's firm provided financing for an iron and steel corporate combine called Republic Iron & Steel Company, which absorbed the Springfield Iron Company run by John Whitfield Bunn, brother of Dickerman's Springfield mentor. Both brothers had been personal friends of Abraham Lincoln.Henry Hall (ed.), America's Successful Men of Affairs: An Encyclopedia of Contemporaneous Biography, Vol. 1 P. 192 (New York Tribune: 1895-1896). Dickerman retired from active business life in 1909. He also served as president of the New York Zoological Society, where he served on the board of managers for fifteen years and was a member of the Executive Committee. He was also a member of the Metropolitan Club, the Union Club, the Century Association, and the Brook and Riding Clubs. Personal life On February 18, 1869, Dickerman was married to Martha Elizabeth Swift (1847–1908), a daughter of Samuel Swift and Mary (née Phelps) Swift of Brooklyn. Together, they were the parents of: * Watson Bradley Dickerman (1871–1873), who died young. After the death of his first wife, he remarried to Florence Elaine Calkin at the Grace Church chantry on April 12, 1917. Florence was a daughter of Freeman Brant Calkin of Yonkers, and according to their New York Times wedding announcement, \\"Dickerman is many years the senior of his wife.\\" Together, Watson and Florence were the parents of: * Watson Bradley Dickerman Jr. (1918–1955), a Harvard graduate who became an assistant vice president at J.P. Morgan & Co. before his death at age 37 in 1955. He married Mary McBurney Philbin, a granddaughter of the New York County District Attorney Eugene A. Philbin. Her sister was the first wife of journalist and political activist Blair Clark. After his retirement in 1909, he devoted his time to breeding \\"trotting horses and Guernsey cattle\\" at Hillandale Farm, his country place on Weaver Street, Quaker Ridge in Scarsdale, New York. He first bought the property in 1884 and over the years, added to it until it reached nearly 500 acres in Mamaroneck and New Rochelle. Dickerman died at 998 Fifth Avenue, his home on Manhattan's Upper East Side (an Italian Renaissance Palazzo-style luxury cooperative building designed by McKim, Mead & White and built by James T. Lee), on April 5, 1923. His funeral was held at Grace Episcopal Church in New York. After leaving $20,000 each to the New York Zoological Society and the Home for Incurables, the remainder of his roughly $5,000,000 estate was left to his widow and surviving son. The inheritance tax was $274,153, \\"the largest inheritance tax levied upon a Westchester estate in many months.\\" Two codicils revoked bequests made totaling more than $500,000 to relatives and charity. His son died in 1955 and his widow died in 1963.

During her college years, she used to recall her favorite Korean authors and write literary pieces as if she were one of those writers.Kim, Su-yeong and Seungsuk Yeom. “A 20-Something Author Who Cannot Be ‘Not Embarrassed’ Creates Reality out of Fantasy: Yeom Seungsuk’s Chaepeullin, chaepeullin.” Channel Yes. http://ch.yes24.com/Article/View/18024. Then, during her days of literary practice, she used to carry a Korean dictionary with her and memorize words as if she were studying a foreign language, or sometimes she used to invent her own words. Before her formal literary debut, Yeom had already won several literary awards from her own college, which made her professors call her yeomjak (Author Yeom).Jeong, Han-a. “Act Two: Scene Three.” In Segyeui Munhak, 2010 Fall Issue, 298–299. Two literary debuts She made her literary debut in 2005 by publishing a short story entitled “Baemkkoriwangjwi” (뱀꼬리왕쥐 The Big Rat with a Snake’s Tail), followed by the short story collections Chaepeullin, chaepeullin (채플린, 채플린 Chaplin, Chaplin) (2008) and Noweeomaen (노웨어맨 Nowhere Man) (2011) as well as the novel Eotteon naraneun neomu keuda (어떤 나라는 너무 크다 Some Countries are Just Too Big) (2013).Gwon, Yeong-min. “Yeom Seungsuk.” In Encyclopedia of Contemporary Korean Literature. Seoul National University Press, 2004. https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=2075556&cid;=41708&categoryId;=41737. In 2017, she also had her debut as a literary critic.Yeom, Seungsuk. “Winner of 2017 Kyunghyang Daily News New Writer's Award (Literary Criticism Category) – No Future and the Speed of an Excavator: Criticism on Time of a City by Park Sol-moe.” Kyunghyang Shinmun, January 2, 2017. http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201701022130005&code;=960100. According to Yeom, she gradually came to write literary criticisms because she continued to read works of other authors and asked herself questions as a reader.Yeom, Seungsuk and GON. “[A Talk between Yeom Seungsuk and the Editor] We Are Together, Today and Tomorrow: Yeogie eopdorok haja.” Munhakdongne Naver Café, August 6, 2018. https://cafe.naver.com/mhdn/141965. Her debut work “Eomneun miraewa gulchakgiui sokdo-baksolmoe 《dosiui sigan》ron” (없는 미래와 굴착기의 속도-박솔뫼 《도시의 시간》론 No Future and the Speed of an Excavator: Criticism on Time of a City by Park Sol-moe) received positive critical reviews for its firm critical consciousness of and serious interest in issues facing younger generations of Koreans who cannot expect any stable future.Gwon, Seong-u and Yeong-in Seo. “Judge’s Comment on 2017 Kyunghyang Daily News New Writer's Award (Literary Criticism Category): We Can Identify with Her Serious Critical Consciousness and the Process of Understanding the Age.” Kyunghyang Shinmun, January 2, 2017. http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201701022127015&code;=960100#csidxa4d3235b7e350c3b012678c6d4ecac4. Other activities Yeom Seungsuk has also been actively engaged in diverse fields outside the literary world of writing novels and criticisms. To begin with, she attended graduate school and studied Korean literature, receiving a master’s degree for her study on post-Korean War writings of author Han Moo- sook.Yeom Seungsuk. “A Study on the Post-Korean War Writings of Author Han Moo-sook.” Master’s thesis, Dongguk University, 2009. http://www.riss.kr/search/detail/DetailView.do?p_mat_type=be54d9b8bc7cdb09&control;_no=e3146dbcf0bc4c03ffe0bdc3ef48d419. Since 2017, she has been hosting a podcast show entitled Table Talk by Novelists Yeom Seungsuk and Yun Ko Eun (소설 쓰는 윤고은, 염승숙의 테이블).Table Talk by Novelists Yeom Seungsuk and Yun Ko Eun (소설 쓰는 윤고은, 염승숙의 테이블), a podcast show hosted by Yeom Seungsuk and Yun Ko Eun, is available for free on the following podbbang website: http://www.podbbang.com/ch/16989. Yeom says that she launched this podcast show because she wanted to communicate with aspiring writers and readers about novel writing as she used to have lots of concerns about how to write a novel before becoming an author herself.Kim, Hyeon-jin. “’Writing a novel is about not feeling lonely and caring for each other’: Novelists Yun Ko Eun and Yeom Seungsuk.” Seoul Economic Daily, August 22, 2018. https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/1S3GLH0WKH.  Writing  Yeom Seungsuk’s novels are characterized by fantastical narratives that unfold situations that are impossible in ordinary realities. Yet, the fantasies in her novels are not that far removed from our realities. In Yeom’s novels, fantasy and reality coexist without discomfort, their boundaries ambiguous. For this reason, it is almost impossible to clearly distinguish fantasy and reality in her novelistic spaces. Through such novelistic strategies, the author asks a fundamental question about human existence, including Who am I? Do I really exist here and now? If so, how can I prove this? If Yeom’s novels contain any truth, it will be the fact that we cannot be certain about any truth at all. By immersing themselves in her stories that are amalgamations of fantasy and reality, readers come to ask themselves about what kind of world we live in and who we are as beings living in such a world.Kim, Gyeong-yeon and Yeom Seungsuk. “Meeting the World of Warm Jokes.” In Korean Critical Review, 2010 Issue, 216–218. Short story collections The characters in Chaepeullin, chaepeullin (2008) are all nobodies, with almost no presence. They have ordinary jobs, for instance, as a public servant working at a city hall, a real estate agent, and a physical therapist. They lead an oppressed existence burdened by repetitive daily routines. Then one day, strange, fantastical things happen to them: They come across a big rat with the tail of a snake, which pursues human tailbones, their teeth are replaced by the bones of an iguanodon, and a strange plague, which paralyzes one’s body fixed in a slanting position, breaks out. These bizarre circumstances provide them with opportunities to restore identities that were gradually lost in familiar daily routines.Choi, Hyeon-mi. “’Life’ Is the Destination of Our Fantasy: Yeom Seungsuk’s Debut Novel Chaepeullin, chaepeullin.” Munhwa Ilbo, December 18, 2008. http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2008121801032230023003. Similarly, in Noweeomaen (2011), fantastical accidents, such as metamorphosis, the disappearance of a person and the outbreak of an epidemic, occur commonly. However, unlike in Chaepeullin, chaepeullin, the realities facing characters in this novel are much more realistic.According to Yeom Seungsuk, the reason why her works after Chaepeullin, chaepeullin focus more on realities is because she has become more conscious of assessments of her novels. Even though she used fantasies and allegories as a means to talk about realities, Chaepeullin, chaepeullin was evaluated by critics to be “fantastical.” Yeom says that she was embarrassed and made to think hard by such critical responses. Han, Yun-jeong. “’What Social Structure Makes Us Losers?’: Nowhere Man, a Novel by Yeom Seungsuk.” Kyunghyang Shinmun, April 3, 2011. http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201104032106355&code;=960205. Most of them are those excluded from social safety nets, such as a bankrupt debtor, an irregular worker, a person removed from the resident registration. For this characters, who were alienated from a society filled with cutthroat competitions, survival is much more important that moral issues such as truth and lies, the good and the evil. A sense of crisis felt by these individuals on the verge of a devastating end do not stay as their personal experiences but spread to an ever-increasing number of people. In this respect, Yeom’s novels approach the invisible crisis looming from each individual’s daily life and inner self as a common phenomenon occurring throughout the entire society.Jeong, Ju-a. “The Last Listener and the Language of Apocalypse: Yeom Seungsuk’s Nowhere Man (published by Munji in 2011).” In Literature and Society, 2011 Summer Issue, 364–367. Novels Yeom’s critical consciousness of issues in ordinary people’s lives later leads to her satirical novels. In Eotteon naraneun neomu keuda (2013), she creates “Bingo World” consisting of too big a world and too small humans. In Bingo World managed by a large construction firm, people live uniformized lives as equally shaped Bingo pieces. The novel also contains an allegory of political incidents that sent shock waves through Korean society, such as the 2012 NIS public opinion manipulation scandal. Such literary devices effectively satirize the social conditions of this age that constantly shake one’s individual identity.Naver Book: Publisher’s Review. “Eotteon naraneun neomu keuda (2013).” https://book.naver.com/bookdb/publisher_review.nhn?bid=7275847 In Yeogie eopdorok haja (여기에 없도록 하자 Let’s Not Be Here)(2018), adults who do not work turn into hams. Every day, television news reports on “today’s ham” as if it were a weather forecast, with subtitles detailing the information on unidentified hams.Naver Book: Publisher’s Review. “Yeogie eopdorok haja (2018).” https://book.naver.com/bookdb/publisher_review.nhn?bid=13796301. Fearing that they can turn into hams, then dried, twisted and crushed, people are unable to quit their labor even though they experience unfair treatment or get injured. Instead, they desperately continue their labor as if the avoidance of becoming a ham were their life’s goal. In this respect, against the backdrop of such dystopia, Yeom contemplates on what it means for a human to make money and sustain their living in this capitalist society while asking how humans should exist in this world that defies any predictions on the future.Jo, Yun-gyeong. “’Those Who Work Only to Survive . . .

He started his youth career in Sandefjord club Store Bergan IL and played for Teie IF; though his transfer to Eik-Tønsberg was reported in 1985 he remained in Teie throughout the decade. In Sandefjord BK he scored several goals. In the 1993 Norwegian Football Cup first round he converted a penalty kick to secure a 3–2 lead against Fredrikstad FK. However, he was too late in returning to his own goal, so Fredrikstad equalised right away. After Sandefjord eventually won, they eventually faced first-tier team Kongsvinger IL. Here, Gulliksen scored the only goal of the match. In 1996 Gulliksen made his debut in the Eliteserien for Strømsgodset IF, playing 6 league matches. This season Strømsgodset encountered a number of goalkeeper problems, heavily stricken by injuries, the team used both Roar Gulliksen, Glenn Arne Hansen, Pål Henning Albertsen, Per Øyvind Dahl, Tom Nilsen and Jon Knudsen.

When awake, Angela finds herself connected to a long tube that enters a locked room that she believes Will is in. After Bian gives a strange psychological test to Angela, Trieu explains that Bian is a clone of her dead mother, and she has been providing Bian's own memories to her. With Trieu preparing to activate the Millennium Clock within hours, Angela breaks into the locked room, only to find her tube connect to an unconscious elephant. She rips out her tube and takes an elevator to a higher floor to find a globe device that plays back the messages that people had left at the Manhattan booths. Trieu enters, explaining that she has heard these, and confirms Doctor Manhattan is not on Mars, but actually in Tulsa disguised as a human. Trieu is aware of a Kavalry plot to capture and destroy Manhattan so that they can become like him, and her activation of the Clock within the hour will save humanity. Angela storms out and escapes the facility. Cal finds her at home rummaging for a hammer.

Production Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was not only cast to play Cal, but was considered for how he would play Doctor Manhattan as well. \\"An Almost Religious Awe\\" reveals that Angela's husband Cal (played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) was the human identity that Doctor Manhattan had taken and that Angela knew of this. According to showrunner Damon Lindelof, they had developed the show with Angela as the central character, and only reused characters from the limited series comic when they would help advance Angela's story. When they considered how they could bring Doctor Manhattan back, they quickly settled that he could serve as a facet of love in Angela's life, creating the character of Cal. When casting for Cal, the showrunners were looking for qualities needed for both Cal and Manhattan, though did not tell those auditioning about the latter. Lindelof had been impressed with Abdul-Mateen's performance in The Handmaid's Tale and felt he could play the role of Cal who knew something was \\"off\\" about his identity. Additionally, there was good chemistry between Abdul-Mateen's and Regina King, who plays Angela. Abdul-Mateen himself said that the role of Cal only hinted towards a \\"promising future\\", and had accepted the part of Cal for an opportunity to work with Lindelof. Lindelof subsequently told Abdul-Mateen of his dual role sometime between the filming of the second and third episodes. King herself was not told until after she had read scripts for the third and fourth episode of the series and questioned how Cal's behavior was scripted to Lindelof. Television critics found several clues layered in previous episodes that pointed to this revelation, including Cal's own dialog mimicking what Manhattan might say and Laurie's own feelings about Cal. Lindelof pointed to the Easter egg that Laurie's vibrator shown in \\"She Was Killed by Space Junk\\" was named \\"Excalibur\\" by its creator Daniel Dreiberg, as revealed on the supplementary material website \\"Peteypedia\\". The name is a play on the phrase \\"Ex-Cal Abar\\" which describes Laurie's relationship to Manhattan at this point in time. The episode's title is taken from Manhattan's own recollections in the original comic book series, describing the reaction of the Vietnamese soldiers that surrendered to him when America won the Vietnam War in the Watchmen alternate history.Watchmen Ch. 4, p. 20, topmost right panel.

He was a prolific writer, having written 26 full-length novels and over 100 novellas and short stories.The 100 Years of Modern Literature Study Series Publishing Committee. Literary History through Brief Biographies. Somyeong, 2008. http://www.krpia.co.kr/viewer/open?plctId=PLCT00005191&nodeId;=NODE03755201#none. His early works were mostly devoted to social issues, but the majority of his works since the 1960s are historical novels. Unlike conventional historical novels that focus on entertainment, his novels feature profound historical perspectives.Doosan Encyclopedia. “Yoo Juhyun.” https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1132773&cid;=40942&categoryId;=33385. His representative work Joseonchongdokbu (조선총독부 Joseon Government-General) (1964–1967) has received critical attention for its realistic depiction of the Korean people’s sufferings during the 36 years of Japanese colonial rule. Biography  Yoo was born in 1921. At the age of 15, he moved to Seoul all by himself without any specific goals other than making money. There, he came across his sixth-grade homeroom teacher, who helped him dream of becoming a writer. The teacher landed him a job at a business run by one of his relatives, praising Yoo’s writing capability. In particular, Yoo’s teacher encouraged him by saying that he would someday become a literary great like Yi Kwang-su, which Yoo kept in his heart.Kim, Yong-seong. “A Contemplative Journey within Life’s Reality That Sheds Light on ‘I’.” Hankook Ilbo, November 16, 1982. In February 1939, he moved to Tokyo, Japan, where he attended the Liberal Arts Department of Waseda University. After returning from Japan, he began writing novels while working as a schoolteacher. He made his formal literary debut on October 1, 1948, by publishing “Beonyoui geori” (번요의 거리 Bustling Streets). In 1950, as soon as he published “Gunsang” (군상 The Crowd), the Korean War broke out. When South Korean forces recaptured Seoul, Yoo became an editor for the Education and Information Division of the Ministry of National Defense. Afterward, he relocated to Daegu and became a member of the Republic of Korea Air Force Military Writers Corps, where he began his literary activities in earnest. For two decades, from 1952 to 1973, he served as an editor for the Sintaeyang magazine. In 1954, he returned to his family in Seoul. Here, he produced a number of works, including “Taeyangui yusan” (태양의 유산 The Heritage of the Sun) (1958) and received an Asian Liberation Literary Award (아세아자유문학상) (1958). He continued to pursue his literary ambition actively and was awarded numerous prizes, including a Korea Book Award (1968) and a Korea Culture and Art Award (1976). In 1970, he became a member of the Central Committee for the Korean Chapter of the International P.E.N. Club and a board member of the Korean Writers’ Association. In 1974, he was appointed as the first chairman of the Korean Novelists’ Association. Later he suffered from spinal fractures. On May 26, 1982, he passed away due to osteomyelitis and other complications.  Writings   Early works  Yoo Juhyun published his first novel in the late 1940s. Until the 1950s, his novelistic themes revolved around the gap between “I” and society. His early works are mostly short stories. Their settings are either the ruined reality of the postwar world or the absurd and insecure society. In particular, in his autobiographical debut novel “Beonyoui geori,” the main character Hyeong-sik moonlights as a book seller to earn his tuition fees and living expenses. At one point in the novel, a female college student, whom Hyeong-sik has feelings for, gives alms to the poor, in fact, to avoid getting bad luck. This story is the author’s satire of hollow humans seeking their own good fortune.Jang, Mun- pyeong. “The Fun of Bitter Satire: Jangssi Ilga by Yu Juhyun.” Beomumungo, 1977. http://www.mooksa.pe.kr/admin/bookdata/bookopen/ListingbookContent_1.asp?BoardName=TblMaster1_167&book;_title=신랄한 풍자의 재미&bookPage;=1. In this respect, Yoo’s novels from this period focus, as a crucial theme, on the imbalance of human existence caused by social absurdity and insecurity.Hong, Gi-sam. “About Yu Juhyun” In The Anthology of Representative Korean Literature Vol. 9. Samjungdang, 1970. http://www.mooksa.pe.kr/admin/bookdata/bookopen/ListingbookContent_1.asp?BoardName=TblMaster1_153&book;_title=류주현론&bookPage;=1.  Middle works  The second term of his literary career is thought to have begun with the publication of “Jangssi Ilga” (장씨 일가 The Jang Family). In this short story, the author fiercely criticizes the corrupt and depraved society through a father, a member of the National Assembly during the later days of the rule of the Liberation Party, and his son, a colonel in the reserve. During this period, he also began writing full-length novels in earnest. One representative work is Joseonchongdokbu (1964–1967),Joseonchongdokbu have been republished several times since the first publication in 1967. The most recent edition is Joseonchongdokbu Vol. 1-3 by the publisher Nanam. https://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=7851515. an epic novel set during the Japanese colonial period, which provides an accurate description of history while shedding light on the history of Korea in a three-dimensional way through the appearance of more than 2,000 characters. This epic novel realistically depicts the tyranny and exploitation of the Japanese colonial rule, by focusing on the Residency-General and Government-General, two organizations set up by the Japanese for colonial aggression. Furthermore, the work reveals the fierce struggles of Korean independence fighters and the horrible everyday reality of Koreans. A representative work of Yoo Juhyun, Joseonchongdokbu has received positive critical reviews.  Later works  After the 1970s, the literary world of Yoo Juhyun undergoes transformation to contemplate the destiny of “I” from a truth-seeker’s perspective. The focus of his later works shifts from the attention to the external, represented by social and historical consciousness, to the internal world of an individual, the fantastic and the mysterious, death and afterlife. Among these works, “Sinui nunchori” (신의 눈초리 God’s Gaze) deals with a psychological conflict between a father, a former psychiatrist-turned stroke patient, and a son, a businessman who runs a wig export business. The novel thoroughly illustrates the internal volition of the father and the worldly conflict of the son who is obsessed with external desires. In this respect, the works listed in Jugeumi boineun angyeong (죽음이 보이는 안경 Glasses That Can See Death) (1977), which he wrote while fighting his illness, are a testament to his inquiry into the self in his later literary world.

Mundt and Richard M. Nixon. History Background U.S. Representative Karl E. Mundt (undated) supported the Mundt Bill while serving on HUAC In early 1948, US Representatives Mundt and Nixon began formulating an anti-communist bill, formally House Resolution 5852, Subversive Activities Control Act of 1948, which passed the House in May 1948. Activities On June 1, 1948, Henry A. Wallace supporters visibly \\"took command\\" of a march on Washington to stop the Mundt-Nixon Bill from passing the Senate. Former congressional representative Jerry J. O'Connell became chairman of a \\"Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill.\\" The committee claimed that more than 5,000 would march on Washington on June 2. In early June 1948, the bill died in the US Senate as the 1948 United States presidential election season commenced with conventions. (See Mundt- Nixon Bill.) The group continued existence long enough to face the next iteration of the Mundt-Nixon Bill, namely the Mundt–Ferguson Communist Registration Bill AKA the \\"Mundt-Ferguson Bill.\\" It is unclear when exactly the group dissolved. During hearings in 1955, O'Connell indicated that NCDMB ended when Congress overruled President Truman's veto of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, more commonly known as the McCarran Internal Security Act, i.e., September 22, 1950. HUAC's annual report for 1950 cited an unspecified date in September 1950. HUAC report U.S. Representative Richard M. Nixon (1950) supported the Mundt Bill while serving on HUAC On December 7, 1950, HUAC issued a 15-page Report on National Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill: A Communist Lobby. At that time, HUAC's senior investigator was Louis J. Russell and director of research Benjamin Mandel. HUAC had successfully subpoenaed months of Western Union telegrams and telephone records between the committee and the National Lawyers Guild and tied both organizations to the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and numerous Communist front organizations. HUAC also cited testimony from FBI undercover agent Matthew Cvetic. The report concluded: > The Committee on Un-American Activities is unanimous in its belief that the > National Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill was organized not as a > legitimate lobbying enterprise, but rather as a propaganda adjunct of the > Communist Party. The work of this organization, in many instances, was > performed by the Communist Party, and it was at all times wholly supported > by the Communist Party. (Note: The report states its \\"belief.\\") Organization A number of NCDMB supporters also supported US Vice President Henry A. Wallace and his Progressive Party including Leo Isaacson, Arthur Miller, Louis Untermeyer, and Mark Van Doren (listed under \\"sponsors\\" below). Structure US Representative Leo Isacson (here, 1947) was an NCDMB member The NCDMB has the following sub-organizations: * Chicago Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill * Freedom House Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill (Miami) * New York Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill * San Francisco Committee to Oppose the Mundt- Ferguson Bill * Santa Cruz Citizens Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill * Delaware Committee to Defeat the Mundt bill * Philadelphia Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill * New Jersey Citizens Committee Against the Mundt Bill * Colorado Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill Major financial contributors to NCDMB included: * Mrs. Luke I.

All crimes were committed in Contra Costa County, in the San Francisco Bay Area. His exposure occurred only a few years after his death, based on results from DNA profiling. Jackson is suspected of committing several more murders during the 1970s and 1980s around the Contra Costa area, in which at least 5 other serial killers also operated in that time frame.  Early years  Charles Jackson, Jr. was born on February 12, 1937 in Louisiana. Shortly after birth, his family moved to Mississippi, where young Charles grew up in the countryside. He lived in a socially disadvantageous environment, as his father was an alcoholic who was aggressive towards him and other family members. Due to material difficulties, Jackson dropped out of high school in the early 1950s and started spending a lot of time on the street. He became involved with the criminal subcultures, and soon delved into crime himself.  Criminal career  In 1953, at the age of 16, Jackson was first arrested and charged with theft. Subsequently, over the next 28 years, he was repeatedly arrested on charges of committing crimes such as burglary, rape, assault and molestation of minors (dates include March 2, 1962; January 11, 1965; May 15, 1967; October 1969; June 9, 1970; August 21, 1975 and May 22, 1978). The last time he was released was on September 12, 1981, after which he started work as a day laborer for some time, as well as doing other odd jobs. On January 2, 1982, Jackson attacked Joan Stewart, raping, strangling and stabbing her several times in the woodlands near Montclair. During the investigation, several eyewitnesses to the crime were found who wrote down the license plate on Jackson's car, on the basis of which he was arrested on three days later, and charged with Stewart's murder. In 1983, he was found guilty and received a sentence of life imprisonment as punishment.  Implication in other killings  Charles Jackson spent the rest of his life in the Folsom State Prison, where he died in February 2002 from a heart attack. A month after his death, DNA testing of biological samples from him were carried out on samples found on the bodies of various women and girls, killed throughout Contra Costa County during the 1970s and 1980s. In 2005, based on results from the DNA research, Jackson's involvement was revealed in the following murders: Sonya Higginbotham (19), killed in June 1975 in Auckland; Ann Johnson (27), killed in August of that same year in Montclair; Cynthia Waxman (11), killed on April 22, 1978 in Moraga; Henry Villa (62) and his wife Edith (59), killed on November 22, 1981 in Albany Hill; Betty Grantzweig (37), killed on December 4, 1982 in Oakland; and finally, Gail Slocum (34), killed on December 8th of that year, also in Oakland. All of the women had been raped and strangled. Jackson's true victim count is currently unknown, since there were at least five other serial killers in the Contra Costa area during his murder spree.

Written while she was staying in the Hamheung region as the wife of an assistant magistrate of the same region, it depicts her trip to a beach near Hamheung known as Dongmyeong (東溟) and her experience of watching a moonrise and a sunrise there. This travelogue appears in Uiyudang gwanbuk yuram ilgi (의유당관북유람일기 The Diary of Uiyudang's Journey to the Gwanbuk Region), which she wrote after travelling around the Hamheung region.  Authorship  Uiyudang's mother was the daughter of Yeo Pil-yong (呂必容), and her father was Nam Jik-gwan (南直寬), the son of Nam Do-gyu (南道揆) who served as daesagwan (chief historiographer), a high-ranking official, during the reign of King Sukjong. Uiyudang was also the wife of Sin Dae-son (申大孫, 1728–1788), the 8th lineal descendant of General Sin Rip (申砬). Moreover, The sister of Uiyudang's husband married Hong In-han (洪麟漢), the uncle of Lady Hyegyeonggung Hong (later Queen Heongyeong), and her elder sister's husband was Kim Si-muk (金時默), the father of Queen Hyoui, the wife of King Jeongju. As such, Uiyudang was from the most prestigious family at the time. According to her another work Uiyudangyugo (의유당유고 The Posthumous Writings of Uiyudang), she lost all but one of her 12 children. It seems that when she was younger, she followed her husband to northern and southern regions of Korea, but led a lonely life after her husband and most of her children had passed away. While she was spending her later years in Samcheong-dong, Seoul, her niece Queen Hyoui took care of her, regularly sending her food and clothing. Uiyundang's major literary works are Uiyudang gwanbuk yuram ilgi and Uiyudangyugo. In addition to Dongmyeong ilgi, Uiyudang gwanbuk yuram ilgi contains \\"Nangminu\\" (낙민루 Nangminu Pavilion), a travelogue of the Nangminu Pavilion, a well-known attraction in the Hamheungbu region; \\"Buksannu\\" (북산루 Buksannu Pavilion), a travelogue of the Buksannu and Seomunnu Pavilions; \\"Chunilsoheung\\" (춘일소흥 A Little Joy on A Spring Day), a Korean-script collection of other people's anecdotes; and her Korean translation of \\"Yeongmyeongsa deugwollu sangnyangmun\\" (영명사득월루상량문 The Foundation Story of Deugwollu Pavilion at Yeongmyeongsa Temple). Among these literary works, \\"Chunilsoheung\\" and \\"Yeongmyeongsa deugwollu sangnyangmun\\" are not either her original stories or related to her travel around the Gwanbuk region, but since they are part of the Uiyudang gwanbuk yuram ilgi, they are presumed to be her own translations. On the other hand, Uiyudangyugo contains three Chinese-script essays, including \\"Baengnyeonbongseo\\" (백년봉서 A Writing on Baengnyeonbong Peak); 17 Chinese poems, including \\"Chungyeong\\" (춘경 A Scenery on a Spring Day); and three Korean-script essays, including Gieoyuson (기어유손 My Story of Living with a Young Grandson).  Plot  In 1769, Uiyudang moves to Hamheung with her husband after his appointment as an official in the region. She is told that the moonrise and sunrise in Dongmyeong are worth seeing, but is unable to watch them due to her husband's objection and the fact that Dongmyeong is 50 ri away from Hamheung. Two years later, she receives permission from her husband and visits Dongmyeong. However, when she climbs up to the Gwigyeongdae Cliff (龜景臺), she is unable to see a sunrise due to a cloudy weather. Uiyudang begs her husband again, and in 1772, accompanied by her husband, woman entertainers, and servants, she takes a trip to Dongmyeong once again to see a moonrise and a sunrise. After arriving at her destination, she first enjoys boating, and then when the dusk is falling, she climbs up to the Gwigyeongdae Cliff. There, waiting for a moonrise, she enjoys listening to \\"Gwandong byeolgok\\" (Song of Gwandong) sung by a woman entertainer before finally watching a moonrise. After staying up all night to see a sunrise, Uiyudang climbs up to the Gwigyeongdae Cliff once again and waits for it. However, women entertainers feel sorry for her, thinking that she won't be able to see a sunrise due to a cloudy weather. Uiyudang is also worried about it, but the sun looms above the horizon, and she describes the scene in great detail. After having breakfast, she tours around the Bongung House, the former residence of King Taejo of Joseon. She expresses gratitude for royal blessings and dedicates a piece of writing.  Features and Significance  Uiyudang gwanbuk yuram ilgi is significant in that it is a unique travelogue of the Gwanbuk region, the northern border area of Joseon, written by a Joseon noblewoman who was barely allowed to leave home. In this regard, it is comparable with gihaeng gasa (prose poetry on travel) written by noblewomen. Dongmyeong ilgi, in particular, is considered an essay masterpiece as it provides a detailed observation of the emotions and behavior of people waiting for a sunrise, while illustrating the awe of this natural phenomenon with fresh words and dramatic expressions.  Other  Considered a masterly Korean-script essay featuring aesthetic descriptions, Dongmyeong ilgi has been appearing in high school Korean language and literature textbooks.  Text  Uiyudang gwanbuk yuram ilgi was rediscovered by Garam Lee Byeong-gi in the 20th century. The title of this travelogue appears in the Yeongyeongdang eonmunchaek mongnok (연경당언문책목록 The List of Korean-Script Books Housed at Yeongyeongdang Residence), indicating that the book was part of the royal collection of the Joseon Dynasty. The original manuscript of the book has not survived to the present day. However, a printed edition created by Garam Lee Byeong-gi and a printed copy appearing in Joseon yeokdae yeoryu munjim (조선역대여류문집 A Collection of Writings by Joseon Women) are available today.

This memoir consists of a preface, which states the purpose of her writing; a body that depicts her childhood as well as her husband’s fight against illness and death; an epilogue written after the death of her father and her young brother (whom she adopted as her own son); funeral orations written by relatives after her husband’s death; and her elder sister’s afterword on transcribing the book. Among these, the preface and body were written in 1792; the epilogue, in 1805. For other sections of the book, it is unclear when they were written.  Authorship  Lady Jo of Pungyang was born as the second daughter of Jo Gam (趙𣊟, 1744–1804) and Lady Ha of Jinju (晋州河氏), a daughter of Ha Myeong-sang (河命祥), and she married Kim Gi-hwa (金基和, 1772–1791). The Jo clan of Pungyang was a prestigious clan during the late Joseon Dynasty. However, her paternal grandfather was a concubine’s son, and her father Jo Gam passed a high-level military examination and served as a district magistrate. Her husband Kim Gi- hwa’s great grandfather passed a high-level military examination and served as a district magistrate, but his grandfather and father did not hold civil posts. Thus, the clans of her father and mother were both military clans who had lived in Seoul for generations. As of Lady Jo, there is nothing known about her, except for what is written in her memoir.  Plot  Jagirok describes the author’s own childhood; her marriage and the illness and death of her husband; and her life afterward. Regarding her childhood, even though she mentions her father and elder sister, she mostly talks about her mother. She depicts in great detail how her mother had become weak after a series of childbirths and eventually passed away as a result. Her childhood story is followed by the story of her marriage, mostly the illness and death of her husband Kim Gi-hwa, who was of the same age with her. She illustrates the cause of his illness, his suffering and treatment, the aggravation of his illness, her attempt to prick herself and shed blood, her suicidal thoughts, her husband’s funeral, and her life afterward.  Features and significance  Jagirok is significant in that it is a rare autobiography of a traditional Korean woman. Even though her stories mostly revolve around her family (e.g. mother and husband) rather than “I,” she reflects on herself through her relationships with other family members. In this regard, Jagirok is comparable with proses that record a woman’s life, such as Hanjungnok (閑中錄 A Record of Sorrowful Days), and gasa (a type of poetry popular during the Joseon Dynasty) that relates women’s lives. This memoir has a unique woman’s voice that is not present in biographies of exemplary women written in the late Joseon period. At the time, many male authors wrote about devoted women who hurt their body to save their husbands in times of crisis or who killed themselves following the deaths of their husbands. However, these works did not reflect women’s own positions. Jagirok is an important work of literature as it clearly shows a woman’s voice. Furthermore, Jagirok serves as historical records of aristocratic family culture in Seoul during the late 18th century. The narration of her life stories naturally reveals the culture of the time, such as the marriage customs of aristocratic families and how people treated illness. In particular, this memoir provides detailed accounts of her husband’s illness and treatment, thereby serving as a clinical report.  Other  The Korean drama Saimdang, Memoir of Colors was inspired by Jagirok.  Texts  The only surviving transcribed copy of Jagirok is housed in the National Library of Korea. It is presumed that this is not the original manuscript written by Lady Jo of Pungyang but a copy transcribed by her elder sister. It was first introduced to academia in 2001 by Korean classical literature scholar Park Ok-ju.  References   Further reading  * Lady Jo of Pungyang. Memoirs of Lady Jo of Pungyang.

The ores of the Chilean Iron Belt formed in separate pulses in the Cretaceous period as result of magmatic and hydrothermal processes. At least part of the iron oxide-apatite rock originated from molten iron in the form of lava, tephra. and intrusions.

Inducted in 2017 to the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) Hall of Fame he was for the latter half of the 20th century an African American voice in Miami, Florida, having taken over his fathers duties as publisher after WWII. Early Life Reeves was born in Nassau, Bahamas to Rachel Cooper and Henry Ethelbert Sigismund Reeves. The family immigrated to the United States and he grew up in Miami’s Overtown and Liberty City from when he was just 4 months old. His memories of the overt racism he and others faced helped to shape the activist he became during the Civil Rights Era. The only job he ever had other than his stint in the segregated ARMY during WWII was at the one sheet tabloid for the black community started by his father in 1923. He worked at the paper from high school until his retirement in 1994. Reeves graduated from Florida A&M; University, a HBCU, before enlisting. Recalling his time in the Boy Scouts in Jim Crow 1935, he articulated not being able to advance in the Scouts, due to the lack of facilities for blacks to take swimming lessons or take the practical tests for the required badges. There were no public pools for blacks in the south at the time and public beaches were restricted. He and his friends sold newspapers and candy to raise funds for a sleep-away scouting jamboree for blacks in Jacksonville. After returning from Europe at the end of World War II and encountering racism at home he became dispirited, giving his mother a list of places other than Miami he felt were more accommodating to African-Americans . The Miami Times Reeves had returned to Miami in 1946, his father Henry E. Sigismund Reeves was running The Miami Times which was a 'race' tabloid, catering to the black community. A strict disciplinarian and teetotaler, the Episcopalian church elder Reeves was cast in the mold of an old-fashioned leader. His paper was printed on a hand press in single pages in a room set aside for it. Henry opposed the bus boycotts the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was promoting to fight for civil rights in Montgomery, Alabama. He disapproved of Bus boycotts for Miami in his column as they placed church people in jeopardy. His son was on the opposing spectrum, having fought for freedom in Europe and not being as patient with the Jim Crow policies of the south. Garth held every job at one time or the other at the paper and the energy he devoted drove the Times to grow during the 50s and 60s. Reeves fought against laws upholding segregation with acts of civil disobedience. In 1949, blacks were not allowed to play at the public golf courses during the week, but were allowed on Monday, the one day the sprinklers were on. Garth brought friends to play on a Wednesday. He and his friends filed suit for access to the fairways, basing their claim on taxes paid in upkeep and maintenance of the courses. Their suit was successful after a court case that lasted seven years. This led to the desegregation of the Miami Springs golf course in 1959. While not subscribing to the non- violence philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr. during the run up to the March on Washington; he reported on the movement in the periodical faithfully. Fighting against inequality was his passion which he pursued with his pen using the Times as his platform. ‘CONSCIENCE OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY’ is how his editorials were described, he consistently used very different wording than other papers to describe the riots that swept into Florida after police shootings, calling them 'protests' instead, as Reeves later described The Miami Times’ editorial policy in a 1999 interview.https://www.sun- sentinel.com/local/miami-dade/fl-ne-mh-garth-reeves-obit-20191126-mfv5xfqp... Reeves called the conflagrations “rebellion” and “protests” in The Miami Times as he believed they spoke to the community’s frustration after years of continuing police brutality. He even called for the removal of politicians and imbued social causes and candidates with his imprimatur. “For many, the Miami Times became the conscience of the black community,” Dorothy Jenkins Fields, the founder of the Black Archives, History and Research Foundation of South Florida, wrote. “He was not afraid and he was not intimidated. He was dedicated to uplifting the race and he was not afraid to throw rocks and hide his hands to get the power structure’s attention to the difficulties and the inequalities of the black community. He dedicated his life to that,” said Fields in a statement. In 1957, Reeves and other black leaders took their tax bills to a meeting with white officials in an effort to integrate Dade County beaches. “We’re law-abiding, tax-paying citizens,” they said, “and we’re going swimming this afternoon at Crandon Park.” When the men arrived at the beach, they were met by angry policemen lining the beachfront, but the black men were eventually unmolested for testing the waters in a brief dip.https://www.miamiandbeaches.com/things-to-do/history-and-heritage/the- history-of-the-miami... “From that day we swam at all the beaches,” Reeves later recounted. Reeves developed his writing voice in the middle of the civil rights era when he ascended to managing editor of The Times. Under his tutelage, the Times pressed the power of the black voter.https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami- dade/article20608311.html He also came to understandings with the white business establishment in the downtown Miami, joining the mostly white Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce in 1968. He also courted various charities like the United Way, the Boy Scouts and other philanthropic endeavors that the downtown clique perceived as the litmus test of civic involvement. He inherited the paper when Henry died in 1970. The paper was the basis of Reeves’ small fortune. He invested the profits in bank stock and real estate, owning a 5 percent share of Miami’s Bayside Marketplace, located in the thriving downtown. Reeves became a life member of the NAACP and founding member of Miami’s Episcopal Church of the Incarnation. His calls to action matched his editorials as printed in the Times. It was he who secured the family ownership of the Times as it evolved into the current digital edition helmed by his grandson, Garth Basil, whom succeeded his daughter, Rachel, who also passed in 2019. She had been the latest publisher of The Miami Times, assuming the mantle of leadership from her father and grandfather in 1994.https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/obituaries/article235066692.html Publisher Emertius He retired from the day to day operation and assumed the mantle of elder statesman, active in civic affairs into his 98th year. In 2017 he was inducted into the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) Hall of Fame. “I have admired the organization since it started. Black journalists and the black press are up against formidable foes and we have to keep fighting and not give up. It makes you feel good when you are recognized by your peers and, being in the business, at 98, I feel good,” he told The Miami Times. “These valiant soldiers without swords not only excelled in their chosen field, they also brought others along with them. We stand on their shoulders,” Sarah Glover, NABJ president at the time, said in announcing the award. City and county leaders in 2017 designated Northwest Sixth Street as Garth C. Reeves Way. In 2019, the City of Miami Commission honored Reeves on the occasion of his 100th birthday. Death After Rachel passed at age 69 in September, 2019, Reeves' health declined. He died of complications from pneumonia two months later, on November 25, at his home in Aventura, Fla. He was 100. See also * Miami Times * Ruth W.

Set between the late 16th and early 17th century in Joseon, Japan, China and Vietnam, the novel depicts a family's diaspora and reunion during the turmoil of wars that swept East Asia. It is a poignant story of how Choe Cheok and Ok-yeong overcome the atrocities of war and reunite.  Authorship and publication  Jo Wi-han (趙緯韓, 1567–1649) published this Chinese-language novel in 1621. He served as an official during the reigns of Prince Gwanghae (r. 1608–1623) and King Injo (r. 1623–1649). He served his tenure while experiencing a series of tumultuous domestic and international historical incidents, including the Japanese Invasions of Korea (1592–1598), the Injo Restoration (1623), and the Qing Invasion of Joseon (1636). Choecheokjeon is said to have been written while he was staying in Namwon as a retiree from public service, after hearing about Choe Cheok's troubled life. Jo was close friends with prominent writers of the time, including Heo Gyun (許筠, 1569–1618) and Gwon Pil (權韠, 1569–1612). It is worth noting that the three writers have published masterful novels in an age when their society was highly critical of novels.  Plot  Choe Cheok is from Namwon, Jeolla-do Province. While studying at one of his father's friend's home, he falls in love with Ok-yeong. When he proposes to her, her parents object to it because he is poor, but Ok-yeong is able to persuade her parents, and they become engaged. However, days before their marriage, the Japanese invade Joseon. Then Choe Cheok joins a righteous army and goes to the front, while Ok-yeong's parents arrange her marriage with a rich guy named Yang-saeng. At this, she tries to persuade her parents but no avail, so she attempts to take her own life by hanging herself, which stops her parents’ insistence on her marriage with Yang-saeng. Choe Cheok and Ok-yeong get married, have their son Mong-seok, and live a happy life together. Soon, however, the Japanese forces invade Namwon, and the family hides in Jirisan Mountain. While Choe Cheok is away from home searching for food, the Japanese come to their shelter and Ok-gyeong is caught and kidnapped by an old Japanese soldier named Don-u. Having lost his family, Choe Cheok experiences a mental breakdown. Then he moves to Ming China, following Yeo Yu-mun (余有文), a Ming dynasty general. In the meantime, Choe Cheok's father and Ok-yeong's mother have survived the war and return home to take care of their grandson Mong- seok. They spend their days missing Choe Cheok and Ok-yeong. Meanwhile, Don-u, who has kidnaped Ok-yeong but takes good care of her, disguises her as a man, and they become merchants sailing around foreign countries on a trade ship, whereas Choe Cheok frequently visits Vietnam on a trade ship with his friend Song-u (宋佑). On one quite night, Choe Cheok plays a bamboo flute at a port in Vietnam. Upon hearing the music, Ok-yeong, aboard a Japanese trade ship, recites a Chinese poem only she and her husband know about. The next day, Choe Cheok visits the Japanese trade ship and reunite with Ok-yeong, and all witnesses around the couple marvel at this miraculous event. Choe Cheok and Ok-yeong return home from China and have their second son Mong-seon, who later marries Hong-do (紅桃), daughter of Jin Wi-gyeong (陳偉慶), a Chinese soldier who was dispatched to Joseon during the Japanese Invasions of Korea. Later when the Later Jin invades the Ming dynasty in China, Choe Cheok is drafted again to the Ming forces, saddening Ok-yeong who fears that her husband may not return home alive. The Ming forces have a great defeat, and Choe Cheok becomes a prisoner of war. In the concentration camp, he miraculously comes across his eldest son Mong-seok, who has joined the Joseon forces (which have entered the war, following the request of Ming China) and become a prisoner of war after the defeat of his forces. With help of a sympathetic Later Jin soldier, Choe Cheok and his son safely escape from the camp, but face trouble because Choe Cheok develops abscesses on his back on the way to Namwon. Then they come across a Ming person named Jin Wi-gyeong who treats Choe Cheok, who soon realizes that Jin is the father of Hong-do, his Chinese daughter-in-law. Together with Jin, Choe Cheok and his son return home, 20 years after leaving Namwon, thereby reuniting with the rest of their family in Joseon. On the other hand, Ok-yeong, who has been separated from Choe Cheok and has left Joseon, prepares for a journey home, upon hearing the rumor that even though the Ming forces have been defeated, many Joseon people have survived and returned home. Ok-yeong and her family are caught by a sea storm during the journey. They are stranded on a deserted island and lose their ship to pirates, but they are soon safely rescued by a Joseon trade ship returning from Vietnam. Ok-yeong, along with Mong-seon and his wife, returns to Namwon, reuniting with Choe Cheok and other family members. Likewise, the Chinese man Jin Wi-Gyeong reunites with his daughter Hong-do in Joseon, and they live happily ever after.  Features and significance  Among seventeenth century Korean novels, Choecheokjeon is regarded as the most realistic representation of society at the time because the work depicted atrocities of war that took place during the period of hegemonic shift in East Asia associated with the Japanese Invasions of Korea, the war between Ming China and the Later Jin, and other wars. The novel is also significant in that it expanded the narrative space from Korea to China, Japan, and Vietnam; that it created an archetype of an active and energetic woman through the protagonist Ok-yeong; and that it has a favorable view of international marriage (e.g. the marriage between Choe Cheok's second son Mong-seon and the Chinese woman Hong-do) and foreigners. Choecheokjeon is a rare work among classical Korean novels as its author and publication date are known despite the conservative vibe of the Joseon society that was critical of novels. Depending on the perspective, the novel is considered a Buddhist novel, a historical novel or romance novel as it combines diverse story elements. Furthermore, the short story Hong-do (紅桃 The Tale of Hong-do) appearing in Eou yadam (於于野談 Eou's Unofficial Histories) written by Yu Mong-in (柳夢寅, 1559–1623) has a plot development similar to that of Choecheokjeon. Likewise, Gimyeongcheoljeon (김영철전 The Tale of Kim Yeong- cheol) written by Hong Se-tae (洪世泰, 1653–1725) is often mentioned along with Choecheokjeon because the former also deals with the issue of war and separated families.  Texts  Five transcribed copies of Choecheokjeon (Seoul National University edition, Korea University edition, Kim Mo edition, and Gan Ho-yun edition), along with one transcribed copy of its Korean translation (Yonsei University edition) and five transcribed copies of the abbreviated versions of the novel, have survived to the present day. Among these, the most well-known is the Seoul National University edition. Its front cover says 奇遇錄, or “record of a bizarre meeting,” and the first inner page says 崔陟傳, or “the tale of Choe Cheok.” The book consists of 32 pages, with each page featuring nine lines containing up to 30 letters.

It contains nine novels, namely “Jusaengjeon” (周生傳 The Tale of Jusaeng), “Unyeongjeon” (雲英傳 The Tale of Unyeong), “Yeongyeongjeon” (英英傳 The Tale of Yeongyeong), “Dongseonjeon” (洞仙傳 The Tale of Dongseon), “Mongyudalcheonnok” (夢遊㺚川錄, The Dream Journey of Dalcheon Pyeongya), “Wonsaengmongyurok” (元生夢遊錄 The Dream Journey of Scholar Won), “Pisaengmyeongmongnok” (皮生冥夢錄 The Dream Journey of Gentleman Pi), “Geumhwayeonghui” (金華靈會 The Meeting of Spirits at Geumhwasa Temple), and “Gangnojeon” (姜虜傳 The Tale of Gang Hong-rip). “Dongseonjeon” and “Dongseongi” (동선기 The Record of Dongseon) are the same work, so are “Mongyudalcheonnok” and “Dalcheonmongyurok” (달천몽유록 The Dream journey of Dalcheon); and “Geumhwayeonghui” and “Geumsansamongyurok” (The Dreaming Journey around Geumsansa Temple). Only six transcribed lines of “Pisaengmyeongmongnok” have survived to the present day, and one page of “Geumhwayeonghui” is missing.  Authorship  The passage yakgeogigae sicheongyeyuk (略擧其槪 時天啓六), which means “The works were compiled in the sixth year of Cheongye (the 4th year of King Injo’s reign) (1626).” indicates that Hwamongjip was transcribed during the first half of the 17th century. However, there has been a new argument that the passage is not about the compilation date of the book but part of the novel Choecheokjeon (The Tale of Choe Cheok). As such, it is currently unclear by whom, and when, Hwamongjip was transcribed. However, considering the fact that many of the novels in the book features stories related to war, the compiler was presumably a person who was deeply conscious of the realities of Joseon in the aftermath of the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) and the Qing Invasion of Joseon in 1636.  Summary  Among Hwamongjip’s short stories, “Jusaengjeon,” “Unyeongjeon,” “Yeongyeongjeon,” and “Dongseonjeon” can be categorized as romance novels, whereas “Mongyudalcheonnok,” “Wonsaengmongyurok,” “Pisaengmyeongmongnok,” and “Geumhwayeonghui” are thought to be mongyurok, or record of a dream journey. As such, it is thought that, in the title Hwamongjip, hwa (flower) means romance novel and mong (dream) means mongyurok. “Gangnojeon” is an anomaly as it is considered a historical novel; however, the work still features characteristics of a romance novel. Among Hwamongjip’s romance stories, “Jusaengjeon” is about a tragic love triangle between a young scholar named Juhoe and two women named Bae-do and Seon-hwa. The first half of the book depicts the love between Jusaeng and Bae-do and the second half, between Jusaeng and Seon-hwa. Notably, Jusaeng is portrayed as a character who abandons loyalty and pursues worldly desires. Set in the Sujeonggung Residence of Grand Prince Anpyeong, “Unyeongjeon” illustrates a tragic love between the palace woman Unyeong and the scholar and literary licentiate Kim Jinsa. “Yeongyeongjeon” depicts the love between Scholar Kim attending Seonggyungwan, the most prestigious royal academic institute, and the palace woman Yeongyeong. “Dongseonjeon” is about a romantic relationship between Seo Mun-jeok, his wife Lady Yu, and the woman entertainer Dongseon. “Dongseonjeon” is unique in that its first half can be considered a romantic novel as it depicts the relationship between Seo Mun-jeok and Dong-seon, while its second half is a family novel dealing with the collaborative efforts of Lady Yu and Dong-seon to rescue Seo Mun-jeok. Among works belonging to the genre of dream journey stories, “Mongyudalcheonnok” illustrates how a man meets, in his dream, the spirits of patriots who sacrificed themselves during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598). It also discusses the loyalty and achievements of numerous commanders, including Admiral Yi Sun-sin. In “Wonsaengmongyurok,” a dreamer meets King Danjong and his loyal subjects, thereby dealing with the politico-historical incident of King Sejo's usurpation of the throne from King Danjong, in the form of a novel. “Pisaengmyeongmongnok” tackles the subject of the funeral and burial of war victims in the aftermath of the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598). “Geumhwayeonghui” features founders of each Chinese dynasties, reflecting a Han Chinese-centered historical perspective. Finally, “Gangnojeon” depicts how Gang Hong-rip surrendered to Qing China in a critical tone, reflecting the pro-Ming and anti-Qing attitude prevalent during the period of the Ming-Qing transition.  Features and significance  Hwamongjip clearly demonstrates the circumstances that surrounded the Korean classical novels of the early and mid-17th century. The book is a selective compilation of stories written in similar time periods, stories that can be clearly distinguished by genre. The appearance of such collection suggests that a significant amount of novels were created at the time, enough to enable the publication of a collection. The novels appearing in Hwamongjip are longer than their predecessors, their plots more complex, and their characters more diverse, thereby indicating dynamic shifts that unfolded in the Korean classical novel genre at the time. Furthermore, Hwamongjip tackles issues facing post-war Korean society. In fact, it can be considered a “collection of post-war novels” in that the works appearing in the book deal with the traumas associated with the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) and the Qing Invasion of Joseon in 1636 while portraying human destinies and emotions related to war.  Texts  Hwamongjip is a collection of Chinese-script novels transcribed during the late Joseon period. The work is housed at Kim Il-sung University in North Korea, a fact known to South Korean scholars through North Korean academic writings on the history of Korean classical literature. Since then, photographic, annotated, and translated editions of the book have been published in South Korea and are now easily available.

After desegregation, much of the racial violence in Miami had calmed only to be reignited by the 1980s. The decade of riots were the result of policing controversies and ethnic tensions fueled by the perceived threat of recent immigrants to African Americans on the Miami job market. Background In the United States through the 1960s, desegregation was empowering once disadvantaged African American communities to reach new political and economic gains. In Miami the Cuban exile seemed to undercut new African American gains as Cubans began to compete for jobs, residence, and political power. The later perceived successes of many Cubans gave a feeling of powerlessness to local African Americans. Many Cuban refugees lacked English language skills and ended up living in lower income neighborhoods and taking up blue collar jobs that many African Americans also held. Cuban and later Latin American refugees were also given assistance by the US government and Catholic church that local African Americans were not given. In 1963, Ebony magazine characterized the Cuban exile as an \\"invasion\\" bringing in \\"grave social and economic problems.\\" By 1968, Miami witnessed a riot in its Liberty City neighborhood during the 1968 Republican National Convention, caused by the frustration African Americans faced in the country. By the 1970s, the Hispanic population of Miami outnumbered the African American population and more Hispanic owned businesses had been opened than African American owned businesses. Between the 1968 Miami riot and the 1980 Miami riots, up to thirteen \\"mini-riots\\" would occur in Miami, all stemming from police confrontations with African-Americans. Riots and incidents 1980 Miami riots The 1980 riots were race riots that occurred in Miami, starting in earnest on May 18, 1980, following the acquittal of police officers who had beaten black motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie.Huffington Postt, McDuffie Riots: Eerie Scene From Miami Race Riot Of 1980, 05/29/2013. 1982 Overtown riot After the accidental police shooting of a man in an Overtown video arcade, a riot broke out in the neighborhood. Cars were burned, businesses were looted, and police were shot at. Ivey Kearson, director of the Overtown Jobs Program, said of the riot's cause \\"unemployment in the area is 50 percent or higher.\\" \\"Most of the people here, they don't see anything happening for them and their neighbors and the guy down the street.\\" \\"It's not just going to be in Miami and it's not going to just be blacks. People feel they have to react violently.\\" The policemen in the original arcade shooting were Latin American. \\"Leave these Latins get out of here, right now,\\" shouted the Rev. Jonathan Rolle, in a television interview about the incident. Later, in a phone interview, he would say, \\"The Latin police, they just ride around in their cars, and they never get out\\". \\". . . . The Latins are the ones who are killing the blacks.\\" 1989 Miami riot The 1989 Miami riot came after police officer William Lozano shot Clement Lloyd, who was fleeing another officer on a motorcycle. He crashed and his passenger, Allan Blanchard, was also killed. Four days of rioting later took place in Overtown. On January 21 after the shooting, violence erupted in Overtown and the next day in Liberty City. Schools were closed and police cordoned off a 130-block area and teargassed rioting crowds. Aftermath \\"Quiet riot\\" After the arrest of Haitian demonstrators picketing a Cuban owned business, believed to have harassed Haitian customers, and the condemnation of Nelson Mandela's visit to Miami by many Cuban city officials, many black business organizations boycotted Miami entirely throughout the summer of 1990. This boycott was dubbed at the time as a \\"quiet riot\\". The boycott was noteworthy for its peaceful and successful tactics as compared to the recent riots. In the end $50,000,000 dollars was lost due to cancelled conventions in the city and ended with various business deals in the city to help expand black owned businesses and attract black professionals. 1991 Miami riot After police shot a shooting suspect in Overtown, rioting broke out in majority black neighborhoods of Liberty City, Overtown, and to a lighter degree in Coconut Grove. Twenty people were arrested after rocks were thrown at a police station, a city bus, and a dumpster was set on fire.

It examines the relationship of behavior and brain function throughout the course of an individual’s lifespan, though often emphasis is put on childhood and adolescence when the majority of brain development occurs. Research tends to focus on development of important behavioral functions like perception, language, and other cognitive processes. Studies in this field are often centered around children or other individuals with developmental disorders or various kinds of brain related trauma or injury. A key concept of this field is that looks at and attempts to relate the psychological aspects of development, such as behavior, comprehension, cognition, etc., to the specific neural structures; it draws parallels between behavior and mechanism in the brain. Research in this field involves various cognitive tasks and tests as well as neuroimaging. Some of the many conditions studied by developmental neuropsychologists include congenital or acquired brain damage, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder, executive dysfunction, seizures, intellectual disabilities, obsessive compulsive disorder, stuttering, schizophrenia, developmental aphasia, and other learning delays such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyspraxia. __TOC__  History  Alexander Luria is considered a founding father of the field of neuropsychology. Luria’s work, much of which was related to speech rehabilitation, provided much of the foundation for what we know today as child neuropsychology (developmental neuropsychology focusing only on beginning of lifespan). The Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery, a standardized test of neuropsychological functioning, was created based on his ideas. Lev Vygotsky, a student of Luria, also made significant contributions to child neuropsychology. Together, their methods have developed the basis for what is known as the Vygotsky-Luria approach. This approach is characterized by the idea that “higher psychological functions are characterized by three main features: (1) social genesis; (2) system structure; and (3) dynamic organization and localization” and examines the neural organization and function structure behind these higher mental functions. Over time, completion of education to at least the high school level has become increasingly common as more and more jobs require skills such as reading and writing. As pressure to have children complete their schooling increases, so has the pressure to provide adequate education to all children. This has led to laws whose aim is to ensure education for handicapped/disabled students. In order to accomplish this, research focus began to shift from adults who were skilled or struggled to read and write to the developmental processes behind them.  Subfields of Developmental Neuropsychology  Research in developmental neuropsychology can generally be divided into two categories that are based on two main goals of the field: educational and clinical. The educational approach aims to understand and aid in the education of developing children (or in some cases adults) whom have deficits learning certain skills, most commonly language related – reading and writing. While some studies do focus on children with brain damage, a lot can be learned from children without brain damage who struggle to learn specific skills and/or have learning disabilities. The goal of this research is to understand the neural causes of these problems and how they relate to the psychological aspects of it in order to improve education programs and treatments. The clinical approach has a greater focus on pathology and medical treatments and diagnoses. Often these studies evaluate and describe a patient’s neural damage due to injury, brain tumors, seizures, or various congenital disorders. This type of research typically examines loss of certain functions due to damage and assesses to what extent if any can patients, usually children with still developing brains, can regain these functions.

She was known for her research on atomic- scale structures and processes on solid surfaces. Early life and Education Thiel was raised on a farm in southwest Minnesota, near her birthplace of Adrian, Minnesota. Her parents grew up in immigrant farm families and each had completed an eighth grade education. Thiel herself attended a private elementary school nearby her farm in Lismore, MN for grades 1-8 and public high school in Adrian, MN for grades 9-12. Support from the National Merit Scholarship Program enabled her to attend Macalester College in St. Paul, MN, where she was inspired by her freshman chemistry course and its instructor, Prof. Emil Slowinski to major in chemistry. She completed a BA in chemistry with a minor in mathematics in 1975. After working for a year at Control Data Corporation as an analytic chemist, she enrolled in the Chemistry Department at the California Institute of Technology, with financial support from a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship. She completed a PhD in chemistry in 1981 under the supervision of W. Henry Weinberg. Career Thiel's first appointment after graduation was as an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where she worked in the research group of Gerhard Ertl, who later went on to receive the 2007 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1982 she joined the technical staff of Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, CA and, after a brief stint as a Visiting Professor in the Physics department of the University of California, Berkeley, joined the Chemistry department faculty of Iowa State University in 1983, with a simultaneous appointment as staff scientist with the US Department of Energy's Ames Laboratory She was subsequently promoted to the ranks of Associate Professor (1988), Full Professor (1991) and Distinguished Professor (2001). She received an additional appointment as Professor of Materials Science and Engineering in 2012. Throughout this time period she received outstanding teaching awards, and held several administrative posts, including Program Director for Materials Chemistry (Ames Laboratory; 1988-2004), Chief Research officer (Ames Laboratory; 2008-2009) and Chair of the Iowa State Chemistry Department (1999-2002). Thiel was an associate editor of The Journal of Chemical Physics (2013-2020). She attended the Nobel Prize ceremony on December 10, 2011, where Dan Shechtman received the 2011 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the discovery of quasicrystals. Research Thiel's research elucidated atomic-scale structures and processes on solid surfaces, in areas relevant to microelectronics, tribology, heterogeneous catalysis, and nanoscience. She published over 300 research papers, which have been cited about 12,000 times, effective 2019. She is especially known for work in the following three areas. Surfaces of quasicrystals Thiel's research group pioneered studies of nucleation and growth of metal films on quasicrystal surfaces, demonstrating that local pseudomorphic growth, including starfish- shaped formations, can occur at very specific nucleation sites. Focusing on metallic, aluminum-rich quasicrystals, Thiel and her collaborators extensively explored how quasicrystal atomic-scale surface structures were related to their unusual surface properties, including low friction, low adhesion, and good oxidation resistance. Interaction of water with metal surfaces Thiel's Ph.D. research described evidence for hydrogen bonding between water molecules on a ruthenium surface. She continued her research on water as a faculty member at Iowa State University, and discovered that desorption kinetics of water can exhibit a measurable isotope effect. She was credited with being the first to propose that bilayers of water near solid surfaces could possess a structure similar to the basal plane of Ice Ih. She was the co-author, along with Theodore E. Madey, of a highly cited and comprehensive review article describing the interactions and properties of water near solid surfaces. Nucleation, growth, and coarsening of metal nanostructures on surfaces Thiel's group was credited with discovering that large two- dimensional islands of metal adatom clusters can have significant room temperature mobility on metal substrates, and that, contrary to what had usually been assumed, this can be the main route to coarsening (an evolution to larger sizes and fewer numbers) of these clusters. She and James W. Evans are responsible for first describing an atomic-scale mechanism for metal film growth, which they dubbed ‘downward funneling’. Because of this mechanism, they predicted an unusual variation in film roughness with temperature from theory, and eventually confirmed it experimentally using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. This is now accepted as an important mechanism that affects thin film morphology upon growth at low temperature. More recently, her group discovered a series of naturally-occurring metal-sulfur complexes with distinct stoichiometries, which may influence stability of larger metallic features by assisting surface metal transport and hence coarsening. She was highlighted for this work in the Journal of Physical Chemistry's virtual issue highlighting 66 women in honor of Marie Curie's 150th birthday. She and her collaborators also discovered that metallic nanoparticles can be grown as encapsulated clusters near the surface of a layered material, graphite, if specific growth conditions are met. Applying a continuum elasticity model, they developed insight into the reasons for the low, flattened shapes (high aspect ratios) of these embedded particles, and a prediction that the shape of encapsulated metal islands should be universal (size-independent).

Tanya Amber Gee (July 15, 1977 – September 28, 2016) was a South Carolina circuit court judge.  Early life, education  Gee was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Her mother was originally from Germany, and her parents met while her father was serving in the army overseas. Gee was educated in public schools in Michigan until her family moved to Rock Hill, South Carolina, when she was sixteen. She graduated from Northwestern High School in 1995. Gee earned a BA degree, magna cum laude, from Winthrop University. In 2002, she graduated from the University of South Carolina School of Law, where she served as president of both the Pro Bono Board and the Public Interest Law Society. Upon graduation, she was awarded the Bronze Compleat Lawyer award, the most prestigious award chosen by the law school faculty and administration, as well as the Claude Sapp Award, chosen by her classmates “as possessing the best combination of scholarship, leadership and industry.”  Legal career  Gee began her legal career as law clerk to Kaye G. Hearn, who was then chief judge of the South Carolina Court of Appeals. Gee was eventually appointed chief staff attorney for the Court, and in 2010, she was elected clerk of court. In 2012, she left the court to practice law at Nexsen Pruet, where she worked for several years in business litigation and on appellate work. Among her clients were state senators Paul Thurmond and Clementa Pinckney, who faced ballot challenges in 2012. In 2015, the South Carolina legislature elected Gee, at the age of 37, to a seat on the South Carolina Circuit Court.  Awards  Gee was selected one of The State newspaper's 2010 “20 Under 40” class of young professionals. She was a member of the Liberty Fellowship Class of 2012. She also was awarded the Silver Compleat Lawyer Award (awarded to three selected young alumni) and making her one of only two attorneys to have been awarded both the Bronze and Silver Compleat Lawyer Awards. She also served as a board member for Sarcoma Warriors. After her death, a judicial portrait was presented to a joint session of the South Carolina Supreme Court and the South Carolina Court of Appeals. The portrait currently hangs in the state's Court of Appeals. Gee was also posthumously awarded the Judge Matthew J. Perry Civility Award from the Richland County Bar.  Death and legacy  Late in her life, Gee was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called chondrosarcoma. She was first treated in 2013 while practicing law at Nexsen Pruet. After appearing to recover, Gee was elected to the bench. However, the cancer returned in 2016, and she died on September 28, 2016. State Supreme Court Chief Justice Costa Pleicones appointed Gee to sit on some S.C. Court of Appeals cases because she was familiar with that court’s practices and she had “an incredible work ethic.” “She was one of the best and brightest,” Pleicones said, adding that had she lived, her career would have gone upward, perhaps “ultimately to the Supreme Court.” Chief Judge James Lockemy wrote in the Court's case opinion that she was the only individual to ever serve as a law clerk, chief staff attorney, and clerk of court, “culminating at the time of her death as a member of the South Carolina Court of Appeals.” He noted that “Judge Gee was filled with pride and happiness, as were her colleagues.” The University of South Carolina School of Law maintains a \\"Tanya A. Gee Warriors for Justice Fund,\\" which facilitates scholarships.

The regiment is part of the Italian army's army aviation and operationally assigned to the Airmobile Brigade \\"Friuli\\".  History   Formation  On 5 July 1996 the 7th Attack Helicopters Regiment \\"Vega\\" was raised at Casarsa Airport with personnel ceded by the 5th Army Light Aviation Regiment \\"Rigel\\" and placed under command of the Army Aviation Inspectorate. After its activation the regiment received the 48th Attack Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Pavone\\" from the 4th Army Aviation Regiment \\"Altair\\" and the 49th Attack Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Capricorno\\" from the 5th Army Aviation Regiment \\"Rigel\\". On 5 July 1996 the regiment was structured as follows: * 25px 7th Attack Helicopters Regiment \\"Vega\\", at Casarsa Airport ** 48th Attack Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Pavone\\", at Belluno Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 481st Attack Helicopters Squadron (A129D Mangusta attack helicopters) *** 482nd Attack Helicopters Squadron (A129D Mangusta attack helicopters) ** 49th Attack Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Capricorno\\", at Casarsa Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 491st Attack Helicopters Squadron (A129D Mangusta attack helicopters) *** 492nd Attack Helicopters Squadron (A129D Mangusta attack helicopters)  Naming  Since the 1975 Army reform Italian army aviation units are named for celestial objects: regiments are numbered with a single digit and named for stars in the 88 modern constellationss. Accordingly, an army aviation regiment's coat of arms highlights the name-giving star within its constellation. Squadron groups were numbered with two digits and named for constellations, or planets of the Solar System. The 7th Army Aviation Regiment was named for Vega the brightest star in the Lyra constellation. On 15 July 1996 the President of the Italian Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro granted the regiment a newly created war flag, which has since been awarded Military Order of Italy for the regiment's participation in international missions in Albania, Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and one Bronze Medal of Army Valour awarded to the then autonomous 48th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Pavone\\" for its service after the 1976 Friuli earthquake.  Events  On 1 September 1998 the 7th Vega ceded the 48th Attack Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Pavone\\" to the 5th Army Aviation Regiment \\"Rigel\\", which moved on the same date to the former Italian Air Force Miramare Air Base near Rimini. On 23 October of the same year the 7th Vega was renamed 7th Army Aviation Regiment \\"Vega\\" and on the same date swapped name and flags with the 5th Army Aviation Regiment \\"Rigel\\". Based now at Miramare Air Base the 7th Vega consisted of the 25th Army Aviation Squadrons Group \\"Cigno\\", 48th Attack Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Pavone\\", and 53rd Army Aviation Squadrons Group \\"Cassiopea\\". On 1 January 1999 the regiment entered the Mechanized Brigade \\"Friuli\\", which was in the process of reforming as the army's airmobile brigade. On 5 May 2000 the 5th Army Aviation Regiment \\"Rigel\\" joined the Mechanized Brigade \\"Friuli\\", which in that date changed its name to Airmobile Brigade \\"Friuli\\". In 2008 the Vega began the transition from AB 204B/205 to NH90 helicopters. On 31 December 2015 the 53rd Squadrons Group \\"Cassiopea\\" is disbanded.

After the war he was in charge of the Field Command, Armed Forces Special Weapons Project at Sandia Base, and the Caribbean Air Command. Early life Leland Samuel Stranathan was born in Glenwood, Iowa on 28 June 1904. He graduated from Glenwood High School in 1921 and entered the University of Southern California later that year. He graduated in 1926 with a bachelor of arts degree, majoring in business administration. Stranathan was a Flying Cadet from 28 June to 22 July 1927, and from 28 October 1927 to 31 October 1928. He was part of the first class of Primary Flying School students to go through March Field, California, after it was reactivated after World War I. His first instructor was Second Lieutenant Hoyt Vandenberg. He then attended the United States Army Air Corps Advanced Flying School bombardment course at Kelly Field, Texas, and was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Air Reserve on 22 October 1928. His first assignment was to Langley Field, Virginia. On 2 February 1929, Stranathan received a permanent commission in the Army Air Corps , and in March was posted to Bolling Field, D.C., where his main duty was transporting dignitaries. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 1 October 1934. After serving as an instructor at Randolph Field, Texas, he commanded the 50th Observation Squadron at Luke Field in the Territory of Hawaii, from 23 March to 3 September 1937. World War II Stranathan was promoted to captain on 2 February 1939, and graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School in 1940. He was assigned to Maxwell Field, Alabama, where he became assistant director of training on 22 August 1940.

As a high school student, he began performing and writing theatrical sketches, and joined the Rose McClendon Players. He met performers such as Ethel Waters and George Wiltshire, and encountered racial discrimination at first hand in his everyday life. As a result, he resolved to work towards presenting positive images of blacks, and providing better work opportunities, in the theatre. He attended the City College of New York and won a scholarship to attend Talladega College in Alabama, where he wrote a paper which later became the basis of his 1967 book, Black Drama: The Story of the American Negro in the Theatre. \\"Loften Mitchell 1919–2001, Playwright\\", Encyclopedia.com.

Popular in the New Jersey underground music scene, Cook Thugless gained national attention with their 2019 single titled, \\"Lockjaw\\". The name Cook Thugless is a derivation of the Cook-Douglass Campus at Rutgers University where the group was formed.  History   Origins and formation (2012–2013)  Jace Limb, Brian Clines, and Jeff Petescia met in Sparta, NJ, before attending Rutgers University together. Clines met Keith Lalley and Jean Louis at Mason Gross School of the Arts, the arts conservatory at Rutgers University. Limb, Clines, Petescia, and Lalley lived together in the Starkey Dormitory and named the band Cook Thugless, a play on Cook-Douglass campus where the band lived and attended school.  Space, Time, and Money (2013–2017) On April 20, 2013, Cook Thugless released their first full- length album titled Space, which was followed shortly thereafter by the release of their second album \\"Time\\". The band primarily played underground shows, house parties in off-campus housing, and at smaller, less formal venues. Cook Thugless slowly but surely became a mainstay of the New Brunswick music scene. J-Titty (drums) joined Cook Thugless in 2015, just after the release of Time. In 2016, Cook Thugless recorded their third studio album Money in Jersey City, NJ. Money is a concept album following Cook Thugless imagined rise to fame. Money explores the intersection of consumerist culture with music, and the recording industry. The album features a number of skits and storylines, in which the band's style and music are critiqued and changed to maximize their appeal. This includes a skit in which Jean Louis is directed to adopt the stage-name Fatty Puss. Money was critically lauded, with NJ music reporter Bob Makin writing, \\"It’s rare when a local unsigned act makes lasting art, but that is what Cook Thugless have done with Money...\\"  LUXE and lost in LA (2019)  Cook Thugless released their fourth album LUXE on January 4, 2019. The album's lead single Lockjaw became a break out hit on streaming services garnering more than 700,000 plays in its first month. The Aquarian Weekly named LUXE as \\"Record of the Week\\".

The team currently competes in the Moto2 World Championship under the name NTS RW Racing GP, in a technical partnership running the factory team for Japanese motorcycle chassis builder NTS.  Team history  Roelof Waninge, owner of a Dutch network of commercial vehicle dealerships and workshops headquartered in Assen, originally invested in motorcycle racing in 1993 as a personal sponsor of Dutch rider Jarno Janssen, who would go on to become RW's team principal after his riding career. In 2011, the long-standing Dutch 125 cc and 250 cc team owned by Arie Molenaar experienced financial trouble, prompting Waninge to purchase the remaining assets of the team and rename it RW Racing GP.  125 cc/Moto3  The team began competing in 2011, taking over the existing 125 cc programme from Molenaar, using Aprilia machinery and retaining upcoming Spanish rider Luis Salom. In 2012 with the replacement of the 125 cc class by the new four-stroke Moto3 regulations, the team switched to Kalex-KTM machines, retaining Salom and adding South African rider Brad Binder. Salom finished the season in 2nd place with 2 wins and 8 podiums. In 2013, former Molenaar team rider Jarno Janssen, who had continued with the team and subsequently with RW in various technical roles after retirement as a racer, was named general team manager. 2014 would prove to be the team's worst season to date, with both riders Scott Deroue and Ana Carrasco failing to score a single point. 2015 saw a major change for the team, with a switch to Honda machinery and a reduction to a single rider, Livio Loi. Loi managed a win in 2015 at Indianapolis that season, but managed only one other top 10 finish with a 5th place at Silverstone Circuit. For the 2016 season, RW continued with Loi with similar overall results.  Moto2  2017 saw another major step for the RW Racing GP team, as they moved up to Moto2 with Spanish rider Axel Pons on Kalex machinery. For the 2018 season, RW joined forces with Japanese chassis manufacturer NTS to operate their factory programme as the sole users of the NTS chassis, expanding their programme to two riders. Despite NTS's relatively quick success in the previous two seasons of the CEV Moto2 European Championship, the challenge of the Moto2 World Championship proved difficult with RW finishing 16th and 15th from 18 teams in 2018 and 2019 respectively.

The coup overthrew President Arturo Araujo and led to the establishment of the Civic Directory of El Salvador.  Coup and Directory  The Salvadoran Armed Forces toppled the government of the democratically elected President, Arturo Araujo, the candidate of the Labor Party. During his administration, El Salvador faced political tension and public unrest. Tax reforms also failed to succeed due to resistance from the wealthy class. The final straw for the coup was an attempt to reduce the military budget which was met by heavy resistance by military officers. With the government being unable to pay wages to military officers, the army staged the coup to remove Arturo Araujo’s administration at 10pm on December 2, 1931. The military officers established the Civic Directory as a provisional government generally led by General and former Vice President Maximiliano Hernández Martínez and Colonel Osmín Aguirre y Salinas.  Legacy  The Directory was dissolved on December 4 and Maximiliano Hernández Martínez assumed the Presidency as “Acting President”. He would later officially become President on March 1, 1935. The coup led to the subsequent 1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre where Feliciano Ama and Farabundo Martí lead poor Salvadoran peasants in a communist rebellion against Martínez’s government leading to 25,000 deaths. The United States did not recognize the legitimacy of Hernández Martínez's rise to power or government due to the 1923 Central American Treaty of Peace and Amity and only recognized his government after his government put down the communist uprising in early 1932.

Plot  Johann is sad because Embla, the cow of his family, has died. It was the only cow that the family had. Soon it will be Christmas, but without the cow and its milk, it is going to be a very sad one. Meanwhile, a rich farmer buys a calf in the town. Afterwards, he goes into a pub and gets drunk.

In return, Johann and his father should not tell how they got the calf. Johann is happy, this is a wonderful Christmas present.

Once he told Astrid Lindgren of a drunken barkeeper from Frödinge, who bought a calf from his brother. Ericsson helped the barkeeper to put the calf into a bag so the barkeeper was able to take it home with him on his carriage. Afterwards the barkeeper went to the pub and drank. On his way back, he did not remember buying a calf. When he suddenly heard a terrible roar from the calf, he believed that this was the devil and threw the calf off the wagon. This story was later told throughout the village. When Ericsson met the barkeeper again, he asked him mockingly, what had become of the calf. The barkeeper sensed that Ericsson knew about the story. He replied that this calf had made a long journey.Catharina Stackelberg: Astrid Lindgren erzählt aus ihrem Leben (Astrid Lindgrens Småland). (film) In: 100 Jahre Astrid Lindgren Jubiläumsedition.

Within the first month, the book had already sold more than 30,000 times. The book has been translated into many languages, among them are English, German and Dutch. English Edition has been illustrated by Marit Törnqvist.  Reception  The German child and adolescent psychiatrist Michael Schulte-Markwort believes A Calf for Christmas is one of the most beautiful stories for bereaved counsel and comfort. It could help readers or listeners to cope with the strokes of fate.Michael Schulte-Markwort (2017): Kindersorgen: Was unsere Kinder belastet und wie wir ihnen helfen können. P. 16 Kirkus Reviews praises the well-told story. It is a mix of satire and sober realism. The watercolors by Marit Törnqvist are beautiful and \\"a fine complement to this unusual glimpse of rural Sweden at the turn of the century\\". Natalia Bragaru believes that A Calf For Christmas, like all Astrid Lindgren's books, has \\"multiple layers\\". It provides information about the harsh realities of the daily life on a farm in Sweden, telling of the gap between the poor and the rich, the traditions of the farmers, as well as of love, hope and the belief in miracles.

He was the eldest child of Daniel Pomroy of Coventry, Connecticut and his wife, Fanny Belden, of Simsbury, a descendant of Horace Belden. After his father died when he was just twelve years old, his mother, brother and sisters moved to Stamford, Connecticut before Henry attended boarding school at Mount Carmel and in Ossining, New York before studying at the Columbia School of Mines for one year.

She is best known for her study of memory and culture. Wang is a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and the Psychonomic Society. She is also a member of the American Psychological Association, the Society for Research in Child Development, the Cognitive Development Society, the International Society for the Study of Behavioral Development, and the Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition. She serves on many editorial boards and is currently Associate Editor for Memory and Culture and Brain. She is the director of the Culture & Social Cognition Lab.  Biography  Qi Wang was born and raised in Chongqing, China. Having both parents being engineers, her choice of becoming a psychologist was influenced by her aunt, a psychology professor at a Chinese university. Wang received her undergraduate degree in psychology from Peking University. She went on to earn her Ph.D. in psychology (with a minor in anthropology) in 2000 at Harvard University. Her academic advisors were Michelle Leichtman and Sheldon White. Wang’s dissertation, “Culture, self, and emotion: An integrative perspective on the development of autobiographical memory,” won the James McKeen Cattell Award for outstanding dissertation in psychology from the New York Academy of Sciences. She subsequently joined the Cornell Human Development faculty as an assistant professor and became a full professor in 2011.  Research  Wang proposes a cultural dynamic theory of autobiographical memory, arguing that memory is not simply a product of the mind or brain but instead a social- cultural construction. Her research reveals that people from different cultures often show diverse ways of remembering their past experiences: They differ in what to remember, how to remember, and why to remember it. These cultural differences in memory emerge early in childhood and persist across the lifespan. Her work further shows that these differences stem from the influences of a variety of cultural elements such as cultural self-construal, perceptual encoding, emotion cognition, and mnemonic practices. Wang also works on childhood amnesia (or infantile amnesia), a phenomenon in which adults show inability to recall memories from the earliest years of life. She and Carole Peterson observed that when remembering early childhood experiences, both children and adults systematically date the events at later ages than they actually were - a telescoping bias. This finding has critical implications for the theoretical explanation for childhood amnesia. Furthermore, her research reveals cultural differences in childhood amnesia, whereby Westerners recall earlier, more numerous, more self-focused, and more emotionally laden childhood memories than do East Asians. Wang further leads the research effort to understand the impact of the Internet and social media on memory. She suggests that the public, interactive, and immediate nature of online posting changes what and how individuals remember about their experiences and further shapes their sense of self and identity. Studies by Wang and her colleagues show that whereas sharing personal information (e.g., a recent family trip) online leads to better memory for the information, sharing public information (e.g., by reposting or retweeting news) results in impoverished recall. In addition to studying memory, Wang has undertaken extensive studies to examine future thinking, self-concept, and emotion knowledge in cultural contexts, the influence of the Internet and social media on human behavior, and the relation of socio-cognitive processes to psychological well-being. Given the pivotal role of culture in shaping mind and behavior, Wang urges psychologists to take culture into account in their research so as to eliminate culture-bound biases and build a true psychological science. Using a multi-level analysis approach, her research demonstrates the many ways in which culture and mind interact.  Publications  Wang has frequently published in scientific journals and in volumes of collected works. Her single-authored book, The Autobiographical Self in Time and Culture, is regarded as a definitive work on culture and autobiographical memory. Her most recent theoretical synthesis of the influence of culture on human memory can be found in the Annual Review of Psychology. Wang’s work has also been featured in media outlets such as Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, BBC, PBS, and The New Yorker. Wang has received the Young Scientist Award from the International Society for Study of Behavioral Development (2006), the Award for Distinguished Contributions to Early Research from the Society for Research in Child Development (2005), and the Outstanding Contribution to Research Award from SRCD Asian Caucus (2013).

Richard Newton Appointed Principal of Hart Hall, Oxford in 1710, he refounded Hart Hall as Hertford College, his statutes being accepted in 1739 and the charter granted in 1740, and remained Principal of Hertford College until his death in 1753. Early life Newton was the youngest son of Thomas Newton, lord of the manor of Lavendon, Buckinghamshire, and his wife Katharine Hervey. He was born at Yardley Park, Northamptonshire, a house which his father rented from Lord Northampton, on 8 November 1676. He was educated at Westminster School, being admitted in 1690, and at Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating on 16 June 1694, graduating B.A. 1698, M.A. 1701, B.D. 1708, D.D. 1710 (from Hart Hall). He remained at Christ Church as a tutor, and was appointed rector of Sudborough, Northamptonshire in 1704. Despite a complaint in 1743 that he had not been resident in Sudborough for more than twenty years, he did not vacate the living until 1748. Hart Hall On the recommendation of Henry Aldrich, Dean of Christ Church, Newton was appointed Principal of Hart Hall, installed on 28 July 1710. He was also tutor to Lord Pelham's two sons, Thomas (the future Duke of Newcastle) and Henry Pelham, both future Prime Ministers. When Newton was appointed to Hart Hall, Henry Pelham accompanied him, being admitted to Hart Hall on 6 September 1710. Henry Pelham is said to have maintained an affection for both his college and his tutor, though he did not use his influence to their advantage. Pelham commented that Newton had never asked for anything. Another of Newton's students at Hertford was George Augustus Selwyn, the politician and wit, who was rusticated in 1745 (he unregistered to avoid expulsion) for an irreverent joke that was deemed insulting to Christianity. As principal of the hall, Newton worked towards two aims. He desired that it should be established as a college, and that poor students should be trained in it for the ministry on very moderate terms of payment. Newton built, at a cost of nearly £1,500, one- fourth part of a large quadrangle, consisting of a chapel, consecrated by John Potter, then Bishop of Oxford, on 25 November 1716, and an angle, containing fifteen single rooms; purchased the adjoining property at a cost of £160 more, and endowed the new institution with an annuity of £53 6s. 8d. paid from his estate at Lavendon. The other buildings, which were intended to comprise a library, hall, principal's lodgings, and further rooms for the students, were never erected, mainly through his disappointment in his expectations of assistance from the wealthy among his former pupils, and especially from the Pelhams. Hart Hall had long paid a small quit-rent to Exeter College, and some of the college fellows, led by John Conybeare (Rector of Exeter College from 1730, then Dean of Christ Church from 1733), opposed its incorporation. When in 1734 Newton wrote an open letter to the Vice-Chancellor William Holmes complaining of obstruction by Exeter College, Conybeare responded with Calumny Refuted: Or, an Answer to the Personal Slanders Published by Dr. Richard Newton (1735); Newton responded with The Grounds of the Complaint of the Principal of Hart Hall (1735). After many years Newton triumphed over all obstacles. The Attorney General advised against the claim of Exeter College, the proposed rules and statutes were confirmed by King George II on 3 November 1739, the charter was granted on 27 August 1740, and Newton became the first principal of Hertford College. For these long-continued exertions Newton incurred the charge of being ‘founder-mad.’ Newton's statutes for Hertford College were strict, and aimed at economy and efficiency of supervision over the undergraduates by the tutors. Newton was well-versed in both classics and modern languages. He believed in disputations, and insisted on English composition, but not on poetry, except in the case of the pupils ‘having a genius’ for it. There are frequent sneers in the ‘Terræ Filius’ of Nicholas Amhurst and the pamphlets of the period at his economical system of living. Newton became a canon of Christ Church, Oxford in January 1753. He died at Lavendon on 21 April 1753, and was buried in the chancel of Lavendon Church. Family Newton married firstly Catherine, daughter of Andrew Adams of Welton, Northamptonshire, by whom he had one daughter, Jane, who married the Rev. Knightley Adams. He married secondly Mary, daughter of Sir Willoughby Hickman of Gainsborough, by Ann, daughter of Sir Stephen Anderson, and by her had no issue. She died on 5 July 1781, aged 82.

At its formation the regiment was structured as follows: * 25px 2nd Army Aviation Regiment \\"Sirio\\", at Lamezia Terme Airport ** 12th Army Aviation Squadrons Group \\"Gru\\", at Lamezia Terme Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 121st Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 205 helicopters) *** 122nd Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 205 helicopters) ** 20th Army Aviation Squadrons Group \\"Andromeda\\", at Pontecagnano Airport *** Command and Services Squadron *** 420th Reconnaissance Helicopters Squadron (AB 206 helicopters) *** 520th Multirole Helicopters Squadron (AB 205 helicopters)  Naming  Since the 1975 Army reform Italian army aviation units are named for celestial objects: regiments are numbered with a single digit and named for stars in the 88 modern constellationss. Accordingly an army aviation regiment's coat of arms highlights the name-giving star within its constellation. Squadron groups were numbered with two digits and named for constellations, or planets of the Solar System. The 2nd Army Aviation Regiment was named for Sirius () the brightest star in the Canis Major constellation. In fall 1996 the President of the Italian Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro granted the regiment a newly created war flag, which today is decorated with one Silver Medal of Army Valour awarded to the then autonomous 20th Light Airplanes and Helicopters Squadrons Group \\"Andromeda\\" for its service after the 1980 Irpinia earthquake.  Events  On 1 October 1997 the 30th Army Aviation Squadrons Group \\"Pegaso\\" based at Fontanarossa Airport in Sicily entered the regiment and began its move from Fontanarossa to Lamezia Terme. On 30 April 1998 the 12th Army Aviation Squadrons Group \\"Gru\\" based at Lamezia Terme was disbanded and its personnel and equipment integrated into the newly arrived 30th Army Aviation Squadrons Group \\"Pegaso\\". On 15 November 2000 the regiment entered the Air Cavalry Grouping, which on 1 March 2006 became the Army Aviation Brigade. On 3 April 2001 the 21st Squadrons Group \\"Orsa Maggiore\\", at Elmas Airport in Sardinia entered the regiment and in fall 2002 the 20th Army Aviation Squadrons Group \\"Andromeda\\" was disbanded.

Symbols can define certain aspects of cultures making them initially exclusive to particular groups. When it comes to symbolism in archaeology, artifacts found may display iconography with these abstract symbols or tell us more about the people who made them through their construction. Symbolism is not limited to only inanimate objects but can be found in the actions or being of living things as well. The Philippines, comprising more than 7,000 islands, is an archipelago where symbols of the past and present contribute to its unique culture. These symbols are influenced by and noticeable in burial practices, rituals, social status, architecture, agriculture, and The Philippines' place in the Austronesian world.  Burials  For archaeologists, burials of all types can give more information about how the deceased was living causing them to be important when looking at a culture. In Philippine archaeology, we find a variety of different burial forms ranging from coffins to mummification. A form of burial that has an obvious form of symbolism is the use of jars in secondary burials. Wilhelm Solheim, an American anthropologist has stated that burial jars can tell an archaeologist three things in particular: the relation of groups due to the jar’s design as well as the way they were positioned and the items that are associated with these burials. Jar burials are a neolithic feature that included different sizing that denotes primary or secondary burial type and can be found in open spaces and caves alike. Other burial types include mausoleum burial sites composed of larger structures representative of the deceased individual. Items commonly associated with these burials include beads, metals, bones, shells, porcelain and religious iconography.  Manunggul Jar  The Manunggul Jar was discovered in the Tabon caves by American anthropologist Robert B. Fox who worked in conjunction with Miguel Antonio during their excavation on the island of Palawan in 1962. The Manunggul Jar is a type of secondary burial meaning that the body had been moved after an initial burial which can be ceremonial. The discovery of the Manunggul jar gave archaeologists a better understanding of the Philippines' early belief in the afterlife. The Manunggul Jar The Manunggul Jar is an earthenware that has been considered a national treasure of the Philippines. The symbols seen on this pottery are representative of maritime culture as well as traditional burial arrangements. The scrolls that adorn the upper section of this pottery are made of hematite and resemble the waves that these early Filipinos would have been sailing on. The very top of the jar's lid is decorated with two figures in a boat sailing into the afterlife with one in the back end of the boat rowing and the other with its arms crossed looking out into the distance. The significance of the figure with its arms crossed is that this representative of arm arrangement in primary burials in the Philippines.  Mausoleums  Mausoleums are physical structures that are representative of the way people lived. The Manila South Cemetery is home to burial sites of both elite and lower-class individuals. Burial sites themselves can be indicative of social status, wealth, and identity of the deceased. Mausoleums require regular maintenance and therefore are only affordable to wealthier individuals such as businessmen, merchants, political officials, and other elites. Therefore, it is uncommon for mausoleums to be decorated with imagery of religious affiliations, family names, and other symbols that depict cultural identity. On the contrary, lower-class individuals unable to pay for a burial site end up being placed aside in bags along with others who are also unable to. The distinctions between social classes carries on after death in burial site differences.  Rituals  Ritual practices in the Philippines contain a kind of symbolic meaning that is passed down through generations through continuous participation which can include inanimate objects to represent a higher power or be caused by an event in their daily lives. Rituals such as those that take place in Ifugao transpire underneath homes or in granaries year-round for reasons such as marriage, prestige feasting, or death. These rituals included the sacrifice of animals which were typically domesticated to represent purity. The number of animals that were sacrificed during these rituals was a symbol of wealth and power in these communities as just to have these animals was a large expense, thus making a household's ability to sacrifice more than one for any ritual during the year to be a clear sign of significant wealth and social status. The reason that these rituals occur is based on the perceived benefits that come with these events such as a good harvest, good health, hunting success, and overall protection from negative forces.  Agriculture  Ifugao Terraces Pigs are one of the most common animal to be used for animal rituals, usually in celebration of the conclusion of a good year or of a good seasonal harvest. Animal rituals are only able to be sponsored by rice producers, therefore, characterizing the group of Filipinos able to harvest wet-rice as the wealthy social class. The animals, however, are bought from Filipinos without the resources to grow wet-rice; since pigs are grown by potato consumption. The number of pigs, or animals, used in a feast is directly indicative of the power and helps the sponsor gain prestige. Three examples in which animal rituals are a symbol of closure or initiation of a new micro-era are: Fiestas, Media Noche, and Noche Buena. Fiestas, the more common example, are thrown for the conclusion of a good season or at the start a new project. Media Noche is symbolic for the conclusion of a good year. Noche Buena, has a religious symbol attached to it because the animal ritual occurs in Celebration of the birth of Jesus on the night of December 24th. There are rules to animal rituals, a noteworthy rule symbolizing purity stem from the commonly accepted condition that wild animals are considered inappropriate to sacrifice. Consumption of meat immediately after a formation of an alliance, and family unions, is symbolic of the following shared belief, \\"consumption and distribution of meat during feasts strengthen kin relations and solidifies non-kin relations\\". There is archeological evidence of agricultural symbols because there is a larger amount of pig skeletal remains dating to after the arrival of the Spanish to the Philippines. Also, there was a flip in the correlation of low-land wet-rice grounds to the Ifugao rice terraces supported by the proper dating of such terraces by an estimate, product of the Bayesian method. In other words, since the arrival of the Spanish, association of lack of wealth with the highland taro and potato fields, switched to an association of wealth with the rice terraces formed in the highlands to create distance between the Spanish and the Ifugao wet-rice elite. Rice production still symbolized wealth, but the location connection to wealth was flipped.  Spanish Colonialism  Pericolonialsim, in unsuccessful colonialism that affected the population socially and economically. Pericolonialsim effects through agriculture are located in the above section. Sometimes this term refers to the politically \\"unconquered\\" areas the Philippines, such as Ifugao locale, a frontier area that has been called pericolonial. However these areas show signs if colonialism influence. Furthermore, professor Acabado writes, \\"ethnographically, the concept of pericolonialism is manifested in language, myths, and material symbols Austronesian World  Peñafrancia Festival  Colonialism influenced agriculture through the economy and social prestige, but there are still living religious traditions of colonialism in present day Philippines. For example. The Peñafrancia Festival in the Naga City, Bicol, Philippines, is a fiesta carried out every year in September, where mostly men participate in an attempt at physically touching the wooden religious figure of Our Lady of Peñafrancia (the Virgin Mary) for good luck and health. There is an adopted symbolism of athleticism and strength attributed to men that stemmed from the Spanish culture, because the mission to come in physical contact with the wooden religious figure is one in which men crowd surf and work with each other. Gendered fiestas and patrilineal traditions in the Philippines did not dominate in pre-Spanish contact Philippines because wet- rice lands had previously been inherited through the use of bilateral con- sanguine kinship system. Colorism Despite the usual use of an inanimate object to represent an idea, a person's skin color was a symbol of your social status and directly correlated with wealth; due to the caste system implemented by Spanish Colonialism. Colorism continued to exist for the following colonial power, the United States of America. Mid 20th century the American anthropologist Henry Otley Beyer, during his assignment to the Philippines, produced the Beyer's Waves of Migration Theory. This theory was based on the idea that the darker group of people called \\"the negritos\\" arrived prior to an Indonesian group and to civilized Malay group.  Link to the Austronesian World  The Austronesian world extends from Madagascar on the West to Polynesia in the East, then Taiwan and Micronesia to the North. This geographical location is joined by the theory that a proto-language existed and unified all of these countries and territories not attatched to any mainland continent. There are problems with linking this connection to language because language travels faster than human migration.  Tattoos  Pintados- Visayans as portrayed in the Boxer Codex Across the Austronesian world, and mostly to the west of the Philippines, tattoos were a common for of incorporating symbolism to solidify a cultural, traditional, or religious belief. For example archeological evidence exists of mummified bodies with body tattoos. Other accounts such as the Hispanic Boxer Codex, provide examples of the Visayans, which the Spanish called \\"pintados\\", the pained ones. Meanings and ingredients were different but, the method was the same for all tribes. Most tribes used a form of needle or heated piece of iron, but the Isneg of Apayao has a unique instrument called the Igihisi.Salcedo, Cecilio G. 1998. “Prehistoric Vanities.” In Kasaysayan: The Story of the Filipino People, Volume 2, edited by Gabriel Casal, Eusebio Dizon, Wilfredo Ronquillo, and Cecilio Salcedo, 231–41. Hong Kong: Asia Publishing Company.  Ceramics   Sa-huynh-Kalanay pottery and Lapita pottery  Sa- huynh-Kalanay pottery was found in the Kalanay cave in Masbate, Philippines and the Lapita pottery is from Malenesia. Despte the fact that Lapita (red Slip) pottery does not stem from Kalanay cpottery, they share similar form and elements of design. In 1988 Solheim went as far as to say that \\"the relationship between the two was vital to understanding cultural history\\".  Sun and Bird Symbols  According to Grace Barretto-Tesoro, \\"In Pangasinan, Agneo, the sun, and Bulan, the moon, were children of a powerful god, the ruler and creator.\\" Ceramics contained designs reminiscent of the sun denoting leadership and power. The blue birds found on some porcelain plates, is said to be the same blue bird that the Tagalog venerated.  Ornaments  Ornaments found between the Neolithic and Metal Age regardless of whether they were locally or non-locally produced point to advancements in technologies and cultures. Non-local ornaments suggest trade was common prior to colonial influences. As a result, it points to a more advanced culture inconsistent with narratives of a primitive culture prior to colonialism. Instead, there are established systems that deal with trading and producing ornaments. Neolithic Jade Ornament  Jade  Although jade ornaments found from the Neolithic period are not local resources from the Philippines, discovery of jade ornaments in Tabon Caves suggests development of culture and technology since it implies early trade with China and Taiwan. Aside from trading relationships being formed, early Filipinos learned to produce similar ornaments made out of jade using metal-drill techniques leading to cultural advancements. Due to jade being an exported good and less accessible, it was considered a prestigious good and therefore associated with high-status and considered a symbol of the wearer's beauty. Metal ornaments resembling jade ornaments continue to be worn by the Ifugao as representations of social status and power.  Shell  While shell ornaments are abundant in Tabon Caves, they were considered less valuable in comparison to exotic goods because of their local availability. This does not mean that shell ornaments were not important. They are still considered important factors in building and maintaining social relationships. Shell ornaments have become embedded in Philippine culture as they have transcended through time despite their lack of prestige.  Sociopolitical Symbolisms  Symbolisms in sociopolitical structures deal with power dynamics in both chiefdoms and governments. In both cases they highlight the importance of wealth and power in maintaining hierarchies that give chiefdoms and government the ability to control communities. Outside influences such as colonialism have affected modern sociopolitical structures, but chiefdoms continue to be a part of Philippine communities.  Chiefdoms  Manila, Capital of the Philippines Chiefdoms are sociopolitical structures that represent systems of wealth and status. Wealth and higher social status in chiefdoms can be achieved through the ability to host massive feasts for the community with prestigious foods, such as meats. On the other hand, wealth and status in Visayan traditions was demonstrated in a different manner than the Ifugao. The community would offer prestigious items to chiefdoms as a form of ritual and therefore prestige came from having the most valuable resources to oneself. As such, there was a link to a prestige goods economy where chiefdoms could control who has access to certain resources. This in itself represents local relationships with trade and serves as a symbol of Philippine political alliances with international bodies. These types of trading systems can be traced back to past forest hunter-gatherer relationships with coastal people that also predate colonial influences.  Government  Manila was established as the capital of the Philippines under colonial government rule and was meant to symbolize a set towards modernization. With modernization of the Philippines arose idea of capitals being a symbol of progress and the way other cities should be. This acts as a way of legitimizing the power held by the government itself. There are also attempts to propose an image of national identity and unity based on the buildings and monuments that are erected in public spaces. However, there lacks mention of the ways in which government exerts their power and control by dictating where and how people live. As a result, capitals such as Manila are heavily influenced by colonial ideologies and continue to affect the way Philippine communities live and the narratives about their past.

Written and illustrated by Tony Cliff, Delilah Dirk started as a webcomic, and now consists of three full graphic novels and one shorter story.  Creation  Writer and illustrator Tony Cliff is a Canadian cartoonist and animator also known for his contributions to the Flight anthology series. He started working on Delilah Dirk as a 30-page comic inspired by the Napoleonic Wars, Indiana Jones, and James Bond. Cliff combined this initial comic with a short story from the Flight anthology with another hundred pages to create the first complete published story, Delilah Dirk and the Turkish Lieutenant. Cliff has also cited Horatio Hornblower and the Sharpe series, as well as the histories of the Elgin Marbles and the Venus de Milo as inspirations. He describes himself as \\"enthusiastic for historical elements\\" but adds that \\"if I feel like some historical accuracy is putting a speed bump in an otherwise smooth story, I’d like to think I’d favor the story over the accuracy.\\" He has also stated that part of the inspiration for the series was to contrast with the humorless depiction of women in late '90s superhero comics.  Works  Delilah Dirk is an action adventure comic set in the 19th century. The main character is a trained sword fighter who fights pirates while travelling the world on her flying boat. Delilah Dirk and the Treasure of Constantinople The first publication of a Delilah Dirk adventure was a 28-page comic made in 2007. It would later become chapter 1 of Delilah Dirk and the Turkish Lieutenant.  Delilah Dirk and the Aqueduct  The next publication of a Delilah Dirk adventure was in Flight Volume 5. Flight was an anthology series, and volume 5 was published in 2008. The pages and plot from this short story would later become chapter 3 of the longer work Delilah Dirk and the Turkish Lieutenant. Delilah Dirk and the Turkish Lieutenant The first book of the series is set in Turkey in 1807. Dirk escapes a Turkish prison while befriending a mild- mannered Jannissary officer named Selim who becomes her sidekick. Dirk then plots to steal treasure from the pirate Zakul. Delilah Dirk and the Seeds of Good Fortune This shorter story, written between The Turkish Lieutenant and The King's Shilling, is 36 pages and is in black and white rather than color like the full graphic novels. Dirk needs to obtain a signature from a corrupt chieftain of a small Greek town, but her plan unravels due to the greedy manipulations of a local merchant.  Delilah Dirk and the King's Shilling  The second graphic novel was released in 2016. In it, Dirk and Selim are accused of espionage against the British crown, and must clear their names. This book was originally tentatively titled Delilah Dirk and the Blades of England.  Delilah Dirk and the Pillars of Hercules  The third graphic novel, released in 2018. It is set in central Asia and relates to the location of the legendary third pillar of Hercules.  Publication history  Delilah Dirk and the Turkish Lieutenant was first published online, starting on May 28, 2011. By December 2011 it was in its fourth chapter and it was fully published online by February 2012. Tony Cliff stated that had always intended The Turkish Lieutenant to become a printed graphic novel, and he serialized the book online to gauge public interest. Delilah Dirk first appeared in print in French, published by Éditions Akileos in 2011. An English print book, which added around a dozen pages to the web version and edited some of its text, was published by First Second Books in 2013. First Second Books has published the subsequent books as well. The second book in the series, Delilah Dirk and the King's Shilling, was partially published online before the release of the book. The first 90 of the 160 pages were published online serially and for free before the book's release. Delilah Dirk and the Pillars of Hercules similarly had about 100 pages released online prior to the print publication of the entire story.  Reception  The Turkish Lieutenant received many positive reviews. Reviewers for Comic Alliance wrote that \\"Delilah Dirk reminds me of the best aspects of classic Disney movies, but skews towards a much more mature audience without being \\"adult\\" in a way that could turn off some readers\\" and \\"sassy lady protagonists are my jam so it's unsurprising that I really enjoy Delilah Dirk. Tony Cliff is an excellent storyteller who keeps the action constantly moving. But most importantly for a book about a sassy lady, he pulls off excellent body language and facial expressions.\\" Reviewing the Turkish Lieutenant, a CBR.com reviewer called it \\"a charming story, saying that \\"Cliff really makes the friendship between Dirk and Selim feel real... These are two fascinating characters who have good chemistry with each other, and the fact that Cliff's writing is so often funny as well as insightful makes this an even more delightful read.\\" It also received positive comments from Boing Boing, io9, and Wired. Delilah Dirk and the Turkish Lieutenant was a New York Times bestseller in 2013. It was named both A Publishers Weekly Best Children's Book of 2013 and Best Teen Book of 2013 by Kirkus Reviews. It was also nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Digital Comic in 2012 and has also received Shuster and Harvey nominations.  Adaptations  In 2016, it was announced that Disney would be adapting Delilah Dirk and the Turkish Lieutenant into a live-action film. Roy Lee was named as one of the producers. As of late 2019 there was no further information on the status of the project.

Description The border starts at the Togolese tripoint, then proceeds briefly overland in a north-western direction, before reaching the Pendjari River, which it then follows for some distance. An overland section then connects up the Mékrou River, which forms the boundary up the tripoint with Niger. Virtually the entire boundary area is protected by various trans-border parks which together form the W-Arly- Pendjari Complex. History During the second half of the 19th century France began creating small trading settlements on the West African coast. In 1851 a treaty of friendship was signed between France and the Kingdom of Dahomey in what is now southern Benin, followed by the creation of a protectorate in Porto Novo in 1863. The colony of Dahomey (the former name of Benin) was declared in 1894, and was later included within the much larger federal colony of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale française, abbreviated AOF) in 1899. The 1880s saw an intense competition between the European powers for territories in Africa, a process known as the Scramble for Africa; the process culminated in the Berlin Conference of 1884, in which the European nations concerned agreed upon their respective territorial claims and the rules of engagements going forward. As a result of this France gained control the upper valley of the Niger River (roughly equivalent to the areas of modern Mali and Niger). France began occupying the area of modern Mali (then often referred to as French Sudan) and Burkina Faso (then called Upper Volta) during the 1880s-90s. This region was organised as Upper Senegal and Niger; various French decrees delimited a border between this colony and Dahomey during the period 1901-14. The colony of Upper Volta (modern Burkina Faso) was constituted in March 1919; the colony was abolished in 1932 and its territory divided between what Niger and Ivory Coast, but it was then reconstituted within its previous borders in 1947. The Dahomey-Upper Volta boundary was finalised by French statue on 27 October 1938. As the movement for decolonisation grew in the post-Second World War era, France gradually granted more political rights and representation for its African territories, culminating in the granting of broad internal autonomy to each colony in 1958 within the framework of the French Community. Dahomey declared full independence on 1 August 1960, followed shortly thereafter by Upper Volta on 5 August, and their mutual frontier became an international boundary between two sovereign states. Parts of the border remained contested on the ground, with several incidents in the disputed areas of Koalou and Niorgou sparking tension in the 2000s. As a result, the two countries signed an agreement in May 2009 which created a small neutral zone in the area, pending a final decision on the matter by the International Court of Justice. In recent years the boundary region had been affected by the ongoing Islamist insurgency in the Sahel, predominantly on the Burkinabe side of the border. In May 2019 two French tourists exploring the Pendjari National Park were kidnapped and their Beninese guide killed. At present third party governments generally advise against travelling in the border region.

She earned her doctoral degree under the supervision of George Polyzos at the University of California, San Diego in 1994. Claffy was a summer intern at AT&T;, Harry Diamond Laboratories and the Federal Reserve. Her years in graduate school occurred during the period in which the federal government of the United States relaxed control over the Internet. The Internet became a more commercial entity interconnecting a rapidly-increasing number of networks, hosts and users, and as the World Wide Web expanded, the nature of the traffic on the Internet changed. This inspired Claffy to develop initiatives that share Internet data and support Internet data analysis.  Research and career  Claffy was promoted to Associate Research Scientist in 1994 and Research Scientist in 2007. In 1996 Claffy founded the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) in the supercomputing centre at the University of California, San Diego. At the CAIDA Claffy works on internet cartography that characterises the changing nature of Internet topology and Internet traffic dynamics. This involves mapping and measuring internet data in an effort to make the internet safer for the general public. Claffy is part of the Named Data Networking project. In 2015, Claffy shared the IEEE Internet Award with Vern Paxson for \\"seminal contributions to the field of Internet measurement, including security and network data analysis, and for distinguished leadership in and service to the Internet community by providing open-access data and tools\\". Her work established definitions for the concept of Internet \\"traffic flows\\", in which most packets flowing across the Internet are understood to be part of a connection with coherent characteristics, rather than isolated, unconnected messages. In 2019, Claffy was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame for her groundbreaking work in the field of internet measurement and analysis.

He was born in the family estate of Giegrany as the second son of Antoni and Kazimiera née Gadon. Because his father took part in January Uprising, the family estate was taken from them by the Russian government. He studied law in Moscow and then at the Imperial University in St. Petersburg. After completing his apprenticeship, he was appointed as an investigating judge in the first district of the city of Chisinau. In 1880 he started to work as a lawyer in St. Petersburg and from 1883 in Vilnius. From 1888, he became involved with his younger brother Witold (father of Stanisław Węsławski, later an underground mayor of Vilnius during World War II) in creating the structures of secret Polish education. He took part in the works of all main Polish institutions. Elected as councilor and in the years 1905-1916 three times as a mayor of the city. His merits for Vilnius include an attempt to implement a plan of the so-called \\"Europeanization\\" of the city. Until the outbreak of World War I, he managed to start the construction of water supply and sewage systems, which was continued in the interwar period. In 1906 he was elected as a member of the Second State Duma where he was the President of the Circle of Lithuania and Ruthenia. He died of a heart attack on August 22, 1917 in Vilnius.

The diseases infects common garden plants, such as cabbage, and are caused by several closely related species of fungi. Some of these fungal species target specific plants, while others have been known to target plant families. One commercially relevant plant genus that can be affected by Alternaria Leaf Spot is Brassica, as the cosmetic issues caused by symptomatic lesions can lead to rejection of crops by distributors and buyers. When certain crops such as cauliflower and broccoli are infected, the heads deteriorate and there is a complete loss of marketability. Secondary soft-rotting organisms can infect stored cabbage that has been affected by Alternaria Leaf Spot by entering through symptomatic lesions. Alternaria Leaf Spot diseases that affect Brassica species are caused by the pathogens Alternaria brassicae and Alternaria brassicicola. Alternaria leaf spot on quaking aspen leaves Hosts and symptoms A. brassicae and A. brassicicola can infect plant species of the genus Brassica. Hosts include broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, kale, rutabaga, Brussels sprout, and mustard. Specifically, plants that have longer periods of leaf wetness are more susceptible to development of the disease. Areas with higher rainfall that experience wet, mild seasons lead to the highest reports of disease incidence. Water promotes disease development as the pathogens only undergo germination and infection after more than nine hours of leaf wetness. A. brassicae and A. brassicicola cause very similar symptoms, with symptoms normally occurring on older leaves, as they are closer to the soil and more likely to be affected by rain splash, which spreads the pathogen. Necrotic lesions bordered by chlorotic halos develop on the leaf surface. These lesions are dark brown to black circular leaf spots with target-like, concentric rings. Shot holing may also occur when lesion centers dry and fall out, similar to the lesions observed in Early Blight caused by Alternaria solani. Symptoms do not usually significantly reduce yields, but they can cause cosmetic issues that reduce marketability of the crop. However, heavy infections of foliage can reduce plant vigor and can result in lower than expected yields. Disease cycle A. brassicae and A. brassicicola produce asexual conidia via conidiophores. At optimum temperatures (20-30 C), the average time of sporulation is 13 hours. Conidia are dispersed via water and wind after sporulation. Once they come into contact with a leaf surface under optimal environmental conditions, germination can begin. Germination of conidia occurs most efficiently when temperatures are higher, with germination time increasing as temperature decreases. Germination occurs most quickly at temperatures between 21 and 28 C. The presence of moisture as water or a high relative humidity (at least 95%) is required for germination. After germination, the pathogen begins to infect the host via penetration of the leaf surface using an appressorium and infection peg. Leaf cells are infected, and the symptomatic lesions begin to appear, with conidia-producing conidiophores being produced from mature lesions. Further dispersal of conidia by water or wind occurs from these new conidiophores. This dispersal can be local from one leaf to an adjacent leaf, or it can be long distance from plant to plant.'The spores can be blown in the wind for distances up to 1.1 miles.'A. brassicae and A. brassicicola survive in the form of microsclerotia and chlamydospores which appear after infected leaves have partially decayed. Both of these survival structures develop best at low temperature (3 C) and they have been found to be resistant to desiccation and freezing. Conidiophores eventually develop from the microsclerotia and chlamydospores, allowing for the production of conidia again and the cycle to repeat. Management A. brassicae and A. brassicicola can be chemically controlled by applying fungicides as foliar sprays. These fungicides include iprodione and chlorothalonil. It is recommended to practice crop rotation with non- cruciferous crops. This creates periods of time when no active pathogen is present in the area due to lack of a host. If there are no pathogens present, they cannot produce microsclerotia and chlamydospores that would eventually be input into the surrounding area via plant debris, reducing chances of future infection. It is also recommended to irrigate in the morning when leaves can dry quickly, and to orient rows according to the wind. Morning irrigation promotes shorter periods of leaf wetness, disrupting the pathogens’ germination and infection. Orientation of rows disrupts dispersal of conidia via wind by reducing contact. Application of straw mulch can reduce disease incidence by acting as a barrier against soil-borne inoculum, disrupting dispersal of conidia from conidiophores developed from microsclerotia and chlamydospores. Maintaining control of cruciferous weeds is another important management practice, as this removes potential hosts for the pathogen that can aid in the spread of the disease.

Activated charcoal is available in powder, tablet and liquid form. Its proponents claim the use of activated charcoal on a regular basis will detoxify and cleanse the body as well as boost one's energy and brighten the skin. Such claims violate basic principles of chemistry and physiology. There is no medical evidence for any health benefits of cleanses or detoxes via activated charcoal or any other method. Charcoal, when ingested, will adsorb vitamins and nutrients as well as prescription medications present in the gastrointestinal tract which can make it dangerous to use unless directed by a medical doctor. Background Production and industrial applications Activated carbon Activated charcoal, also known as activated carbon is commonly produced from high carbon source materials such as wood or coconut husk. It is made by treating the source material with either a combination of heat and pressure, or with a strong acid or base followed by carbonization to make it highly porous. This gives it a very large surface area for its volume, up to 3000 square metres per gram. It has a large number of industrial uses including methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment and air filters in gas masks and respirators. Medical use Activated charcoal for medical use Activated charcoal is used to detoxify people, but only in life threatening medical emergencies such as overdoses or poisonings. As it is indigestible it will only work on poisons or medications still present in the stomach and intestines. Once these have been absorbed by the body the charcoal will no longer be able to adsorb them so early intervention is desirable. Charcoal is not an effective treatment for alcohol, metals or elemental poisons such as lithium or arsenic as it will only adsorb certain chemicals and molecules. It is usually administered by a nasogastric tube into the stomach as the thick slurry required for maximum adsorption is very difficult to swallow. Use in alternative therapies A vegan burger with a charcoal bun Pizza made with charcoal were popular in 2016 as they gave the dough an umami flavor A charcoal biscuit Activated charcoal, as used in cleanses or detoxes, became popular around 2014 after it was brought to mainstream attention by Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop company where it was described as \\"one of the best juice cleanses\\". Since then, it has become a popular additive to many different types of foods and drinks including juices, lemonades, coffee, pastries, ice cream, burgers, pizzas and pet food. The City of New York has banned activated charcoal in food products unless approval for their use is granted from the FDA. Activated charcoal, excluding products designed for emergency medical interventions, is available in many pharmacies, wellness and health food stores in tablet, capsule and powder forms. Claims Proponents of charcoal detoxes claim that it will cleanse the body by aiding in the removal of excess toxins that the body is unable to get rid of by itself. Other claims made include that the use of activated charcoal provides anti-ageing benefits, will increase your energy, brighten your skin, decrease wind and bloating and aid weight loss. Criticism Scott Gavura of Science Based Medicine was highly critical of the use of activated charcoal in the wellness industry. In his 2015 article Activated charcoal: The latest detox fad in an obsessive food culture he said \\"Fake detox, the kind you find in magazines, and sold in pharmacies, juice bars, and health food stores, is make-believe medicine. The use of the term “toxin” in this context is meaningless. There are no toxins named, because there’s no evidence that these treatments do anything at all, but it sounds just scientific enough to be plausible.\\" Sophie Medlin, a lecturer in nutrition and dietetics at King's College in London suggests avoiding the use of activated charcoal cleanses for a number of reasons: *It will bind with nutrients in food present in the stomach and intestines making the food less nutritious. *It will bind with some medications making it dangerous to use if medications have recently been used. *Charcoal will only adsorb particles present in the gastrointestinal tract when it is taken. So if it's being used to adsorb alcohol or cure a hangover from the night before it won't work. *Activated charcoal will slow down the bowel and can cause nausea, constipation and dehydration. Jay Rayner of The Guardian contacted a manufacturer of activated charcoal lemonade to ask about its detoxifying properties. He was told that they make no claims at all about the product. When he then asked how the product detoxes the body he was told that he was confusing the term \\"detox\\" with the medical term \\"detoxification\\". Carrie Dennett of The Seattle Times said of activated charcoal \\"unless you have a rare health condition that renders your liver — or its supporting players: your kidneys, digestive system, lungs and lymphatic system — unable to perform as designed, then your body doesn’t need help. Unless you have overdosed or been poisoned, there’s no substantial evidence that activated charcoal will benefit you.\\" Charcoal is also used as an alternative to whitening products in toothpastes but was found to not be as effective in whitening the teeth as regular products such as hydrogen peroxide.

The company was based in La Vanguardia Airport, Villavicencio. History It was founded in 1956 at the initiative of Captain Hernando Pote Gutiérrez, who had withdrawn from the company Avianca due to disagreements with the head of the company, Martín del Corral. Captain Gutierrez wanted to create a passenger company and compete with Avianca by acquiring the first aircraft, two DC-3 for passenger transports, HK-166 and HK-766, belonging to a company called Tacata. The first and only regular route that Arca managed to operate was Bogotá-Cúcuta for a value of 42 pesos per ticket. A great advertising campaign was made, which announced the new rate. Under pressure from Avianca, Lloyd and Taxader, the Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics (SAUCA) cancelled Arca's passenger routes in the 1960s; Then, it had no choice but to operate only cargo from La Vanguardia Airport. Some time later the base of operations was transferred to the El Dorado airport in Bogotá. During that decade, Arca operated with Douglas DC-3 aircraft (HK-337, HK-338, HK-339, HK-766 and HK-166). The cargo operation connected Bogotá mainly with a large part of the Eastern Plains, joined by Curtiss C-46 HK-1322. Success in the 1970s At the beginning of the 1970s, some of the DC-3s were sold to Aerosucre, Laos and Alianza, all of them cargo operators at the La Vanguardia Airport, while the permit to start operating the route was processed before the SAUCA Charge to Miami. In 1973, SAUCA authorized Arca the cargo operation to Miami International Airport from Bogotá, this was done on an intermediate scale in Barranquilla in the newly acquired Douglas DC-6B, HK-1332. Thus, Arca entered into strong competition with Avinca, Aerocosta and Aerocóndor on the cargo route to Miami. Arca was part of the Big Four airlines of Colombia at that time and was highly considered among other airlines, at that point in the mid-70s it was the peak of its success. In 1975, Arca entered the jet era by leasing a Boeing 707-120F, HK-1773, with a wide cargo door to transport flowers and perishable products between Bogotá and Miami, mainly, a route that had been approved by the SAUCA. This rare Boeing 707 belonged to the Swiss cargo company Phoenix, which retained some emblems during its short operation in Arca. In 1977 the company achieved sufficient financial capacity to acquire its first Douglas DC-8-43 registered as HK-1854, through Alitalia, to increase cargo operations between Bogotá and Miami. This would be the first DC-8 operated in Colombia; In addition, he introduced the new image of the following Arca aircraft, preserving the colors of the Italian airline. The particular thing about this aircraft was that it had no loading door, so loading and unloading operations took a long time. Douglas aircraft in the Arca Fleet Next in the fleet was DC-8-43 HK-1855, also from Alitalia. At that time, Arca became the first Colombian cargo airline to fly the DC-8 to Miami. In addition, they bought a simulator, installed in the former loading area at Miami. Arca was characterized from then, until it ceased operations, for having two DC-8s operating simultaneously. Other cities were included in cargo operations from Miami, such as Cali, Cartagena, Medellín, Barranquilla, San Andrés and Bucaramanga, when there was demand. In January 1981, the first DC-8-50F with wide cargo door, HK-2587-X, was acquired from Braniff. For the first months of operation, the aircraft retained the red color with the Ark emblems. This DC-8 lasted the longest in operation at the company, until the airline ceased operations. Thanks to the acquisition of these new DC-8, with more load capacity, the kind of cargo brought from Miami began to vary. It began to bring cars, spare parts and, in some cases, horses. By the beginning of that decade, Arca closed a temporary contract with Air France to bring cargo from Martinique. In mid-1981, he acquired a Douglas DC-8-30F on lease, through F.A. Conner, whose license plate was N53CA, which operated for a few weeks. By the beginning of 1982, the second Douglas DC-8-50F arrived with a wide cargo door, HK-2667-X, previously operated by Japan Airlines, which is why it was known among Arca's crew as Japanese. Minor troubles The itinerary of the Arca flights with flowers and other perishable items, at that time, was scheduled to leave Bogotá at dawn to arrive in Miami very early in the morning. The aircraft was unloaded and was ready before noon to return to Colombia. In mid-1982, Douglas DC-8 HK-2587-X suffered an accident arriving at Cali from Miami, leaving the runway due to a hydraulic failure and loss of nosewheel steering, a factor aggravated by the wet runway. The break at the airport lasted for three days, while the aircraft was removed and the runway cleared. The aircraft returned to operations after repair. 1980s In the early eighties, the arrival from Miami at Olaya Herrera Airport, Medellín was sometimes considered a feat of the pilots. Since the aircraft arrived with full cargo on most flights and was sometimes overloaded. Sometimes, after landing, the aircraft's tires deflated on the platform because of a safety valve that overheated due to the intensive braking that was needed to stop the aircraft. In addition, for this aircraft only runway 19 was available to land, even with tail wind. Which definitely slowed down all flights at Olaya Herrera Airport and made the mechanics jobs much easier if no flights are going out. During the 1980s, Arca initiated operating agreements with the cargo airline, Ecuador Andes, thus the Douglas DC-8 HK-2667X was transferred to it, and shared flights were initiated to the Quito International Airport from Miami and Colombia. By the end of that decade an additional Douglas DC-8 was acquired, the N121GA, later registered as HK-3746-X. 1990s At the beginning of the last decade, after having signed the Open Skies Agreement of the Andean Pact, especially with Venezuela, Arca processed before the SAUCA the authorization to transport passengers between Cartagena and Miami with seven weekly frequencies in Douglas DC-8 aircraft for 180 passengers at a cost of $279, about half of what an ordinary ticket cost; He also requested permission to fly the Bogotá-Cartagena, Cartagena-Medellín and Cartagena-Cali routes with passengers. Arca's request was supported by the National Tourism Corporation (NTC). His representative, Luis Baldión, said at the public hearing that the request was presented that the entity supported the initiative that tends to make tourism an industry. Dozens of Colombians in Miami joined their voice to call to break the monopoly and lower air fares between the United States and Colombia. In the Colombia la Grande radio program, broadcast by WRHC Cadena Azul, calls were received from the public to support Arca, who also sent his signatures of support to the head of the SAUCA at that time, José Joaquín Palacio Campuzano. Days after studying the petition, the SAUCA denied Arca the approval of these routes. The decision adopted was based on the recommendation of the Higher Aeronautical Council, which considered it inconvenient for the company, to operate cargo, to move passengers, in particular on the most important routes for the country. After knowing the refusal of the SAUCA, Captain Gutierrez founded the airline in Venezuela and taking advantage of the bilateral agreement within the framework of the Andean Pact, he began operating with passenger routes between different cities of Colombia and Miami via Maracaibo with DC equipment- 8 and Boeing 727 at really cheaper prices. In 1992, one of the last Douglas DC-8-50F operated by the airline, the N5842A, was acquired on leasing, which was completely white. In June 1993, one of the most unusual events in the history of Arca occurred. To the surprise of many, a stowaway boy, Guillermo Rosales, 13, was found alive on the landing gear of a company Douglas DC-8, at Miami International Airport, at 2 a.m., in a flight with flowers from Bogotá. The fact astonished doctors and aviation experts, since the boy survived the extreme conditions of temperature and lack of oxygen. The decade of the nineties would mark a crisis not only for Arca, but for all Colombian freight airlines, because of several circumstances that combined against the airline industry in the country. The main one was drug trafficking, a ballast that a large investment in security, regulated by the FAA, was required to combat it, in order to operate in the United States, in addition to the noise restriction, which forced Stage I and hush kits to be adopted, which it would increase the unforeseen expenses that the airlines had to make in their Douglas DC-8, in addition to the decertification that the country suffered due to the Samper government scandal. By mid-1994 one of the Douglas DC-8, HK-3125-X, ended its useful life and was grounded. Contacts were made to acquire a Douglas DC-10-10 (F) on lease, with construction number 46727, but the transaction was canceled. During the following years it was increasingly difficult to continue loading operations; FAA pressure became increasingly rigorous while the tough competition of international freight airlines made the operation less profitable. On January 24, 1997, Arca was intervened by the SAUCA. The director of the entity, Abel Enrique Jiménez, and the head of the Office of Control and Security, Captain Germán Duarte, said that in the process of inspection (or search for recertification), they had to paralyze the operation they had been carrying out the aircraft of the company, because they did not meet the requirements to fly to the United States. So the company was under fire for having not completed the inspection on aircraft and the financial status of the company. The immobilization of each DC-8 represented for the company a 50% decrease in its revenues and that since the beginning of 1996 the SAUCA was lowered by the FAA to category two, for not exercising an adequate inspection on the airlines. In mid-1997 the FAA fined Arca with a sum of $68,000, for not complying with a maintenance plan.

It is housed in the Palatine Gallery of the Pitti Palace in Florence, Italy. Description The painting depicts a mystical event occurring to the 13th-century Franciscan tertiary, Margaret of Cortona. In the painting, she swoons while upheld by two angels, and has a vision of a Christ aloft on a cloud, showing her his stigmata. Margaret narrated that in the vision, Christ called her my beloved daughter. Margaret's waist is girded with the rope cincture that characterizes members of the Franciscan orders. The small dog at her feet is a common feature of her iconography; it recalls the story that her dog found the body of her murdered lover, this event her life triggered her movement towards an eremetic life. The bare background is dark but rises to a luminous gilded light surround the figure of Christ. The baroque arrangement by Lanfranco, places the figures along a diagonal in the canvas and grants a realistic solidity to the characters, focusing the attention on Margaret's psychic state and not only her overpowering miraculous vision. The veneration of Saint Margaret of Cortona was prominent in Tuscany. The painting was commissioned in 1622 by Nicolo Gerolamo Venuti, whose coat of arms is at the lower left, and decorated at the main altar for the church of Santa Maria Nuova in Cortona.Historical Dictionary of Baroque Art and Architecture, 2nd Edition, by Lilian H Zirpolo (2018), page 222. It was purchased for the palace by Prince Ferdinand de' Medici, who provided to the church a replacement canvas on the same subject by Giuseppe Maria Crespi.Baroque, by John Rupert Martin (2018), entry #74. This painting is now in the Diocesan Museum of Cortona.Cortona Tourism portal. Lanfranco in his design appears to show the influence of Caravaggio's oil painting depicting St Francis in Ecstasy (1596). In turn, this painting may have influenced the design of the statuary group (1645-1662) depicting the Ecstasy of St Theresa by Gian Lorenzo Bernini.Zirpolo, page 222.

His teaching and research work was undertaken through positions at the University of Melbourne, CSIRO and the National Museum of Victoria (now Melbourne Museum).  Early life  Baker was born at Coventry, Warwickshire, England on 10 October 1908. His mother died when he was seven months old and he was first cared for by his aunt, then later was placed under the guardianship of a Quaker solicitor. He won a scholarship to Leominster Grammar School, where he thrived as a scholar and athlete, becoming a school prefect as a senior. Baker migrated to Victoria, Australia in March 1925 at the age of 16 to live with relatives.  University of Melbourne  George Baker c1940 Baker found work on reaching Melbourne almost immediately, being selected as a junior assistant at the University of Melbourne's Geology School in April 1925. Through the encouragement and patronage of Ernest Willington Skeats, he was permitted to attend lectures and was subsequently admitted to a Bachelor of Science. On graduating, he then completed his Masters degree conducting field and laboratory research on the geological properties of the You Yangs to the southwest of Melbourne, through which he became known for \\"his meticulous thoroughness, his dependability, and his courage in overcoming difficulties.\\"  Australites  Baker's scientific work was concerned with australites, tektites with unique properties found in Australia. These are small bodies composed of black, green, brown, or gray natural glass. While the button-like presentation of many australites fuelled early conjecture about their human- made origins, scientific analysis established these objects are formed from the molten, terrestrial debris ejected during meteorite impacts. Baker's work supported the theory that the \\"assemblage of shape types discovered is more likely an outcome of natural phenomena than of selective accumulation by Aboriginal man.\\" Indeed, some Aboriginal groups in Western Australia and the Nullabor Plains directly associated tektites with meteors and cosmic impacts - the \\"sky stones\\" were \\"valuable to Indigenous cultures as surgical tools and implements for use in ritual and ceremony.\\" His work ranged to the \\"specific gravity relationships\\" that contributed to the formation of these phenomena. Baker was recognised for the quality of his research work by the University of Melbourne through award of the David Syme Research Prize in 1944, and was conferred the degree of Doctor of Science (DSc) by the university in 1956.  Later career  Maintaining his base at the University's Geology School, Baker accepted the role of research officer with CSIRO's mineragraphic section, later promoted to of senior principal research scientist by the time of his retirement in 1968. He also maintained a role as honorary associate in mineralogy with the National Museum of Victoria. Baker's research work on australites, meteorites and petrology in Victoria was published in Australia by the Royal Society of Victoria in its Proceedings and Transactions, by the Museum in its Memoir, and with many international journals including Nature, the American Journal of Science and American Mineralogist. In all, he published 135 papers and monographs. Baker was a fellow of the Mineralogical Society of America and the Meteoritical Society, a life member of the American Geophysical Union, the Mineralogical Society of Great Britain and Ireland, and the Royal Society of Victoria, and a foundation member of the Geological Society of Australia. He was commissioner for Australia of the International Committee on Meteorites of the International Geological Commission. George Baker was the inaugural recipient of the Royal Society of Victoria's Medal for Excellence in Scientific Research, awarded in 1959 on the centenary of the Society's formal foundation.  Death and legacy  George Baker died in Melbourne on 25 August 1975, leaving his extensive collection of 2,500 Victorian tektites to the National Museum of Victoria and a portrait painted by Melbourne artist Orlando Dutton to the Royal Society of Victoria.

The first Kenyan project that was financed by the World Bank was the African Agriculture Project, the World Bank issued the then British Colony with $5.6 million dollars to invest in infrastructure that was vital to developing Kenya's agricultural sector. Description The World Bank has maintained its relationship with Kenya and continues to finance development projects. Kenya receives loans from both the IDA and IBRD agencies of the World Bank which are designed to help low and middle income countries. The World Bank has publicly stated its support for the signature \\"Big 4 Agenda\\" of President Uhuru Kenyatta, which aims to develop Kenya's manufacturing sector while improving access to healthcare, nutrition, and affordable housing. The World Bank has also stated their support for Kenya's \\"Vision 2030\\", which is a development blueprint to turn Kenya into a middle income nation by 2030.The World Bank's country director for Kenya is C. Felipe Jaramillo, he also acts as the country director for Rwanda, Somalia, and Uganda. The World Bank has increased the value of its lending to Kenya in recent years, from $623 million in 2019 to $1.27 billion in 2019.  Criticisms  Critics of the World Bank have raised concerns about the impact of their loans on Kenya's debt problem. The debt held by the Kenyan government has more than doubled in the past 6 years to over $50 billion. In 2019 Kenya raised their legal debt limit as their debt exceeded its previous cap of 50% of GDP. The World Bank has also been criticised for an alleged lack of concern about the negative impacts to the environment and the livelihood of local communities that projects they support may have. The Accountability Counsel and other NGO groups have alleged that World Bank funds are contributing towards the building of a coal-fired power plant in the coastal region of Lamu despite concerns about pollution and the displacement of local communities. Widespread accusations about the corrupt use of funds designated to infrastructure projects in Kenya has caused concerns about the potential for the misuse of World Bank loans. Corruption reports by the Kenyan government estimate that up to 70% of corruption in Kenya may be associated with the process of procuring government contracts, many of these contracts are financed through money borrowed from foreign governments and international financial institutions. The World Bank's Office of Suspension and Debarment has suspended and disbarred several Kenyan companies and individuals on the grounds of alleged corruption. The World Bank's IDA agency which finances projects in low income countries has included a greater emphasis on combatting corruption in its most recent reports. The IDA has committed to several projects with the goal of increasing accountability and transparency in the government's of low income countries.

Artists display and sell works of various media, including paintings, sculptures, and electronic art. In the artist community in Paris, people debate whether the formally established art galleries provide more opportunities for the artists who work there or inhibit the artistic process.

Asher Angel performed during the ceremony. It aired live on Nickelodeon and in a domestic simulcast with several other ViacomCBS cable networks, and tape delayed across all of Nickelodeon's international networks.

On March 7, the outdoor aspects of SlimeFest were postponed to a future date due to public health concerns regarding the coronavirus pandemic, before the network cancelled the event as a whole.

Biography Elvira Badaracco was born in Alessandria, Italy. As a teenager she moved with her parents to Milan.  Political career  From 1963 she began to devote herself to political activity; the following year she enrolled in the Italian Socialist Party, dealing with social and women's issues. In those years she also joined the Unione donne italiane. From 1964 to 1970 she was secretary of the Morandi Section, elected councilor for zone 5 of Milan and, as party representative, entered the Administrative Board of the Ronzoni Surgical Institute and then into the Board of Directors of Clinical Specialization Institutes. As provincial and then regional head of the PSI she organized many conferences on the history of socialist women, work, health of women workers and abortion. In 1974 she began writing articles at L'Avanti! and other national newspapers. From 1979 to 1980 she became city councilor in Milan for the PSI. Center for Historical Studies In 1979 she founded the \\"Center for Historical Studies on the Women's Liberation Movement in Italy\\" with Pierrette Coppa and served as its president until her death in 1994. The Center was created: > With the aim of collecting, organizing, preserving and making available the > wealth of knowledge and practices developed by the women's movement, in the > belief that the protection and enhancement of the history of feminism and > the history of women in general constitutes a value not only scientific and > cultural, but also - and above all - political. The Center carries out an intense political and cultural activity in Milan and collects documentation on the feminist movement on an ongoing basis. In her will, Elvira Badaracco donated her assets to the Study Center, naming Annarita Buttafuoco as the life guarantor of the economic, scientific and political heritage she left behind, requiring the transformation of the Center into a Foundation. The Elvira Badaracco Foundation was established in December 1994 and Marina Zancan was named president. On the death of Annarita Buttafuoco in 1999, the role of guarantor passed to Marina Zancan.

Orr has work in both public and private collections, and shows her work nationally as well as internationally. Orr's work can be see in the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco and in Korea in the collection of the WOCEF.  Education  Orr earned her BFA in 1983 from the University of Texas in Austin. She did post- graduate studies at the Southwest Craft Center in San Antonio and the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. In addition, she studied with Betty Woodman at the University of Colorado in Boulder in 1989, before earning her MFA at The New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University in 1992.  Studio work  Orr works in earthenware clay, using a variety of processes that include using the potter's wheel as well as a ram press and press molds, often using multiple processes to produce one piece. Her work, which includes platters, bowls and plates, are organic in form and functional in purpose. Orr's work is primarily influenced by Mexican folk pottery and is characterized by the terra sigillata, stamps, slips and sprigs she uses to finish the surface, and by her layers of multi-colored glazes. Orr believes that studio pottery is artistically significant and as a result and in collaboration with five other artists, co-founded the Art of the Pot studio tour. This is an invitational tour where nationally known potters are invited to show their work along with the collaborators in their studios. She has been awarded grants including a Fulbright, National Endowment for the Arts and the Mid-America Arts Alliance.

The term appears in Greek and Syriac writings mainly to refer to extreme forms of Miaphysitism.Sergey Minov, \\"Date and Provenance of the Syriac Cave of Treasures: A Reappraisal\\", Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies 20,1 (2017): 129–229, esp. at 141–145. The term evokes the second-century heresy of Docetism, both accused of denying the full reality of Jesus' humanity.John Chapman, \\"Eutychianism\\", in The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 5 (Robert Appleton Company, 1909). The first targets of the label were the Eutychians, the followers of Eutyches. In a letter read before the Council of Chalcedon (451), Pope Leo the Great castigates the phantasmatici Christiani (Christian phantasmatics) in a clear reference to the Eutychians. Moderate Miaphysites like Timothy Aelurus, Philoxenus of Mabbug and Severus of Antioch also labelled the Eutychians phantasiasts. One Miaphysite oath administered to those returning to Miaphysitism from heresy called for the abjuration of the Phantasiasts. The use of the label Phantasiasts by both Dyophysites and moderate Miaphysites indicates the extreme nature of the position relative to orthodox theologies.Aloys Grillmeier and Theresia Hainthaler, Christ in Christian Tradition, Volume 2: From the Council of Chalcedona (451) to Gregory the Great (590–604), Part 4: The Church in Alexandria, with Nubia and Ethiopia after 451 (Westminster John Knox Press, 1996), p. 23. In the middle of sixth century, the term Phantasiasts was applied to the Aphthartodocetae, the followers of Julian of Halicarnassus, the theological foe of Severus of Antioch. It was in this sense that Patriarch Sergius I of Antioch used the term in the late 550s when writing to the Miaphysite bishops of Persia about receiving back those who had lapsed into the \\"heresy of Julian the Phantasiast\\". The poet George of Pisidia also describes Phanatasiasts in his poem celebrating the emperor Heraclius' campaign of 622 against the Persians. The term was also applied to the Gaianites (latter-day Aphthartodocetae) and in this sense was used into the ninth century.Grillmeier and Hainthaler (1996), p. 48.

Taxonomy  Anoteropsis cantuaria was described by arachnologist Cor Vink in 2002. He named the species cantuaria after the New Zealand province of Canterbury, the only place it occurs. The male and female holotype and allotype were collected by Vink in Prices Valley, Banks Peninsula in 1994 and 1990 respectively, and in the Lincoln University Entomology Research Collection (LUNZ). Other paratype specimens collected by Vink and John Early were lodged in LUNZ and the New Zealand Arthropod Collection.  Description  A. cantuaria males have bodies 7–10 mm long, females 8–11.5. Their body is orange-brown, with a black brown abdomen bearing a faint stripe. Legs are yellow brown with faint rings. A. cantuaria is similar to A. lacustris, but lighter in colour. Males can be distinguished from other New Zealand wolf spiders by the shape of the median apophysis on the palpal bulbs – the apophysis on the bulb of A. cantuaria has a slightly more rounded bend than A. lacustris. Females can be distinguished by the shape of the sclerites of the epigyne, which have backward-pointing hoods.  Habitat and distribution  A. cantuaria is only found in Canterbury, New Zealand, and lives amongst the rocks and stones of riverbeds, especially the shallow braided rivers that are characteristic of the Canterbury Plains. Specimens have been collected from Waipara Gorge, Waihi Gorge, and the Opihi River.  Life history  Ventral view of holotype Adult spiders are found from spring to autumn (September to April). Eggs are laid in October, and a female carrying spiderlings in typical wolf spider fashion was found in mid- summer (January).

He was a Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Waterloo. Godambe was known for formulating and developing a theory of estimating equations. Early life and education Godambe was born on June 1, 1926, in Pune, India as the second oldest of four children. He was frail and sickly growing up so he attended the local school from age five to 10. Godambe later attended Nutan Marathi Vidyalaya in Pune and Fergusson College for his Bachelor of Science in mathematics. After earning his Masters degree, Godambe accepted a position in the Bureau of Economics and Statistics with the Government of Bombay. While there, he submitted papers for publication in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society and Bulletin of the Bureau of Economics and Statistics, Bombay. Godambe shortly thereafter left Bombay to pursue a PhD at the University of London, and accepted a fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley. Upon his return, and completion of his thesis, Godambe was appointed a Senior Research Fellow at the Indian Statistical Institute and Professor and Head of the Statistics Department in Nagpur. Career Godambe eventually left Nagpur and accepted a position at Bombay University as a Professor for one year. He then moved to North America and worked at the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, alongside Ivan Fellegi, then taught at Johns Hopkins University, University of Michigan, and finally the University of Waterloo. Godambe began his career at the University of Waterloo in July 1967 as a visiting professor in Statistics and Actuarial Sciences but was granted tenure as Professor in July 1969. A few years later, in 1971, Godambe and Mary Thompson read a paper to the Royal Statistical Society entitled ‘Bayes, fiducial, and frequency aspects of statistical inference in survey sampling. From there, “Godambe’s paradox” was invented. Based on the paper published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, he demonstrated that the likelihood principle implies that inference should be independent of the sampling design in general, which led to the development of model theory in survey sampling. His method of estimating equations argued that all statistical inferences should adhere to his \\"ancillarity principle.\\" Awards and honours In 1987, Godambe was honoured with the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC) Gold Medal and was later named an honorary member. In 1991, he was appointed a Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Waterloo. In 2002, Godambe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

She is most often identified as Mary Ludwig Hays, who fought in the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778. Another possibility is Margaret Corbin, who helped defend Fort Washington in New York in November 1776. However, various Molly Pitcher tales have grown in the telling, and many historians regard \\"Molly Pitcher\\" as folklore rather than history, or suggest that Molly Pitcher may be a composite image inspired by the actions of a number of real women. The name itself may have originated as a nickname given to women who carried water to men on the battlefield during War.  Mary Ludwig Hays  The deeds in the story of Molly Pitcher are generally attributed to Mary Ludwig Hays. Hays was the wife of William Hays, an artilleryman in the Continental Army. She joined him at the Army's winter camp at Valley Forge in 1777, and was present at the Battle of Monmouth, where she served as a water-carrier. When her husband fell she took his place swabbing and loading the cannon, and after the action was commended by George Washington. The incident was recorded by Joseph Plumb Martin in his memoir published in 1830.  Margaret Corbin  The story of Margaret Corbin bears similarities to the story of Mary Hays. Margaret Corbin was the wife of John Corbin of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, also an artilleryman in the Continental army. On November 16, 1776, John Corbin was one of 2,800 American soldiers who defended Fort Washington in northern Manhattan from 9,000 attacking Hessian troops under British command. When John Corbin was wounded and killed, Margaret took his place at the cannon, and continued to fire it until she was seriously wounded in the arm. In 1779, Margaret Corbin was awarded an annual pension of $50 by the state of Pennsylvania for her heroism in battle. She was the first woman in the United States to receive a military pension. Her nickname was \\"Captain Molly\\".Koestler-Grack, Rachel A. Molly Pitcher: Heroine of the War for Independence. Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2006. . Deborah Sampson Deborah Sampson has also been posited as an inspiration for Molly Pitcher.Will the Real Molly Pitcher Please Stand Up? Teipe, Emily J. Sampson disguised herself as a man and enlisted under an assumed name; because of her smooth complexion and high-pitched voice she was nicknamed \\"Molly\\" by her comrades. After her discharge she successfully petitioned for a pension as a veteran, one of only two women (the other was Corbin) to receive such. Identification Historian Emily Teipe, in considering the identity of Molly Pitcher, has suggested these three possibilities, but has also pointed out 'The historical record presents other candidates too numerous to mention' and contends that 'the name Molly Pitcher is a collective generic term, much like \\"G.I. Joe\\"'; it serves as a common label for the 'hundreds, perhaps thousands, of women (who) served not only as ammunition wives, manning and firing the guns, but also in the army and colonial militia'.

Earlier that year, festivities had been planned to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Monmouth. Stamp collectors petitioned the U.S. Post Office Department for a commemorative stamp to mark the anniversary. After receiving several rejections, New Jersey congressman Ernest Ackerman, a stamp collector himself, enlisted the assistance of the majority leader of the House, John Q. Tilson. Postmaster General Harry New steadfastly refused to issue a commemorative stamp specifically acknowledging the battle or Molly Pitcher. In a telegram to Tilson, Postmaster New explained, \\"Finally, however, I have agreed to put a surcharged title on ten million of the regular issue Washington 2¢ stamps bearing the name 'Molly Pitcher.'\\" Molly was finally pictured on an imprinted stamp on a postal card issued in 1978 for the 200th anniversary of the battle.

Biography Born in Lecco in 1904, she lost her father and began working in a factory at the age of ten. She began to frequent unions and participating in the occupation of factories during the strikes of 1919-1920. It was at this time that she met Gaetano \\"Nino\\" Invernizzi, who soon became her companion in political activism as well as in private life. Marriage and Communist Party activism In 1922 Nino joined the Communist Party of Italy and was soon forced to emigrate to Paris. Francesca managed to join him there in 1924. They married the next year. In 1929, Francesca also joined the Communist Party, starting a long period of political commitment in the Italian-speaking group of the French Communist Party and, because of political persecution, she was forced to move with her husband to Belgium and then to Luxembourg. In 1932 they returned to Paris and were given the task of making clandestine trips to Italy to introduce the party press and reorganize the communist apparatus, while in the following two years they were invited to Moscow at the School of the Communist International. On their return in 1935 they resumed their journeys to Italy until their arrest, which took place in Milan on 13 June 1936. On May 22, 1937 the Special Court for the Defense of the State sentenced Nino to 14 years and Francesca to 8, on charges of conspiracy against the State and the re-establishment of the Communist Party. Francesca was imprisoned at the women's penitentiary in Perugia, where she served four years and left, following an amnesty, in 1941. She then returned to Lecco where she found a job and resumed political activity. After the fall of Mussolini on 25 July 1943, Nino was also released from prison and resumed his political activities in Lecco, alternating his work underground with the partisan struggle in the mountains. The battle of Piani d'Erna On September 9, 1943 Francesca participated in the partisan band \\"Carlo Pisacane\\", commanded by Renato Carenini and of which Nino was political commissary. Thus began the Resistance in the mountains of Lecco. On 17 October 1943, at the Piani d'Erna, was the eponymous battle, one of the first of the Italian Resistance, which was also attended by Francesca Ciceri. Here the Fascists managed to break through the lines of the Resistance and the partisans (including Francesca and Nino), were forced to retreat in Valsassina and in the Bergamo area. After the battle the two were called by the Party to Milan. In 1944 Francesca lost her brother Pietro, deported to Mauthausen-Gusen, and her 21-year-old nephew Lino, arrested in Lecco and shot during the Cibeno massacre, while her husband Nino was seriously ill due to the eight hard years he spent in prison. The end of the war After the Liberation, Nino took on important union duties and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Italian Communist Party. Francesca continued her activity directing the network of Gruppi di Difesa della Donna (Women's Defense Groups) and entering the Committee of the Milanese Federation of the Party, activities that she had to subsequently reduce for health reasons and to attend to her seriously ill husband. After Nino's death in 1959, Francesca returned to settle in Lecco becoming president of the provincial section of the National Association of Italian Partisans between 1980 and 1988. In 1977 the city of Lecco awarded her the gold medal for patriotic and civil merits. She died in her hometown in 1988 and was buried at the cemetery of Acquate, next to her husband. In January 2019, two memorial blocks were placed for her brother Pietro and her nephew Lino in front of their home in Via Resegone, 16.

But they had finished in a disappointing 11th place in the League, which meant there would be no European football in the new season. 1978–79 was Jim McLaughlin's fifth season as manager, and was Dundalk's 53rd consecutive season in the top tier of Irish football. Season summary The previous season had been dogged by an early season row over player expenses, which had seen two players depart acrimoniously; while the death of club stalwart Brian McConville after returning home from a match in January 1978 had further affected the club. There were rumours that McLaughlin would be let go, despite retaining the Leinster Cup, and winning their first League Cup in a penalty shoot-out over Cork Alberts. Instead, the club supported the \\"reorganisation\\" he demanded, and used funds from the sale of three players (Synan Braddish, Derek Carroll and Brian Duff) to Liverpool, for a combined £55,000, to rebuild the squad and make ground improvements at Oriel. The new season opened inauspiciously, with both the League Cup and the Leinster Cup being surrendered in their respective first rounds in early September. The League schedule commenced on 10 September 1978 and Dundalk continued their slow start, dropping points in eight of the first 15 matches to lie in fourth position. But, starting with a win over Shamrock Rovers on Christmas Eve, they only dropped three points from the next 14 matches to surge to the title with a game to spare. It was confirmed in slightly surreal fashion – with a win away to Cork Celtic (who were about to be expelled from the League) in front of 200 people; while the trophy was presented in Oriel Park 48 hours later after a final-day defeat to FAI Cup final opponents Waterford. Having made light work of reaching the 1979 FAI Cup Final, they defeated Waterford 2–0, thereby completing the club's first League and Cup Double.

Biography Born in Udine, after having lived in Trieste and Verona, she moved to Milan to attend the Faculty of Medicine. In January 1944 she joined the Youth Front for National Independence and Freedom of Eugenio Curiel. On 4 July she was arrested; after a brief period in San Vittore, she was interned in the Bolzano Transit Camp. She luckily succeeded avoiding deportation to Germany. From this experience came the novel La condizione sperimentale. Once free, she obtained her degree in Medicine. In Milan she also cemented her political commitment: first in the ranks of the Italian Socialist Party, and from 1951 in the Italian Communist Party. She held the positions of provincial councilor from 1960 to 1970 and subsequently, until 1980, of regional councilor of Lombardy. She was secretary of the Casa della Cultura, founded and directed the Gramsci Association, and participated in the foundation of the Lega per l'ambiente (today Legambiente) in which she was president of the Scientific Committee. In 1987 she was elected to the Chamber of Deputies. Environmentalism The environmentalism of Laura Conti had a component of strong humanity that was rooted in her experience in the Resistance. These roots were shared with another figure of the enlightened Milan, Ercole Ferrario. Conti liked to repeat: \\"I am not a scientist, but a scholar of ecological problems. While finding the study fascinating, I think it is also important to act and operate. For this reason I decided to do politics: it is not enough to study, we must also get busy.\\" On 10 July 1976 the Seveso disaster occurred. From Icmesa, a factory north of Milan, a toxic cloud came out containing many kilos of dioxin, a substance then almost unknown, which falls on the town. Conti was then a regional councilor and did not spare her help and comfort to the inhabitants of Seveso. With the publications Visto da Seveso and Una lepre con la faccia di bambina [A hare with the face of a child], the popularity of Laura Conti transcended national borders. On June 24, 1982, Brussels approved the directive on the risks of accidents associated with certain industrial activities that will be called the \\"Seveso Directive.\\" In 1986 she was awarded the Minerva Award for her scientific and cultural path.

Biography She was born in Pertuis, Vaucluse, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region and was known as \\"Magali\\" to her family. She was the eldest of three daughters of Lucie Marie Joséphine Maurizot and Émile Rouvière, an army administrator with the rank of artillery lieutenant, a former student of one of the Grandes écoles, the École Polytechnique known as l'X, and a knight of the Legion of honour. In 1908, she achieved her :fr:Certificat d'études supérieures préparatoires (English: Graduate preparatory certificate) in physics, chemistry and natural sciences with good honours. In 1910, she became the first woman to be accepted at another of the Grandes écoles, the highly selective and prestigious École Normale Supérieure of Rue d'Ulm Street (ENS) after her case was discussed and her enrolment confirmed by the :fr:Conseil supérieur de l'Instruction publique. On her behalf, her egalitarian father had asked the director of the ENS - the celebrated historian Ernest Lavisse - to allow her entry. It was agreed, the administration having discussed prior successes of two other young women in mathematics and natural sciences, Liouba Bortniker and Marie Robert respectively (Rouvière's sister, Jeanne, enrolled two years later). In 1913, she followed this by becoming the first female winner of the :fr:Agrégation de sciences physiques, a competition for the recruitment of teachers for schools and universities: successful students of the school are regarded as civil servants. She undertook a doctoral scholarship for two years, unencumbered by the wartime obligations of the male students. Her studentship at the ENS had been reported nationally with contrary attitudes. The front page of Le Matin - illustrated with a photograph of Rouvière - bore the headline, \\"La première taupine de France.\\" [Taupe is ENS argot for a student of preparatory science courses, hence the feminine form, taupine]. It stated that here was a young woman whose drive bypassed the expected frivolities of youth towards \\"transcendental mathematics.\\" Conversely, she was scoffed at in Femina - a conservative and bourgeois-leaning women's magazine - which clamed that out of over a thousand women interviewed, most did not approve of her presence there. Femina included a photograph of the three Rouvière sisters - Marguerite, Jeanne and Madeleine - and commented on her sister, Jeanne, who was aiming to go to the Lycée Buffon, that \\"more than one pupil would find 'the teacher' more attractive than the subjects.\\" (Jeanne spent two years at Lycée Buffon and afterwards published a translation of Albert Einstein's special and general theories of relativity). At the ENS itself, initial surprise among many gave way to curiosity and interest towards a \\"balanced and intelligent girl.\\" She was supported by practising catholics there. However, as an ENS existed for young women at Sèvres, some considered that she was therefore taking the place of a young man, without having to do national service. A number of teaching staff bemoaned Rouvière's inclusion, including Henri Abraham, the professor of Physics (later to be killed in Auschwitz concentration camp) who excoriated her about a [quite accurate] statement she made on a difficult topic, leaving her in tears. In this environment, she was helped by her colleague, Jean Rivière, whom she later married. She was only able to claim \\"licence holder\\" status as a woman [statut de boursière de licence] from her time at the ENS - for example, she could not teach in a boys' school or be entitled to a pension until a ministerial decree of 1927. She translated into French the work of father-and-son Nobel-prize winners William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg, X-Rays and Crystal Structure, and that of the discoverer of the eponymous Lyman series of ultraviolet emission lines Theodore Lyman, The Spectroscopy of the Extreme Ultra-Violet. She was scientific editor of a French translation of Frank E. Weston's Practical Manual of Organic Analysis. She married Jean Rivière (born 18 May 1889) on 17 October 1916. He was the son of a librarian from Douai and became a naval engineer and then a researcher for the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). She gave up teaching during motherhood. She had three children, Jacques (1918), Michel (1924) and Danielle (1927). Jacques enrolled at ENS in 1939 but became ill. Rouvière asked to be reassigned from the Lycée Fénelon, Paris, to Marseille or Grenoble during his recovery (he'd gone to Marseille, where his father worked) and was finally employed at Aix- en-Provence. When Jacques got better he resumed his studies in Marseille, and Rouvière was reinstated in her Paris job. However, Jacques died in July 1943, and she was assigned a less demanding role at the Lycée et collège Victor- Duruy. As a teacher, from April to July 1915, she worked at the Lycée Pasteur (Neuilly-sur-Seine) for eight hours per week. Through the remainder of 1915 and 1916 she taught Physics without full teaching status for six hours weekly at Lycée Carnot in Paris. She was a teacher for scientific preparatory work - that is for the same competitive state scientific environment she succeeded in - at the boys' high school in Toulon for entry to the naval school (from January 1930, at the request of the management). In 1930, she became the first female member of the :fr:Union des professeurs de classes préparatoires scientifiques (Accueil  prepas.org). In 1933, she taught science at the girls' high school in Toulon. Later she taught at the lycée Fénelon (1936-1942, then 1943), with an interlude at the girl's high school in Tournon, Ardèche (1939-1940), then Aix-en-Provence (1942-1943) and finally the lycée et collège Victor-Duruy (1943-1955). Her peers described her \\"luminous intelligence\\" and \\"exceptional mastery, without any weakness\\". She retired in 1955 and settled in Aix-en-Provence. She died on January 30, 1966, aged 76. She was buried in a religious ceremony at Jouques, 25 kilometres north-east of Aix-en-Provence. Jean Rivière was buried in the same plot after his death on 16 June 1975.

Biography  Alfonso García-Valdecasas was born on 14 May 1904 in Montefrio, Granada. He obtained a doctorate of law from the University of Bologna in 1925, and became a chair at the university. Together with Fernando de los Ríos, Luis Jiménez de Asúa, Felipe Sánchez-Román Gallifa, Wenceslao Roces and José Ortega y Gasset, García-Valdecasas resigned from his position as chair in 1929 in protest due to Spanish leader Miguel Primo de Rivera's persecution of student politicians. In 1931, García-Valdecasas joined the parliamentary group known as Agrupación al Servicio de la República (\\"The Grouping at the Service of the Republic\\"), an organization of intellectuals created by José Ortega y Gasset to support Spanish Republican politicians. He was soon elected as deputy of the Granada constituency in the 1931 Spanish general election. He was secretary of the parliamentary commission involved in drafting the Spanish Constitution of 1931. In 1932, he left the Agrupación al Servicio de la República to create the Frente Español (Spanish Front) alongside José Antonio Maravall, Antonio Garrigues Díaz-Cañabate, María Zambrano, Antonio Sacristán Colás, Salvador Lissarrague Novoa, Antonio Bouthelier Espasa, Eliseo García del Moral y Bujalarce and Antonio Riaño Lanzarote. He later became involved with the Movimiento Español Sindicalista (Spanish Syndicalist Movement, or MES). By March 1933, García-Valdecasas began to collaborate with José Antonio Primo de Rivera, a lawyer and the eldest son of Miguel Primo de Rivera, and the two became founding members of the Falange Española alongside Julio Ruiz de Alda. The Falange Española was a fascist successor group that split from the Movimiento Español Sindicalista. García- Valdecasas participated as a speaker at the founding ceremony of the Falange, which was held on 29 October 1933 at the Teatro de la Comedia in Madrid. García-Valdecasas ran under the banner of the Falange in their first election, and was appointed a member of the Comité de Mando de Falange (Falange Command Committee), alongside cofounders Ruiz de Alda and Primo de Rivera. In November 1933, he ran as a candidate for the right-wing Bloque de Derechas coalition in Granada, but was replaced by Ramón Ruiz Alonso. He soon retired from parliamentary politics but remained a member of the Falange. After the breakout of the Spanish Civil War, García-Valdecasas joined the Francoist side, and in 1938 he was appointed Undersecretary of Education by Francisco Franco. Between 1939 and 1943 he served as the first president of the Institute for Political Studies, an organ of the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (FET y de las JONS), successor to the Falange Española and ruling party of Spain. In 1944, he was removed from his position due to his defence of Juan de Borbón, count of Barcelona. He then became an attorney in the Cortes Españolas from 1943 to 1946, and again from 1967 to 1971, and from 1971 to 1977.

Biography The first of four children, Rina was privately educated; for this purpose the father chose to entrust her to a young Italian teacher of Ferrara: . The two, she aged fourteen and he in his twenties, began a lifelong love affair. Paolo Maranini, when he met Rina, had already been the manager of the Ferrara socialist circle Figli del Lavoro for two years; this meant that Melli received from him, in addition to Italian lessons, a political education. Soon Rina became an active member of the Ferrara socialist movement, with particular attention to the status of women workers. In 1898 Paolo was arrested and Rina's father began to oppose his relationship with his daughter in a decisive manner; this meant that Rina, as soon as she turned eighteen, left her family to go and live with his family in the poor and popular district of the city, where after a few months she married Paolo. Having become a prominent member of the Ferrarese socialist movement, Rina founded the women's socialist magazine \\"Eva\\", but in 1902 she had to move to Genoa with her husband due to friction and disagreements within the Socialist Party in Ferrara. Later that year, she was joined in Genoa by her mother and her three brothers, forced to leave Ferrara due to an unsustainable family situation and the excesses of her jealous and possessive father. In 1903 Rina moved again with her family to Trento, to collaborate with her husband in Il Popolo by Cesare Battisti. Rina, in order to make her work as a columnist more effective, decided to learn German (Trentino was then Austrian) and to perfect her command of the language she moved for a time to Vienna with her eldest son . While there she collaborated with the magazine Arbeiter Zeitung under Victor Adler. Following an illness of Giuseppe, who risked dying, Rina began to dedicate herself primarily to her family, ceasing to be a political militant. However she continued the collaboration with the printed paper and her socialist acquaintances; in particular, she collaborated with the Bietti publishing house, publishing a small Italian grammar book for German-speaking students and translating from German fairy tales and stories by Hans Christian Andersen. Some years after Paolo's death in Milan in 1941, Rina ended up moving to Pavia with her daughter Rosa, going to join her other daughter, . She remained in Pavia until her death on March 25, 1958. Political activism Rina worked with great commitment within the Ferrarese socialist leadership group, which needed a woman to organize the female component of the labor movement, and showed immediately that she had talent and charisma. She went directly to the Ferrara countryside to reach out to women workers and soon gained great popularity. Beginning in 1897, in the Ferrara countryside, an impressive wave of strikes had begun which lasted until 1902 and which, despite harsh repression, led tens of thousands of laborers and boars to abstain from work. The strikes highlighted the need to tackle the agrarian question, namely the seasonal chronic unemployment of the laborers and the unsustainability of the ancient relations between masters and settlers, which were gradually being replaced by new relations between wage laborers. That experience represented, with the struggles of Bologna, the heart of the strikes in Italy. The harsh repression, with arrests, trials and convictions, did not prevent wages from being raised thanks to those struggles and the commitment to draw up new colonial contracts, written for the first time. Particularly painful was the condition of female work which, like child labor, did not enjoy legal protection. For this reason, Melli is particularly committed to union activity aimed at women workers, setting up leagues and organizing socialist circles, often dedicated to Anna Kuliscioff, whom she met. From February 1901, the Ferrara peasant movement undertook an extraordinary organizational and political growth that had no equal in any other Italian province. Rina's fervent political activity and her consequent popularity made her the target of the opposing press. In reaction to the intrusion of women on political life, the Catholic paper Domenica dell'Operaia referred to her as \\"the Jewish woman Rina\\" and wrote: \\"We also had to get this to see the propaganda of socialism made by women, some of whom roam the countryside, talking in closed or open places, excite men and women to strike, to resist, build leagues and beat the bass drum for the cause of future collectivism. Women, women! It must be said that in them the hysterical phenomena have assumed frightening proportions.\\" Journalist activity Rina collaborated with the editorial staff of La Scintilla, a socialist magazine directed by her husband, writing articles on the condition of women and also intervening critically with respect to the initiatives of the socialist leadership. Melli later felt the need to start a socialist newspaper aimed at women workers and that is why, on June 15, 1901, Eva is the first women's magazine published in Italy. The aim is to educate women workers (especially agricultural workers) in politics through the newspaper, using simple language that is also accessible to those who did not have high levels of education, in order to accelerate the growth of the socialist movement. From the articles published on \\"Eva\\" it clearly emerges that Rina's political stance is that of a reformist and humanitarian socialism, which has Camillo Prampolini as its inspiration.

President Donald Trump nominated Burkhalter to serve as the United States Ambassador to Norway on May 15, 2020.  Early life and education  Mark Burkhalter was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He graduated from the University of Georgia in 1984 with bachelor's degree in Global Studies (Political Science) and a minor in German and Slavic languages.  Political career  Burkhalter was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives from the 41st district between 1993 and 2003. He continued his service from the 36th district between 2003 and 2005. Burkhalter went on to represent the 50th district in the session between 2005 and 2011. During his terms in the Georgia General Assembly, he served as both Speaker and Speaker Pro Tempore of the Georgia House of Representatives. The various districts he represented were located in the Atlanta suburbs of north Fulton County in Georgia. In 2008, Burkhalter served on the Platform Committee of the Republican National Convention and was a leader for Governor Mitt Romney's Presidential campaign in Georgia. Prior to his state congressional tenure, Burkhalter served as an intern on the legislative staff to U.S. Representative Newt Gingrich in Washington, D.C.  Racist ad controversy  In 1994, while Burkhalter was campaign chairman for then-Fulton County, Georgia, Commission Chairman Mitch Skandalakis, he was involved in creating campaign fliers which depicted Gordon Joyner, an African-American politician running for a seat on the county commission, in a racist manner: Joyner's features were darkened, and he was photoshopped to have a large Afro, an enlarged lip, and a warped eye. Burkhalter, who was deposed as part of a resulting libel lawsuit, was involved in delivering materials for the flyer, attributing it to a false political action committee, authorizing payment for part of its printing and approving its release, according to court documents. The libel lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed sum in October 1995, and Skandalakis, Burkhalter and other officials signed a letter of apology to Joyner in which they took \\"full responsibility\\" for the flyer. The signed apology says the flier “contained a distorted photograph of you and inaccurate statements regarding you and attributed to you.” The flier sparked a controversy when it was released, with a 1995 editorial in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution calling it a “racist hit piece.” Court filings says that during a meeting Burkhalter attended before the flier was created, attendees discussed that “white voters in North Fulton County were unaware that Gordon Joyner is black.” The lawsuit said that \\"Defendants mailed the cards bearing the false pictures captioned 'Gordon Joyner' primarily to white voters residing in the northern part of Fulton County, for the purpose of instilling and inciting racial fears and prejudices on the part of those voters.\\" During a deposition, Burkhalter said the doctoring of Joyner's photo was discussed and joked about because “the face looked a little funny.” In addition to the lawsuit, Burkhalter was involved in an ethics investigation related to the flyer and following \\"nearly a year of proceedings, which included appearing in person before a hearing of the Ethics Commission, Mr. Burkhalter signed a consent order stating that he personally authorized payment for the flyer, failed to properly disclose the payment, and agreed that he violated Georgia law and would pay a civil penalty.\\" On July 14, 2020, the NAACP issued a statement opposing Burkhalter's nomination and calling for his withdrawal. Derrick Johnson, president & CEO of the NAACP, was quoted as saying that “Mr. Burkhalter’s actions were racist and deeply offensive. It is inconceivable that someone who sought to use racial prejudice to influence the electoral process could now be chosen to represent our democracy to the world.\\"  Business career  Parallel to his service in government, Burkhalter built a successful career in real estate development. From 2010 Burkhalter led the UK Public Affairs effort for the international law and public policy firm McKenna Long & Aldridge. He continued to play an important role at the firm after McKenna Long & Aldridge initially merged with Dentons in 2015. Dentons told CNN that Burkhalter resigned effective June 30, 2020, two days before the first media reports about his role in the racist ad controversy. Dentons told CNN that \\"We were unaware of the situation reported in the media, which predated Mark's affiliation with the firm.\\"  Personal life  Mark Burkhalter and his wife Gina, have three children; Natalie, Sam and Olivia. The amphitheater in Newtown Park, Johns Creek, is named in honor of Mark Burkhalter for his efforts in gaining city-status for Johns Creek.

Background on the Ivorian Political and Economic Context  Alassane Ouattara, Ivory Coast's current President From its independence from France, Ivory Coast developed a relatively stable and prosperous economy centred on the production and export of commodities such as cacao and coffee, and a network of clientelistic relations. Ivory Coast's first President, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, developed an economic system founded on the extraction and redistribution of agricultural rents, mainly coming from the cocoa-coffee industry. Nevertheless, the 1970s global monetary shocks and the drop in value of basic commodities in international markets induced the Ivorian government to borrow extensively. Ivory Coast's growing problem with foreign deficit eventually led to the intervention of France, and later on the IMF, to stabilize the economy. In the 1990s, with the encouragement of the IMF, Ivory Coast implemented nationwide monetary and macroeconomic reforms targeting clientelistic networks and reducing the role of the state in the economy. However, in 2000, following the controversial election of Laurent Gbagbo, a civil war split the country between the Muslim rebel-held North and the Government controlled Christian South, leading to large-scale violence and instability. As a result of the 2007 peace agreement, elections took place in 2010, which declared Alassane Ouattara winner. Gbagbo’s refusal to leave power triggered post-elections violence, but with Ouattara’s mandates, Ivory Coast went back to relative political and economic stability. The Ivorian economy indeed expanded by an average of 8% since the end of the political crisis in 2011, making Ivory Coast one of the fastest growing economies in West Africa.  Specificity of the Zone Franc and Distance from the IMF until the 1980s  Map of the CFA Franc Zone Ivory Coast is in the CFA Franc Zone, a former French colonial monetary zone created in 1939, which now gathers 14 Sub-Saharan countries using the CFA Franc. Following the Second World War, French authorities reformed the CFA and fixed its convertibility to the metropolitan Franc. As a result of decolonization, the CFA was further reformed with the creation of two monetary zones and their respective Central Banks, which got to control 35% of the reserves while 65% remained in the French Treasury. Owing to these monetary arrangements, France was able to remain the primary financial backer in its former African colonies. Indeed, the CFA arrangements enabled French authorities to directly finance external deficits and impose some soft disinflationary adjustments, which dissuaded former colonies to go toward the IMF’s harsher lending conditions.  The 1980s Structural Changes  As a result of the drop in value of agricultural products in international markets in the late 1970s, the indebtedness that resulted from monetary shocks, and the failure of the cacao war, Ivorian authorities agreed with the IMF on a first program of structural adjustment in 1981. The main objective of the reforms was to break down the clientelistic practices corroding the Ivorian economy. To do so, the IMF promoted privatization, in particular in the agricultural industries formerly administered by the state. Thus, in 2000, Caistab, the state-firm controlling the cacao-coffee industry, was liquidated. Scholars have argued that at the time Ivory Coast was lacking the legal institutions necessary to enable the switch from a national monopoly to a neoliberal system fully opened to international multinationals. The structural changes affected former interest structures, and the ending of the state's protection of domestic industries made small-scale peasants vulnerable to international competition. The resulting social instability participated in triggering the nationwide movement of peasants’ riots and demonstrations that spread across the country in 2004.  Broader effects of lending and conditionality of the IMF programs  The IMF’s structural adjustment programs in Ivory Coast have involved privatization waves, including the privatization of the cacao industry, Ivory Coast's top export industry. Opening the industry to foreign competition pressured farmers to increase output. This need for increased production was accompanied by an intensification in the illegal exploitation of children. In 2002, approximately 15,000 children were working on Ivorian cocoa, coffee, and cotton farms. Structural adjustment programs also required the government to reduce public spending in order to reduce budget deficit. User fees were introduced into the health care system, which became more and more privately funded. In 2011, 65% of health care expenditure in Ivory Coast was financed by private households’ out of pocket payments. Furthermore, education budgets were cut, leading to decreases in civic servants’ wages. Many highly skilled professors left Ivory Coast for better employment opportunities in France or Canada, triggering a ‘brain drain’ movement. In 2009, 30,7% of Ivorians residing abroad were high-educated individuals, and 49,8% were residing in France.  Recent IMF programs: The EFF/ECF lending arrangements  The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and Extended Credit Facility (ECF) are two lending arrangements. The ECF provides medium and long-term sustained program engagement for countries with balance of payments problems. The EFF provides assistance to countries experiencing payments imbalances because of structural impediments or a slow growth and a weak balance of payments position. The three-year ECF/EFF arrangements in Ivory Coast were first approved by the IMF Executive Board in December 2016 with a total access of SDR 650.4 million, equivalent to 100 percent of Ivory Coast’s quota. In June 2019, the IMF’s Executive Board completed its fifth reviews under the ECF/EFF arrangements, and agreed to the immediate disbursement of additional SDR 96.786 million, bringing current disbursements to SDR 553.6 million. In Ivory Coast, the ECF/EFF arrangements consist mainly in macroeconomic policies and structural reforms aiming to increase tax revenue mobilization in order to address infrastructure needs and reduce budget deficit. They also include fiscal reforms aimed at consolidating Ivory Coast’s banking sector and making its business climate more inclusive for private investment. Ivory Coast has been relatively successful in implementing these reforms as all performance criteria were met in 2018. Moreover, all but one indicative target were met at end-2018, and five out of six structural benchmarks were also met.  Current Economic Situation and Relation with the IMF  In October 2019, the IMF staff completed a mission to evaluate Ivory Coast's current economic climate and completion of IMF programs. The report emphasized the resilience and strength of the Ivorian economy in the last few years, despite a deteriorating external environment. It evaluated the performance of Ivorian authorities under IMF-supported programs and highlighted that Ivory Coast met all performance criteria for end-June 2019, and all but one of the structural benchmarks on public finance management, public enterprise monitoring, and tax policy and administration. The report acknowledged Ivory Coast's encouraging position regarding the reduction of its budget deficit to 3.0% of GDP, as well as efforts to restructure the public sector and diversify exports. Moreover, it confirmed the one-year program expansion of fiscal policy measures to 2020 in order for Ivory Coast to meet the 3.0 percent of GDP deficit objective. It also formalized the IMF's agreement with national authorities to continue domestic revenue mobilization efforts and the implementation of policies to create space to finance the National Development Program (2016 - 2020), a national development plan aimed at consolidating Ivory Coast's industrial sector and reduce poverty. {  +Ivory Coast: Selected Economic Indicators 2017-21 ! !2017 !2018 !2019 !2020 (projection) !2021 (projection) - GDP Growth (%) 7,7 7,4 7,5 7,2 7,0 - Current Expenditure (% of GDP) 18,0 17,3 16,6 17 16,9 - Public Debt (% of GDP) 49,8 51,8 50,5 49,7 48,9 } According to the IMF's Country Report No. 18/367.

Her research, teaching and publications focus on reproductive politics and gender relations, right-wing populism and anti-feminism. Her 2018 published book, \\"The Rhetoric of the Right: an overview of right-wing populist discourse strategies\\" detailed how the right-wing uses strategies of free expression to add their rhetoric to the public sphere. In her text Dominant masculinity and neo-reactionary world views in the pick-up artist scene, Schutzbach dealt with the \\"radicalization and politicization of the masculine scene\\". She specifically looked at pick-up artists who started in the US as a kind of support group for insecure men who wanted to learn to \\"conquer\\" women, and are now active in blogs and forums, but also offline, in large parts of the world. According to Inga Barthels in the Der Tagesspiegel, Schutzbach documents how this group increasingly works together with right-wing nationalist movements and analyzes the connections between anti-gender discourses, anti-feminism and right-wing populism, which were observed throughout the Western world.

History In the early 19th Century, immigrants from Ireland moved in large numbers to Middletown. By 1830 there were enough families there to form a vibrant and close-knit Irish community that desired its own place of worship. In 1841, two acres of land were purchased on the current site of the Church was purchased. Most of the future parishioners of St. John's worked across the river in the brownstone quarries of Portland and the owners of the quarries donated large blocks of brownstone to help build the first church.  Mother Church of the Diocese  Since St. John's was built back in 1843 and the Diocese of Norwich was not created until August 06, 1953 by Pope Pius XII the Church is the oldest Church in the Diocese (as it actually pre-dated it) and is lovingly known as the Mother Church of the Diocese. The Archdiocese of Hartford, in fact, had ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Church until 1953. Buildings Interior of St. John Church The imposing 1843 Irish influenced ecclesiastical Gothic Revival church building was designed by architect, Patrick Charles Keely and it was built by local Irish immigrants that were led by prominent local builder Barzialli Sage. The original church that was completed in 1843 was just a small church building and the existing spire for the Church was erected in 1864. There has been three renovations to the exterior of the building. The 1864 building is now the sacristy for St. John's and the current church was finished in 1852. The Church can hold up to one thousand worshipers. The interior walls of the Church were frescoed by William Borgett, a local artist and there have been several interior renovations over the years. The building is listed as significant contributing property of the City of Middletown Historic District.  St. Elizabeth Convent  During the construction of the Church, it was decided that a convent was to be built. Saint Elizabeth Convent was finished in 1873. The convent was used as a Parish Center after the Sisters of Mercy vacated the Property in the 1960s. In 2007, the former convent was demolished due to being in disrepair.  St. John Parochial School  Saint John Diocesan Elementary School was a Catholic parochial elementary school that was operational from 1888 till 2013. The school merged with the Saint Mary of Czestochowa Diocesan Elementary School to form Saint Pope John Paul II Regional Diocesan Elementary School which still operates today were it still serves students from PreK to 8th Grade.  St. John Graveyard and Cemetery Old Saint John Graveyard The Church maintains two cemeteries. The original graveyard is located directly behind the church and the newer cemetery is located on Johnson Street in Middletown.  Yoked Parish  The Parishes of St. Sebastian and St. John have shared a Priest since 2017, so Daily Mass and Sunday Masses are held at both Parishes. The Parishes are still their own entities and are not merged into a combined Parish.

Biography He was born in Yavoriv in western Galicia. His family had its origins in Portugal, but were forced to leave with the expulsion of Jews from Portugal. It is reported that upon reaching Prague built a synagogue using stones from the old Portuguese synagogues they had left, and therefore the family name became Altschuler (\\"of the old synagogue\\"). According to other reports, the family origin was in Provence. In the year 5486 (1725-1726) he is recorded as serving as a rabbi or judge of Yavoriv. Apparently, after this served as rabbi of Prague, as did other members of his family. He saw that Bible study had become weak among European Jews and even among scholars. Believing that the reason for this was the lack of a sufficiently simple and clear commentary, he wrote his commentary \\"Metzudat David\\" to fit this need. The commentary covers all of Nach (Neviim and Ketuvim), except for Ruth, Lamentations, and Esther. It is principally based on the commentary of Radak, but includes ideas from many other previous commentators. According to the Hida, these sources include Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Ralbag, Moshe Alshich, Saadiah Gaon and Ramban.Shem haGedolim haHadash (Maarechet Sefarim), Mem, 166 The commentary was published in Zhovkva in 1753, and later published a second time before his death. David's son Yechiel Hillel Altschuler also served as rabbi of Yavoriv, and finished his father's great work, and traveled extensively in Europe in order to publish and spread it. David published the commentary as one work, but Yechiel divided it into two works: Metzudat David which explains the meaning of the verses, and Metzudat Tzion which explains individual words and phrases. The two works are collectively known as the Metzudot. In time the Metzudot became one of the basic commentaries on Nach, printed in most editions of the Hebrew Bible with commentators.

Description The painting depicts events in 10 November 1608 just before the death of the priest and Theatine preacher Andrea Avellino. As he began to celebrate the miracle of the Eucharist, he was stricken with apoplexy (stroke) and would soon after die. The depiction shows an assistant aiding him to stand as the heavens and angels open up above, prefiguring his sanctity. The depiction of the lower figures were completed by Lanfranco putatively in 8 days in order to be complete for his beatification by Pope Urban VIII in 1624.

Biography Born into a wealthy, she obtained her degree in chemistry in 1930 at the University of Pavia and found work in Milan. In 1937 she joined the underground Communist Party of Italy where she began military service in the anti-fascist struggle. In 1942, she was arrested by the fascist police in Bergamo and sentenced to confinement in Sant'Angelo in Vado until 25 July 1943. Then she moved to Zurich, where for about a year and a half she continued to work for the party. In December 1944 she returned to Milan and joined the editorial staff of L'Unità, at that time still a clandestine newspaper. In the same year she joined the Press and Propaganda Commission of the High Italian Direction of the PCI. In 1946 she was elected to the Constituent Assembly of the Italian Republic in the Communist Group. In the Constituent Assembly she fought in particular for the repeal of the article of the pre-Fascist laws that forbade women's access to the highest ranks of the Judiciary.

Since 1945, Bolivia has cooperated with the IMF to achieve social reforms and economic growth. These efforts have involved strategies to reduce poverty, increase social equity, improve the education system and healthcare system, and expand social services to rural populations and underserved urban communities. Since 1984, Bolivia has been an active client of the fund, accessing 19 credit lines with the fund since joining. , the country has no outstanding balance with the IMF, as the country is pulling away from what it says is foreign control of its economy. Map of Bolivia  National economy and revolution of the 1950s  After the overthrow of the mining elite who had dominated political life in Bolivia, the new government reorganized the economy to create an economy that was fair. It therefore increased spending on public programs and nationalized key industries, like mining and oil. Bolivia's first stabilization plan took place from 1955 to 1964. This generated growth in the economy, as commodities like tin paid well and were needed in other countries to make finished goods, so therefore demand was high.  Bolivia's Economy from the 1960s to the late '70s  High government spending and an influx of foreign capital as well as actual growth, gave the Bolivian economy impressive growth. By 1974, there was a surplus of 8.5% in GDP, but failing to re-invest it in the economy later caused problems. Instead of funding economic activities, the state continued to expand public spending, amassing large amounts of foreign debt. As the economy was not strong enough to fund these programs, the government turned to foreign loans from banks and public institutions. Apart from its deficit financing, Bolivia remained overwhelmingly dependent on commodity exports, specifically tin and silver, making it highly susceptible to market changes.  Late 1970s through the 1980s; the IMF's initial approach  Due to high public spending by the government, the Bolivian economy began to spiral. A decline in tax collection and the accumulation of foreign loans forced the state to find alternate ways to finance the deficit. The government responded by printing large sums of money, which led to high levels of inflation; by 1985 the inflation rate was around 11,750 percent. This created more problems, as citizens became unwilling to hold money in the Bolivian peso due to the instability of its exchange rate. Bolivian banks began to pay out in dollars, as citizens feared the peso was worthless as its value fluctuated with an unpredictable market. The government was no longer in direct control of the country's currency. In order to slow down inflation, the government attempted to devalue the peso, and imposed Dollarization programs to buy back the foreign capital and replace it with pesos. This, however, had little success. Instead, black market premiums surged and inflation continued to grow. During this time period, the price of non-fuel commodity goods, such as tin, sharply decreased. Bolivia's economy remained reliant on commodities, therefore the price drop destabilized the economy. There was a 10% decline in real GDP from 1980–85. After the Bolivian government expelled its executive in 1978, the IMF and Bolivia began contracting a potential plan to re-stabilize the economy. The IMF, however, pulled out, as they did not believe that the government was strong enough to enforce the changes needed to revitalize the economy.  IMF intervention and reforms from 1985–1998  With a deteriorating economy, high debt, and high inflation, the Bolivian state had no choice but to turn to the IMF. Under the Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF), the IMF approved a deal on June 19, 1986 to help stabilize Bolivia's economy. Along with many other nations, Bolivia participated in the Brady Plan restructuring agreements of the 1980s, utilizing dollar denominated bond conversion mechanisms to resolve its debt crisis. Apart from repaying the $96,800,000 loan, Bolivia was asked to reduce government spending, liberalize the economy by opening up trade, raising exports and reducing imports, and regaining control of inflation. Bolivia was more or less successful in the implementation of most programs, and even went as far as declaring a state of emergency to keep control of the economy when opposition became strong. Throughout this time, the IMF continued to lend large amounts of money to the Bolivian state, through the General Resources account as well as through the Poverty Reduction Trust, which lends only to the poorest member states of the IMF. These loans were used to stabilize the Bolivian economy by providing much-needed capital to repay private loans and revamp crucial economic practices. From 1985 to 1999, the IMF loaned Bolivia around $458,093,000 SDR in combined general loans, and through the Poverty Reduction Trust.  Debt relief of 1996  Poor indebted states like Bolivia have struggled to balance their payments due to a high number of loans, both private and public. The need to maintain good credit to access new loans, in order to pay back old loans, is a cycle that keeps these states indebted. In 1996 the IMF and the World Bank created the HIPC Initiative (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries), to lower the high debts acquired by the poorest states in the world. Bolivia qualified for adjustments and was able to forgo a portion of its debt. On September 9, 1997 the IMF approved Bolivia's debt relief program by relinquishing around $428 million of Bolivia's external debt. The conditions for obtaining such debt relief are similar to IMF conditions for loans -- the state must continue to work at bettering its balance of payments and regulating inflation.  Outcomes of IMF intervention (1986–1998)  By 1990 IMF programs had successfully reduced 12 month inflation to 18%, by 1997 the government had reduced inflation to 7%. An admirable feat, as at its peak in 1985, inflation had amounted to 23,500%. IMF intervention increased Bolivia's credit worthiness, as well as foreign investment, allowing for moderate growth. Between 1994 and 2001, Bolivia received approximately $178 million in loan disbursements from the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust. The IMF continued to regularly provide analyses evaluating the performance of Bolivia's domestic financial institutions, including in domestic bank restructuring and pension reform.  Effects on the people  The programs by the IMF and the Bolivian government affected a large portion of Bolivia's poor. To better conditions, the government planned to increase spending on education, health care, improve the efficiency of governmental programs, and better the education system by paying teachers based on their merit, to increase the quality of instructors. However the strategies of implementation also negatively affected the population. The privatization of government industries left many without jobs. Opening up trade networks to other states also left small Bolivian companies at a disadvantage where people were let go due to foreign competitors, leading to unemployment.  Bolivia and the IMF 1999–2005  The Bolivian economy was becoming stable, but IMF involvement was not yet finished. In this time period, the IMF disbursed around $139,536,500 SDR in loans, aimed to continue the progress created by previous programs.  Strategy of reforms  The strategy was to continue to reduce inflation, reduce poverty by increasing spending in social programs, privatisation of all remaining government-owned companies, decrease participation in the informal economy, and improve governmental institutions such as the judiciary branch. Another crucial part of the second phase of reforms was to increase reserves of foreign currency. A big problem of the 1980s was that Bolivia simply had no foreign currency to repay debts, spiraling them into further debt. The IMF looked to stop this from happening again. Reforming the tax system was another goal of the Bolivian government, modernizing the tax system to improve the liberalization of domestic markets was crucial to continue repaying back loans as well as keeping up with spending on social programs. An important feature was phasing out the financial transaction taxes that affected business transactions in Bolivia, as well as increase the efficiency of the tax collection system.  Outcomes of the 1999–2004 reforms  Although inflation and positive growth were standard throughout most of the 1990s into the early 2000s, on the whole IMF policy did not lead to a complete turn around of the Bolivian economy.  What caused the failures of the programs  Blame for the shortcomings of implementation can be attributed to both the IMF and the Bolivian government. The Bolivian government remained inefficient and unwilling to impose unpopular reforms; the government also struggled with political corruption, and political interference by the people, and opposition to the reforms. The IMF also failed to force the state to implement all proposed programs, as well as increase government productivity by forcing the state to implement legislation that would improve efficiency. Breaches of previously agreed programs peaked starting 2001 through 2004, when many points in the performance criteria were not met, compared to the previous years where most if not all reached minimum satisfactory marks.  Consequences of failing to implement such programs  The Bolivian economy stopped its 4% growth trend and began to contract. By 1999 growth in GDP was reduced to .4%. There was a sharp decrease in foreign investment by 30%, as well as an increase in foreign debt. Debt increased from 41% of GDP in 2001, to around 73% at the end of 2003.  Bolivia and the IMF 2005–present  In December 2005, Bolivia and 18 other countries received 100% debt relief as a consequence of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. With the aid from this initiative, the Bolivian government paid off its loans to the IMF through repurchases and repayments between 2005 and 2007. The IMF forgave Bolivia of $251 million, coinciding with the election of Evo Morales. With the victory of Morales, an indigenous leader, Bolivia saw the opportunity to claim independence from the IMF. No new arrangements have been made with the IMF since 2005. Bolivia however continued its battle with reducing poverty and balancing out the economy, and Bolivia's GDP and foreign revenues have grown steadily. GDP grew consistently at around 4.8% from 2004 to 2017. Growth however, has not been supported by a similar programs prescribed by the IMF. Instead the state has once again nationalized key industries and kept up with social spending to improve the lives of its citizens and reducing extreme poverty. , Bolivia has no outstanding debts to the IMF. The IMF continues to evaluate the Bolivian economy's economic performance, citing its hydrocarbon and mining export performance as responsible for economic growth and fiscal revenue.  Criticisms  Protests have occurred in Bolivia in relation to IMF and World Bank related market reforms, loan conditions, and structural adjustments. Criticisms have been levied toward the IMF regarding its motives, actions and ties to U.S. foreign interests. Social tensions have been attributed to frustrations regarding the lack of demonstrable economic improvement expected of structural reform. In 1998, the Bolivian government agreed to the privatization of \\"all remaining public enterprises,\\" including water and gas. The companies that gained ownership of the water resources increased prices. Domestic unrest resulted in the Cochabamba Water War. Discontent with austerity measures and privatization has resulted in protests that have been met with the use of state emergency measures. In 2000, large waves of protests erupted from rural Bolivians over public sector cutbacks, a decline in per capita income, and rising rates of unemployment. With the election of Evo Morales to the Bolivian presidency in 2006, the Bolivian government pursued economic growth and financial stability with the intent to distance its relationship to international lending institutions, specifically the IMF and World Bank.

At City College, Hochberg was influenced by studying perception with psychologist Gardner Murphy. He received a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, he was taught by influential figures like Edward Tolman, Egon Brunswik, and Gordon Lynn Walls. After graduate school, Hochberg became an instructor at Cornell University and was promoted to full professor by 1960. He was a professor at New York University between 1965 and 1969 before moving to Columbia University, where he finished his teaching career. Research In the 1950s, Hochberg led a study that examined how college students judged qualities like cuteness and intelligence based on physical features. The study, which was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research, found that college students studied in the same year showed consistency in judging facial expressions, but students from a given year tended not to agree with students studied in other years. This suggested that over time there are trends in judging people. Hochberg found that there was an exception to the discrepancies seen in students from different years: judgments of the cuteness of babies tended to remain stable over time.

R. Bills (born 1967) is an American author and journalist. Life and career Born in Fort Worth in 1967, Bills was raised in Aledo, Texas. His blue-collar parents stressed the importance of a college education and sent him to Europe with the American Institute of Foreign Study at the age of sixteen. Pursuing studies in art, literature and journalism at Texas State University, Bills garnered numerous state and regional awards for his work as the editor of the university magazine, Hillside Scene and also served as editor of university’s literary journal, Persona. In 1990, he was a member of Texas State’s national championship-winning team in the American Advertising Federation's annual National Student Advertising Competition and graduated from the Texas State University Honors College with a degree in journalism. Bills pursued Master’s courses in American literature at Texas State and the University of Texas at Arlington, but never completed a graduate degree. In 2006, Bills became a frequent contributor to Fort Worth Weekly and a columnist for the short-lived Paper of South Texas. By 2009, he was writing articles for Fort Worth Magazine and served as a community panel columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Then, he began writing features for newspapers and magazines around the state, including the Austin American-Statesman and Texas Co-Op Power magazine. In early 2013, a feature Bills penned on the 1910 Slocum Massacre (in East Texas) for the Austin American-Statesman caught the attention of The History Press and a commissioning editor subsequently approached him about writing a book. In late 2013, his first book, Texas Obscurities: Stories of the Peculiar, Exceptional and Nefarious was published by The History Press. In 2014, it was followed by his second title with The History Press, The 1910 Slocum Massacre: An Act of Genocide in East Texas. In 2015, Bills published Black Holocaust: The Paris Horror and a Legacy of Texas Terror with the Eakin Press. In 2016, Bills took a break from nonfiction and co-edited the Lone Star state’s first anthology of horror, Road Kill: Texas Horror by Texas Writers (Eakin Press), with fellow Texas author and former schlock filmmaker, Bret McCormick. Road Kill: Texas Horror by Texas Writers included works from Rio Grande Valley author David Bowles, filmmaker Glen Coburn (creator of the 1984 cult-classic film Bloodsuckers from Outer Space and legendary Texas author Joe R. Lansdale In August 2017, Eakin Press published Bills’ Texas Dissident: Dispatches from a Diminished State, 2006-2016, a collection of editorials and essays. In early October, the Eakin Press released Bills and McCormick’s Road Kill: Texas Horror by Texas Writers, Volume 2. In mid-October 2017, The History Press released Bills’ fifth book, Texas Far and Wide: The Tornado with Eyes, Gettysburg's Last Casualty, the Celestial Skipping Stone and Other Tales. In August 2018, Bills published 100 Things to Do in Texas Before You Die with the Reedy Presshttps://www.texasstandard.org/stories/from-isolated-beaches-to-great-tex- mex-get-to-know-100-things-to-do-in-texas-before-you-die/ and was the sole editor of Road Kill: Texas Horror by Texas Writers, Volume 3 (HellBound Books). In October 2019, Bills published The San Marcos 10: An Antiwar Protest in Texas with The History Press and released his first book of fiction, Pendulum Grim, in December 2019. Over the last several years, Bills' historical research and writing has been repeatedly noted by the Zinn Education Project, and his titles have been cited in national publications like Smithsonian magazine and Mental Floss . Slocum Massacre After the publication of Bills’ The 1910 Slocum Massacre: An Act of Genocide in East Texas in May 2014, Bills and Constance Hollie-Jawaid, a descendant of victims of the Slocum Massacre, worked together on a historical marker application commemorating the atrocity. Hollie-Jawaid submitted it to the Anderson County Historical Commission and members there were immediately hostile. Commission officials criticized Hollie-Jawaid’s application, variously claiming it was unprofessional, based on rumors, antagonistic and, finally, too focused on negative history rather than positive. Hollie-Jawaid subsequently petitioned the Texas State Historical Commission directly and, on January 29, 2015, the Commission unanimously approved the Slocum Massacre historical marker application with a score of 98 on a 100-point scale.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/texas-marks-a-racial-slaughter- over-a-100-years- later/2016/01/15/fb194dd0-ba4e-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d_story.html When it was placed and dedicated on January 16, 2016, it became the first state of Texas historical marker to specifically acknowledge racial violence against African Americans. In 2016, Bills and Hollie-Jawaid completed The First Eight, a screenplay based on the Slocum Massacre. In late 2017, Bills book, The 1910 Slocum Massacre: An Act of Genocide in East Texas, was optioned for film treatment. In early 2018, Bills and Hollie-Jawaid wrote Shallow Playground, a second screenplay related to the Slocum Massacre and it, too, was optioned for film treatment. Bills and Hollie-Jawaid continue to work on locating and gaining access to the unmarked mass graves that still contain the remains of victims of the Slocum Massacre. In the October 2019 Texas Monthly cover story, \\"The Battle to Rewrite Texas History,\\" Bills was mentioned as part of \\"a new generation of scholars\\" who are attempting to correct the \\"historical record\\" in the Lone Star state.

History  The movement, which emerged in early 1933, was founded primarily by José Antonio Primo de Rivera, writer Rafael Sánchez Mazas, and aviator Julio Ruiz de Alda. Other notable members of the MES were Dionisio Ridruejo, Alfonso García Valdecasas, Manuel Sarrión, and Andrés de la Cuerda. Members of the MES openly embraced fascism and for a time the movement was known as the Movimiento Español Sindicalista-Fascismo Español (MES-FE, or Spanish Syndicalist-Fascist Movement). It soon became apparent that the MES was to have little political success on its own. In August 1933, José Antonio Primo de Rivera signed the \\"Pacto de El Escorial\\" (\\"El Escorial Pact\\"), wherein a pact of solidarity was formed between Spanish monarchists and the MES-FE. On 29 October 1933, in the midst of an electoral campaign, the MES held a rally at the Teatro de la Comedia in Madrid and re-founded itself as the Falange Española. The Falange Española would be succeeded by the Falange Española de las JONS, which was itself merged in April 1937 into the FET y de las JONS, which backed Francisco Franco as leader of Spain.

Biography Upon the death of her father, the town's blacksmith and active socialist, she moved to Rufina, with her mother's family, then to Florence to continue her studies. She obtained his master's degree and enrolled in the faculty of teaching. As a teacher, she encounters difficulties and obstacles, to the point of losing her job, due to disagreements with her superiors on her independent way of conducting lessons, for example her desire not to neglect Jewish culture and civilization. She therefore accepted the proposal for an appointment as an Italian language teacher in Bulgaria, from December 1941. In June 1942 she returned to Italy and, after a brief period in which he settled again in Rufina, she returned to Florence after the fall of Mussolini. She took part in the meetings of the Action Party, the spread of anti-fascist leaflets and in arms transport for the partisans. In 1945 she joined the Socialist Proletarian Unity Party of Giuseppe Saragat and Pietro Nenni and collaborated with various political journals. She was a friend of Angelica Balabanoff and shared her aspiration for women's emancipation and her pessimism about the backward position of the country. In the elections of June 2, 1946, she was among the 21 women out of 556 members elected to the Constituent Assembly. During her participation in the Constituent Assembly she spoke on the problems of school, pensions and employment. In January 1947 she followed the Saragat group in the split of Palazzo Barberini which gave birth to the new Italian Democratic Socialist Party. In 1948, a candidate in Sicily was elected in the I Legislature for the list of Socialist Unity. From the fifties she devoted himself to the study of educational issues and to the creation of the School of Europe of Monte Senario, a model institute for elementary and middle school children. The ideas that motivate this experiment, in many aspects experimental and avant- garde, are expressed in the essays L'esperienza di un'educazione nuova alla Scuola d'Europa. In the same years she collaborated with the newspaper La Nazione in Florence, writing the \\"Occhio ai ragazzi\\" column aimed at educational problems. From 1970 to 1975 she was elected municipal councilor of Florence on the PSDI lists, holding the office of deputy mayor. Starting from this time she also devoted herself to writing works of an autobiographical nature.

(Abraham) Gabbai is an American Orthodox rabbi, serving as the rabbi of the Spanish and Portuguese synagogue Congregation Mikveh Israel since 1988. Mikveh Israel was founded in 1740, and is the second-oldest active congregation in the United States. Gabbai is a native of Cairo, Egypt. Following the Six-day War in 1967, Gabbai, who was 18 years old at the time, was arrested and sent to prison in Egypt for three years. After being released he went to France and then to the United States. Early life and education Gabbai was born in Egypt in 1949 to Jewish immigrant parents. His father was born in Baghdad to a family of rabbis. He came to Egypt as a child with his family, and traded in silk shirts. Gabbai’s mother came from a family originally from Leghorn, Italy. They met and married in Egypt. Gabbai’s maternal grandmother was born in Salonica, Greece. Her family spoke Ladino. There were ten children in the Gabbai family: eight boys and two girls. The family was strictly observant of Judaism. Like many Jews in Egypt, their culture was French, and Gabbai attended the Collège de la Salle (French Catholic School). The majority of the students were Jews, but there were Christians and Moslems as well. As a child Gabbai sang in the choir of the Sha'ar Hashamayim Synagogue. Imprisonment in Egypt Life in Egypt was generally good for Jews up until the 1940s and 50s. The situation became more strenuous until eventually, the Jews started to leave and immigrate to other countries. Gabbai’s four brothers left before 1967 and went to the USA where they became US citizens. Gabbai, three brothers, two sisters, and their widowed mother stayed behind. Their father had died years earlier. In 1967 Gabbai was 18 years old and in high school. He and the rest of the family were awaiting visas to be permitted to leave Egypt when the Six-Day War broke out. After the war broke out, and before they could leave, Gabbai and his three brothers were rounded up by the secret service and put in prison camps. First, they took two of his older brothers in June 1967 and a few weeks later they came back for him and another brother. There was no due process, no charges, no trial, and no right to an attorney, they remained in prison till June of 1970. According to Gabbai the cells were made for 30, 40 people but held 70 in each at the time. In the beginning they were in a prison camp in Abu Zaabal for six months and it was very bad, He and his brothers feared that they were going to be killed, and their mother was told they were dead. After six months they were taken to a prison camp in Tora where it became more relaxed. Since his family was strictly observant they only ate vegetables. Eventually, the women and children were allowed to visit, and his mother brought him kosher meat and chicken. Release and immigration to the United States In June of 1970 under pressure from the outside, they were let go. They were taken from the prison camp directly to the airport, there was no time to stop at home to collect their possessions and were flown to Paris. Their mothers, wives and children followed a few weeks later. In Paris Gabbai met his family and applied for refugee status to come to the United States. After about a year Gabbai arrived in New York City in 1971. Gabbai insists that because of his great suffering there he will never go back to Egypt even to visit. Later education and rabbinical career In New York Gabbai attended Yeshiva University. From 1983-1986 Gabbai was the assistant hazzan of Congregation Shearith Israel in New York. Congregation Shearith Israel is a Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue. It is the oldest Jewish congregation in the United States. Gabbai then traveled to Jerusalem to the Shehebar Sephardic Center under Rabbi Sam Kassin to be ordained a rabbi in the Sephardic tradition. He graduated SSC in 1989. Gabbai is also a spiritual and musical student of Rabbi Abraham Lopes Cardozo. Since 1988 Gabbai has been the rabbi of the Spanish- Portuguese congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia.# Gabbai is fluent in more than six languages. He is a member of the Board of Governors of Gratz College.

Xyris marginata is a monocot in the family Xyridaceae which is endemic to King Island (Tasmania) and Tasmania, commonly growing in button grass moorlands, at altitudes of up to 1070 meters (3,510.5 ft) above sea level. Taxonomy The etymology of the word Xyris has two sources. The Latin root of the word stems from iris, presumably as many of both of the monocot genera are renowned for their bright yellow flowers. Marginata refers to the tightly rolled leaf margins of the species. There are four native species in Tasmania: Xyris marginata, Xyris muelleri, Xyris operculata, and Xyris tasmanica. They all occupy waterlogged soils and swamps with Xyris marginata thriving at the highest altitude. Xyris operculata is the only one not endemic to Tasmania. Description Xyris marginata grows on high altitude moors. Its most notable characteristics are its yellow flowers, its twisting stems, and the wavy margins found on the bracts of its inflorescence. The blade is 1 mm broad and thick; its base sheathing being 4-6 cm long; and the main stalk, coming from the roots, is between 15 and 55 cm long. It is perennial and forms small tussocks. Xyris marginata, like all Tasmanian Xyridaceaes, flowers between November and January. The flower head is broader towards the top, almost forming a globe, the lateral sepals are turned inwards and rough in texture. The petals are rounded and a golden yellow colour. They have finely notched margins, for which Xyris marginata gets its name. The stamens are equipped with anthers protruding on short filaments, with hairy staminodes reaching towards its base. They have three branches which are shallowly channelled. There are minute margins projected out from these that may be difficult to see without a magnifying glass. Finally, the flower contains a three-lobed capsule that is hardened at the top. The leaves are thick, with a central rib, and are characteristically dark brown and shiny. The margins are rounded, except at the tip of the leaf which is awl shaped. They are spirally arranged from the bottom of the plant.Launceston Field Naturalists Club (1996), A Guide to Flowers and Plants of Tasmania, Reed Books Australia The bracts are dark brown, becoming larger and broader as they ascend. Their outline is curved, irregularly torn, and darker in colour towards the centre. Similar species Plants in the family Xyridaceae are tufted herbs and usually perennial. The leaves ascend from the bottom of the plant and are arranged spirally. The flowers are spherical, and all Tasmanian varieties have yellow flowers. Typically, they will have three sepals, three petals, and three stamens. Altitude is also an important factor for determining the species, as it is unlikely that species other than Xyris marginata have the resilience to survive at high altitudes. Xyris operculata (A) can be differentiated from Xyris marginata (B) by its slender and erect leaves, as opposed to the spring- like leaves of Xyris marginata. In addition, Xyris operculata has three stamens reduced to hairy tufts in addition to its three regular stamens. Xyris muelleri (C) has leaves curling upwards, which are pointed at the ends. The petals have consistent margins. Xyris tasmanica (D) has consistent margins similar to C, however, does not have leaves close to the head of the flower.

Button grass moorlands, on which Xyris marginata is commonly found, occupy approximately 14% of the state, including alpine areas in western and southwestern Tasmania, the highlands of north-eastern Tasmania, the lowland heath-land pockets in eastern, north-eastern and south-eastern Tasmania. Button grass moorlands are defined by the Tasmanian Government’s Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) as “vegetation less than two meters in height, in which the hummock forming plant known as 'button grass' (Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus) is usually dominant or common”. This includes, but is not limited to Western button grass moorland, sparse button grass moorland on slopes, pure button grass moorland and button grass moorland with emergent shrubs. As well as DPIPWE being aware of where Xyris marginata is located, other sources, such as Reid et al. (2005) claim they are also in the east of the island. The left section of the map and the section in the top right show where DPIPWE believe Xyris marginata to be located. Ecology The most characteristic feature of button grass marshes is the Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus (button grass), after which this category of moorland is named. The depth of the peat substrate in Tasmanian button grass moorlands greatly vary and can sometimes be eroded to only 1cm thick. Below which there may be mineral soils but generally quartz gravels are more common. Button grass moorlands can grow on flats, slopes, ridges, and mountain plateaus that are vulnerable to frequent fires. Characteristically the soils are infertile and drain poorly but approximately 272 vascular plant species are recorded for this type of moorland, of which one third are endemic to Tasmania. Conservation There are no specific conservation objectives for Xyris marginata. However, the moors are protected by DPIPWE. The majority of moor land is publicly owned and under DPIPWE’s jurisdiction. It is resistant to invasive weeds and controlled burning can takes place if required.

It is notable as the site of a prominent agricultural reform demonstration in 1948, which addressed a huge problem in Georgia agriculture. This was the fact that few Georgia farmers terraced their fields or rotated crops, leading to severe erosion. An extreme example was the development of what became known as the Providence Canyon, from growth of a farm gully into a 150-foot-deep canyon, even becoming a state park.

Al-Najashi counted him among \\"al-salaf al-salih\\" (righteous pioneers [in Islam]). During the reign of Ali, he was the treasurer of Kufa.  Name  Abu Rafi' was a Copt (special tribe in Egypt). Different reports about his name has been quoted in various books. Names such as: Aslam, Ibrahim, Thabit, Hurmuz, Sinan, Qaraman, Salih, Yazid, Yasar, and 'Abd al- Rahman are reported as his name. However, in most of the sources Aslam is mentioned as his name.  As a Slave  At first, Abu Rafi' was 'Abbas ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib's slave. Al-'Abbas gave him to the Prophet (s). When Abu Rafi' told the Prophet (s) that al-'Abbas embraced Islam, the Prophet (s) freed him as a reward of his good news. Abu Rafi' embraced Islam in Mecca before Hijra to Abyssinia.  Immigration to Abyssinia  He was among the Muslims who immigrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) under the leadership of Ja'far ibn Abu Talib to get away from the hostility of pagans of Quraysh.  Immigration to Mecca  It's commonly believed that Abu Rafi' not only did not immigrate with the Prophet to Medina, but also stayed there until the Battle of Badr after which he joined the Prophet (s) in Medina. However, there is another narration that contradict this report. After that he entered Medina, the Prophet (s) married him to his female slave –Salma- and 'Ubayd Allah was born from them.al-Najashi, Ahmad b. 'Ali. Rijal. p. 4  Participation in Battles  Abu Rafi' participated in all of the battles after he immigrated to Medina. He was counted among the Muhammad close companions to the point that the Prophet (s) said \\"every prophet has a trustee and my trustee is Abu Rafi'.\\"Qummi, al-'Abbas. al-Kuna wa l-alqab. vol. 1. p. 77  During the Imamate of Ali Ibn Talib  After the death of Muhammad, Abu Rafi' became a companion of Imam 'Ali. He was one of Ali Ibn Talib companions until Imam took over the caliphate. When Mu'awiya from Syria and Talha and Zubayr from Basra rose up against Ali Ibn Talib caliphate, Abu Rafi' said that the Prophet had already foretold him this incident and said that Ali Ibn Talib is right and his opponents are wrong.  Immigration to Kufa  When he was 85, he sold his house and his lands in Khaybar and Medina and immigrated along with Ali Ibn Talib to Kufa.al-Najashi, Ahmad b. 'Ali. Rijal. p. 4 It was then that he said \\"all praise is due to Allah that I reach a position that no one else has reached to; because I swore two allegiances: al-'Aqaba and Ridwan. I prayed toward two Qiblas and I immigrated thrice.\\" In Kufa, he was appointed by Ali Ibn Talib as the treasurer of the treasury of Kufa and his two sons –'Ali and 'Ubayd Allah- started working as Imam's (s) scribes.Al-Najashi, Ahmad b. 'Ali. Rijal. p. 2-3  After the Martyrdom of Ali Ibn Talib  According to a narration, Abu Rafi' was alive in the time of Al-Hasan's caliphate and returned to Medina along with Imam al-Hasan after the martyrdom of Ali Ibn Talib. If this narration is credible, he should have been over 90 years old at that time. Because Abu Rafi' had sold his land and house in Medina; when he returned to Medina, Imam al-Hasan (a) gave him a half of Imam 'Ali's house and a piece of land located on outskirts of Medina. After his demise, his son -'Ubayd Allah- sold the land for 170,000 (probably dirhams).  Demise  There are different reports about his demise date: * Some said that he passed away in the year that Ali Ibn Talib was martyred. * Al-Waqidi said: \\" he passed away a while before or after 'Uthman. * Some also said that he passed away during Imam Ali Ibn Talib reign.'Asqalani, Ibn Hajar. al-Isaba fi tamyiz al-sahaba. Vol. 4. P. 67. But according to a narration ,quoted by al-Najashi, he had relations with Hasan Ibn Ali and returned to Medina with him so he was alive after the martyrdom of Imam 'Ali (a) and lived more than 90 years.  Narrator of Hadith  Numerous narrations have been quoted from Abu Rafi' by his children and wife -Salma- and others. Muslims, especially Shi'a have placed him among the reliable narrators of hadith.  Writing the First Jurisprudential Book  Abu Rafi' tried to gather, compile and classify hadiths. He compiled the book al-Sunan wa l-ahkam wa l-qadaya. He is –apparently- the first person in the history of Islam who has written a jurisprudential book. This book includes chapters of: prayer (salat), fasting, hajj, zakat, and judiciary. Narrations from Ali Ibn Talib can be found in the book.  See Also  * Al Abi Rafi' * Ubayd Allah b.

The fishes include Catla catla, Labeo rohita, L. calbasu, L. gonius, Cirrhina mrigala, Barbus spp., Wallago attu, Mystus tengra, Mystus aor and Oampokpabda, Gadusia chapra, Clupea spp., Notoptenis notopterus, Clarius batrachus, Heteropneustes fossilis, Channa spp., Anabas testudineus and Colis afasciota. Freshwater shrimps of the genus Macrobrachium are common. Threats # Existing wetland continue to be under the threat of siltation, being drained for agriculture and industry. The water bodies are converted to small fishing blocks by artificial embankments and roads. This has resulted in decline of fish population along with the waterfowls. #The loss of tree diversity and population is due to encroachments for cultivation, invasion of weed species, grazing of cattles, collection of minor forest produces and fuel wood, fire hazard, expansion of network of roads and other infrastructure projects. #There are large population of people living along the wetland. They are mostly migrants and are involved in fishing and cultivation for their livelihood.

Early life  Ukaji was born on March 13, 1933 in Urakawa, Hokkaido. She and her siblings grew up without much money, and would skip school and get part-time jobs to help support the family. When she was 20 years old, she moved to Sapporo to attend junior high school, even though she was much older than her classmates. She moved to Tokyo when she was 23, hoping that there would be less discrimination against Ainu there than in Hokkaido. She worked as a waitress, and furthered her education by listening to the college students who came by and reading what they were reading. She later got married and had a son, Takashi Ukaji.  Career  Ukaji became an active part of the indigenous rights movement for Ainu people during the 1970s. She petitioned Mayor Ryokichi Minobe for the 1975 survey of the socio-economic conditions of Ainu in Tokyo. The survey found that there were around 600 Ainu households in Tokyo, and many worked blue-collar jobs. A position for an Ainu counselor was made at Shinjuku's Metropolitan Economic Security Office, so that Ainu people could get help finding jobs. Ukaji filled this position for a few months, but stopped because of the intense workload. During the 1990s Ukaji began studying embroidery. In 1996, she went back to Hokkaido to study traditional Ainu designs and incorporate them in her work. Her work is typically of Ainu legends, which she sews on to kimono fabric like a tapestry. She calls her style \\"kofu-e\\" or \\"old cloth pictures\\". She also published children's books based on her tapestries. In 2004 Ukaji was awarded the Ainu Culture Promotion Award. In 2006, Ukaji helped to produce a film called \\"Tokyo Ainu\\" about Ainu people living in Tokyo and the prejudice that they experience when they share their ethnic backgrounds. Ukaji won the Eiji Yoshikawa Cultural Award in 2011.

Her death was recorded on audiotape during Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) surveillance on Zein Isa due to his association with Abu Nidal Organization (ANO). He and his wife were both convicted for first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Zein Isa died of diabetes before he could be executed. Maria Isa was later resentenced to life imprisonment and died in prison. Background Palestina Zein Isa, named after the country of Palestine, was born in Mato Grosso, Brazil. The youngest of seven siblings, she lived in a southern portion of the City of St. Louis in an apartment complex, and while in St. Louis was a student at Dewey Junior High School, and Roosevelt High School. Her father was a Muslim Palestinian, Zein Isa, who originated from Beitin, West Bank. Her mother, Maria Isa, was Brazilian and a Roman Catholic. As a result Tina was of German, Italian, Palestinian, and some indigenous South American descent. She learned Arabic and Portuguese from her parents and Spanish during her time living in Puerto Rico. Zein al-Abdeen Hassan Isa, born on June 3, 1931, was the third son of a farmer. While a teenager, he married a woman named Foiziya, his double first cousin. In the 1950s, Zein left Palestine, and he emigrated with members of neighboring families. He first lived in the south of Brazil and met Maria Matias (born August 10, 1943), a native of Mato Grosso who had been born in Santa Catarina, while on a business trip to Rondonópolis, Mato Grosso. She was of German, Italian, and South American native descent. On February 6, 1963, the two married despite the opposition of Maria's parents. Zein did not reveal to Maria that she was his second wife until after the marriage occurred. They moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in fall 1963, then to Paterson, New Jersey, Areceibo, Puerto Rico, back to Rondonópolis, then to Cáceres, Mato Grosso; Tina was born in Mato Grosso. The family moved back to Puerto Rico, living in Areceibo until moving to Isabela one year later. During this time, the father, without the mother, lived with his children in the West Bank for periods of time. In 1980, Zein became a naturalized citizen of the United States. The entire family moved to Beitin when Tina was five. The family came to St. Louis around 1986, and the family had its own grocery store there. Tina began learning English after arriving in St. Louis, where her friends gave her the nickname \\"Tina\\". In 1991, Tim Bryant of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote in regards to the parents, \\"Neither speaks English well.\\" Tina's relationship with her father declined after she turned fourteen; previously they had a better relationship. She listened to American popular music such as hip hop, dance, rap, R&B;, and rock. Tina Isa's ambition was to become a pilot after taking aeronautical engineering courses; she intended to do this at Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology (part of St. Louis University). Zein wanted to arrange Tina as a marriage partner to a man from his hometown. Isa's elder sisters stated their dislike of her lifestyle. Her family sent people to extract her from a prom dance she attended. When her family learned that she, since January 1989, was engaged in a romantic relationship with a 20-year-old African-American, Cliff Walker, Tina's parents grew even angrier. Zein Isa held grudges against African-Americans because Palestinian businesspeople had been targeted by black criminals. Prior to his daughter's murder, Zein made telephone calls stating that Tina had damaged the honor of his family and needed to die. On the day of her death, she worked her first day at a Wendy's fast food restaurant; the family also opposed the idea of her not working for the family's grocery business. Ellen Harris, author of Guarding the Secrets, wrote that \\"The problem was that Tina thought of herself as American or hyphenated-American, not as Arab.\\" Death Her murder took place at the Delor Park Apartments, in her family's residence. Isa's boyfriend walked her home after the first day of her job. Initially, her parents criticized her for having the outside job and later stated a belief that she was doing something else instead of working. Zein Isa stabbed his daughter with a boning knife. One of her lungs, her liver, and her heart were severely damaged by six blows to her chest. Maria Isa assisted Zein by holding Tina. FBI agents were not at the surveillance unit when the killing happened. Tina Isa was buried at Sacred Heart Cemetery in Florissant, Missouri, reportedly in a bridal gown. Her Brazilian mother said unmarried girls and women in Brazil who die are buried accordingly. The family intentionally did not provide notice of the funeral to the media to ensure that only people from the family, the local Palestinian community and people from Beitin attended. They expressly did not want Tina's boyfriend to attend. FBI agents secretly monitored and photographed the proceedings. Investigation, arrest, and trial Zein Isa was a member of the Abu Nidal Organization, which at the time he murdered his daughter, was plotting to bomb the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C. Harris wrote that \\"His daughters had long worried about Zein's ANO activities.\\" A crucial factor in his trial was the fact that the FBI had bugged Zein's house on a FISA order in connection with his suspected terrorist activities, and as such, had recorded Tina's murder on an audio cassette. This was especially important in confirming the fact that Maria was an active participant in the murder, and that Zein's claim of self-defense against Tina was false. Zein had accused Tina of asking for $5,000 and of grabbing a knife, and Isa's lawyers represented to the jury that Tina had kicked her father in the leg, which they stated had previously sustained injuries, and that she had wielded a meat cleaver as a weapon. The New York Times wrote \\"Since the F.B.I. has refused to discuss the tapes, only some of which were used at the trial, it is not clear whether the authorities could have intervened to prevent the killing.\\" FBI officials stated that several of Isa's statements before the killing were empty threats, and that this is why the agency took no action before Tina died. The state-level prosecutor, Dee Joyce-Hayes, used several FBI tapes as evidence in the trial against Zein and Maria Isa. Maria's lawyers argued that Maria had favored Tina in family disputes and that she could not have assisted the murder. On October 25, 1991, Zein and Maria Isa were convicted of first-degree murder. The jury discussed the circumstances for fewer than four hours before deciding that the suspects committed first-degree murder. On December 20, 1991, the two were sentenced to death by the jury; Circuit Judge Charles A. Shaw stated \\"Culture is no excuse for murder. I see no reason to deviate from the jury's recommendation.\\" In April 1993, Zein was indicted by the FBI in connection with his terrorist activities within the Abu Nidal Organization, and the federal prosecutors issuing the indictment accused Zein of killing Tina partly because he feared she could expose his ANO activities. The charges were later dropped because he was already on death row for his daughter's murder. The case received media coverage in Brazil. Zein was to be sent to Potosi Correctional Center in Potosi, Missouri while Maria was to be sent to the Jefferson City, Missouri- area Renz Prison. He later died of complications of diabetes on February 17, 1997. Maria's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment without parole; she died on April 30, 2014, in a Vandalia, Missouri, prison at the age of 70 from apparent natural causes. \\\\- The article mistakenly states \\"Vandalia, Missouri\\". \\\\- Variant article: \\"Woman serving life dies in prison\\" (May 1, 2014) at the Columbia Daily Tribune; accessed June 13, 2020. Aftermath As a result of the case some Palestinian families resident in the U.S. sent their children back to Palestine to avoid them undergoing Americanization. Cultural references A book titled Guarding the Secrets, written by Ellen Harris, was published in 1995 which documents the murder. In the book, she stated a journalist from Palestine compared the murder to the ancient story of Dinah. The case was depicted on the Forensic Files season 8 episode \\"Honour Thy Father\\" which aired on July 30, 2005. The case was also featured on an episode of Arrest & Trial.

The organization's present focus is on STEM and they operate their own science competitions for students in co-ed schools, Orthodox all-boys schools, and all-girls schools. Their most recent multi-school STEM competition (December 2019) expanded, reaching down to the middle-school level. The multi- organization task force from which CIJE was initiated had as their driving focus, according to their 1990 report, to go beyond the single-gender schools, and reach out to \\"the segment of the Jewish population which is finding it increasingly difficult to define its future in terms of Jewish values and behavior.\\" The way their work contrasts with that of Torah Umesorah – National Society for Hebrew Day Schools, another non-profit organization, was describedin an article by the dean of the recipient of a $15 million grant for Jewish education as \\"from life back to the Torah.” History Commission on Jewish Education in North America The Commission on Jewish Education in North America, a newly formed group, \\"met six times .. from August 1, 1988 to June 12, 1990\\" and appointed a directorAlan David Hoffmann to \\"a new entity, the Council for Initiatives in Jewish Education (CIJE).\\"Funding, and the initial idea for \\"the Commission\\" is accredited to \\"Morton L. Mandel and his brothers.\\" Council for Initiatives in Jewish Education The Council for Initiatives in Jewish Education was the first of two organizations to use the initials CJIE. Its director, Alan David Hoffmann, one of the 24 individuals providing \\"individual consultations\\" to the commission, served from 1994 to 1996. It scheduled annual review meetings, while seeking to enhance the outcome from the \\"some estimates say 30,000\\" involved in Jewish education in North America. Center for Initiatives in Jewish Education The Center for Initiatives in Jewish Education (CIJE) was formed in 2001, as a New York-based followup to the first CIJE. Unlike the earlier organization (which, after much analysis, was seeking to focus on \\"three to five model communities\\"), this organization has a much larger focus. In 2015 it opened its CIJE-Tech Middle School Program as a \\"groundbreaking ... across the denominational spectrum in more than 180 schools nationwide\\" effort \\"to promote inquiry and project-based thinking, and curiosity.\\" The goal, however, still remains from the first CIJE: \\"new personnel .. new programs .. teaching of Hebrew, the Bible, and Jewish history.\\"\\"prepares .. for every aspect of successful 21st Century living.. Jewish values and ideals.\\" Providing lab equipment is a part of the CIJE program.A 2011 Jewish Press story about Torah Academy of Boca Raton, whose goal is \\"a lifelong commitment to and passion for Torah study and ethical growth\\" described their new computer lab, whose hardware and software were \\"made possible by a generous donation by\\" CIJE. The software is SuccessMaker (Pearson Education), published by Computer Curriculum Corporation. Innovation Day Innovation Day is a CIJE program that began in 2013, in which students from North American Jewish high schools present competing innovations within six categories.\\"Scientific Engineering, Eldercare, Arts, Eco-innovation, Healthcare and Assistive Technology, and Consumer Products.\\" More than one location hosts competing students. The largest for 2019 was in Holmdel, NJ (over 1,000 students from the Northeast); the Boca Raton, Florida site was for \\"eight South Florida Jewish day schools.\\" Both 2019 events were on May 1. Effectiveness The original report's listed goal was to involve \\"all sectors of the Jewish community.\\" It was multi- dimensional: stream/denominations,\\"Orthodox, Conservative, Reconstructionist, and Reform\\" roles,\\"scholars, educators, rabbis\\" and lastly Jewish organizations and foundations. As of 2010, it was noted that most Jewish children receive (and will continue to receive) \\"Jewish education in supplementary settings\\" rather than in day schools. Additionally, programs of a similar nature, though less time-intense were developed, including Birthright Israel (a 10-day program) and several summer-camp programs. A 2019 report by Avi Chai Foundation indicated ongoing participation by boys and girls at schools identified as Orthodox, Conservative and Reform, covering \\"16 states\\" (albeit largely from the Northeast, Florida and Texas). One criticism of many programs is instructor turnover, especially in non-Orthodox schools, where an estimated 25% of those teaching are in their first year.

After returning shortly afterwards, he retrieved something from the vehicle and walked away, with another security camera capturing his reflection in a car window. He has not been seen since, although some activity was recorded on his cell phone over the next two days. Koecher's absence from his home, work, and church activities in St. George, Utah, was not noted for several days; eventually, the homeowners' association of Anthem, where he had parked, got in touch with his employer and then his parents about the abandoned car and he was reported missing. Police had few leads at first since it appeared he had intended to return to St. George and did not appear to be involved in any criminal activities. The reason for his trip to the Las Vegas area that day has never been determined; his family believes he was looking for work since he could not make the full rent payments on his apartment with the job he had. Searches in the area around where he was last seen yielded no evidence. Further investigation found credit card and cell phone receipts and witness statements showing that in the week prior to his disappearance, Koecher had been driving great distances around Utah and Nevada, including almost in one day. The purpose of these trips is also unknown; on one he stopped to visit a former girlfriend's parents and had lunch at their house. Josh Powell, a West Valley City man suspected of murder in his wife Susan's disappearance a week before Koecher's, argued along with his father and brother that the two cases were related, suggesting the two were romantically involved and ran off together. Both Susan Powell's family and Koecher's have dismissed that theory. The Koecher case has been the subject of an episode of the Investigation Discovery channel's Disappeared series. Background Koecher was born in 1979 in Amarillo, Texas, one of four children of Rolf and Deanne Koecher. He was active in the Boy Scouts, eventually making Eagle Scout. After graduating from Amarillo High School in 1998, Koecher, a devout Mormon, attended first Ricks College (now Brigham Young University–Idaho) and later the University of Utah, where he received a degree in communications. He did his missionary work in Brazil, and learned to speak Portuguese. After college, he interned in the state governor's office for nine months. A year and a half later, he went to work for the Davis County Clipper, a Bountiful- based bi-weekly newspaper edited by his father, as a stringer. He remained there for another year and a half, with some articles he worked on receiving awards from the Utah Press Association. In 2007 he began working for the Salt Lake Tribunes digital advertising division. He liked the work, according to his mother, but not working the overnight shift. The many temperature inversions in the Salt Lake City area that winter also bothered him, so after a year he decided to leave his job at the newspaper and relocate to St. George, in the warmer southwestern portion of the state. At first he had work with another Internet advertising firm, Matchbin, but that employment ended soon after he relocated. With the Great Recession underway, it was difficult for him to find a new job. He was able to find some work for a local window- washing firm, handing out flyers for it. It did not provide him with enough income to meet his expenses, and by November 2009 he was several months behind on his rent. Greg Webb, the singles' ward president, claims the local electric utility was threatening to terminate Koecher's service for nonpayment, although his mother says that would have been the landlord's responsibility. So he was actively seeking another job, using connections from the local ward where he volunteered. December 10–12, 2009 On December 10, 2009, Koecher apparently left St. George in the early morning hours and drove his 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier north on Interstate 15 to Salt Lake City, where he bought some gas with a debit card. He then traveled west on Interstate 80 another to West Wendover, Nevada, where he again pulled off the highway to refuel. After that he continued another to the Ruby Valley ranch of the Neff family. Koecher had in the past dated Annemarie Neff and visited the ranch; he told her parents, who had not been expecting him, that he thought he would stop in to see her. She was not there, but the Neffs served Koecher lunch anyway. He told them he was on his way to visit family in Sacramento, California, but was not certain whether he could continue in that direction due to bad weather. After two hours he left, and decided to return to St. George the way he had come, stopping to buy gas again in Salt Lake City and Springville, followed by dinner at a Taco Time in Nephi. By the time Koecher returned home he had driven nearly . During the day Koecher talked with his mother on the phone. The two discussed his plans for returning to the family's Bountiful home for Christmas. Deanne said he seemed upbeat about the upcoming holiday and his job prospects despite his financial difficulties. He did not tell her of his road trip that day. The next day, while handing out flyers for his employer, Koecher encountered two young girls who had inadvertently been locked out of their family's apartment. Learning of their plight, he tried to call their mother. When she did not answer, he looked for someone in the neighborhood who could take them in temporarily, until someone arrived who could let them in. At some time the same day, Koecher spoke with his ward's bishop, who also described Koecher's mood as positive. The bishop was also trying to help him, and had promised Koecher he would have a job available by the beginning of 2010. On December 12, Koecher again hit the road. That morning his phone pinged a cell tower near Overton, Nevada, at the north end of Lake Mead. In the evening he bought gas and snacks at a convenience store in Mesquite, Nevada, along I-15 just over the Arizona state line. Why Koecher went to Nevada that day is unknown; three hours after his Mesquite purchase Koecher bought a baby's bib and cookies, believed to be Christmas gifts for his brother and his family, whose names he had drawn in the family's annual Christmas gift exchange, at a Kmart outside St. George. Disappearance A neighbor of Koecher's recalled seeing him return to his apartment around 10 p.m. A half-hour later, he left again; while he was not seen to return later that night it was possible he could have. The next morning, December 13, Webb called Koecher, saying he was on his way back from Las Vegas and feared he might not make it to St. George in time for the 11 a.m. service, asking if Koecher could lead it in his absence. Koecher said he, too, was in the Las Vegas area, away, but would return home if needed. Webb told him not to worry and that he would try to get back in time. Another ward member called again later that morning with a similar request, which they dropped when Koecher told them where he was. Neither he nor Webb asked Koecher why he had gone to the Las Vegas area that morning; they found nothing unusual about their conversations with him. At 11:54 a.m., a home security camera on Savannah Springs Avenue in Sun City, a retirement community in the Anthem development in southern Henderson, recorded Koecher's Cavalier driving past it to the cul- de-sac where it was later found. Six minutes later, a figure that seemed to be Koecher (his family believes it was him), wearing a white shirt and slacks, walked the opposite direction down the sidewalk in front, carrying something in one hand that appeared to be a file folder or portfolio. Shortly afterwards another security camera in a garage on adjacent Evening Lights Street caught his reflection as he walked north. Koecher has not been seen since. Koecher's phone remained active. Around 5 p.m. that day it pinged a tower at the intersection of Arroyo Grande Boulevard and American Pacific Drive, more than northeast of where he had parked. Two hours after that, it pinged another tower near Henderson's Whitney Ranch subdivision, two miles (3.2 km) north of the previous ping. Early the next morning, the phone pinged a tower at the interchange between Interstate 515/U.S. Route 93 and Russell Road, two more miles to the north. Koecher's landlord sent a text, and then an hour later it was used to check Koecher's voicemail. The phone remained in that tower's vicinity for the next two days, suggesting that its battery died. There has been no activity since. A day after that last ping, Sun City's homeowners' association parking enforcement took note of the car at the end of the Savannah Springs cul-de-sac and tried to find its owner. Through the windows they saw one of the flyers Koecher had been distributing for the window- washing company in St. George and called the number on it. Eventually they spoke with the owner, who gave them Koecher's cell phone number, where they left a voicemail. Later they called his mother; she returned their call on December 17, and, realizing no one else in the family had talked to him in a week and unable to locate him, reported him missing. Koecher's brother and sister drove to St. George from the Salt Lake City area to start searching. Investigation The Koecher family went to jails, morgues, and hospitals in the Las Vegas area in search of him. At one point, when employees at an International House of Pancakes told them that a man fitting Koecher's description had eaten there for three weeks straight, they themselves ate there for four nights. Another employee eventually gave them a more detailed description of the man and his eating habits, which led the Koechers to conclude he was not Steven. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police (LVMPD) canvassed the houses in the neighborhood where the Cavalier had been parked. With the help of volunteers, they used helicopters, all terrain vehicles, and dogs. By Christmas, the media in Salt Lake City and Las Vegas had begun reporting the story. A local dairy put Koecher's picture on a milk carton, and the LVMPD put a video with information on the case on its YouTube channel. In April 2010, another party of searchers scoured the open desert south of the Henderson Executive Airport to the west of where Koecher had parked in response to a tip passed along to a former LVMPD officer working as a private investigator for the family. A group of 70 covered about a half-mile (1 km) stretch in two hours. Bone fragments were found, but they were not human. Rolf Koecher, Steven's father, died in February 2011 after a brief illness that may have been toxic shock syndrome. Rolf had, with his wife and family, recently finished filming an episode of the Investigation Discovery cable channel's show Disappeared about Steven's case. It aired two months later. A cousin of the Koechers started a Facebook page devoted to the case. It generated not only some tips but suggestions for how to investigate further. Members of the WebSleuths Internet forum also took up the case; they assembled a timeline of events in the case based on newspaper accounts and social media posts by family and friends. In 2015, a local search and rescue group organized another effort, this time going high up the hills south of Anthem, on a different theory of what Koecher might have been doing. They did not find anything. Theories Koecher's family believes, given his financial circumstances at the time, that Steven had gone to Henderson that morning for a job opportunity. Despite the odd location where he parked his car, on the video the neatly dressed Koecher is walking purposefully, suggesting he knew where he was going and what he was going there for. \\"He doesn't look confused or dazed\\", Steven's brother Dallin said in 2018. But beyond that, there is no evidence to suggest what happened afterwards, nor has anything emerged subsequently which could. \\"We know about as much now as we did the second we realized he was gone,\\" the St. George police detective in charge of the case said in 2018. Koecher's difficulties notwithstanding, his family does not believe he chose to voluntarily disappear in order to escape them, or take his own life. Deanne Koecher said that in her last conversation with him, on December 10, he was optimistic about his ability to find another job and the two were making plans for his Christmas visit home. The Cavalier and its contents also suggest Koecher intended to return to St. George. Rolf Koecher said that it was in working order and the gas tank was half full when he reached it on December 17 after the Sun City parking authority called his wife about the car. In the car were the Christmas presents Steven had bought for his brother and his family at KMart the previous day, as well as job applications and the flyers from his employer that had helped the parking authority find his parents. At Koecher's apartment, his clothing and possessions remained where he stored them and had not been disturbed or packed. Koecher's unusual, and mostly unexplained, travel in the days leading up to his disappearance has led to suppositions that he may have turned to some sort of illicit activity for income. A drug dog was taken to sniff over the Cavalier but did not alert on anything. Another vehicle seen on the security camera footage driving up and down the street around the time Koecher parked and walked away from his car was investigated, and turned out to be a local real estate agent showing a house in the area. Checks of Koecher's financial history and phone records turned up nothing unusual aside from the trips. A single charge to his credit card since the disappearance was just an automatic charge made to webhosting company GoDaddy ensuing from his days at Matchbin. One unknown phone number turned out to be the family of the two girls Koecher had been helping get back inside on the day before he went to Las Vegas. A search of his computer and Internet browsing history found nothing unusual. Investigators also checked his borrowing history at the St. George library and found nothing there that suggested any unexplored leads. Koecher kept a diary, but recorded no problems in his life at the time of his disappearance beyond his monetary issues and his ongoing bachelorhood, neither of which he believed would last much longer. The family does not consider Koecher's travel to be particularly unusual, either. One of his reasons for moving to St. George was to research family history in that area; he often went on tours of cemeteries looking for ancestors' graves. His mother believes the trips were just his way of keeping himself busy despite his underemployment. While there is no evidence that would suggest Koecher was killed or kidnapped, neither the St. George nor Henderson police have found any evidence to eliminate that possibility. \\"There's nothing that makes us suspicious,\\" a detective from the former department told the Las Vegas Review- Journal. \\"But at the same time, it's a strange situation.\\" Theorized connection to Susan Powell disappearance Koecher disappeared a week after Susan Powell was reported missing from her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Valley City. The latter case received much more media attention as suspicion centered on her husband, Josh, with whom she had been having marital difficulties. The night after a neighbor last saw her in the family home, her husband had left after midnight to take the couple's two sons camping in Tooele County. Police officers who came to investigate the next morning after Susan did not drop her sons off at daycare forced entry into the house and found two fans blowing at a wet spot on the carpet. Early in the Koecher investigation, tips were posted to the Internet and brought to the family's attention suggesting a connection between the two disappearances. In 2010, Josh Powell's family began making those allegations publicly, claiming on a website they had set up to find Susan that she had, with her family's help, framed her husband for murder and escaped with Koecher. Steven Powell, Josh's father, outlined the theory in a February letter to police and FBI agents investigating his daughter-in-law's case. Police investigated the connection, but found nothing to support it. A Koecher family friend who by 2011 had taken over managing the Facebook page on Koecher called the allegations, which came up frequently in posts to it, \\"nonsense\\". Josh Powell moved to Washington, where he died along with his sons in a 2012 murder-suicide; his father, who had been convicted of child pornography and voyeurism after, among other things, explicit pictures he had secretly taken of Susan were found on his computer, died in 2018, a year after finishing his sentence.

St. Francis Inn property owner John L. Wilson and his wife Francis contributed to the formation of the public library system in St. Augustine after they purchased the Segui-Kirby Smith building on Aviles Street. They helped form the St. Augustine Library Association and gave the building to a private organization to be used as a free public library, where it remained from 1874 until the 1980s. When the St. Augustine Library Association was first formed on April 25th, 1874, no books of sectarian or political nature were to be purchased, but would be accepted if they were donated. Although there was no charge to borrow the books, library patrons gave money to help buy books for the library. Today, St. Augustine Historical Research Library is still open to the public at no cost, however, much of the material are one of a kind and rare and, therefore, must be used within the library.

It is being developed by Ørsted US Offshore Wind in conjunction with Public Service Enterprise Group (PSE&G;). Construction is planned to begin in the early 2020s; expected commissioning is in 2024. The closed Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station would provide a transmission point for energy generated by the wind farm. It will be the largest producer of wind power in New Jersey and largest offshore wind farm in the United States. Background In the United States, federal waters commence 3 nautical miles offshore. The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management awarded leases for offshore wind sites in 2015. NJWEA South is offshore Atlantic County and Cape May County, where the ocean floor is deep. The rights were later acquired by DONG Energy, which became Ørsted, parent of Ørsted US Offshore Wind. The company was selected by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBOPU) in June 2019. PSE&G; later joined the project. There is only one other utility-scale wind farm in the state, the 5-turbine Jersey-Atlantic Wind Farm. Two other projects which would provide wind power to New Jersey are Garden State Offshore Energy, Offshore Delaware in WEA OC-A 482 North opposite Rehoboth Beach, also by Ørsted US Offshore Wind, and Atlantic Shores Wind Farm in Offshore New Jersey WEA OCS-A 0499 -- off the coast of Jersey Shore (mostly opposite Ocean County from Atlantic City north to Barnegat Light) by EDF Renewables/Shell. Another potential WEA is Offshore New Jersey/New York on the west/south side of Hudson Canyon 21 miles offshore opposite Monmouth County. Design, construction and staging Turbines Haliade-X 12 MW wind turbines produced by GE Wind Energy will be used. The structures are tall with a rotor blade diameter of . As many as 90 will be constructed. As of 2019, they had the highest capacity of turbines being produced. On-shore staging center Ørsted U.S. Offshore Wind is also partnering with Tradepoint Atlantic, based in Port of Baltimore, to create a 50-acre staging center for on-land assembly, storage and loading out into deep waters for projects along the East Coast. The Port of Paulsboro could become the site for the production the monopile foundations for the turbines. On-shore interconnection In September 2019, Ocean Wind, with the approval of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, secured the capacity interconnection rights to bring the power generated by the wind farm on-shore at Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station in Lacey Township, a 619-megawatt nuclear power plant which was shut down in September 2018. It can use the existing power infrastructure of the plant, after some upgrades, to connect to the regional transmission grid. Impact on marine life and fisheries The wind farm will be built in prime fishing areas. Its impact on fisheries industry remains unclear, though there are some concerns and recommendations.

Early life and education  Kugelberg was born to a modest family on September 20, 1880 in Ljungarum, Sweden. He received his M.D. from the Karolinska Institute at Uppsala University in Stockholm, Sweden. Following his clinical training, he felt a spiritual calling and immediately left for south India on December 8, 1905 under the mission of the Swedish Church. The Church of Sweden under the 1904 Diocese of Luleå cared much for spreading healing to southeastern Asia.  Missionary Service   Tamil Nadu  When he first came to the state of Tamil Nadu, Kugelberg settled in the city of Pattukottai to conduct field research about the prevalence of disease. Kugelberg focused his efforts on treating two conditions: cataracts and leprosy. He then traveled to the more populated city of Tirupattur to implement his research. He founded the Swedish Mission Hospital in Tirupattur and was chief medical officer from 1909 to 1932. Kugelberg introduced novel cataract surgeries and leprosy antibiotics to the population. There were significant improvements in patient outcomes. In addition, Kugelberg gave particular care to the female workers and patients. As a result of his work, Kugelberg received approval from the dominion of Madras (Chennai, Tamil Nadu) to continue his practice in neighboring cities as well. So in 1926, Kugelberg opened the Moses Gnanaparanam Eye Hospital at Coimbatore.  Moses Gnanaparanam Hospital and eye clinics  The growth of the Moses Gnanaparanam Hospital was fast and it achieved equal success to the hospital in Tirupattur. His Excellency George Stanley, the then Governor of Madras, appreciated the \\"noble deeds\\" and requested Kugelberg to continue such \\"worthy\\" services to impoverished, rural communities. During this time, Dr. Kugelberg also started the Joseph Eye Clinic in Trichy, the St. Luke Eye Hospital in Virudhunagar, and hospital- dispensaries in Mayiladuthurai, Perambalur, and Ariyalur as its branches. The British-colonized government realized the dire necessity for healthcare and decided to sponsor Kugelberg’s services indefinitely.  School for the blind  Kugelberg particularly began believing in the Bible’s verses regarding the blind being healed by Jesus Christ. Convinced of the mission, he opened a school for the blind in Tirupattur in the year 1929. Kugelberg not only performed surgery but taught the patients braille, music theory, and musical instruments. The blind were also trained in dancing, basket making, and handicrafts, which were then exported for profit. Kugelberg valued such economic incentivisation and the lasting effects it would have for the sustainability of the people.  Religious service  Kugelberg came to serve the neighboring rural communities. It was his belief that Christian compassion and obedience would reduce symptoms of sickness. He preached the Gospel regularly when consulting patients and is recognized for converting many Hindus to Christianity. Part of his message was equality between the sexes. In this vein, he opened a Christian teaching hospital for nurses in Madurai, as a way of including more women in healthcare.  Legacy  Kugelberg spent the majority of his life in India, providing medical care and developing hospitals and policy. He knew that medical care was temporary, and that educative hospital experiences would prove to be more effective in the long-term. His name is inscribed in the Swedish Mission Hospital in Tirupattur. As a mark of respect, in Dr. Kugelberg’s golden jubilee year, another large building was built in his honor. It was named as the Kugelberg Women and Children’s Ward. Kugelberg's wife, Eva Karolina Kugelberg, fell ill in 1932 and left India. Dr. Kugelberg followed soon after. After leaving India and returning to Sweden in 1932, he received an honorary commendation by Uppsala University the same year. Kugelberg died April 29, 1963 in Sweden. Inspired by his work his sister, Sonja Kugelberg, opened a Swedish home for the blind in 1971. It remains operation in 2019.

Plot  A mother tells a story about the very first Christmas to her child. Although it had happened a long time ago. in a distant land, the child imagines that it had happened on his parents' farm. A man and a woman are very tired after a long journey and want to sleep. But there is no light in the courtyards around them. Therefore, the two travelers go into a stable. When the couple is in the stable the animals walk around the woman and warm her up. A short time later, the woman gets a baby. All stars suddenly light up, one is particularly bright and stands directly above the stable. The shepherds in the fields wonder why there is a star above the stable. When they see the newborn child, they realize that the star is shining for the child. Since there is no bed, the woman puts her child in a crib. The child sleeps and is watched by the shepherds and animals. The poinsettia is shining in the sky above the stable.  Background  The book was first published in 1961 in Sweden, by Raben & Sjogren. The text had been written by Astrid Lindgren and the book was illustrated by Harald Wiberg. The story has been translated into many languages, including English, German, Low German, and Frisian. In Sweden and German a new Edition of the book with pictures from Lars Klinting has been released in 2002. This Edition has not been published in English.  Reception  Stiftung Lesen thinks that the Christmas story is \\"simple but wonderfully beautiful\\". Kirkus Reviews adds that the story is told without mentioning religious symbols. It is a \\"fine introduction to the meaning of Christmas for the child who (...) nestles in mother's lap to discover it.\\" According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Astrid Lindgren is telling Christmas story in a simple way, so that the imagination can find its own pictures. Harald Wiberg illustrates the story from a dreamier, but at the same time more distant perspective than Lars Klinting. According to t-online.de Lindgren's book is already suitable for very small children. The Christmas story is told in ancient, mysterious and yet new, timeless manner.

Many of his works were in a modified Symbolist style. Life and work  His father, Adriaan Roland Holst, was a manufacturer and underwriter. His nephew, also named Adriaan Roland Holst, was a well known poet. From 1885 to 1890, he studied at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten with August Allebé, among others. After 1918, he was teacher there and served as Director from 1926 to 1934. In 1896, he married the poet and revolutionary, Henriette van der Schalk. Their marriage remained childless. He was heavily influenced by the ideas of the writer, William Morris; treating art as an idealistic, service-oriented activity, emphasizing purity and clear form. He also attached great importance to collaborations between artists from different disciplines, so he is often referred to as a \\"community artist\\". In addition, he was a confirmed socialist and a close friend of the leftist writer, Herman Gorter This influence may also be reflected in his harsh criticism of Johanna Gezina van Gogh-Bonger while she was organizing in 1892 an exhibition of Vincent Willem van Gogh's, her brother in law's works, hence indirectly criticizing also Van Goghs's work: \\"Mrs Van Gogh is a charming little woman, but it irritates me when someone gushes fanatically on a subject she knows nothing about, and although blinded by sentimentality still thinks she is adopting a strictly critical attitude. It is schoolgirlish twaddle, nothing more. [...] The work that Mrs Van Gogh would like best is the one that was the most bombastic and sentimental, the one that made her shed the most tears; she forgets that her sorrow is turning Vincent into a god.\\"Quoted in J.M. Joosten, \\"Van Gogh publicaties (15) deel 6\\", Museumjournaal 15 (1970), pp. 157-58, note 61. He made numerous woodcuts, designed posters, and provided illustrations for Henriette's works, as well as designing the typography. Most of his works were small in scale, but he also created murals for the Beurs van Berlage, the office of the General Diamond Workers' Union of the Netherlands (known as the \\"\\") and the building of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in The Hague. Later, he designed stained glass windows for St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht and several public buildings.

Identity, borders and injustice are her preferred themes. She lives and works in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. From 2011-2017 she was the president, and since 2017 is the co-president, of Visarte Neuchâtel, the Swiss association of professional visual artists. Early life Mnatsakanian was born in Tehran, Iran. Her mother, Hasmik Haroutunian is a plastic surgeon, and her father, Leon Mnatsakanian, was an architect. From 1976 to 1978 Mnatsakanian studied architecture at the School of architecture of the University of Tehran. In 1979 she moved to Paris to continue her studies, this time as an art student at the University of Paris 8. During her studies one professor was crucial in the development of her work: Edmond Couchot. His conceptual and analytical way of thinking influenced Mnatsakanian in her future work. One of the outcomes of her studies was Verb-images, a series that she created using the letters of the Armenian alphabet. The formal and conventional form that is writing, through a transformation from verbal to visual mode, takes a pure image value, without reference to recognizable forms. The goal of this research is to use a conventional and well-known form to create abstract visual imagery. From 1981-83 Mnatsakanian became part of the director Arby Ovanessian's theater group, who is known for his experimental creations. The two-year experience gave birth to “How my mother’s embroidered apron enfolds in my life”. The film version of the play was produced in 1985. Mnatsakanian participated as an actor in both the play and the movie versions of this work. Career Los Angeles In 1984, Mnatsakanian moved to Los Angeles. She started her career in art and design. She received a master degree in arts from the California State University of Los Angeles in 2000. Professors Joe Soldate and Elizabeth Bryant were important influences in installation art and video. During her studies Mnatsakanian started questioning her identity. She was born in Iran; lived in France and now in USA, and she considered herself Armenian. She addressed her thoughts in her artworks. In Box, Cross, Dismemberment, Genocide (1996), she addressed the Armenian Genocide in an installation/performance, mixing objects, images, music and performance. A later work of this period is the Self Portrait (1997), where she puts various objects, including earth, a house, and her own image in cardboard boxes. She uses cardboard boxes again in another installation called Journey (1997). In this period her work becomes more symbolic. A basic house shape is recurrent in her works as well as earth. In 2000 she creates the House on Wheels , a video installation with a house on wheels in the center. It is an autobiographical work that addresses her life in 3 different countries and her Armenian identity. It is a reference to her multicultural self. In 2003, Mnatsakanian received a grant from the California Council for the Humanities for Our Stories, a community based project where she worked with a group of multi-cultural students and created a sound installation with their stories told in various languages. In the same year she created a work called 1 person died. Three legal sized notebooks containing the phrase “1 person died” repeated one and a half million times. The work was meant to acknowledge each and every person perished during the Armenian Genocide of the beginning of the 20th century. Switzerland In 2006, Mnatsakanian moved to Switzerland. She created a new style of work that she calls Marks: paintings and drawings, often in multiple layers, resembling writing. “When we go from one place to another, we put our marks. The new marks don’t cover the old ones, but complement them.” says Mnatsakanian. In 2007 she receives a grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Culture for an installation entitled The mountain comes to me. In an installation with five videos, a robot and a model of the mount Ararat, the mountain that is so close to Armenians and to Armenia, but yet in a different country goes for a world tour. For The mountain comes to me Mnatsakanian receives the help of the Ecole Polytechnique (EPFL) of Lausanne. The collaboration was to use a robot to move the mountain. The experience with the robotics continued on 2009 when she got accepted to a Swiss Artists in Labs residency at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Lugano. During the 9-month residency she got acquainted with the world of the artificial intelligence and the robotics and at the end of the period she delivered a robotic performance with small wheeled robots. The performance was called When I woke up the sun had moved , another work related to the movement and how it changes the conditions of life. In her installations and performances the media follows the concepts. Thus in 2012 she creates a site specific installation in Armenia, the Our cyclopean walls, which was a community building work that resulted in the cleaning of a village—where exist historical cyclopean walls—and creating a wall with plastic bottles, pieces of metal, paper and glass found during the cleaning process. In 2014 Mnatsakanian curated a show at the Museum of modern art, Yerevan, Armenia with Edmond Habetian from France and Catherine Aeschlimann, Geneviève Petermann, Josette Taramarcaz and Pier Giorgio de Pinto from Switzerland. The project was called “Come Closer” and the aim of it was to connect with the local public through interactive artworks and various events. Mnatsakanian created an interactive installation called Message in a bottle for this exhibition. One person died book and booklets 2015 was the centennial of the Armenian Genocide. Mnatsakanian created a projectable version of the 1 person died, that she called One person died, ephemeral monument. The idea was to project the work in as many places as possible in Switzerland and elsewhere. Technically the work is a software that repeats the phrase “one person died” in different sizes and shades of grey. A counter in red tallies the repetition and when is reaches 1.5 million, it restarts. In 2017 Mnatsakanian documented this project as well as her other works related to the Genocide in a double book which was published in 2018. One of the books is a 3rd version of the 1 person died, this time printed in 100 limited edition copies. The accompanying book is written by five writers, in five different languages and all translated in English. The writers are Mario Casanova, Ramela Grigorian Abbamontian, Alice Henkes, Suren Manukyan and Karine Tissot. In 2016 Mnatsakanian started a series of collaborations with musicians. The result of these collaborations was a series of animated and digital paintings. An animated painting is a painting that evolves gradually over the duration of the music, where the viewer can see many mutations of the work. She collaborated with Karine Vartanian, pianist, with Serj Tankian of the System of a down and in 2019 with Barbara Minder, flutist. Ballade, 2016, pigmented print on paper Since 2016, drawing became Mnatsakanian’s favorite media. Drawings are the continuation of the Marks, but in black ink usually and without layers. In 2018 the drawings and paintings evolved in three dimensions. Mnatsakanian created three-dimensional drawings using laser-cut wood.Connexions Insolites, Installation, 2017, acrylic on wood  Awards and residencies  * 2014 City and Canton of Neuchâtel for “Come Closer” at the Moderne art museum, Yerevan, Armenia * 2012 The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) for \\"Our cyclopean walls\\" * 2012 Residency at Art and Cultural Studies Laboratories (ACSL), Armenia * 2009 California State University, Fullerton, residency at the Grand Central Art Station, Santa Ana, California * 2009 Etat de Neuchâtel, Service de la cohesion multiculturelle for “Our Storis/Nos Histoires” * 2008 Office fédéral de la culture, Artists- in-Labs residency at Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Lugano * 2007 Office fédéral de la culture (Swiss ministry of culture) for “The mountain comes to me” * 2003 California Council for the Humanities for “Our Stories” Public collections * City of Neuchâtel, Switzerland * Haute école de géstion Arc, Neuchâtel, Switzerland * Haute école d’ingénierie, St-Imier, Switzerland * Musée d’art et d’histoire Neuchâtel, Switzerland * Musée des beaux-arts, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland * Bibliothèque publique et universitaire de Neuchâtel, Switzerland  References  External links * Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Swiss women artists Category:Conceptual artists Category:People from Neuchâtel Category:University of Tehran alumni Category:California State University, Los Angeles alumni Category:People from Tehran Category:Iranian Armenian people Category:Armenian American Category:Swiss Armenians ","title":"Alina Mnatsakanian"},{"id":"62489553","text":"Alla Borisovna Pokrovskaya (; 18 September 1937 - 25 June 2019) was a Soviet- Russian actress and educator.

It is a Grade I listed building. History The building is mainly Norman and is mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086 AD). The tower dates from the 15th century. The church had further Victorian restoration by John Middleton in the 19th century. The church has been placed on the Historic England Heritage at risk register because of slow deterioration of the stonework of the tower and buttresses. The parish is part of the benefice of Redmarley D'Abitot, Bromesberrow, Pauntley and Upleadon within the Diocese of Gloucester.  Dymock sculptors  Dymock is celebrated as the centre of a mediaeval school of Romanesque sculpture that was first described in detail by George Zarnecki in 1950. It was more fully analysed by the Reverend John Eric Gethyn-Jones, who renamed it after the Dymoch church which contains all of its characteristic motifs. Evidence of the work is also found in other churches within a ten-mile radius.  Architecture  The church consists of a long 12th-century nave and a west tower dating from the 15th century, topped with a short octagonal pyramid spire. It has a south porch, and a south chapel immediately east of it. There is a north chapel not facing the south one, but further to the west. East of the nave is a 12th-century bay that was originally the lower story of a crossing tower. The tower and octagonal spire include a small octagonal stair turret and is supported by buttresses. The church includes several examples of Romanesque architecture including the doorway and windows of the nave, the stringcourse of the tower and part of the chancel wall. The west end of the nave is devoted to a display of the Dymock poets, their work and associations. Within the church is a memorial to the men of Dymock who died in World War I and World War II.

During the games Scheduling * Philippines athletics head coach Sean Guevara was furious with the scheduling of athletics programme as their athletes would compete in the same event on the same day in the space of 30 minutes in the heats and just one hour apart in 100m and 400m finals causing the Philippine Athletics Track and Field Association (PATAFA) to request for a change or adjustment to the schedule for the men's 400m hurdles and 100m, but the Malaysian organising committee did not take any action when the Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) secretary-general Low Beng Choo explained he had noticed the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) appeal for the schedule to be changed but the Malaysian Athletics Technical Delegate turned the request down. * The Singapore national under-22 football team coach Richard Tardy criticised the organisers for informing him about a press conference held on 13 August just 30 minutes prior to its scheduled 11:30am start time, causing him to be late. Thailand national under-22 football team coach Worrawoot Srimaka also failed to turn up as he was informed about the conference only after having to reschedule his team's training session. Transportation issues * Thailand women's national futsal team didn't get any bus to travel to the venue and Vietnam national under-22 football team were coming late to make a training at the venue because of the poor organisation from the bus management. Television broadcast issues * Malaysia's failure to air some of the live matches on football events also been criticised, with one football supporter from Myanmar said: “I’m surprised to learn that Malaysia, which is much richer than Myanmar, fails to manage live coverage of some popular events and tournaments. I am asking this on behalf of all other ASEAN countries, not just for Myanmar”. Driver's background * An incident of the host Malaysian bus driver ferrying the Myanmar women's national football team was caught for theft as well for not having a driving licence, leading to a delay for the players and officials from reaching their hotel. Judging issues * The failure of Malaysian SEA Games Organising Committee (MASOC) to fully install “video challenge” or “dark fish” system for sepak takraw matches that can be used by teams to challenge calls made by the umpire or referee during a bout or match are criticised by the national sepak takraw association itself as all ASEAN sepak takraw teams had been notified and expecting the technology to be used in the competition. * On 20 August, Indonesian women's sepak takraw team walked out of the venue to protest a call by the referee. Following the match abandonment from the Indonesian side, the Malaysian side was awarded a 2–0 score by the referee. Later, Malaysian media claimed that Indonesia has admitted that it was a mistake to abandon the match. However, this statement was rejected by the Indonesian officials. * During pencak silat men's doubles seni contest on 24 August, Malaysian pair Taqiyuddin Hamid and Rosli Sharif won the competition with 582 points. Indonesian coaches, whose athlete Hendy and Yolla Primadona settled for silver, claimed that the given score is not natural and biased. According to one of the coaches, the highest point ever given for the competition was around 570. However, Malaysian National Silat Federation secretary general Datuk Megat Zulkarnain Omardin has denied such claims and said that the Indonesian team had accepted the result during team manager meeting. Indonesian Minister of Youth and Sport Affairs, Imam Nahrawi, later said that he was planning on sending protest notes to the Asian Pencak Silat Federation and the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) to prevent the referees or judges from officiating in 2018 Asian Games to be held in Indonesia. * During Pencak Silat - Tanding Men Class D on 29 August, Malaysian athlete Razak Ghani seriously injured in the rib during a match against Thai athlete Pornteb Poolkaew causing it to be stopped definitely. The referee however gave Razak to win the match in a sudden controversial decision. * The results of the boxing men's light flyweight quarter-final bout between Carlo Paalam of Philippines and Muhamad Fuad Redzuan of the host nation Malaysia was met with criticism as the latter was given a 5–0 decision despite being out boxed. Muhamad Fuad was also warned by the referee for illegal attacks such as take downs, headlocks and occasional lacing of his opponent's face in clinches but received only warnings and no point deductions. Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines (ABAP) executive director Ed Picson declined to make comment about the officiating and scoring other than to say \\"I thought it was the other way around. But it is what it is\\". However, Muhamad Fuad gets to prove his worth when he went on to win the semi-final and final bouts to take the event gold medal. * The winner of the women's 10,000 metres walk race, Elena Goh Ling Yin from the host nation Malaysia, was accused of cheating. The Vietnamese media protested that the Malaysian athlete cheated by \\"running\\" instead of \\"walking\\", especially during the last lap to overtake Phan Thị Bích Hà from Vietnam. According to walk races' rules, athletes’ two feet are not allowed to leave the ground at the same time. The rules also state that the front leg must straighten when it makes contact with the ground. A violation may be cautioned with a yellow paddle, while repeat violations may be met with a red card. Three red cards, from three different judges, will result in a competitor's disqualification. Pictures allegedly showed Elena Goh violating both of these rules. Meanwhile, the runner-up Phan Thị Bích Hà said to the media that, \\"It's too frustrating. But I couldn't do anything. As a competitor, I won't make any comment. But everyone can clearly see what happened on the track\\". Media issues * An incident involving the flag of Indonesia printed upside down in the games souvenir guidebook led to a furore amongst Indonesians, with Indonesia's Olympic Committee chairman Erick Thohir accusing the Malaysian SEA Games organisers of \\"negligence\\". Indonesian President Joko Widodo called for an apology from Malaysia but cautioned Indonesian citizens against exaggerating the incident. Shortly after, the hashtag \\"#shameonyoumalaysia\\" became the most popular hashtag on Twitter on 20 August 2017. Malaysian Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin then met his Indonesian counterpart Imam Nahrawi at a hotel to personally apologise over the incident and assure that the guidebooks will be corrected and reprinted. The issue was resolved as the Ministers held a press conference afterwards and informed that Nahrawi had accepted Khairy's apology. Despite the apology, an Indonesian hacker group called the ExtremeCrew hacked into and vandalised several Malaysian websites with the message \\"Bendera Negaraku Bukanlah Mainan\\" (Our country's flag is not a toy). Ticketing issues * The allocated tickets of the Myanmar-Laos football men's group match at the UiTM Stadium which was said to be already sold out causing Myanmar fans had to support their team from outside the stadium despite there are still many empty spaces available inside the stadium as they were not allowed to enter. * On 28 August, many Malaysians fans angered over ticket sales system at the Shah Alam Stadium for the final football match between Malaysia and Thailand. Ticket counters at the Shah Alam Stadium are only open up to 2 counters resulting in chaos and forced Federal Reserve Unit (FRU) and police to be deployed to the area to disperse the crowd involved in the chaos. Most of those involved are frustrated because they have long queues since 6am but unable to buy even one ticket as the counter had run out of ticket sales. Other Malaysian fans also criticises the ticketing system as it is not sold online. But Malaysian Minister of Youth and Sports, Khairy Jamaluddin explained that online payment gateway provider could not guarantee a stable process because of volume and they were concerned people would transact payment and not get tickets because of the sheer volume. Fans' behaviour * Other threats to football supporters from other Southeast Asian countries by Malaysian hooligans were also previously reported when Malaysian SEA Games organisers have called Malaysian football fans to be civil and control their behaviour as the events are based on a \\"strong spirit of togetherness and sportsmanship\\" especially after an incident where video footage had circulated in the internet showing extreme Malaysian football supporters chanting \\"kami turun ke Shah Alam, satu jiwa sokong Malaysia, Singapore anjing dibunuh saja\\" (we come to Shah Alam, united in supporting Malaysia, Singapore dogs should only be killed). Food- related illness * On 24 August, 16 Malaysian athletes were sick after being hit with stomach bug suspected of food poisoning. Closing ceremony * The Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) was under fire and criticised by netizens for the disapproval of the planned performance, sponsored by the Department of Tourism (DOT) amounting at PHP8.1 million, in the turn-over of the hosting duties to the Philippines from Malaysia for the hosting of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games in the closing ceremony. The check was given back to DOT. However, in another report, POC Commissioner Peping Cojuangco stated that the plan to have a cultural performance in the closing ceremony was scrapped as Malaysia's SEA Games Organising Committee has already laid down their program before their request was made. After the games Doping * It was reported on 26 October 2017 that Malaysian diver Wendy Ng Yan Yee had failed a doping test conducted at the Games. Her B sample tested positive for sibutramine, a stimulant banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). As a consequence, Malaysia will lose the gold medal won by Wendy Ng and fellow diver Dhabitah in the 3m springboard synchronised event.

She is known for her popular slogan designs which address social issues surrounding sexuality. She is the author of the 2020 book Women Don't Owe You Pretty, promoted as an accessible introduction to feminism. As of August 3, 2020, she has a following of 506k on Instagram and uses this platform and Twitter to raise awareness of issues of sexuality, race and gender.  Life and career  Given's career started at the age of 14 when she received unexpected comments on the social media platform Instagram about her image, as well as being bullied at her all-girls' high school. She had her first experience with sexual harassment and was immediately called \\"frigid\\". Given stated in an interview with the Daily Mirror, \\"Being able to go on a night out legally and seeing so many women groped, harassed and objectified for going out and loving themselves pained me, because they didn't realise that this was actually sexual assault, not just 'boys being boys'.\\" This launched Given's stand against sexism. She also stands against victim-blaming which she has experienced first-hand. She refused to wear a bra in classes and she would be stared at by her fellow classmates. She began creating videos (vlogs) on YouTube and posting on Instagram about her experiences and advising people in the same situations that they are not alone. Given attended Plymouth College of Art from age 16 to 18 before she moved from Plymouth to London in 2017 to study at the London College of Fashion. Here she learnt to draw from fashion illustrator Julie Verhoeven. In 2018 she hosted her first exhibition. Launched in partnership with creative debuts, \\"Girls uninterrupted\\" included work from female and non- binary artists showcasing their experiences in society. A few months later Given received a message on Instagram from Rita Ora's stylist Kyle De'Volle, who asked her to design official merchandise for the singer's 2018 European tour. Given started off as Rita Ora's merchandise designer for her Girls Tour boosting the visibility of her designs. Given created her own company, Floss, which sells T-shirts, bags, prints and phone cases all displayed in bright colours and printed with Given's influential designs. All products sold on her website are vegan approved, created with organic cotton and vegan ink. Florence later wrote and illustrated her book Women Don't Owe You Pretty, which was released in June 2020. The book is based on lessons that she wished someone had taught her at a younger age. Filled with Given's artwork and knowledge on issues such as body image and mental health she explains that women do not owe it to anyone to be pretty. Given also created her own self- published magazine, Don't call me baby, which features her designs and nude edits and photography. From this she received further threats.  Appearances and press  In 2018 Given launched a petition to cancel the Netflix fat- shaming series Insatiable, gaining over 300,000 signatures. She appeared on the UK and US news debating the matter. Given has done multiple interviews on Live BBC radio on the roles in society that are assumed about the stages of a woman's life and how double standards of women and men in the media come to light. In June 2019 Given joined Tinder's \\"Single not sorry\\" campaign where she explained that she loves meeting new people and exploring her identity to learn that she is enough on her own. Given attended the BAFTA awards for the first time in 2019.  Influences  The first time the Given saw the quote \\"dump him\\" was when Britney Spears wore a T-shirt displaying that quote after the end of her relationship with Justin Timberlake. When Given experienced a break-up herself, she adopted the quote into her designs as a \\"cathartic release\\". Given hopes that someone in a similar situation as she was in would see the quote on a T-shirt, phone case or a Tote bag in the street and take it as a sign to put themselves first. She cites model and activist Munroe Bergdorf and fashion writer Chidera Eggerue as influences.  Recognition  Given won Cosmopolitan's UK Influencer of the Year 2019 for her work on women's mental health. Irish magazine Her listed her among its Women of the Year 2019.

The organisation was founded on 9 June 1998, with the intention of changing the lives of workers in companies’ supply chains.  Origin  The mid 1990s saw increased awareness of sweatshop working conditions for overseas garment and factory workers. This triggered calls for radical change regarding the ethics of employment overseas factories. As a reaction, companies created their own codes of conduct and set moral expectations for their supply chains. These set maximum working hours, minimum pay and codified the employees' freedom of association. Investigation had found that former companies’ codes of conduct were, in effect, futile as they inadvertently controlled the workforce further. Additionally, enforcement of these codes was through in-house, company-paid monitoring programmes. These were often described as \\"piecemeal\\" and \\"lacking credibility\\". The subsequent formation of the ETI was backed therefore by NGOs, UK businesses, and the then UK Secretary of State for International Development, Clare Short. Acting independently from the companies, it could more credibly implement the code and providing protection for the workers. The ETI relies on annual subscriptions from its member organisations. These formerly comprised a few, albeit large, companies (such as ASDA and The Body Shop). As of 2019 their membership reaches 90 companies, employing 10 million workers globally. High- profile members include the BBC, Burberry, Co-op, Fat Face and ASOS. The ETI is registered with Companies House as a non-trading company, number 03578127. The current Director of ETI is Peter McAllister, formerly the Executive director of the International Cocoa Initiative. McAllister took over the role from Dan Rees in 2010.  Base code  The ETI require their members to adopt and enforce their base code. This is expected to form the base for workers' conditions and rights. This includes the following: * \\"Employment is freely chosen.\\" meaning workers aren’t forced to work there or for longer than is contracted. They are also not forced to remain in the employment if they indicate they do not want to. * Freedom of association and collective bargaining. This allows workers to become members of trade unions or other forms of workers organisations. To the ETI, this condition is an essential requirement for membership and it has sanctioned companies for non-compliance. * \\"Working conditions are safe and hygienic.\\" * \\"Child labour shall not be used.\\" This point has been criticised as having unintended consequences, discussed below. * \\"Living wages are paid.\\" This differs from the minimum wage and is often much more. * \\"Working hours are not excessive.\\" This element relies on the states’ laws on maximum working hours. It has been argued in the theory of 'Race to the Bottom', that states compete with one another to raise maximum working hours (or lower safety regulations) so as to attract business, at the expense of workers’ health. Thus, exceeding the legal working limit is difficult in most cases. * \\"No discrimination is practised.\\" * \\"Regular employment is practised.\\" This would outlaw precarious and unreliable zero- hour contracts where the work attendance is at the discretion of the employer. * \\"No harsh or inhumane treatment is allowed.\\" This includes physical, sexual and verbal abuse as well as subhuman working conditions and practises. The ETI admit that some of these points have better compliance than others, and work towards them is still required. This lies in the more subjective points. For example, working hours and no child labour are measurable and quantifiable aims, whereas freedom of association does not factor in the unmonitorable atmosphere and culture that may prevent someone from feeling free to join any such association. There is also difficulty in implementing the living wages point, due to factors outside of companies such as rising costs of housing, fuel and schooling that decrease the workers’ wages. There is also an economic theory that points out that by increasing the paid wage, in accordance to the perceived living wage can eventually decrease the ‘take home’ wage. This is because the pay increase means that the costs of goods will have to increase to cover the higher labour costs. Therefore the consumers (who include the ones making the goods) will have to pay more from their new ‘living wage’, decreasing how much they have left to live with.  Governmental influence  The UK department for international development have granted unrestricted funding. The founding of ETI was backed by the Secretary for International Development. They often work with other governments to ensure adequate funding and also to lobby for legislative changes, if found to be necessary.  Departures  Boohoo, one of the largest UK fast fashion brands, withdrew their interest in becoming a member in 2019. Boohoo refused to meet and answer USDAW’s (Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers trade union) questions. This came after the UK Environmental Audit Committee’s inquiry into the fashion industry, recommended that the retailer engaged with USDAW in a bid to repair their damaged reputation. The committee also suggested becoming a member of the ETI which would bind the retailer into ethical practices, including paying a living wage and protecting workers' freedom of association. This follows revelation that workers in their Burnley warehouse were being paid £3.50 per hour, a fraction of the legal £8.21. The key recommendation from the committee was to recognise the workers' right to join a trade union. The ETI statement on the subject wrote, “a key expectation ETI has of its members an open attitude towards the activities of trade unions, enabling effective representation and ideally for workers to bargain collectively.” The ETI made a submission to the Environmental Audit Committee, meaning they actively disagree with the evidence given by Boohoo. Since then, there has been no further advancement in the retailer’s membership process to the ETI. Fyffes, an Ireland-based banana supplier, was suspended and eventually expelled, due to repeated failure to enforce the base code. In March 2016, NGOs Banana Link and the International Union of Food workers (IUF) complained to the initiative about the supplier not respecting their workers’ right to freedom of association; disallowing and not recognising the trade unions some workers chose to associate with. In some cases farmers were sacked who had chosen to associate with trade unions. In light of these concerns, a suspension order was put in place in May 2017. During this period Fyffes were encouraged by the ETI to reform their practices in line with the code; specifically to allow their farmers in Honduras to join trade unions at their discretion. Despite warnings, the highlighted concerns were not redressed, leading to membership being revoked in March 2019. Fyffes, in a statement to The Grocer, said that although \\"disappointed\\", they ultimately did not agree with the decision made by the ETI on the grounds that the trade union in question, Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Agroindustria y Similares (STAS), is not legally recognised in Honduras. Hence, denial of association remained, from their perspective, ethical. They decided not to appeal the order. Fyffes also said that they would continue implementing the base code in their practices across the supply chain. Banana link, a not-for-profit co-operative aiming to protect and restore plantation workers’ rights, also told The Grocer that they will press Fyffes on their agreement put in place in January 2019. The agreement states that they would reinstate sacked union members, while also raising wages and conditions for their workers, thus supported by STAS.  Criticism  One element of the base code is particularly contentious: the prohibition of child labour. A group of academics in 2016 condemned a United Nations convention banning child labour as promoting a particularly Western view of childhood as innocent and labour-free. They argue that paid work may be the means by which a child will feed their family or fund their siblings' or their own schooling. They argue that banning child labour, without effective actions against the large-scale poverty that necessitates it, can be futile or counterproductive. When the Indian government took nationwide measures to prevent child labour, they inadvertently caused more. As legal employment was no longer an option, families needing money for food and education turned to informal child employment. These operations are illegal and unregulated, so the employers can pay much less and often have harsher conditions, pushing other children into work to supplement the lost wages.

She designs outfits for womenswear, in particular for the women of Iran, who are subjected to wearing Hijabs and Chadors. She considers herself to be “daring... and I encourage women to also be avant- garde in the way they dress.” Abdoli uses bright colours and Western- influenced patterns and cuts while staying within the dress code of Iran’s Islamic ideals. Her daring, artistic designs and tailored pieces have landed her in conflict between the Iranian government and her brand. Abdoli’s agenda for her brand is to challenge the government, but more importantly, to allow Iranian women to express themselves through fashion.  Early life  Farnaz Abdoli grew up in Shiraz, Iran, with her family but moved to Tehran later. She describes her love for fashion from when she was a young girl living in Iran; \\"As a young girl I wasn't able to find my desired streetwear\\". This is due to the Iranian Revolution, which lasted between 1978-1979. The revolution had introduced an Islamic government, introducing sanctions on women being subjected to wearing Hijabs and loose-fitting clothing. This law had been established by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was the leader of the Basij Militia; the Militia enforced this dress code all over Iran, arresting anyone who would refuse to wear the legally required dress. Abdoli’s passion also derived from her designing clothes for herself and her sister, and then her mother would sew them. She is grateful to her mother for allowing her to be passionate about the fashion industry. Abdoli is also fluent in English and Persian.  Education  Abdoli first started at The Art Institute of Shiraz (2007-2009), where she got her Associates degree in graphic design. To expand on her graphic design journey, she then went to Sariyan University in Sari, Iran. After 2 years of study (2009-2011), she got her Bachelor's degree in graphic design. During her four years of education, Abdoli also worked as a freelance graphic designer; working with techniques such as processing, design and working with graphic applications. Abdoli begun a fashion career at IED Barcelona where she studied a short course in Fashion/Apparel Design which lasted less than a year (2014). Abdoli achieved her Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Shahid Beheshti University from 2014-2015.  POOSH-e MA  Since 2012, Abdoli’s main focus has been on her own brand called POOSH-e MA. Originally called \\"Poosh\\" (meaning \\"cloth\\" in Persian), it was founded in 2011. Her role in the company consists of her being the Founder, Senior Designer and Creative Director. As a side job, Abdoli is currently working as an actress too, working in a theatre since 2007. Her first collection involved a collaboration with “Street Style Fashion” which set in the Gallery of Design in Shiraz. After her brand’s debut, she started working with Mohammad Reza Vojoodi (The Chief Operating Officer of POOSH-e MA). Abdoli and Vojoodi brought out their 2013 Spring/Summer collection, which brought the attention of news agencies such as newspapers in Iran, California and Germany, BBC World News, BBC Persian, Germany Radio and CNN. The media describes the brand as \\"innovative, bold and fresh whilst being respectful to women of Iran,\\" and \\"colourful and modern\\". Abdoli has showcased further collections including POOSH-e MA Fall/Winter 2013/14, which introduced her ‘Smile Collection’. Then she launched her Spring/Summer floral collection in 2014 and lastly her Fall/Winter 2014/15 collection. For these shows she worked alongside other Iranian artists and designers including Reza Alaeddini, Hadi Qashqaei, Mohammadreza Rezania, Majid Haghighi Khoshbakht and her co-worker, Mohammad Reza Vojoodi. POOSH-e MA’s products are made of fabrics imported from Turkey by a professional tailoring company and have stated that they maintain ideal qualities in the private factory. It is estimated that there are between 51-200 employees that are working for the company. Abdoli currently has two shops in Tehran. POOSH-e MA has a presence on social media such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram. As of 2019, she has a follow count of approximately 84,200 on Facebook and 81,700 on Instagram.  Social and Political Backlash  Despite the success with her brand, Abdoli is one of the many Iranian fashion designers to receive criticism from the government. This has resulted in the Iranian authorities to block certain websites and social media pages, as they wanted for women to dress plainly and not for them to be influenced by up and coming designers. In 2013, when POOSH-e MA grew in popularity, Abdoli received a lot of skepticism from Iranian women asking if her collection was truly appropriate to wear outside. Moreover, POOSH-e Ma’s 2013 Spring/Summer collection experienced an adverse reaction from the media; the Bultan News website described Abdoli’s collection as “the Spring prostitution campaign” and had accused her fashion brand of being illicit. The claim of POOSH-e Ma being ‘too provocative’ is because her models wear leggings rather than wide leg trousers, three-quarter sleeve tops rather than long sleeved tunics and tighter fitting clothes rather than loose clothing. In 2016, the Iranian police shut down 800 shops for selling politically challenging clothing and gave a further 3,000 shops a formal warning. POOSH-e MA received backlash following this event from Iranian MP, Zohreh Tabibzadeh. She described Abdoli’s collection (which contained the word ‘Queen’) as a “calculated plan to subvert traditional values” and also declared that Abdoli’s collection was an “ugly manifestation of a Western trend that has entered our country with evil intentions devised behind the scenes.” In the last five years, Iran has grown drastically in terms of giving women some rights, especially in the fashion industry. Abdoli has mentioned that Iran has changed for the better, “Now you can’t count the number of people involved in fashion in Iran, with many companies holding training for modelling and designing and even offering certificates.” Iran also passed the law in December 2017, that women have the choice to partially wear the Hijab. However, not wearing a Hijab at all would result in going to Islamic education classes. Abdoli in part of an Iranian Fashion Revolution, exploring high fashion and bringing the demand for Western fashion trends to the Middle East. Articles have spoken about Abdoli’s ambitious ways of promoting fashionable dress.

This species occurs only on some small predator-free islands in the Chatham Islands, New Zealand, where it lives in seabird burrows. Its name derives from Rekohu, the Moriori name for Chatham Island.  Discovery and naming  This species was first noted in 1924 by C. Lindsay, and a specimen collected on Mangere was sent to the Canterbury Museum. Rowan Emberson of Lincoln University collected two from a petrel burrow on Mangare in 1993, and John Marris and Emberson collected others in expeditions in 1997 and 1998 to Mangere, Rangatira, and Star Keys, in burrows, and under logs and leaf litter, and with pitfall traps. The type specimens was collected in Woolshed Bush, Rangatira Island, in February 2006 by David Clarke and M. Renner; the holotype was deposited in Lincoln University's Entomology Research Collection, and paratypes went to the Field Museum and the New Zealand Arthropod Collection.  Description  Head of Creophilus rekohuensis Emberson noted that the unnamed Creophilus species he had collected was similar to the mainland New Zealand species C. huttoni, but its tiny hairs were silver rather than gold in colour. In his description of the species, Clarke noted that it had a large trapezoidal head, pale yellowish brown behind the eyes, and asymmetrical last segment of the antennae and reduced last segment of the front foot (protarsomere). The sexes seemed to be similar in size, unlike all other Creophilus species. Clarke also noted its greatly reduced wings; this species, unlike most staphylinid beetles, is flightless. When disturbed, it still has a flight response, spreading its wings while running away.  Distribution and habitat  C. rekohuensis has only been recorded from small islands south east of Chatham Island, New Zealand. Specimens have been collected from Mangere Island, Pitt Island, a tiny islet off the north-west coast of Pitt Island called Rabbit Island, Star Keys (14.5 km east of Pitt Island), and Rangatira Island – most collections have been from Rangatira. The preferred habitat on Rangatira seems to be coastal broadleaf forest, made up of Myrsine, Pseudopanax, and Coprosma species, riddled with the burrows of white-faced storm petrels, diving petrels, and broad-billed prions. The forest floor in seabird colonies is compacted and has little leaf litter, but C. rekohuensis is able to shelter in burrows. It is also found in coastal herbfields of Sarcocornia and Disphyma.  Ecology  Creophilus species are carrion feeders, consuming maggots on rotting corpses both as adults and larvae, but there has been only one observation of C. rekohuensis on carrion. However seabirds that die on Rangatira Island are rapidly skeletonised by the abundant endemic wētā species Talitropsis megatibia and Novoplectron serratum.  Conservation  All attempts to find C. rekohuensis on Pitt and Chatham Islands using pitfall traps with carrion have been unsuccessful, so the species seems to be restricted to islands where introduced predators are absent; although Rangatira Island was farmed until 1961, it never had cats, rats, or mice. It is possible the species might survive on main Chatham Island in seabird colonies with intact forest and rodent control, such as the taiko colony at Tuku Nature Reserve. Like other flightless beetles of the Chatham Islands, C. rekohuensis is vulnerable to rodent invasion of its last remaining refuges; unlike them, it does not have any formal protection under the Wildlife Act 1953. It has not been assessed under the Department of Conservation's Threatened Species Categories, let alone had a species recovery plan drawn up.

To the west it ends at the small headland called Pilot Point; to the east, at the cliffs of the much larger Purehurehu Point. Immediately south lie approximately of flat ground, beyond which the land rises steeply on all sides up towards Stone Hill and Hodson Hill. A stream flows down the valley from Hodson Hill and crosses the beach near its eastern end. Beyond Pilot Point lies Long Beach, followed by Pūrākaunui, Māpoutahi, and Blueskin Bay; beyond Purehurehu Point lie Kaikai Beach, Aramoana, Heyward Point, and the mouth of Otago Harbour. Northeasterly swells, although rare, produce barrelling waves or \\"mal waves\\" of great interest to surfers. The tides regularly strew the beach with shells and driftwood. Access to Whareakeake is by Whareakeake Road (formerly Murdering Beach Road), a steep one-lane gravel drive leading down the side of the Purehurehu Point ridge to the eastern end of the beach.  History   Pre-colonial occupation  During an 1879 Royal Commission of Inquiry into Ngāi Tahu land claims, a local named Taare Wetere Te Kahu identified Whareakeake as a traditional (place of residence) and (place of food production). Other older Māori people at the time recalled \\"a fenced fort, a cemetery, a sacred altar and a canoe anchorage.\\" Beattie's information is in general to be taken with a grain of salt, as he openly avowed substituting \\"quite harmless translations\\" for place names that he deemed \\"coarse and gross\\" and \\"lacking the refinement brought to us by the Holy Scriptures\\" (p. 90). At least two archaeological sites are present: a site with moa bones well back from the shoreline, which has received very little study, and a Classic Māori site, now thoroughly excavated, extending into the sand dunes. The latter site consists of four occupation layers of which even the oldest contains no moa bone. Artefacts from it – including fish-hooks, weapons, and amulets – have been used as type specimens of the Classic period. An unrivalled quantity of artefacts was excavated from Whareakeake in the 1880s and 1890s. One artefact found in the surface layer in 1863 was a medal given out by Captain James Cook during his second voyage to New Zealand, and most likely subsequently traded from Queen Charlotte Sound for . Due to extensive fossicking it is difficult to analyse the changes in this site across time.  The Sealers' War incident  In December 1817 the Sophia, a Hobart sealing ship carrying prospective settlers, anchored in Otago Harbour. Its captain James Kelly and a few others went to visit Whareakeake (then known to Europeans as \\"Small Bay\\") in an open boat. Among them was a settler named William Tucker, who had built a house at Whareakeake two years previously, where he ran an export business in ornamental ( neck pendants). At first they were welcomed, but when Tucker went into his house, the locals attacked Kelly, at the instigation of the chief Te Matahaere. In the ensuing melee three of the settlers were killed, including Tucker himself, who made it back to the boat but lingered in the surf begging his attackers not to hurt him before being \\"cut limb from limb\\". All the dead were eaten. Kelly and the other survivors of the attack rowed back to the Sophia. He and his men then proceeded to kill large numbers of Māori, including a local chief named Korako. Their subsequent report claimed that the Māori had boarded the Sophia and were killed in the fight to retake it, and that Korako was captured and shot when he attempted to escape; historians caution that Kelly's account of events, made to justify the actions he took, exaggerates the danger he and his men were in. He went on to destroy multiple canoes and set fire to \\"the beautiful city of Otago\\". This probably refers to Ōtākou, on the other side of the harbour; however, the Whareakeake village does seem to have been burned at around the same time, and abandoned rather than rebuilt. A was placed on the site and lifted in the 1860s. The motive for the attack at Whareakeake is unclear. Kelly believed it was a reprisal for previous shootings of Māori by Europeans in the ongoing state of lawless conflict known as the Sealers' War. A later account accused Tucker of having stolen a Māori preserved head in 1811 and inaugurated the trade in these items; this is considered to be poorly evidenced. Local Māori tradition has it that the trouble arose over the Sophias crew's treatment of the women at Ōtākou. Whareakeake was thereafter occupied by a succession of European households, and informally referred to as \\"Driver's Beach\\" or \\"Coleman's Beach\\" after two of them. However, on the first surveying map of the district (dated 1863) it was labelled \\"Murdering Beach\\". This remained its official designation until 1998, when the name Whareakeake was restored in the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act.  Present use  Whareakeake is a relatively quiet beach owing to the difficulty of access by road. It is a favoured spot for swimming, sunbathing, and scenery-gazing. It is the terminus of a full-day horse trek from nearby Hare Hill. Due to its right-hand point break, Whareakeake is one of four surf breaks of national significance in Otago – the others being at Karitāne, Papatōwai, and Spit Beach at Aramoana. It is considered suitable for intermediate to expert surfers. When the swell is northeasterly, the beach can become crowded with surfers, as these opportunities are rare. Whareakeake is frequently used by naturists for nude bathing. New Zealand has no official nude beaches, as public nudity is legal on any beach where it is \\"known to occur\\".

Early life  Tuit was born at Prospect in South Australia in 1911 and is the son of Clarence and Olive Tuit.  Life in the Northern Territory  Tuit arrived in Alice Springs in 1932 after an eleven-day journey in a Diamond T truck and started doing contract driver work for David Baldock, primarily driving between Alice Springs and Tennant Creek, which he did for the next three years. In 1936 Tuit established his own business after acquiring a Ford V8 transporting perishables to the remote mining communities at The Granites and Tanami. In 1937 Tuit's first wife died following a long illness. During World War II Tuit was the major civilian transport link between Alice Springs and Birdum as well as continuing, under military supervision, to supply mining communities; now including the mica mines at Wauchope and Hatches Creek. In 1939 Tuit married Pearl Arthur (née Brandt) and adopted her son Malcolm, from her previous marriage. Following the War Tuit won a five-year mail contract after proving that he could transport the mail between Alice Springs and Darwin in three days, which was faster then the Commonwealth Railways (from Birdum to Darwin). He combined the mail run with a passenger service, in a modified K5 International and it was known as 'The Butterbox'. The truck was very basic and was fitted with bench seats and had a canvas canopy and it would not have been an easy trip for its passengers. Tuit's first experience with tourism was taking students from Alice Springs to Palm Valley in 1944 and, in 1950, he took the first ever tour group, from Knox Grammar School in Sydney to Uluru (within what is now the Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park). Tuit would continue to take occasional tours to Uluru and he, and his wife Pearl, lobbied the government to have Central Australia promoted as a tourist destination; the government was determined that \\"there was no future in tourism for the NT\\" and that Uluru, then known as Ayers Rock, would be seen only as a \\"lump of rock\\". The Tuit's persisted and they were granted the first tourist lease in 1953 and, by 1955, were offering regular tours there. These early tours could carry approximately 20 passengers and the only accommodation was tents with an ex- army marquee set up as a dining and store room. By 1958 Tuit was taking 2,000 people to Uluru. Because of the success in the tourism side of the business, which also more suited his free spirit Tuit gave up, and sold his interest, in the transport side of the business. Tuit and Bert Bond, another Central Australian tour operator, were fierce competitors and they each maintained an arduous schedule to attract passengers. In 1952 the two men decided to merge their businesses and, on 16 October 1953, the Centralian Advocate reported a parting of the ways and that the businesses would once again operate separately: this was finalised by 3 December 1954. Reasons for the collapse of this partnership are speculative but presumed to be based around differing personalities and approaches. In 1957 Tuit bought Bond out when he left the Northern Territory in 1956 and, despite not wanting to, had to partner with Pioneer Tours due to financial difficulties. The business became 'Pioneer-Tuit Tours Ltd of Alice Springs'.  Later life  Tuit died on 15 May 1976 in Queensland.

It is set at their villa in Ibiza, where they are visited by Lucas (played by Ben Lamb), who believes that Isabelle has cheated him out of his late father's inheritance. It is notable because it marked the first time that the well-known singer Iggy Pop had played a lead role in a film (although he had had previously had cameo roles in several films). Critical reception In the UK, the film received a generally favourable review in the Radio Times, which commented that \\"the twist isn't entirely concealed, but it is surprisingly atmospheric and artful\\" and a slightly less favourable review in The Guardian, which gave the film three stars out of a maximum possible five. The critic Stuart Bannerman described the film as “one of the highlights of my film viewing year”, and as “very well directed and filmed in beautiful locations”.https://frompage2screen.com/2016/05/25/an-interview-with-toby- tobias-writer-director-of-blood-orange-bloodorangefilm/ The Hollywood Reporter was more critical, commenting that Iggy Pop “oozes craggy charisma in his first starring role” and that his “casting should give it cult appeal in theaters”, but also describing the film as \\"more self-conscious homage to vintage film noir than a fully rounded addition to the genre\\", and criticising director Tobias for requiring Barnfield to appear nude in several scenes, commenting that \\"for male-written female-fantasy figures, the line between empowerment and exploitation is often a fuzzy one\\".

The group consists of members Celly14, YP, J Emz, Lekks, Caesar and Spenny, with their name derived from a street gang called NF14. Music They have been called Australia's first drill rappers, with a sound heavily derivative of UK drill music, with the group incorporating UK drill's production style. However, they have a unique sound, which represents a Western Sydney subculture where young men are “lads”, “earchers” or “eshays”. OneFour were the first Islanders in this subculture to sing in an Australian accent. The video for their single \\"In the Beginning\\" achieved one million views on YouTube in 48 hours, and became the group's first single to chart, debuting at number 39 on the ARIA Charts. Legal issues In 2019, Onefour were forced to cancel their first national tour following police pressure on venues. In December 2019, three members of the rap group, YP (Pio Misa), Lekks (Salec Sua), and Celly14 (Dahcell Ramos) were jailed over several charges including reckless grievous bodily harm after a violent interaction at the Carousel Inn at Rooty Hill in July 2018. Misa was sentenced to four years in prison, with a two-year non-parole period, and will be eligible for parole in December 2021. Sua was sentenced to four and half years jail with a non-parole period of two years and three months and will be eligible for parole in December 2021, whilst Ramos was sentenced to ten years jail with a non parole period of six; he will be eligible for parole in December 2024. According to NSW Police, the group were involved in rival street gangs in Western Sydney, however J Emz stated in September 2020 that OneFour members had left the disputes of their teenage years behind them.

Timeline   Initial cause and fire View of the two headframes at the Bois du Cazier On 8 August 1956, a major mining disaster occurred at the Bois du Cazier coal mine. An accident began at 8:10 AM when the hoist mechanism in one of the shafts was started before the coal wagon had been completely loaded into the cage. Electric cables ruptured, starting an underground fire within the shaft. The moving cage also ruptured oil and air pipes which made the fire worse and destroyed much of the winch mechanism. Smoke and carbon monoxide spread down the mine, killing all the miners trapped by the fire. At the time of the incident, 274 people were working in the colliery Bois du Cazier, also known as Puits Saint-Charles.  Rescue operations  Rescue operations continued until August 23 when the final verdict came from the mouth of a rescuer: \\"Tutti cadaveri!\\" (All corpses).  Dead and casualties  Of the 274 people working on that morning, only twelve survived. Most of the victims were immigrants. Among the victims, there were 136 Italians, 95 Belgians, eight Poles, six Greeks, five Germans, five Frenchmen, three Hungarians, one Englishman, one Dutchman, one Russian and one Ukrainian. Old equipment outside the Bois du Cazier mine. The incident prompted Italy to demand better working conditions for the Italian guest workers in Belgium. Belgium, however, decided to recruit foreign workers from other countries more actively.  Trial  In the resulting prosecution, the trial court acquitted all of the accused on October 1, 1959. An appeal was lodged, and on January 30, 1961, the court gave the mine manager a six-month suspended jail sentence and a 2,000 Belgian franc fine (equivalent to €300 in 2006 after adjusting for inflation) and acquitted the other defendants.  Aftermath  The catastrophe had left such a legacy behind that it was selected as the main motif for a 2006 commemorative coin: the ten-Euro 50th anniversary of the catastrophe \\"Bois du Cazier\\" at Marcinelle coin. The obverse shows a portrait of a miner, with the mine \\"Bois du Cazier\\" in the background.

In the early 19th century, this was considered to be outside the boundaries of the town; the western boundary being marked by the Priory Bridge situated immediately to the east of this area. Itinerant builders who were employed in the large scale construction works taking place during the early 19th century around the town and St Leonards having no readily available accommodation, settled in this area of land.Brett Manuscript History of Hastings and St Leonards Vol 1 This area became almost an entirely self-sufficient district. Prior to being cleared in 1850, the area consisted largely of Ropewalks and shacks although there were a few more-substantial buildings. Post 1850, the land was transferred to the Crown, becoming the property of the Chief Commissioner for Woods and Forests, remaining in Crown possession to the current day. Pre-settlement Prior to becoming closed up by the accumulation of shingle after the great storm of 1287, the area was once part of the river mouth of the Priory Stream.The stream used to be navigable up to approximately the location of Hole Farm (near Blacklands Church) and formed a large natural harbour at the stream's mouth. The land was part of the property of the Augustinian Priory of the Holy Trinity, becoming the Priory Farm more recently. Occupation by itinerants  When the new town of St. Leonards by James Burton and the development of Pelham Crescent designed by the architect Joseph Kaye commenced during the 1820s, a large itinerant workforce migrated to the town, it being reported that they “took possession without leave, licence, or interference, and built houses, shanties, warehouses, and other erections, for which they paid no rent or consideration; a ‘No Mans Land\` and independent of any law or order and, who when challenged hoisted the American Flag, very much a symbol of independence at that time\\". Other settlers followed this workforce, resulting in the approximately 8 acres of foreshore becoming home to nearly 200 buildings and over 1000 residents. The names of the earliest inhabitants were recorded as being Thomas Page and John Prior in 1806. They lived in an old hulk (the remains of the brig Polymina, which had been converted into two dwellings. As the area became populated, many trades appeared in the area including a gardener, carpenter, miller together with Lodging houses, as well as limekilns, stonemasons, a tallow factory, a sawing house and a butchers with slaughter houses and piggeries. There was even a gin palace, the Black Horse run by Daniel Thomas,Nathan Dylan Goodwin: The America Ground #4  nathandylangoodwin , accessdate: 4 November 2019 and a small school founded by William Parker – the forerunner of Hastings Grammar School. Some of the occupiers had signed leases or gained permission from Lord Chichester, who claimed the whole of the area as owner or Lord under a grant thereof in the reign of James the First and others had sanction from the Corporation of Hastings, under a grant made to the Corporation under Queen Elizabeth.Hastings of Bygone Days and the Present (Henry Cousins - 1912) Many of the properties were found by a survey undertaken in 1829 to be either in the ownership of Mr. Thomas James Breeds, Mr. Thomas Breeds, and Mr. Mark Boykett Breeds, or associated with them.  Perception of the America Ground In general the occupants of the America Ground were considered to be little more than smugglers, thieves and vagabonds. Many of the shacks consisted of half-boats (vessels that had been destroyed by sawing in half at the Condemned Hole) up- endedHistoric Hastings J. Manwaring Baines Sheila Kaye-Smith in her 1919 book ‘Tamarisk Town’ described the area as having been “free to any beggars, gypsies or other undesirables ... a mock city of shacks, huts and tents.”Tamarisk Town (Sheila Kaye-Smith 1919) Barry Funnell however represents that in his book, ‘The America Ground’; 'is that of a diverse, industrious, self-contained community'. 'The America Ground' (Barry Funnell) Hastings Area Archaeological Research Group J. Manwaring Baines in Historic Hastings gives the following exchange between the, then Pierwarden, Charles Picknell and counsel during the hearing on the area; At some point in the early 1800s, bailiffs were sent into the area to apprehend suspected felons. The occupiers of the ground rioted in protest and chased the officials back over the Priory Bridge. The inhabitants raised the American flag, the Stars and Stripes, as a symbol of their independence, which they maintained to the end of their occupation of the land, aping events that had occurred during the American Revolution.  1821 map In 1821, the cartographers Abraham Purshouse Driver and Edward Driver, drew a detailed plan of the area which is held at East Sussex County Council's archive (The Keep). The catalogue entry contains the following description;  Inquiry  On 5 November 1827, an inquisition was held at the George Hotel, Battle. into the America Ground to determine ownership. In addition to the squatters of the land and the Crown, the adjacent landowners (the Cornwallis and Eversfield Estates) held themselves to be entitled to the land. After the Battle Commission decreed that the land was the property of the Crown, notices were served on the occupants in May 1828 to prove their claims. Of course, proving of the claims was impossible, but a number of seven year long. leases were granted to those who had buildings on the land.Sixth Report of the Commissioners of His Majesty's Woods, Forests and Land Revenue 5 June 1829 pg 10 In addition, the detailed plan of the land between Cuckoo Hill and The Priory was annotated to reflect leases  Eviction  On 13 November 1834, the Woods and Forests Commissioners served notice on the tenants that all buildings remaining on the ground after Michaelmas the following year, would be forfeit. Many of the evicted inhabitants moved to St Leonards, even going as far as removing their houses piece-by-piece and rebuilding them in Gensing Road, Norman Road, Shepherd Street, North Street and London Road among a few other locations; in total, some twenty eight buildings were re- located.Historical Hastings Wiki Brett Manuscript History of Hastings & St Leonards Vol.2 transcript The higher ground along the line of modern-day Cambridge Road was claimed by Lord Cornwallis as being the boundary of his land, leaving the parcel of ground now in Crown ownership. The ‘Americans’ remained independent until the end. In 1832 they marched to a civic banquet held on Priory Meadow, carrying their flag, which now also included the Union Flag and the Arms of Hastings. The flag was presented to the borough as a gesture of reconciliation.Hastings & St Leonards Observer 13 Jun 2014 (retrieved 2 Nov 2019) The 'America Ground' then remained unused for some 15 yearsHastings & St Leonards Observer 24 May 1924 pg. 9 other than occasional cricket matches and the Annual Rock Fair which was traditionally held on July 26-27th. The area subsequently became known as the Waste or Derelict lands..  Development  A real estate developer called Patrick Robertson leased the crown lands for 99 years at a rate of £500 per year. His name was later given to Robertson Street. Plans were drawn up by an architectural partnership, Reeks Humbert in 1850 and within six months, the aforementioned Robertson Street, Carlisle Parade and Robertson Terrace were in construction.

The street takes its name after the Copenhagen Stocks House which was located at the site from 1741 to 1851. The College of Advanced Technology's former buildings occupy the entire southwestern side of the street. History Gedde's district map of St. Ann's Western Quarter Stokhusgade originates in the 1649 plan for New Copenhagen, the large area which was included in the fortified city when the old East Rampart along present day Gothersgade was decommissioned and a new one was built in a more northerly direction. Part of a group of streets named after minerals from Norway, then ruled from Denmark, it was originally called Stenkulsgade (Black Coal Street). In 1741 the Copenhagen Stocks House relocated to a new building on the west side of the street. Originally a military prison, it was now also opened to civilian prisoners. The name referred to the stocks in which the prisoners were placed. Each prison cell contained up to 50 prisoners. The street is on Gedde's Map of 1757 referred to as Stokhusstræde. St. Mark's Church Nyboder Materialgård, a storage facility associated with Nyboder, was located at the corner with Rigensgade. It was in 1799 replaced by Søetatens Sejldugsfabrik, a navel ship sails manufactury, which closed in 1849. St. Mark's Church, the first Methodist church in the city, opened at the site in 1866. Stokhusgade The Copenhagen Stocks House closed in 1851. In 1862, residents in the street filed a formal request for a renaming of the street since they were unhappy about being associated with the inmates in the former correctional facility but this never happened. In the 1930s the former prison buildings and the other buildings on that side of the street were demolished to make way for a new home for the College of Advanced Technology. Buildings Jerusalem Church The College of Advanced Technology's former building(No. 1-5) was designed by Oluf Gjerløv-Knudsen (1892-1980). It is now home to Gefion Gymnasium and ´the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. No. 4B: The Niels Holscher House The Jerusalem Church replaced the original St. Mark's Church after a fire in the 1910s. The first church was designed by Ferdinand Vilhelm Jensen. The new one was built to a slightly modified and somewhat larger design by Jens Christian Kofoed. The small four-storey building next to the church (MN. 2) is from 1866. It contains the church office. The small building at No. 4B has by Holsher Nordberg Architects been expanded with a seven-storey residential infill on the very narrow site of just seven metres. The building was built as the private home of Holsher Nordberg Architects-partner Nils Holscher. The building at the corner of Øster Voldgade (Stokhusgade 8 / Øster Voldgade 12) is a former tobacco factory built for Wilhelm Frimann Schram in 1850. Commemorative plaque A plaque on the corner of Stokhusgade and ØsterVoldgade commemorates that Icelandic scholar and politician Jón Sigurðsson used to live at Øster Voldgade 12. Transport The northwestern end of the street is located approximately midway between Østerport (500 m) and Nørreport (700 m) station. Stokhusgade and Krussemyntegade are One-way streets in opposite directions (towards Rigensgade), eliminating through traffic. In media and culture In October 2009, Oprah Winfrey visited the Nils Holscher House at No. 4B in a programme sent from Copenhagen.

Ballou (March 3, 1823 – January 16, 1877) was a Vermont businessman and political figure who served as mayor of the city of Burlington from 1868 to 1870. Life Phineas Dodge Ballou was born in Starksboro, Vermont on March 3, 1823, a son of Smith Ballou (1786-1854) and Orissa (Bishop) Ballou. He lived and was educated in Burlington and Starksboro, Vermont and Troy and Albany, New York before moving again to Burlington in 1849. Ballou lived in San Francisco, California for four years during the California Gold Rush, and was a member of the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance that used extralegal means to fight rampant crime and corruption. Ballou returned to Burlington in 1853 and was affiliated with the mercantile firm of David A. Van Namee, whose wife Caroline was the sister of Ballou's wife Lucy. After several years in business with Van Namee, Ballou became a partner in a candy factory and its affiliated candy and cigar store. He subsequently became the owner and operator of a bookstore. A Republican, he served in local offices including alderman and president of the board of aldermen. Ballou was mayor of Burlington from 1868 to 1870. In 1872, he was elected to represent Burlington in the Vermont House of Representatives. Business failures during the Panic of 1873 led to his decision to leave his family in Burlington and move to Omaha, Nebraska, where he engaged in several enterprises he hoped would enable him to recover, including a partnership in a brewery. His sons later joined him in Omaha, and in 1876 his partner and he moved their brewery from Omaha to the new and rapidly expanding town of Deadwood, Dakota Territory. Ballou and his partner also intended to search for gold, and Ballou was engaged in this venture when he died. Ballou died in Gayville, Dakota Territory, about six miles from Deadwood, on January 16, 1877. According to others on the scene, Ballou had inspected a gold mining claim and stayed overnight at a Gayville stagecoach station, intending to travel back to Deadwood the following day. During the night, he went outdoors to relieve himself, mistook the shack covering a mineshaft opening for an outhouse, and accidentally fell about 35 feet. Other individuals at the station heard his cries for help and rescued him from the mine, but Ballou died from his injuries soon afterwards. At the time of his death, Ballou was wearing a Masonic ring, so he was recognized as a member by Deadwood's Masons. Masons took charge of transporting Ballou's body from Deadwood to Omaha, and then on to Troy. He received Masonic funeral rites at the Troy home of his brother Edgar before being interred at Oakwood Cemetery in Troy. Personal life In 1844, Ballou married Sarah F. Boyington, who died in 1847. In 1850, he married Lucy Jane Farnsworth (b. 1829). With his first wife, Ballou was the father of son William, who was born and died in 1847. With his second, his children included Charles Clark Farnsworth, Edgar Phineas, and Franklin Converse. Ballou was long affiliated with Freemasonry, including the Scottish Rite and Knights Templar, and served in leadership positions at several lodges in Burlington. He attained the 33rd Degree in 1870. Ballou was also active in the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and served as grand master of the organization in Vermont.

As an amateur, he won two U.S. National Junior Championships, one U.S. National Youth Championships and represented the United States at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games at light welterweight. Early life Otha Jones III was born on February 6, 2000 in Toledo, Ohio. Before dedicating himself to boxing, Jones participated in wrestling, winning three state titles between the ages of 8 and 12. He first got into boxing at the age of 8 after his friend, Wayne \\"Pretty Boy Bam Bam\\" Lawrence Jr., also eight at the time, became a viral hit on YouTube after posting a video of himself boxing. Jones said of the video, \\"We were like eight years old and he [Bam Bam] got a million views on YouTube [by posting a video of himself boxing]. I was thinking, ‘I want a million views, too, man!’. So, I told my dad and ever since then, I’ve been in the gym.\\" Jones is trained by his father, Otha Jones II and his older brother, Roshown Jones. Amateur career During an amateur career in which he compiled a record of 283–13, Jones won multiple national championships at the junior and youth level. Professional career On January 16, 2019, it was announced that Jones had signed a promotional contract with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing USA. He made his professional debut on March 9, 2019, winning via unanimous decision (UD) over six rounds against Girorgi Gelashvili at the Turning Stone Resort Casino in Verona, New York. Two judges scored the bout 58–55 while the third scored it 59–53. His second fight came three months later on June 21, scoring a first-round technical knockout (TKO) victory over Michael Horabin at the York Hall in London. Eight days after his bout with Horabin, Jones fought Matias Agustin Arriagada on June 29 at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island, winning by unanimous decision. All three judges scored the bout 60–54 in favour of Jones. The fight was part of the undercard for Demetrius Andrade's WBO title defense against Maciej Sulęcki. On October 12, 2019, as part of the undercard for Dmitry Bivol's WBA title defense against Lenin Castillo, Jones defeated Eric Manriquez by majority decision at the Wintrust Arena in Chicago.

She became director of research and development at the Naval Air Development Center in Pennsylvania, where she helped to develop light synthetic materials for use in aircraft. One of her jobs was the testing of fabric in existing balloons to ensure they could be used safely. Vadala was the third woman in the United States to be FAA-certified as a balloon pilot. As member of the Balloon Club of America, Vadala participated in 66 balloon flights, 47 flights in gas balloons and 19 flights in hot air balloons. Vadala was one of the first female pilots to participate internationally. She was involved in 13 flights hosted by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) between 1959 and 1963. On July 28, 2019, Vadala was inducted into the Balloon Federation of America Hall of Fame, at the National Balloon Museum in Indianola, Iowa. Education and early career thumb Eleanor Vadala was born on September 8, 1923, in National Park, New Jersey. She attended school in Atlantic City and Cardiff in New Jersey, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Between 1943 and 1945, Vadala worked at Kellett Aircraft Company, making aircraft parts. After World War II ended, she returned to university at Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. She graduated in 1947 with a Bachelor of Science in nutrition and a minor in chemistry. After graduating, Vadala worked at the Franklin Institute for eight years, as a lecturer on science and technology. She has said that she loved the work, but it did not pay well. Vadala volunteered at the Franklin for another ten years after finding a new job. In 1957 she helped to record the orbit of the Russia's Sputnik satellite as part of the Franklin Institute's Moon Watch Team. Interested in astronomy, she built by herself a 6-inch telescope. She joined the Rittenhouse Astronomy Society, eventually serving as Treasurer, Secretary, and President. Her acceptance of the presidency at a time when the organization had largely fallen into disarray was important in restarting its activities. For two terms, she served the Astronomical League in the position of Secretary of the Middle East. Aviation materials research thumb Eleanor Vadala worked for the Naval Air Development department, studying synthetic laminated materials for use in the construction of aircraft. She held positions at the Naval Air Material Center at the Philadelphia Naval Yard, which carried out materials testing and laboratory experiments, and at the Naval Air Development Center in Warminster, Pennsylvania. She eventually became Director of research and development at the Naval Air Development Center. One of her jobs involved testing the balloons stored in the Naval Air Facility in Lakehurst, New Jersey to ensure that they were still safe to use. She used an Instron Tensile Testing machine to assess the weight, compressive strength and tensile strength of the fabrics used. As a result of her findings, a number of balloons were ruled unfit for use. Vadala also used the Instron to test laminated light weight materials to see if they were suitable for use in aircraft. Her publications include Failure mechanisms for advanced composite sandwich construction in hostile environments (1979) and Triaxially Woven Fabrics of Kevlar, Dacron Polyester and Hybrids of Kevlar and Dacron Polyester (1980). Ballooning thumb Vadala was introduced to ballooning through Tony Fairbanks, a fellow member of the Rittenhouse Astronomy Society. Fairbanks was a charter member of the Balloon Club of America (BCA), incorporated in 1952 in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. Eleanor Vadala enjoyed her first balloon flight on January 9, 1954, a date that commemorated the first balloon flight in the Americas on January 9, 1793, by Jean-Pierre Blanchard. Don Piccard piloted the Balloon Club of America's N9071H, a former U.S. Army balloon built by Goodyear, on its fourth flight for the BCA. Known as the \\"Old 80\\", N9071H was an 80,000 cubic foot gas balloon. Don Piccard was accompanied by Francis Shield, Eleanor Vadala, and another first-time woman balloonist, Kate C. Ornsen. They landed in Netcong, New Jersey. Vadala has spoken eloquently of their landing. \\"We drifted down like one of the snowflakes. We touched down and landed so softly that the deer didn't even move—such a quiet serenity with the snow coming down so gently.\\" The flight was reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer and other newspapers and was the basis for Argosys April 1954 cover story. Vadala's second hot air balloon flight was on July 4, 1954, with Tony Fairbanks. They flew from Valley Forge airport, celebrating Independence Day. Vadala became an active member of the BCA, not only learning to fly, but also repairing the balloons, making nets for them, filling sandbags to use as weights, and driving the chase vehicles that followed the balloons after they launched. The club launched from both the Valley Forge Airport and from Wings Field in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania. Vadala was the third woman to receive FAA Balloon Pilot Certification, passing the written test on June 27, 1962 and the flight test on July 13, 1963. She flew from Doylestown, Pennsylvania to Hilltown, Pennsylvania. Vadala was preceded as a licensed woman balloon pilot in the United States by Constance C. Wolf (\\"Connie Wolf\\"), November 26, 1956, and by Jeannette Piccard who was issued her FAI-ACA ballooning license as of July 27, 1934. Vadala's first solo flight occurred on October 20, 1962 in La Coquette. She flew from Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania to College Avenue in Havertown, Pennsylvania. One of her early solo flights was mentioned with a photograph, in Sports Illustrated for December 24, 1962. Originally owned by the Navy, the balloon La Coquette was constructed in 1928, and later sold to the Balloon Club of America. In 1955, it was redecorated and featured in the 1956 film \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\". (The original book by Jules Verne did not include a balloon flight.) After filming, La Coquette was returned to the Club and continued to fly. In 1967, the Philadelphia Navy Yard decided to commemorate their 50th anniversary with a gas balloon launch. Vadala organized the launch, and was pilot-in-command of La Coquette for the flight, which occurred on July 29, 1967. She presented public educational programs about ballooning and was an instructor for hot air balloons. Unofficially, she served as the first secretary of the Balloon Federation of America, when it was formed in 1961. Vadala also taught classes in English as a Second Language (ESL) to immigrants. At age 63 she married an amateur balloonist, Rittenhouse Astronomical Society member, and astronomer for the Franklin Institute, Edwin F. Bailey (1907–1986). After his death, she established the Edwin F. Bailey Scholarship Award at Villanova University in his memory.

Description The border starts in the north at the tripoint with Burkina Faso. It then proceeds overland to the southwest, veers to the southeast in the vicinity of Grando Namoni, and then turns sharply southwards in the vicinity of Gando, Benin. The boundary then proceeds southwards in a roughly straight line, occasionally utilising rivers such as the Ogou and, in the southernmost stretches, the Mono. Mont Sokbaro, widely cited as the highest point of Benin, lies almost on the border here. In the far south the border turns sharply to the west before reaching the Atlantic Ocean, providing Benin with a thin strip of territory encompassing Grand-Popo and Hilakondji. History During the second half of the 19th century France began creating small trading settlements on the West African coast. In 1851 a treaty of friendship was signed between France and the Kingdom of Dahomey in what is now southern Benin, followed by the creation of a protectorate in Porto Novo in 1863. The colony of Dahomey (the former name of Benin) was declared in 1894, and later included within the much larger federal colony of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale française, abbreviated AOF) in 1899. The 1880s saw an intense competition for territory in Africa by the European powers, a process known as the ‘Scramble for Africa’. Germany began taking an interest in acquiring African colonies, signing a treaty with chiefs along the coast of modern Togo in July 1884; France recognised this claim the following year. The southernmost section of the border was agreed upon by procès-verbal in 1887, with the rest of boundary being settled by a Franco-German protocol of July 1897. A more detailed boundary treaty was agreed upon in September 1912. During the First World War German Togoland was conquered by Allied forces and split into British and French mandates. By plebiscite, British Togoland was incorporated into the Gold Coast colony in 1956, which gained independence as Ghana the following year.Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) Elections in Africa: A data handbook, p432 Ghana National Reconciliation Commission: \\"The Historical Context\\" Government of Ghana The remainder of Togolese territory remained under French control, however France had also initiated a process of decolonisation, which culminated in the granting of broad internal autonomy to its African territories in 1958 within the framework of the French Community. French Togoland declared complete independence as Togo on 27 April 1960, followed by Dahomey on 1 August, and their mutual frontier between an international one between two independent states.

British Muslims are portrayed in the media as foreigners or \\"outsiders\\" whose lifestyles are different from those of English people. There are many reasons for this claim, but the most important one is rooted in ideological beliefs and may be related to the issues of Orientalism. National and international concern The role of media in representing minorities is highly crucial when audiences are in little contact with them. The sociologist Tariq Modood suggests that British Muslims are portrayed as an \\"alien other\\" by British media and this paves the way for the development of \\"Islamophobia\\" which stems from the cultural representations of the \\"other\\". The themes of \\"deviance\\" and \\"un-Britishness\\", Modood continues, are also sought in the treatment of British Muslims and Islam. British Muslims are heterogeneous, with different ethnic backgrounds, distinguished from other social categories such as \\"British\\" or \\"Christian\\". This heterogeneity has been more intertwined with a wide diversity of political, cultural and socioeconomic factors. Comprehensive research studies accomplished in the UK on the concept of \\"national identity\\" reveal that minority groups in the UK are thought of \\"un-British\\". Recent cultural debates and round-table discussions held by Media experts in a quest for knowing \\"who is and who is not British\\" have also attached more significance to the theme of minority marginalization in the media. West and the rest Professor Edward Said's metaphorical expression of \\"a double-edged sword\\" signifies that how the media in its representation of minority groups first \\"marginalize minority voices\\", then, they are \\"virtually ignored or invisible\\". This misrepresentation is backed by negative discourses giving in practice a false account of the minorities. According to Said the press portrayal of British Muslims as the \\"alien within British culture\\" dates back to the rise of Western imperialism from which a political dichotomy of \\"West\\" versus \\"East\\" was constructed. In his book Orientalism Said explores the relationships between the \\"West\\" and the \\"Rest\\" and Muslims in particular. Focusing on the Middle East as a transcontinental region he exposes how in power relations and dynamics a sharp difference is observed between \\"the familiar Europe or the West and the strange, the Orient or the East\\". A complexity of reasons, media experts say, must be considered to understand why the Western media have taken an \\"unsympathetic\\" stance on Muslims or Islam. Said found one problem in connection with the narrator rather than the narrative. He argues the West has its \\"own experts\\" and commentators to represent the East, since \\"they are not representing themselves\\". Akbar Ahmed, American-Pakistani author and analyst, has noted that the negative representation of Islam and Muslims by the Western media is increasingly growing after such incidents as the Rushdie affair, the first Gulf War and 9/11 attacks. Media and race Academic studies show there is a close link between the issues relating to \\"immigration and asylum\\" and the \\"underlying themes of race and nation\\" reflected in the British media. The concept of nation in Western terminology implies \\"a national culture ethnically pure and homogeneous in its whiteness\\", but the existence of non- white communities within the White society, Saeed argues, has semantically deconstructed the conventional norms of social integrity. Journalist Roy Greenslade claims that Britain raises concern about the emergence of a multi- cultural \\"non-white society\\" in its approach to the questions of \\"asylum and immigration\\". Throughout the years the word minorities have been presented by the media in a derogatory sense as they are usually connected with the negative themes of \\"conflict, controversy and deviance\\". Today we are witnessing the rise of an institutional \\"racism\\", which has in core a concern about such issues as \\"Islamic fundamentalist terrorism\\", \\"asylum seekers\\" and \\"illegal refugees\\". This dynamic form of racism can be adapted to different situations and circumstances. American political scientist Samuel Huntington in his book The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order explicates \\"Islamic fundamentalism\\" is not the main concern for the West. It is in fact Islam, \\"a different civilization whose people are convinced of the superiority of their culture\\" and that how they are afraid of losing their power. On the same principle, Hartmann and Husband suggest that it is not \\"race\\" but \\"racism\\" that has caused a problem for the UK and its media. Islam, British writer Ziauddin Sardar concludes, has refused to comply with the West in implementing the \\"universal project of globalization\\" characterized by Western values. This refusal is highly symptomatic of a constant threat to the \\"Western's free and democratic World\\".

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. (Could it be the building located at exactly ?) It is a three-story rectangular house, about in plan, which William Shivers arranged to have built around 1820. Its first floor is a high basement, built of Salmon-colored brick laid on one course of granite blocks, and topped by a narrow course of the same. The house is late Federal in style, with \\"strong overtones of the Greek Revival. As of 1970, it had only been modified significantly once, back in 1890, when an original raised portico at the main entrance was removed and replaced by a second-story porch. The main entrance retains its original glass-panelled fanlight, wide double doors, and side lights. In 1970, plans were underway to re-create the portico, which would again resemble a Greek Doric temple. A broad stairway would rise to the portico/entrance. The restoration was being guided by Edward Vason Jones. With The \\"story of Rock Mill\\" begins with William Shivers' father, Jonas Shiver, who was born in 1750 and fought in the American Revolutionary War. Jonas married in 1772, and by 1809 had migrated from Virginia to this area, and was living on the east bank of the Ogeechee River in Warren County, and was a mill owner and presumably a slave owner. His home was at the center of the small community then named \\"Shivers\\", now Mayfield. It also had a grist mill, a woolen mill, a store, a tavern, and a stage-stop and post office on the Augusta-to-Milledgeville stagecoach line. William Shivers, the son, built a grist mill on the west side of the river, in Hancock County, and then this frame house named for the mill, before 1820. His mills \\"manufactured 'cotton goods and wool yarns,' and carded wool for the local people\\", and he became rich and had many slaves. The house is located on Mayfield Road, on the Ogeechee River north of the community of Jewell, Georgia; Jewell is at the intersection of Mayfield Road and Georgia State Route 16.

The Prime Minister's Chief of Staff Keith Schembri and Minister for Tourism Konrad Mizzi resigned following the arrest of businessman Yorgen Fenech in connection with the murder. On 1 December 2019 Prime Minister Joseph Muscat announced his intention to resign on 12 January 2020 after increased pressure from protestors. An EU mission called for his immediate resignation. Constitutional experts, legal bodies and other representatives have stated Muscat's decision to remain in office until January and to have a six week parliamentary recess over Christmas has led to an unprecedented constitutional crisis. Background Malta has enjoyed a financial boom since accession to the EU in 2004, fueled by online gambling, crypto-currency exchanges, the sale of citizenship (EU-citizen), and a financial centre with a reputation for lax controls on money laundering and tax evasion. According to The Guardian, the country has been used as a gateway into Europe for money from Libya, Azerbaijan, Russia and even Venezuela. In 2018, the European Central Bank revoked the licence of a bank called Pilatus, first investigated by the journalist Caruana Galizia, after its Iranian owner was arrested on sanctions- busting charges by US prosecutors. Among other things, Caruana Galizia wrote about gifts and money from the presidential family in Azerbaijan to Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, his wife and connections between opposition leader Adrian Delia and a prostitution ring in London. Persons involved in the crisis Daphne Caruana Galizia Daphne Caruana Galizia was described as \\"one-woman-Wikileaks\\" and one of the most important, visible and fearless journalists of the country. She ran a popular blog called Running Commentary, which investigated allegations of corruption and other criminal wrongdoing which Caruana Galizia alleged, ran into the highest levels of Maltese government. In a murder plot, she was killed in a car bomb attack to her Peugeot 108 on 16 October 2017. Yorgen Fenech Yorgen Fenech served as head of Tumas Group and a director of energy company Electrogas. Fenech resigned from both positions in 2019. He was identified in 2018 as being the owner of a Dubai-registered company, called 17 Black. The company was listed in the Panama Papers. Caruana Galizia had written about 17 Black eight months before her death, alleging the company had links to the Joseph Muscat's chief of staff Keith Schembri and to former energy minister Konrad Mizzi. The political blogger Manuel Delia assumption is: Fenech wanted to cover up a bribe scandal, which Caruana had uncovered. Yorgen Fenech's \\"17 Black\\" company was to spend millions on offshore accounts of several Labor Government ministers. Evidence had been found only after her murder. Joseph Muscat Joseph Muscat, 2018 Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of Malta at the break out of the crisis, promised a fair investigation after the murder plot. In November 2019, clues pointed directly to the immediate circle of the head of government in the case. There was evidence that Muscat had known Fenech's role in the Caruana Galizia case since 2017, because his secret service bugged Fenech's telephone and was reading the logs. Keith Schembri Keith Schembri was chief of staff of the Office of the Prime Minister. He is said to be one of the most powerful persons in Maltese politics. Schembri was the subject of Caruana Galizia's last blog post, minutes before she got killed. Caruana Galizia alleged he had benefited from secretive shell companies. Schembri was a successful businessman before he switched to politics. His Kasco Holding bought paper and sold it to the printers in Malta with a good margin and expanded the business to the trade of printing machines. His many clients included the oldest newspaper of the country, the Times of Malta. Since the Times of Malta was unable to pay its bills during the financial crisis, according to the newspaper, Schembri often put pressure on them. Apparently he demanded good press for himself and his growing business empire. Kasco also invested in beverage brands, restaurants and luxury furniture. In 2008, Joseph Muscat brought his friend Schembri to the Labour Party. Schembri updated the stale communication style of Partit Laburista. In 2013, the party won the parliamentary elections and Muscat became premier. Schembri was appointed as the \\"Chief of staff\\", a newly created position in the organization chart of the ruling government. When Schembri was arrested, the police investigation drew close to members of Joseph Muscat's government. Police released Schembri some days later, announcing he was no longer viewed as a person of interest. The family of Caruana Galizia sees Schembri as one of the most suspected persons in the murder plot. Konrad Mizzi Konrad Mizzi, 2012 Konrad Mizzi was tourism minister but stepped down, saying it was his duty to allow Mr Muscat's government to continue. Mizzi was earlier removed from his post as health and energy minister in 2016 after it emerged that he had set up a company in Panama, listed in the Panama Papers. He said, he had merely made arrangements for managing family assets and had done nothing wrong. In his health role he oversaw the part-privatisation of Malta's health service. Melvin Theuma  Melvin Theuma is a taxi-driver from Valletta. He is linked to criminal enterprises and was arrested in November 2019 in connection with a separate anti-money laundering investigation. Theuma offered police information about the 2017 murder in exchange for immunity from prosecution. He is described as a middle-man between the commissioners and the murders. Lawrence Cutajar Lawrence Cutajar was responsible for the investigation in the assassination case of Caruana; he was commissioner of the Malta Police Force. In January 2020 Cutajar resigned as commissioner of police. Malta's former head of government, Joseph Muscat, had recently resigned because of alleged involvement of people around him. He had always refused to deputize Cutajar. His successor, Robert Abela, promised to review the police chief's appointment process. Caruana Galizia family Matthew Caruana Galizia, Journalist and son of Daphne Caruana Galizia at the Global Conference for Media Freedom in July 2019 in London. The relatives of Caruana Galizia initiated legal action against Muscat on 2 December 2019. The family demanded the immediate resignation of the prime minister, stipulating that his remaining in power was not to be tolerated by all who cared about justice: \\"His role in investigating the murder of our wife and mother is unlawful.\\" Timeline On 16 October 2017, the investigative journalist Caruana Galizia died in a car bomb attack close to her home, attracting widespread local and international reactions. In December 2017, three men were arrested in connection with the car bomb attack. Important information from a witness in 2019 On 13 November 2019 the spaniel sniffer dog Peter was screening passengers when he alerted his handlers of Malta custom to the smell of cash. Customs reportedly found €210,000 in the belongings of Melvin Theuma, preparing to board a flight to Istanbul. The economic crimes unit were called and a day later, the incident led to the arrest of Theuma. Under questioning by police, Theuma made the claim that he had acted as intermediary in the contract killing of journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia. When Theuma called for his lawyers, he asked for Jason Azzopardi and his colleague Simon Busuttil. Both are the Caruana Galizia family lawyers and both are members of parliament for the opposition Nationalist Party. The Guardian described both as \\"the forefront of the battle to hold Muscat’s government to account.\\" On 19 November 2019 Muscat announced a deal with a star-witness (which later turns out to be Melvin Theuma). This person should provide comprehensive information about the murder case and other crimes, but he receives impunity. On 20 November Fenech attempted to leave Malta on his private yacht, with the Armed Forces of Malta intercepting his boat and arresting him as a \\"person of interest\\" in the Caruana Galizia murder enquiry. Maltese media alleged that Fenech was familiar with Melvin Theuma, a taxi driver with links to criminal enterprises who had been described in local media as a potential \\"middleman\\" in the murder. On 23 November 2019 Fenech offered himself as a witness. He promised information about the murder case and other offenses, in exchange for impunity. On 25 November 2019 the star witness Melvin Theuma was granted immunity from prosecution by President George Vella at the request of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. Fenech's defense tried to call the whole process into question. This was successful - Fenech was released on 29 November 2019. The businessman was prejudiced in public, so his defence said, that he could not hope for a proper investigation and a fair trial. He argued that the second main suspect, Keith Schembri, had not been charged. Also he argued, that Schembri has built the star witness Melvin Theuma against Fenech and paid for it. In addition, the police inspector in charge of the case had a close connection to Schembri and was therefore biased. Keith Schembri and other governmental staff involved On 30 November 2019 an indictment was filed against Fenech in Valletta, and he was accused of complicity in the murder of Caruana Galizia, amongst other charges. Fenech pleaded not guilty. He has been back in jail since 30 November 2019. Six days after Fenech's arrest, Schembri resigned his government post on 26 November 2019, and was subsequently arrested by the police for questioning. Schembri was later released. Adrian Vella, who was a personal physician to Fenech, was also arrested. Vella was named as a director of a number of companies registered or managed in Panama. He is said to have served as a secret messenger between Schembri and Fenech. Yorgen Fenech, in his court statement, accused Schembri of being the mastermind behind the Caruana Galizia murder. Schembri was also accused of influencing Fenech in order to frame Chris Cardona as responsible for the murder. Despite calling for a presidential pardon, Yorgen Fenech was not granted one. This was decided by the Cabinet in a long session in the night of 29 November 2019. Muscat resignation  Muscat announced his resignation on 1 December 2019 in a televised speech, saying he would step down after Labour Party internal elections on 12 January 2020. He informed the President of Malta, George Vella, that he would be resigning his duties once his successor had been elected. His decision was influenced by the investigation into the Caruana Galizia murder. About 4000 Maltese blocked Muscat and other MPs from leaving the Parliament Building in Valletta on 3 December 2019. The Nationalist Party announced a boycott of any parliament session until Muscat stepped down. Several hundred people from the Labour Party met for a demonstration against the anti-government protests. On the same day, Reporters sans Frontieres, together with the relatives of Caruana Galizia, filed a lawsuit against three of the alleged key figures in the murder case in France. The lawsuit was filed with the Finance Prosecutor's Office and the Paris Public Prosecutor's Office accusing Yorgen Fenech, Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi of murder and bribery. Muscat resigned as planned on 13 January 2020 and was replaced by Robert Abela as the new prime minister of Malta. Protests Reactions An EU Parliament delegation announced to come to Malta in early December 2019 to monitor the rule of law and to hold talks with government officials in Malta.

His deep involvement in precision timekeeping, as a colleague of Frank Hope-Jones and director of the Synchronome Company, derived from work on the safety of train travel and the accurate measurement of train speeds, following investigations into a serious train derailment of a LSWR train at Salisbury Station in 1906, when twenty- eight people died.Denys Vaughan, William Hamilton Shortt, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (23 September 2004). Shortt was born in September 1881 in Wimbledon, Surrey, only son to Charles Henry Shortt, a civil engineer, and Fanny (née Dobson) who was sister to the poet Austin Dobson. He worked at the LSWR from 1902, starting as an articled pupil. He became an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1907. Shortt met Hope-Jones in 1910, and began collaborating in the design of master clocks from 1912, joining the Synchronome Company as a shareholder and director. He produced a series of designs involving new forms of escapement, attempting to optimise the delivery of energy to the pendulum, while taking account of variations in external factors such as temperature and atmospheric pressure. Shortt's experiments continued until 1916, when he was released from duties with the LSWR to serve as a captain in the Royal Engineers in France. In 1919, having been demobilised from the army, he returned to his experimental work, producing a series of clocks in which he continued to try new ways of delivering an impulse to the pendulum, while attempting to make the pendulum do as little work as possible. The theoretical ideal was a pendulum operating freely in a vacuum and doing no work. Some of the best performances to date had been achieved by clocks housed in vacuum tanks, using a Riefler escapement. Miles (2019), pp. 27-30 Shortt's breakthrough in 1920 came with the development of a clock system, inspired by the work of R.J. Rudd of Croydon, championed by Hope-Jones, in which the task (each thirty seconds) of unlocking the impulse to an otherwise free pendulum was taken on by a separate slave clock, which in turn was corrected (as part of the same operating cycle) by a synchronising pulse derived from the master clock, containing the free pendulum. This system therefore utilised a mechanical phase-locked loop. Championed by the Astronomer Royal of Scotland, Ralph Allan Sampson, Shortt's free pendulum clock was rapidly adopted worldwide by many observatories as a time standard, and remained as such until the widespread adoption of quartz clocks from the Second World War onwards. Miles (2019) pp. 168-88. Shortt was honoured for his work in horology and precision timekeeping with the Gold Medal from the British Horological Institute in 1931 and its Fellowship in 1932, the John Price Wetherill Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1935, and the Tompion Medal of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers in 1954. He was made a liveryman of the Company in 1931 and served as Master in 1950. Vaughan, DNB (2004). Shortt, Obituary.

The city has plans to expand the current of bike lanes to , and the current of trails to . San Jose was ranked as a bronze-level bicycle-friendly community by the League of American Bicyclists. City planning Bicycle planning in San Jose is handled by the city's Department of Transportation. San Jose Bike Plan 2020 The San Jose City Council passed the \\"San Jose Bike Plan 2020\\" in November 2009. It was a set of goals intended to be implemented by 2020 if possible, or otherwise make progress in those directions. The goals were as follows: * Complete 500 miles of the Bikeway Network by 2020 * Achieve 5% of all trips taken by Bike by 2020 * Reduce bike collision rate by 50% by 2020 * Add 5000 bike parking spaces by 2020 * Achieve Gold-level Bicycle Friendly Community status by 2020 City officials traveled to Copenhagen in 2014 to observe how that city achieved 50% of trips by bicycle. The San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR) reported from a panel discussion at an event they hosted in 2017 that the question came up why San Jose didn't see as much increase in cycling usage as expected after a round of bike lane construction. The panelists concluded that the unprotected bike lanes tend to only attract experienced riders. The panel said new less-experienced riders tend to want protected bike lanes before they will be attracted to ride more. San Jose Better Bike Plan 2025 The San Jose Better Bike Plan 2025 will supersede Bike Plan 2020. It has been in development since 2018. It is expected for release in early 2020. County-wide planning Cycling in the city of San Jose can't just be viewed in isolation because it is bordered by other cities within Santa Clara County. County-wide bicycle and pedestrian planning is done by the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) because it was formed by a merger of the county transit agency with the congestion management districts of the county and all the cities in the county. Cycling infrastructure The city has plans to expand the current of bike lanes to , and the current of trails to . Hellyer Park Velodrome Hellyer Park Velodrome is located in Hellyer County Park next to the Coyote Creek Trail. It was built in 1963. It served as the site of the 1972 US Olympic bicycling team tryouts. The velodrome was renovated in 2007. It is operated by the Northern California Velodrome Association, a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation. San Jose International Airport has bicycle racks in both the Terminal A and B parking structures. Bikes on transit VTA buses have racks in front with capacity for 2 bikes. VTA light rail has 4 racks and room for 4 more cyclists holding their bicycles in each train car. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), which is planned to open in San Jose at the Berryessa/North San Jose station and in Milpitas (next to the border of San Jose) at the Milpitas station in 2020, has rules for bicycles restricting using the first car at any time, the first 3 cars during commute hours, or any crowded car. Cyclists are also prohibited from using station escalators, and must instead use stairs or elevators. Caltrain normally runs 2 or 3 bike cars per train. Cyclists are required to use the bike cars. Caltrain does not allow bicycles to be locked on board. Amtrak California Capitol Corridor normally runs 2 bike cars per train. Other train cars have 3 bike racks on the lower level.

Gaskell was a \\"vivacious but unhappily married society hostess who belonged to the aristocratic circle of friends known as the 'Souls'\\": she had platonic relationship with the artist Edward Burne-Jones, who wrote her up to six letters a day and painted a famous portrait of her daughter Amy. The letters were only discovered in 2005, when May's great-grandchild Josceline Dimbleby wrote a book about the affair, called \\"A Profound Secret\\" () (US title: \\"May and Amy: A True Story of Family, Forbidden Love, and the Secret Lives of May Gaskell, Her Daughter Amy, and Sir Edward Burne-Jones\\", ). Burne- Jones also painted May herself. Gaskell founded the War Library in 1914 and actively ran it throughout the war. Despite moving in similar circles, she was no relation to Elizabeth Gaskell.

It was one of the first examples of bibliotherapy in a military context, inspiring the American Library War Service to be founded a few years later \\\\- although earlier examples can be found, e.g. the Soldiers' Free Library. The service was created by Helen Mary Gaskell, using Lady Battersea's large but empty London home Surrey House (near Marble Arch) as a base. It began operations in 1914. Gaskell obtained official approval from Lord Haldane, then War Minister, and Sir Arthur Sloggett (head of the Royal Army Medical Corps). Initially it was aimed at the wounded in military hospitals, but the Admiralty requested it be extended to those on active service too, including medical staff and coastguards. Gaskell's younger brother (Beresford Melville, former MP for Stockport) offered financial support. An appeal was launched for donations of used books - the first appeal of the war - and with free promotion by newspapers, reading matter started arriving in parcels, boxes, then whole vanloads. Demand was huge: it distributed over six million books and magazines, including new books (purchased by the public) and special editions printed by publishers specifically for this purpose (e.g. Oxford University Press supplied four and a half million New Testaments). At the same time, some people regarded it as a chance to clean out their rubbish while gaining credit for 'charity', so tens of thousands of old parish magazines were sent in, only to be thrown away. In October 1915 it became known for a while as the \\"Red Cross and Order of St John War Library\\", when these two organizations took over the financial burden. Surrey House also hosted the RAF Comforts Fund, which occupied the upper floors as a collection and distribution centre. It was destroyed in the late 1920s and replaced by the Regal (later Odeon) cinema. Alt URL When Thomas Jones CH and others set up the Army Bureau of Current Affairs in 1940 to provide 'mental stimulant' to World War II troops, this was partly continuing the BWL's aims, although Gaskell's contribution appears to have been largely overlooked until as late as the 21st century.

Adopted after Grenada separated from the United Kingdom on February 7, 1974. The island nation of Grenada is the smallest country in the Western Hemisphere. A sovereign state that is located in the West Indies in the Caribbean Sea towards the southern end of the Grenadine island chain, the nation is composed of the island Grenada along with six smaller islands that lie north of it. Grenada is known as the \\"Isle of Spice\\" for its production of nutmeg and mace crops (the nutmeg even being featured on the nation's official flag), for which its is one of the world's largest exporters and contributes vastly to the country's GDP. Grenada is a developing country that relies heavily on the support of other nations and organizations to finance many of its government projects. One of Grenada's partners is the International Monetary Fund.  Relations with the International Monetary Fund  The nation of Grenada joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on August 27, 1975. Since then, Grenada has been under heavy review with the IMF, who have made Grenada eligible for special drawing rights. Special drawing rights (abbreviated SDR) are supplementary foreign exchange reserve assets defined and maintained by the IMF. Based on Grenada's performances, both economically and policy wise, Grenada can be eligible for more SDRs. In the previous years, Grenada and the IMF have been working closely to grow and sustain their economy.

The nutmeg and the mace is one of Grenada's largest spice export.  Economic Overview of Grenada  The economy of Grenada is small and tourism is its largest foreign exchange earner. Grenada shares a common central bank with Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), and holds the East Caribbean dollars as its currency. After tourism, Grenada relies heavily on agricultural exports, mainly different types of spices. The nutmeg, wheat flours, and various fruits makes up majority of Grenada's exports (per 2017). Grenada has suffered many economic drawbacks since becoming a nation. A major concern is the rising fiscal deficit and a heavy debt crippling its government operations. Hurricane Ivan in 2004 led to serious setbacks for Grenada, along with the Great Recession in 2008 as the United States of America is one of Grenada's largest trade partners. Grenada was listed nine spaces above the bottom when it came to total debt in 126 developing countries in 2017.  2019 Article IV Consultation with Grenada  The most recent publishing of the Article IV Consultation conducted by the IMF showed some favorable reviews towards Grenada. The press release shows great progress for Grenada: including a GDP growth of 3.1% and Quota (SDR) of 16.4 million. The IMF notes that the increase of GDP productivity through construction projects and tourism. Grenada has also been able to keep inflation low and bank credit positive. One negative mark noted was that unemployment, although declining, still remains high at 21.7%. A statement from the Executive Board Statement states: > \\"... welcomed Grenada’s continued strong economic and fiscal performance and > sustained debt reduction, underpinned by sound policies. They emphasized > that further policy improvements and public support for reforms are critical > to achieve higher and broad-based medium-term growth, further reduce > unemployment, entrench debt sustainability, and strengthen financial > stability.\\" Grenada has also pushed to focus its concerns on the growing worry of climate change. The destruction brought on upon by Hurricane Ivan was devastating, but with the more powerful natural disasters accruing due to the warming of Earth's atmosphere, Grenada could quite possible be destroyed or even underwater. Much actions are being taken place to counteract the effects of climate change that are seen in the policies Grenada has been implementing this year.

He was a partner in the firm of Fawcett, Preston and Company, which supplied the steam engines for a number of ships, including the paddle steamer William Fawcett, described as the first ship operated by what would become the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O;).  Early career  William Fawcett was born 26 December 1763 in Liverpool, England, into a Quaker family. He married a daughter of Joseph Rathbone, son of William Rathbone II and Mary Darby, sister of Abraham Darby II. Fawcett was an apprentice engineer at the Phoenix Foundry in Liverpool, which was owned by the Darbys of Coalbrookdale and managed by his father-in-law. Fawcett completed his apprenticeship in 1784, and Joseph Rathbone took him into the management of the foundry. When Rathbone died in 1790, he left £2,500 and five shares in the Iron Bridge on the River Severn to Fawcett. Fawcett leased the Phoenix Foundry (for a seven year term) in 1790, and bought it from the Darbys in 1794 for £2,300, naming the firm Fawcett and Company. After buying the Phoenix Foundry and organizing Fawcett and Company in 1794, Fawcett began producing armaments, in particular, naval guns. The production of arms helped the firm prosper during the Napoleonic Wars, but Fawcett's fellow Quakers denounced him for his production of weapons of war and he left the faith. Fawcett went bankrupt in 1810, and sold the foundry to George and Henry Littledale in 1813. Fawcett stayed on as manager, with the firm renamed Fawcett, Littledales, and Company. Fawcett bought back part of the firm by the early 1820s, and in 1823 the Littledales sold their majority interest in the firm to the Preston family. The firm then became Fawcett, Preston and Company.  Steam engines  Fawcett and Company began manufacturing steam engines in 1800. Fawcett, Littledales produced its first marine steam engine in 1817, which was installed in the Mersey ferry Etna. The firm exported stationary steam engines to sugar plantations in Louisiana in the early 1820s. In 1827, William Fawcett received a patent, together with Matthew Clark, for a device for producing sugar from cane juice using the steam from a steam engine's boiler. Fawcett, Preston exported marine steam engines to Canada and the United States. They supplied the engines for the Conde de Palmella, the first ocean-going steamer to leave Britain (traveling from London to Lisbon), for the Royal William, the first steam ship to travel from Liverpool to New York primarily under steam, and for the President, the largest steam ship at the time of her construction. Two paddle steamers were named for Fawcett. In 1828, Fawcett, in partnership with Joseph Robinson Pim, commissioned the construction of a paddle steamer named William Fawcett. The Fawcett, Preston firm provided the steam engine for the ship. The ship is often named as the first ship used by the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company, which later became the P&O.; In 1829, a smaller paddel-wheel steamer, also named William Fawcett, was built and provided with an engine from Fawcett, Preston. That ship served as a ferry between Birkenhead and Liverpool for 20 years. William Fawcett died in Liverpool on 28 December 1844, age 83. The Fawcett name remained on the firm and its successors through the 19th and 20th centuries.

Life  Born in Frankfurt Dönhoff descended from the East Prussian branch of the Dönhoff. His father was the diplomat and Prussian foreign minister August Heinrich Hermann von Dönhoff, his mother Pauline, née Countess von Lehndorff. Dönhoff grew up on the family castle Friedrichstein not far from Königsberg and attended the Kneiphof Gymnasium. After the Abitur he studied law at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn.

Like his father, Dönhoff also embarked on a diplomatic career and worked as secretary of legation for the Empire in Paris, Vienna, London, Saint Petersburg and Washington. In Washington he made friends with the Interior Minister Carl Schurz and accompanied him on an adventurous journey to the American West. Dönhoff laid down his diplomatic duties when, after his father's death in 1874, he took over his hereditary seat in the Prussian House of Lords.

It can occur anywhere in the distribution channel including theft of packages left on at a household. Distribution channel Packages, pallet loads, and full truck loads are subject to theft. this can take place anywhere from the shipper, carrier, or consignee. It can involve individuals with an opportunity to take a package or can involved organized crime. Security systems involving surveillance systems, tracking systems, and broader corporate security are needed to resist the theft of material. Estimates of cargo loss and theft range from two to thirty billion dollars a year. Some theft involves package pilferage where all or part of the contents are taken from the package. Sometimes a weight or object is placed into the pilfered package, the package is resealed, and then sent on its way through the remainder of the distribution system. Package tracking continues but the contents of the package could be gone. Theft of delivered packages from households So called Porch piracy is when a person takes a package that was not shipped to them before its recipient can pick it up from their porch or building. The problem is often underreported to the police, since major online retailers often return or refund items with no questions asked if the item is stolen. While the severity of the crime in the United States is usually only minor, as of 2019, many lawmakers have begun to push for punishments of increased severity due to the increase of such crimes. Porch piracy is unknown in countries where packages are never left unattended on a doorstep (e.g. in Germany).  Incidence of theft  The rate of package theft in the United States has been steadily increasing, with 90,000 packages disappearing daily in New York City alone in 2019, up 20 percent from four years prior. Across the country, more than 1.7 million packages are stolen or go missing daily, adding up to US$25 million in lost goods and services.  Methods of theft  In suburbs and rural areas, some thieves follow delivery trucks and grab packages immediately after they are dropped off. In Urban areas, packages are most often stolen from homes close to the roadway (within 25 feet), when a brand is displayed on the box, during daylight hours, and if the package is medium size and visible from the street.  Severity of crime  Package theft is often considered a minor crime that is not worthy of investigation by police. In New York City, such cases are considered petit larceny, unless the value is above $1000 USD, in which case they are considered grand larceny. In Texas, package theft is considered a Class C Misdemeanor, the same type as a speeding ticket. However, in 2019, lawmakers across the United States began to push for more serious punishments. Three bills in the Texas Legislature, including HB 37 and HB 760, and a bill called the Defense Against Porch Pirates Act in South Carolina, proposed that package theft be considered a felony. In the Texas bill, thieves could face up to 10 years in prison.  Package theft prevention  In buildings without doorbells, packages are often left in public areas that are easily accessed by thieves. The lack of an easy method to stop package theft has caused many to turn to neighbors to receive their packages for them. It has also led to increased income for businesses that offer mailbox services. The e-commerce company Amazon began offering delivery to car trunks, secure \\"Hub Lockers\\", or letting delivery people inside the home of the recipient with Amazon Key. It also began a program to share theft video from Ring doorbell cameras with police, but this led to controversy about privacy concerns. Traditional prevention methods such as videos, fences, and obvious signs someone is home, do not appear to deter package theft. Prevention methods include concealing packages (e.g., removing branding on boxes, placing packages out of view), removing the target (e.g., delivery to a POD, delivery in late afternoons), increasing the effort (e.g., lockable containers), and increasing the risk (e.g., neighborhood watch, package alarms).

Her father Mohammed Saleem began living in Italy circa 1996 and worked in a saucepan factory there. Hina worked as a server at a pizza parlour and had an Italian boyfriend, a carpenter, who she cohabitated with. Mohammed expressed disagreement with Hina's life choices after the family arrived in Italy, complaining about her Westernisation due to the Western boyfriend and her habit of smoking cigarettes, and he instead wanted her in an arranged marriage. Authorities stated that the family gave considerable pressure against Hina to get her to return to Pakistan for marriage. Peter Popham of The Independent wrote that in regards to Hina and her family, \\"Her relations with them had been strained for years.\\" While Saleem was of immigrant origins and resident in northern Italy, honour killings had been an issue with the native southern Italian population; the laws previously allowed for pardoning of crimes for honour reasons, but this was removed in 1981.; Crime Mohammad contacted her and asked her to come to the house in Brescia to meet a cousin visiting in the area. There Mohammad slit Hina's throat twenty-eight times. Hina's boyfriend reported her missing on Saturday 19 August 2006 and the Carabinieri searched the house, finding the body buried in the garden and blood in Hina's bedroom.; Aftermath Saleem was buried in the Muslim section of (a.k.a.

In 2016 Saleem's mother stated that she forgave her husband, and that the media articles inaccurately portrayed the family as being against western culture when this was not the case. On 11 August 2007, the Centro di salute internazionale e medicina transculturale (Centre of International and Intercultural Health) of Brescia, was dedicated to Hina.

It was recently discovered in Kamchatka, Russia at the Tolbachik volcano in 2012. It was named for Russian crystallographer Georgiy Viktorovich Wulff, he was a renowned expert who furthered X-ray diffraction and interference. Wullfite shares many similarities to Parawulffite which was found in the same area just with slightly different chemical composition. Occurrence Wulffite is a volcanic, or fumarolic, mineral which forms in or near volcanic activity. It has been recorded to associate with hematite, langbeinite, calciolangbeinite, arcanite, krasheninnikovite, lammerite, labberite-β, johillerite, bradaczekite, urusovite, fluoborite, gahnite, orthoclase, and fluorophlogopite. Wulffite has been found to reside about a meter down in between layers of basalt scoria and small 2-inch volcanic plutons, otherwise known as volcanic bombs, where most of the common chemicals are sulfates, arsenate, and oxides. Wulffite was found in abundance at the active monogenetic volcanic Arsenatnaya fumarole where the temperature ranged from 360-380ºC where Wulffite was found to mainly form, but with other nearby fumaroles reaching temperatures up to 430ºC. The fumarole also showed through analysis that atmospheric air interacts with the fumarole, enriching it in H2O, HF, HCl, SO2, CO2. The Tolbachik volcano in Russia at 55º41´N 160º14´E, at an elevation of 1200 meters, is so far the only place to have Wulffite occurring. Physical properties Wulffite is an exhalation mineral with its clear crystals being brittle with a Mohs hardness of just 2½. They form individually or in coarse clusters and crusts of elongated prismatic crystals reaching a maximum size of 2 mm long and 1.2 mm thick with groups of clusters stretching 1 cm across. Wulffite has two directions of perfect cleavage parallel to the positive elongation and another on the (010) direction. It also tends to fracture in a steeped pattern. The crystal colors take on being a dark emerald green to a bluish tinted green, dark green being the most common. The mineral has also shown strong optical phenomenon of pleochroism that absorbs light and changes the color from emerald green to pale green (Z dark emerald green > Y green > X pale green). All of the physical properties of Wulffite can be contributed to the highly volcanic environment in which they formed and the amount of elements available for it to form at all. Chemical and optical properties Wulffite is specific sulfate labeled under alkali copper sulfates with its empirical formula calculated from 18 Oxygen to be Nal.08(K2.85Rb0.08Cs0.04)Σ2.97(Cu3.99Zn0.02)Σ4.01S3.99O18. Wulffite has also been shown to dissolve in water showing that its bonds are weak enough to dissolve in room temperature water. Many forms of X-ray analysis were performed such as X-ray Powder Diffraction, Single Crystal Diffraction and Jeol JSM-6480LV a scanning electron microscope to find the chemical composition and crystal structure to compile the data of the new mineral. The analysis showed that Wulffite has an orthorhombic crystal system structure with a basic unit of a heteropolyhedral quasi-framework formed from Cu-O-S chains. Chemical composition {  - ! Oxide !! wt% !! Range -  Na2O  4.11  3.76-4.29 -  K2O  16.46  15.82-17.22 -  Rb2O  0.95  0.64-1.16 -  Cs2O  0.65  0.00-1.05 -  CuO  38.88  37.96-40.02 -  ZnO  0.15  0.00-0.39 -  SO3  39.11  38.64-40.15 -  Total  100.31  98.63-100.31 } X-ray crystallography From Chemical and Optical properties, the tests also showed how the chains run along the [010] with a center of Copper pyramids and SO4 tetrahedra. Wulffite can also be distinguished from the similar Parawulffite by its difference in Cu-O-S chain structures, since Wulffite is mainly centered around the SO4 tetrahedra and with the chains being interconnected instead of distorted. Wulffite was also discovered to be lacking in common bands of BO3, CO3, NO3, and hydrogen groups. With the distinctive chemical banding missing and the specific environment in which they form, making Wulffite a good index mineral.

Developed by ITT Gilfillan in Van Nuys, California, the radar was the primary sensor for the Marine Corps' Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC) and was optimized to work in concert with the MIM-23 Hawk Missile System and the Marine Tactical Data System. Development Development of the AN/TPS-32 began with the United States Navy's Bureau of Ships in the 1950s. It was meant to be a next generation, mobile radar capable of supporting Marine Corps forces during amphibious operations. The TPS-32 was a major improvement in radar technology for the Marine Corps. It was the service's first three dimensional radar providing range, azimuth and altitude from one array thus precluding the need for a Height-finder radar. Unlike the old mechanically scanned arrays that utilized analog technology, the TPS-32 was 90% digital, solid-state electronics possessing a phased Antenna array. Also new for the design of this radar was the use of three Crossed-field amplifiers as the microwave amplifiers in the very-high-power transmitter. They replaced the Cavity magnetrons utilized on earlier radar sets. The AN/TPS-32 was delivered to Marine Air Control Squadron 3 (MACS-3) in 1969 for final operational testing. MACS-3 was re-designated as the Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA) in 1970 and continued testing. The radar entered service in the Fleet Marine Force in 1972. In the 1980s, the Marine Corps began to seek a replacement for both the AN/TPS-32 and MTDS. Development continued throughout the 1980s at Marine Air Control Squadron 1 (MACS-1). Following the Gulf War, the TPS-32 was replaced in the Marine Corps inventory by the AN/TPS-59.

Since the induction of Myanmar as a member of the institution, they have made six arrangements with the IMF with its most recent arrangement made in 1981. As of 2019, they are currently led by Kyaw Kyaw Maung and Alternate U Soe Thein; their Special Drawing Rights (SDR) is at 0.79 million and quota consists of $516.8 million SDR which is 0.11% of the total IMF funds available. As of 2019, the country is under one of the twenty-four Executive Boards that facilitates the day-to-day operations of the IMF, led by Alisara Mahasandana and Alternate Keng Heng Tan; their co-board members consist of Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Republic of Fiji, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Tonga, and Vietnam. The Executive Board accumulates around 218,545 total votes which account for 4.34% of the Fund's total, Myanmar allocates 6,633 of the votes (0.13% of the total votes in the IMF).  Overview of Myanmar's Economy  Myanmar is a low-middle income economy that has seen significant improvements towards poverty reduction in the recent decades. Religious conflicts and natural disasters are rendered as political and geographical dangers towards the Myanmarese economy. According to the IMF, Myanmar's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is at an estimated $355.609 billion with an estimated GDP per capita of $6,707.167 and an estimated inflation rate of 7.841%. Their projected real GDP changes at the rate of 6.2%. As of 2017, Myanmar has exported roughly $15 billion and imported $21.2 billion, leaving a negative trade balance of $6.14 billion. Their leading exports are petroleum gas while their significant imports are refined petroleum.  IMF Arrangements   International Monetary Fund (IMF)  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a multilateral agency that ensures the stabilization of the international economy through economic surveillance, provide short-term loans whilst trying to correct inherent economic issues, and assist in modernizing economies to the 189 countries they are accountable for. The organization focuses their attention towards issues regarding balance of payments and economic crises that pose international consequences.  Involvement with Myanmar  Myanmar has had six arrangements with then Fund ever since its induction into the organization on January 3, 1952. Transactions were made with the IMF between 1984 and 1991, in which the outstanding credit has been consistently paid back; signifying that the IMF has considered the conditions of the state to refrain from imposing struggle. In 1995, Myanmar's external debt consisted mostly of bilateral debt with the remainder being private; the country was strongly advised to utilize Fund programs to alleviate debt. Myanmar has joined the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization with China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Brunei, and Laos. It was a measure in response to the crisis of having insufficient foreign reserves to fulfill their short-term foreign currency obligations, with the intention to develop self-help mechanisms for East Asian countries to prevent the over-reliance on the IMF.  IMF Consultation Post-Ratification of the 2008 Constitution  An oppressive collective of military leaders, military junta, took over the governing body of Myanmar from 1962 until 2011 and were often noted for its human rights violations. The ratification of the 2008 Constitution of Myanmar, was a long-awaited response from the military junta after their refusal to recognize the results of the 1990 General Elections and the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi. Under the new constitution, it is stated that the country is to practice a multi-party democratic system and a market economy system. The development of a citizen- led democracy has brought economic reforms reintroducing Myanmar to the global economy and incentivizing international investors. The IMF acknowledged the fragility of the Myanmar government, aiding in the creation of reforms in taxation for medium-term solutions in the gradual strengthening of institutions through the concentration of large taxpayers. The IMF has also indicated that both constituents and political leaders have recognized the legitimacy of these reformations, but lack the modernization and risk management to face further economic challenges. Myanmar's 2018 Article IV consultation indicated the country's projected improvements to stagnate. Their banking sector has undergone restructuring, uncovering many fragile aspects of the banks; their four state-owned banks strengthened state sectors and large firms, allowing for private sector firms to procure a large market share of banking deposits (64%) and banking loans (82%). Inflated real estate values have also collateralized with lax lending standards intensifying risks created through a credit boom. The IMF's consultation concluded that the banking sectors absence towards recapitalization has exposed fragility in the sector through large-scale financial spillovers. Displaced Rohingya Muslims  Rakhine State  The Rohingya people are an ethnic group established in the Rakhine State of Myanmar, their initial attempts for freedoms were largely defeated. Under the military junta, their political and civil rights slowly diminished and were often met with religious violence; ultimately rendering them stateless and forcing pilgrimage to Malaysia or Bangladesh. Local government has limited or restrained human rights investigators and humanitarian access, and constrained efforts through intensifying security tensions throughout the Rakhine area. The United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, has labelled the acts upon the Rohingya people \\"a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\\" The IMF's consensus throughout the consultation held the humanitarian issues within the Rohingya conflict as a significant factor contributing to the stagnating growth of Myanmar's economic reforms. International actors have concentrated on the issue as a determining factor towards contributing to Myanmar's IMF financing and transition towards large-scale financial projects, although the IMF has viewed the country's progress in the conflict to have decreased significantly.

The organization was established by a group of women lawyers, with support from the New Israel Fund and Shatil, to give voice to women subject to social, geographic, national, ethnic and economic discrimination in Israeli society and inception of \\"groundbreaking feminist projects\\".  Overview  Among the Association's activities are legal aid and representation to women in various areas of the law, including housing and employment; work to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1325; advocacy and lobbying on behalf of women at the governmental levels of the Knesset, High Court of Justice, government ministries, and municipalities; creation of new models for local government to implement gender mainstreaming, and any other issue in the public or private sphere involved with promoting justice and equality. As part of this goal, Itach Ma’aki emphasizes creation of multicultural gender discourse within diverse Israeli communities most subject to marginalization, including Palestinian, Haredi, Ethiopian-Israeli, and Russian-speaking communities. The Association has branches in Tel Aviv, Beer Sheva and Haifa. Board members include legal scholars Netta Ziv (Hebrew), Daphna Hacker and Yofi Tirosh (Hebrew), attorneys Nasrin Aalimi Kabha and Rachel Benziman, journalist Anat Saragusti, political scholar Henriette Dahan Caleb. Major contributors include the New Israel Fund, which also transfers tax-free contributions from the United States, the Hadassa Women's Foundation, the Dafna Foundation, and the Levi Lausen Foundation. Itach Ma'aki belongs to various coalitions and forums aligned with its ideology and purposes, including Women, Peace and Security - Resolution 1325, Forum of women's organisations and Forums for Young Women's NGO's.  Activities   Legal advocacy  Itach Ma’aki acts in the areas of public housing, social security, collections, and other rights of women in low-wage employment, as well as issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence in the workplace. The Association provides legal advice, and represents women in legal cases, while also working to create policy change for various legal issues. A hotline is available for women to call regarding any legal issue they face. In the public advocacy sphere, Itach Ma'aki joined a group of Israeli organizations in 2009, which approached the Attorney General to examine whether the IDF violated international law during the 2008-2009 Gaza War. Following the establishment of the Turkel Commission to investigate the 2010 flotilla to Gaza, Itach Ma'aki petitioned the High Court of Justice against the Government of Israel and the Turkel Commission due to the absence of women on the Government appointed Public Commission (HCJ 5660/10 Itach-Ma'aki v Prime Minister). The petition argued that the absence of women on the Commission dealing with such an important issue contravenes International Law and Section 6c1 of Israel's Women's Equal Rights Law; therefore, the High Court of Justice is required to intervene. The High Court ordered the Government to appoint a woman to the Commission, and the Court's ruling on this matter constitutes, still to date, one of the legal foundations for appropriate representation of women. The Association also asked to be allowed to submit to the committee a report from a gender perspective, so that the probe would include \\"the perspective of women peace activists, who are seeking to protest nonviolently, as well as the reality of women in Gaza, who are living under siege.\\"  Center for Bedouin Women Rights  The center works to promote and ensure the rights of Bedouin women. It was established in Beer Sheva in 2006, when the many calls to the Association from this highly marginalized group made clear the urgent need for assistance. One of the main areas the center assists with is with Social Security rights, especially income guarantee stipends for single mothers and women in polygamous marriages. In addition, the center works on behalf of Bedouin women's rights through petitions to the High Court of Justice, attending Knesset conferences, and publishing reports and position papers in collaboration with other organizations in the Negev. In 2013, Itach Ma'aki published a groundbreaking report, which, for the first time, provides statistics on the extent of domestic violence against Bedouin women in the Negev. According to the report, 86% of the Bedouin women surveyed had suffered violence of some form. Among other findings, the report exposes how the lack of enforcement of the criminal prohibition on polygamy is one of the factors that increases violence.  School Teaching Assistants’ Rights  Itach Ma'aki represents the teaching assistants in their struggle for achieving comparable conditions and recognition within the education system. As part of this collaboration, begun in 2011, the National Alliance of Teaching Assistants (NATA) was established. NATA raises awareness of the struggle through conferences, media reports, position papers, and Knesset education committee discussions. NATA enlists the support and involvement of Knesset members from the entire political spectrum, as well as parents' organizations, in order to increase teaching assistant salaries, end summer dismissal of special-needs and medical-needs teaching assistants, add a second assistant in kindergartens, and create a dialogue with senior officials in the Ministry of Education and the Center for Local Government. In 2011, the Association filed lawsuits on behalf of women working in non-officially recognized kindergartens within the Ultra-Orthodox community for equal employment terms as those of women working in official State recognized kindergartens. The Regional Labor Court ruled that equal terms of employment are mandatory. The significance of the ruling is that it compensated the women for the terms of their employment up until the date of the ruling and provided an opening for additional teaching assistants to demand comparable conditions.  City for All  The Association's City for All project is inspired by the model women's network established in Rishon LeZion, which aims to advance the status of women and promote gender equality locally. Through duplication and development of the model, the Association hopes to develop gender mainstreaming that will actually integrate women into decision-making processes in local authorities. As of 2019, he model is being implemented in the cities of Acre, Tayibe, and Haifa.  Women, Peace and Security – Resolution 1325  UN Security Council Resolution 1325 of October 31, 2000, promotes diverse representation of women in decision-making positions, protection of women from violence, implementation of gender analysis and gender mainstreaming, and the prevention of conflict. This decision was adopted by the State of Israel and enshrined in the Women's Equality Law of 2005. Despite the adoption of the law, has not been practically implemented. Therefore, since 2007, the Association has been acting through petitions to the High Court of Justice, the establishment of conferences and seminars, and participation in committees in the Knesset, in order to implement and advance the resolution's commitments. Inspired by many countries worldwide that have advocated comprehensive action plans to implement these principles, the Association, together with dozens of women's organizations, drafted a comprehensive plan of action. Two years later, the plan was launched at a convention and was presented to the Government, Knesset members and ambassadors from all over the world. In December 2014, following intensive efforts to advance the overall plan of action, the Israeli Government decided that the State will formulate a Governmental Action Plan. According to the Government's decision, the future plan will be based on global examples and the comprehensive plan of action drafted by the civil society.  “Choice” Activism Center for Jewish and Arab Women in Haifa  In 2015, the Association’s Haifa branch created “Choice” – the center of rights and activities on the ground for Arab and Jewish women. The purpose of the Center is to develop and strengthen activism among groups of Arab and Jewish women in the North, to raise awareness of socioeconomic rights, to protect women from violence, and to improve enforcement of their rights. The Center, staffed by lawyers and psychologists, runs a number of projects designed to achieve these goals. Center activities are based on extensive cooperation between civil society organizations in the North and various municipal authorities.  Nothing About Us – Without Us: Young Activists  Itach Ma'aki supports a national group of young women activists from various backgrounds who act to change policy on issues facing marginalized youth who lack support systems and services once they turn 18. The Association belongs to a collaborative group with the Women’s Courtyard and the Forum of Young Women’s NGOs. The group’s goal is to engender critical thinking for getting the issue onto the public agenda and changing the prevailing situation in which policy regarding young women is shaped without their participation and without their knowledge.  2030 Agenda – Global Sustainable Development Goals  Together with the Heschel Center for Sustainability, Civic Leadership, and the Heinrich Bőll Foundation, Itach Ma'aki is working to promote the 2030 Agenda in Israel. Activities include the November 2018 milestone conference, attended by 120 civil society delegates and the issuing of the July 2019 Government Report, drafted by an inter-ministerial task force appointed by the Prime Minister, and which will be submitted to the United Nations.  Safety at Work for Women project  Deals with health and safety hazards that cleaning women and caregivers for the elderly are exposed to in their work, specifically the use of hazardous substances. This project involves a number of stages: mapping of needs, reviewing the existing situation and building a database, forming groups to empower women and train them for on-the-ground activities, and raising awareness among cleaning women and caregivers for the elderly.  Sexual Violence in the Health System project  This project arose as a result of women’s experiences in the institutional health system in Israel and of participants in the Legal Feminism Clinic run by Itach Ma'aki, recognizing the inherent difficulties and the complex balance of power present in the doctor-patient relationship. Through the Legal Feminism Clinic, the Association published a groundbreaking position paper on this subject. The project's goal is to raise awareness among patients and the public, and promote public policy to create an effective response system in the healthcare system to deal with complaints and provide treatment for women who experience sexual harm and abuse by caregivers.  Additional legal achievements  * The National Labor Court upheld Itach Ma'aki's appeal and ruled that the shared household of a woman in a polygamous relationship will be assessed individually, when examining her eligibility for income support benefits In the 2016 the Association filed an appeal against the regional Labor Courts decision in Abu Jaber v. The National Insurance Institute, which rejected the right of a woman living in a polygamous and violent marriage to receive income support. The National Labor Court, which heard the appeal, ruled that the reality of life in a polygamous and violent marriage, where one is under the constant threat of having to relinquish parental rights, should not be seen the same way as the shared life of a nuclear family model couple living together, and therefore, the appellant was entitled to separate income support benefits. * Revocation of rule denying income support stipends for women with cars The National Insurance Institute prohibited single mothers from receiving basic income support benefits if they owned a car or had regular use of one. In one of several successful appeals on this issue, in the 2005 case TSJ 3282/05 Meirav Ben-Nun v National Insurance Institute, Itach Ma'aki filed a petition to the High Court of Justice on behalf of five single mothers against the National Insurance Institute policy and the Income Support Law. Following numerous hearings, in 2012, in an acclaimed final ruling by Supreme Court President, Justice Beinish, the High Court of Justice ruled that the law should be revoked because it restricted the right to minimum dignity of those living in poverty in Israel and that women who are eligible for income support should be permitted to own/use a car. * Cancellation of the employment test exemption for single mothers of children above the age of two In January 2003 Itach Ma'aki filed a High Court of Justice petition (HCJ 1433/03 Svetlana Bajtin v Minister of Finances et al) against the Economic Policy Law, which cancelled the exemption from the employment test for eligibility of single mothers of children above the age of two to receive income support. Under the contested section of the law, in order to receive an income assurance stipend, single mothers of children above the age of two were required, in addition to the income test, to report to the Employment Bureau and to accept any work offered. After the Employment Bureau amended its procedure for the employment of mothers of minor children according to the court's decision, in 2008 a binding ruling was handed down, stipulating that if a single parent has objective difficulty in finding reasonable supervision arrangements for the children, the term \\"appropriate work\\" is to be determined in view of this difficulty. * Supreme Court ruling to remove a discriminatory clause against women from the Agudat Yisrael platform Following a prolonged struggle on behalf of the rights of women to be members of the ultra-Orthodox political parties, in January 2019 the High Court of Justice, in case HCJ 1823/15 Tamar Ben-Porat v Registrar of Political Parties, ordered the ultra-Orthodox party, Agudat Yisrael, to remove the discriminatory clause in its platform that bans women from being members of the party. Itach Ma'aki, together with Prof. Neta Ziv, represented 10 women's organizations that joined the petition filed by attorney Ben Porat. The petition includes a plea that the court stipulate that once the change in the platform has been made, the discrimination and ban on women joining the party must also be lifted in practice. This decision may directly affect all discriminatory policies of political parties in Israel. * Creation of a unique model for promoting feminist leadership and legal discourse through the Clinic for Legal Feminism at the University of Haifa The Women Mentoring Women Program at the Clinic for Legal Feminism was launched in 2005 as a joint initiative of Itach Ma'aki and the Faculty of Law at the University of Haifa. As part of the program, women and men from diverse communities (ethnic, national, sexual, geographic, etc.), learned legal topics relating to broad women's issues to become \\"mentors of rights\\" for the rights of women in their communities, with the participation of students of the Haifa University Faculty of Law. After training, the participants worked in the field together with the Association as agents of social change. The program closed in 2015.

A bureaucrat, revenue farmer (pachter) and businessman, he headed the influential Be family of Bagelen, part of the ‘Cabang Atas’ gentry of the Indies. Life and career Born in Central Java, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), Be was the eldest son of a ‘totok’ or first-generation Chinese migrant, the self-made tycoon and, later, bureaucrat Be Ing Tjioe, Majoor-titulair der Chinezen (1803–1857) by his ‘Peranakan’ wife, Tjoa Tjoe Nio. Be Biauw Tjoan had two younger brothers, Be Ik Sam and Be Soe Ie. The Be family of Bagelen rose up economically and socially through its intimate association with the more established Tan family of Semarang, one of Java’s most powerful Cabang Atas families. Kebon Dalem, the Semarang residence of Majoor Be Biauw Tjoan, 1870 Javanese orchestra of Majoor Be Biauw Tjoan, 1857-1872 As part of this strategic alliance, Be Biauw Tjoan and his brother, Be Ik Sam, were betrothed and married off to the daughters of Tan Hong Yan, the 2nd Majoor der Chinezen of Semarang: Tan Ndjiang Nio and Tan Bien Nio respectively. Be Biauw Tjoan, aged only 21, was raised to the bureaucratic post of Luitenant der Chinezen in Semarang in 1846, serving under his father-in-law. He was raised to the honorary rank of Kapitein-titulair der Chinezen in 1854, and that of Majoor-titulair in 1862. The Chinese officership, consisting of the ranks of Majoor, Kapitein and Luitenant der Chinezen, was an arm of the colonial civil bureaucracy through which the Dutch governed their Chinese subjects in the Indies. This system was known as 'indirect rule'. Be’s involvement in Semarang’s Chinese bureaucracy was, probably, minimal – at least, later on – given his active career as a revenue farmer and businessman. According to the historian James R. Rush, Be stood at the heart of the Tan-Be Kongsi, or business partnership, that dominated Java’s opium farm leases, the colony’s most lucrative revenue farms, from the 1860s until the 1880s. The Majoor-titulair also had interests in other revenue farms, rice, sugar, plantations, shipping, warehousing and property all the way to Singapore, where he allegedly maintained a secret stake in the British colony’s opium farm. In the 1860s, Christian Castens, the Resident of Bagelen gathered evidence of Be’s involvement in large-scale opium smuggling and distribution, not only to supplement the Kongsi’s official allotment, but also to undermine neighboring opium farms. In 1863 – in a massive blow to the Be- Tan partnership – Ludolph Anne Jan Witt, Baron Sloet van de Beele, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, stripped Be of his titular Chinese mayoralty, and imposed a hefty fine on him and his partners for their illegal opium dealings. They were also forbidden thenceforth from participating in any of the opium farms. Through a lengthy appeal to the colonial supreme court, Be was cleared of all charges in 1872, and was restored to his former position. In 1876, though his competitor submitted a formal complaint to the lower house of the Dutch parliament against Be’s supposed undermining of his opium farm, nothing was ever conclusively proven against him. The Majoor-titulair remained legally beyond reach, and retained his pre-eminence in the bureaucratic hierarchy and in business until the end of his life. In March 1895, Be hosted King Chulalongkorn of Siam at his family residence, Kebon Dalem, in Semarang. The Thai monarch made his host a Knight of the Order of the While Elephant, which enhanced Be’s prominence in Java. The Be family’s friendship with the Thai monarchy would continue into the mid-twentieth century. Personal life Majoor-titulair Be Biauw Tjoan and his wife, Tan Djiang Nio, only had one daughter, Be Tiong Khing. Their son-in-law, Liem Liong Hien, would later serve in a substantive capacity as Majoor der Chinezen of Semarang. The Majoor- titulair and his wife also adopted four of their nephews. Through a concubine, Be also had a son, Kapitein Be Kwat Kong. Majoor-titulair Be Biauw Tjoan died in 1904. In 1914, his family founded Be Biauw Tjoan Bank, named after the deceased paterfamilias, which became one of the most important commercial banks in the colony for the next decade until its liquidation in 1927 due to the sugar crisis. Nonetheless, the Be family of Bagelen would remain one of the premier families of the Cabang Atas until the Indonesian revolution of 1945.

At the thalamic pulvinar nucleus, visual information is routed either to the medial pulvinar, which sends connections to cingulate, posterior parietal, premotor and prefrontal cortical areas; or to the lateral pulvinar, which sends connections to the temporal lobe dorsal stream cortical areas (and in particular, to region MT – a critical region for motion perception)Pulvinar nuclei. (n.d.). In Wikipedia. Retrieved November 20, 2019, from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulvinar_nuclei.. Damage to the tectopulvinar pathway is most commonly characterized by visual ataxia, a deficit characterized by an inability to perform visually guided hand movements in reaching and grasping objectsSwearer J. (2011) Optic Ataxia. In: Kreutzer J.S., DeLuca J., Caplan B. (eds) Encyclopedia of Clinical Neuropsychology. Springer, New York, NY, as well as by spatial attentional deficits. Function The tectopulvinar pathway is a fast-acting pathway that provides the viewer with information on the absolute spatial information of objects. The pathway plays a large role in directing visual spatial attention and is particularly responsive to novel stimuli that appear or move in peripheral vision; however, because it receives mostly magnocellular visual input, the tectopulvinar pathway is not sensitive to fine detail. It directs visual spatial attention most notably through guided eye movements, via cranial nerves III ( the oculomotor nerve), IV ( the trochlear nerve), and VI (the abducens nerve). Directing visual spatial attention and eye movements to salient peripheral stimuli is necessary to bring likely important visual information to center vision. Furthermore, the tectopulvinar pathway has been suggested to support residual visual perceptual abilities in blindsight patientsLeh, S. E., Johansen-Berg, H., & Ptito, A. (2006). Unconscious vision: new insights into the neuronal correlate of blindsight using diffusion tractography. Brain, 129(7), 1822–1832. doi: 10.1093/brain/awl111. Superior Colliculus Within the pathway, the superior colliculus functions to orient the viewer’s gaze and attention via eye and head movements towards objects of interest in egocentric space. The superior colliculus’s role in directing eye movements is especially well-studied: multiple lines of evidence show that artificially blocking and increasing superior colliculus activity modulates (inhibits and biases, respectively) eye saccades to the affected sideMcpeek, R. M., & Keller, E. L. (2010). Deficits in saccade target selection after temporary inactivation of superior colliculus. Journal of Vision, 2(7), 573–573. doi: 10.1167/2.7.573. Recent evidence has argued that superior colliculus function is not limited to basic motor and low-level visual control, but more generally in target selection and in both covert and overt attentional controlKrauzlis, R. J., Lovejoy, L. P., & Zénon, A. (2013). Superior Colliculus and Visual Spatial Attention. Annual Review of Neuroscience, 36(1), 165–182. doi: 10.1146/annurev-neuro-062012-170249. Further studies contend that superior colliculus function encompasses a wide range of behavioral responses such as in arm-reaching, and not just in eye and head movementsSong, J.-H., & Mcpeek, R. M. (2015). Neural correlates of target selection for reaching movements in superior colliculus. Journal of Neurophysiology, 113(5), 1414–1422. doi: 10.1152/jn.00417.2014. The superior colliculus is also a center for multisensory auditory and visual integration. Recent studies have shown that the superior colliculus responds especially strongly when auditory input arrives temporally and synchronously with visual input. Superior colliculus activity was measured to be greater in these multisensory events than in single modality eventsGhose, D., Maier, A., Nidiffer, A., & Wallace, M. T. (2014). Multisensory Response Modulation in the Superficial Layers of the Superior Colliculus. Journal of Neuroscience, 34(12), 4332–4344. doi: 10.1523/jneurosci.3004-13.2014 Pulvinar Nucleus Further along the pathway, the pulvinar nucleus performs similar tasks to the superior colliculus in directing visual spatial attention. Pulvinar lesions often create visuomotor deficits and neglect-like attentional deficits. Lastly, the pulvinar nucleus has been implicated in guiding attention for behavioral responses: greater neuronal activity was recorded for stimuli that serve as targets or cues for active behavior than for stimuli that are not associated with active behaviorPetersen, S. E., Robinson, D. L., & Morris, J. (1987). Contributions of the pulvinar to visual spatial attention. Neuropsychologia, 25(1), 97–105. doi: 10.1016/0028-3932(87)90046-7.

Early life Catherine Mary Brennan was born 20 November 1876, the daughter of Francis Brennan, auctioneer, and his wife, Elizabeth Anne Butler, while they lived in 11 South Richmond Street, Dublin. They added the \\"O'\\" to their name to show the family nationalism. Her sister Áine O'Brennan married Éamonn Ceannt and her younger sister Lily O'Brennan was a writer and playwright. Her father died in 1880, her mother in 1930. O'Brennan was a journalist and playwright. She was appointed Dublin correspondent to the London Times and went on to submit work regularly to the Irish Times and the Irish Tatler. American life While Lily and Áine were involved directly in the Easter Rising in 1916, O'Brennan was in the United States. She didn't let her absence from Dublin prevent her from working hard to ensure the success of Ireland's bid for independence. According to research by historian Catherine M. Burns, O'Brennan arrived in America in October 1914 and stayed there for longer than expected due to the difficulty of trans-Atlantic travel during the First World War. Working as a journalist and lecturer, O'Brennan traveled to California and Oregon and took the opportunity to present herself to women's organisations as an authority on the Gaelic league and Irish art and culture. Her lectures included details she got from her sisters and photos of Éamonn Ceannt and his son. While on the West Coast, O'Brennan's ties to the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) also brought her to the attention of the US authorities who tracked her movements and associations. She became involved in the IWW through Dr. Marie Equi, with whom she had a romantic relationship. When Equi was arrested, O'Brennan worked to see her released and continued to agitate until her own arrest in 1919. The U.S. government issued a deportation order for O'Brennan, but it was not enforced. During this period, O'Brennan also founded the Women’s Irish Education League in San Francisco in May 1919. Before her return to Ireland, O'Brennan moved to the East Coast in 1920. As Burns finds, after an \\"American women\\" picketing venture demanding U.S. recognition of the Irish Republic, organised by William J. Maloney in Washington, D.C. in April 1920, O'Brennan, Gertrude Kelly and Gertrude Corless founded the American Women Pickets for the Enforcement of America’s War Aims in New York City. Burns argues that the organisation used American identity as a deliberate tool to shield O'Brennan's identity and to mask the radicalism of their cause by tying support for the Irish Republic to historical memory of the American Revolution. According to Burns, during the April 1920 picketing O'Brennan first took advantage of her position as the pickets' press connection to ensure that names other than her own, such as Kathleen Glennon, Maurya O'Brannon and Kathleen Butler, appeared in press reports about the pickets. This allowed her to hide her identity in the face of the deportation order that might be enforced were she to be seen as associated with militant women's activism for the Irish Republic. Burns maintains that after picket Helen Golden challenged their leadership by publicly designating the women pickets loyal to O'Brennan, Kelly, and Corless as Irish, rather than American, O'Brennan and Kelly then formed an American auxiliary to the Irish White Cross. Fearful that the Irish republican movement in the United States might be perceived as Irish-run, radical, and un-American, Harry Boland opposed their efforts. He and de Valera attacked O'Brennan by deeming her and Kelly as too un-American to work for the benefit of the still unrecognized Irish Republic in the United States. The women also refused to take orders from de Valera, sealing their fate. O'Brennan departed to Canada on a lecture tour in July 1921 and by June 1922 was living back in Dublin. During the Irish Civil War, de Valera used O'Brennan's socialist reputation to approach soviet foreign minister Georgy Chicherin while in Switzerland. The contact was hoped to provide finance and munitions but was unsuccessful. Later life O'Brennan wrote 'Full Measure' which premiered in the Abbey Theatre in 1928. O'Brennan was secretary to the Irish PEN. Her personal papers are currently held in the National Library of Ireland along with those of Éamonn Ceannt, of his wife Áine and of her sister Lily. She is buried in Deansgrange Cemetery with her sister Lily.

Chase presiding. The Constitution of the United States gives Congress the authority to remove the president of the United States from office in two separate proceedings. The first one takes place in the House of Representatives which impeaches the president by approving articles of impeachment through a simple majority vote. The second proceeding, the impeachment trial, takes place in the Senate. There, conviction on any of the articles requires a two-thirds majority vote and results in the removal from office. Three United States presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Donald Trump in 2019. Procedure A postage stamp depicting the signing of the United States Constitution. Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution provides: Article I, Section 3, Clauses 6 and 7 provide: Article II, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution limits the grounds of impeaching a president to \\"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\\". Because the precise meaning of the phrase \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\" is not defined in the Constitution itself, it is left open to the interpretation of Congress, especially since the U.S. Supreme Court decided in Nixon v. United States that it did not have the authority to determine whether the Senate properly \\"tried\\" a defendant. Congress has, however, identified three general types of conduct that constitute grounds for impeachment, although these categories should not be understood as exhaustive: #Improperly exceeding or abusing the powers of the office. #Behavior incompatible with the function and purpose of the office. #Misusing the office for an improper purpose or for personal gain. Other than the above constitutional provisions, the exact details of the presidential impeachment process are left up to Congress. Thus, a number of rules have been adopted by the House and Senate and are honored by tradition. Among them, The House Practice: A Guide to the Rules, Precedents and Procedures of the House, prepared by the House Parliamentarian, is a reference source for information on the rules and selected precedents governing the House procedure. Each Congress adopts its own rules. In 1974, as part of the preliminary investigation in the Nixon impeachment inquiry, the staff of the Impeachment Inquiry of the House Judiciary Committee prepared a report, Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment.Staff of the Impeachment Inquiry, Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment, 93rd Conf. 2nd Sess. (Feb. 1974), 1974 Impeachment Inquiry Report This 1974 report has been expanded and revised on several occasions by the Congressional Research Service, now known as Impeachment and Removal. The Senate has formal Rules and Procedures of Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials. Nevertheless, both the House and the Senate are free to modify the procedures for each presidential impeachment and trial, respectively. An impeachment proceeding formally begins with a resolution adopted by the full House of Representatives, which typically includes a referral to a House committee to proceed with an impeachment inquiry. The House Judiciary Committee then determines whether grounds for impeachment exist. If the committee finds grounds for impeachment, it will set forth specific allegations of misconduct in one or more articles of impeachment. These articles of impeachment are then reported to the full House with the committee's recommendations. The House then debates on the article of impeachments, either individually or the full resolution. A simple majority of those present and voting is required for each article for the resolution as a whole to pass. Upon passage, the president has been impeached. The House then selects \\"House managers\\" to present the case to the Senate, in a role analogous to the prosecution or district attorney in a standard criminal trial. Finally, the House adopts a resolution to notify formally and present the passed articles of impeachment to the Senate. The proceedings in the Senate unfold similar to a jury trial, with the chief justice presiding and Senate members acting as the jury. The House managers present their case and the president has the right to mount a defense with their own attorneys. After hearing the charges, the Senate usually deliberates in private before voting whether to convict. A two-thirds super-majority vote is required to remove the president from office. A two-thirds super-majority vote of conviction only removes the president from office. Following a conviction, the Senate may also vote by a simple majority to punish the individual further by barring them from holding future federal office, elected or appointed. Thus, if the Senate has the required two-thirds super-majority vote to remove a president from office during their first term, it would have to hold a second vote to ban them completely from running for reelection. Once removed, convicted individuals would still be subject to criminal prosecutions in an actual court of law for the same factual situations. Presidents who were impeached Summary Three presidents have been impeached in U.S. history: Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Donald Trump in 2019. None were convicted.

President Andrew Johnson held open disagreements with Congress, who tried to remove him several times. The Tenure of Office Act was enacted over Johnson's veto to curb his power and he openly violated it in early 1868. The House of Representatives adopted 11 articles of impeachment against Johnson. The articles charged Johnson with: # Dismissing Secretary of War Edwin Stanton from office after the Senate had voted not to concur with his dismissal and had ordered him reinstated. # Appointing Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas as secretary of war ad interim despite the lack of vacancy in the office, since the dismissal of Stanton had been invalid. # Appointing Thomas without the required advice and consent of the Senate. # Conspiring, with Thomas and \\"other persons to the House of Representatives unknown,\\" to unlawfully prevent Stanton from continuing in office. # Conspiring to unlawfully curtail faithful execution of the Tenure of Office Act. # Conspiring to \\"seize, take, and possess the property of the United States in the Department of War.\\" # Conspiring to \\"seize, take, and possess the property of the United States in the Department of War\\" with specific intent to violate the Tenure of Office Act. # Issuing to Thomas the authority of the office of secretary of war with unlawful intent to \\"control the disbursements of the moneys appropriated for the military service and for the Department of War.\\" # Issuing to Major General William H. Emory orders with unlawful intent to violate federal law requiring all military orders to be issued through the General of the Army. # Making three speeches with intent to \\"attempt to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach, the Congress of the United States.\\" # Unlawfully, and unconstitutionally, challenged the authority of the 39th Congress to legislate, because Southern states had not been readmitted to the Union. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase presided over Johnson's Senate trial. Conviction failed by one vote in May 1868. The impeachment trial remained a unique event for 130 years. Bill Clinton (impeached Dec. 1998, acquitted Feb. 1999) Two articles of impeachment were approved by the House, charging President Bill Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice. The charges stemmed from a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by Arkansas state employee Paula Jones and from Clinton's testimony denying that he had engaged in a sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. They were: Article I, charging Clinton with perjury, alleged in part that: Article II, charging Clinton with obstruction of justice alleged in part that: Tickets dated January 14 and 15, 1999, for President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial. Chief Justice William Rehnquist presided over Clinton's Senate trial. As both articles of impeachment failed to receive the required super-majority, Clinton was acquitted and was not removed from office. Donald Trump (impeached Dec. 2019, acquitted Feb. 2020) House votes on Article I and II of House Resolution 755 After a whistleblower accused President Donald Trump of pressuring a foreign government to interfere on Trump's behalf in the 2020 election, the House initiated an impeachment inquiry. On December 10, 2019, the Judiciary Committee approved two articles of impeachment (H.Res. 755): abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. On December 18, 2019, the House voted to impeach Trump on two charges: #Abuse of power by \\"pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals ahead of the 2020 election while withholding a White House meeting and $400 million in U.S. security aid from Kiev.\\" #Obstruction of Congress by directing defiance of subpoenas issued by the House and ordering officials to refuse to testify. On January 31, 2020, the Senate voted 51-49 against calling witnesses or issuing subpoenas for any additional documents. On February 5, 2020, the Senate found Trump not guilty of abuse of power, by a vote of 48-52, with Republican senator Mitt Romney being the only senator—and the first senator in U.S. history—to cross party lines by voting to convict, and not guilty of obstruction of Congress, by a vote of 47-53. Chief Justice John Roberts presided over Trump's trial. As both articles of impeachment failed to receive the required super-majority, Trump was acquitted and was not removed from office. Presidents subjected to an impeachment process who resigned before it ended  The Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings received intense press attention. Portions were broadcast live on television. President Richard Nixon was subjected to an impeachment process. To avoid likely impeachment and conviction, he resigned on August 9, 1974. Richard Nixon (initiated Oct. 1973, resigned Aug. 1974) Outgoing President Richard Nixon's farewell speech to the White House staff, August 9, 1974 The House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon for obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress. On October 30, 1973, Nixon ordered the firing of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, precipitating the Saturday Night Massacre. A massive reaction took place, especially in Congress, where 17 resolutions were introduced between November 1, 1974, and January 1974: H.Res. 625, H.Res. 635, H.Res. 643, H.Res. 648, H.Res. 649, H.Res. 650, H.Res. 652, H.Res. 661, H.Res. 666, H.Res. 686, H.Res. 692, H.Res. 703, H.Res. 513, H.Res. 631, H.Res. 638, and H.Res. 662. H.Res. 803, passed February 6, authorizes a Judiciary Committee investigation. In July, the House Judiciary Committee voted three articles of impeachment to the House floor, designated H.Rept. 1305. The impeachment proceedings against Nixon were mooted when Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974. A report containing articles of impeachment was accepted by the full House on August 20, 1974, by a vote of 412–3. While Nixon was never impeached, this remains the only successful impeachment process, as its intended effect was carried out when Nixon resigned from office. Presidents who, after a formal investigation, were not impeached John Tyler Rep. John Botts (Whig-VA), who opposed President John Tyler, introduced an impeachment resolution on July 10, 1842. It levied several charges against Tyler regarding his use of the presidential veto power and called for a nine- member committee to investigate his actions, with the expectation of a formal impeachment recommendation. The impeachment resolution was defeated, 83–127. James Buchanan The House of Representatives set up the United States House Select Committee to Investigate Alleged Corruptions in Government, known as the Covode Committee after its chairman, Rep. John Covode (R-PA), to investigate President James Buchanan on suspicion of bribery and other allegations. After about a year of hearings, the committee concluded that Buchanan's actions did not merit impeachment. Harry S. Truman On April 22, 1952, Rep. Noah M. Mason (R-IL) suggested that impeachment proceedings should be started against President Harry S. Truman for seizing the nation's steel mills. Soon after Mason's remarks, Rep. Robert Hale (R-ME) introduced a resolution (H.Res. 604). After three days of debate on the floor of the House, it was referred to the House Judiciary Committee where it died. Ronald Reagan On March 5, 1987, Rep. Henry B. González (D-TX) introduced H.Res. 111, with six articles against President Ronald Reagan regarding the Iran- Contra affair to the House Judiciary Committee where no further action was taken. While no further action was taken on this particular bill, it led directly to the joint hearings of the subject that dominated the news later that year. After the hearings were over, it was reported in USA Today that articles of impeachment were being discussed, but it was decided against. Presidents against whom impeachment resolutions were introduced, but no action was taken Many presidents have been subject to demands for impeachment by groups and individuals.  Ulysses S. Grant  Rep. Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn (D-KY) introduced an impeachment resolution against President Ulysses S. Grant in 1876, regarding the number of days Grant had been absent from the White House. The resolution never gained momentum and was tabled in December 1876.  Grover Cleveland  Rep. Milford W. Howard (D-AL), on May 23, 1896, submitted a resolution (H.Res 374) impeaching President Grover Cleveland for selling unauthorized federal bonds and breaking the Pullman Strike. It was neither voted on nor referred to a committee.  Herbert Hoover  in 1932 and early 1933, Rep. Louis Thomas McFadden (R-PA) introduced two impeachment resolutions against President Herbert Hoover, which were considered for several hours and were then tabled.  Lyndon B. Johnson  On May 3, 1968, a petition to impeach President Lyndon B. Johnson was accepted by the House Judiciary Committee. Nothing further was done on the matter.  George H.W. Bush  President George H. W. Bush was subject to two resolutions over the Gulf War in 1991, both by Rep. Henry B. González (D-TX). H.Res. 34 was introduced on January 16, 1991, and was referred to the House Committee on Judiciary and then its Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law on March 18, 1992. H.Res. 86 on February 21, 1991, and referred to the House Judiciary Committee, where no further action was taken on it.  George W. Bush  A protester calling for the impeachment of George W. Bush on June 16, 2005.During the administration of President George W. Bush, several American politicians sought to either investigate him for possible impeachable offenses or to bring actual impeachment charges on the floor of the House Judiciary Committee. The most significant of these occurred on June 10, 2008, when Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) and Rep. Robert Wexler (D-FL) introduced H.Res. 1258, containing 35 articles of impeachment against Bush, to the House. After nearly a day of debate, the House voted 251–166 to refer the impeachment resolution to the House Judiciary Committee on June 11, 2008, where no further action was taken on it.  Barack Obama  On December 3, 2013, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on President Barack Obama that was formally titled \\"The President's Constitutional Duty to Faithfully Execute the Laws,\\" which has been viewed as an attempt to begin justifying impeachment proceedings. When asked by reporters if this was a hearing about impeachment, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) claimed that it was not, saying \\"I didn't mention impeachment nor did any of the witnesses in response to my questions at the Judiciary Committee hearing.\\" Contrary to his claims however, a witness did mention impeachment rather blatantly. Partisan Georgetown University law professor Nicholas Quinn Rosenkranz said, “A check on executive lawlessness is impeachment” as he accused Obama of “claim[ing] the right of the king to essentially stand above the law.” Impeachment efforts never advanced pass this making Obama the first president in 28 years to never have articles of impeachment against him referred to the House Judiciary Committee during his tenure.

Early life and career  Jan-Harm Pol was born on September 4, 1942, in Wateren, Drenthe, the Netherlands. Pol grew up on his family's dairy farm. Pol first met his wife Diane Dalrymple as a foreign exchange student at Mayville High School in 1961. In 1970, Pol graduated with a degree in veterinary medicine at Utrecht University. Pol and his wife Diane moved to Harbor Beach, Michigan, where Pol worked for another veterinarian practice for 10 years and then moved to Weidman, Michigan, where he and his wife started their own practice, Pol Veterinary Services, in 1981. The practice is made up of a mix of large and small animals. Due to the unavailability of emergency care animal hospitals in the rural area in which Pol's practice is located, emergencies make up a large portion of the practice. Viewer's complaint and legal fall-out Pol's performance has received a mixed reception by veterinarians. In 2013, Michigan Speaker of the House Kevin Cotter sponsored House Bill 5176, seeking to prohibit authorities from investigating reports of misconduct or allegations “based upon information obtained from viewing the broadcast of a reality program.” Dr. Pol testified in favor of the bill. It was referred to the House Health Policy Committee in December 2013, died in committee, and has not been re-introduced. In 2014 a complaint was filed by a viewer alleging that Pol had not worn proper surgical attire including a head cap and gown during his treatment and care in May 2011 of a Boston terrier that had been hit by a car. The owners had been happy with the animal's treatment, and there were no complications. On 26 March 2014 a disciplinary subcommittee of the Michigan Board of Veterinary Medicine had decided to fine Dr. Pol $500 and put his license on probation for not complying with standards of care required by the state. Pol was also ordered to complete an educational course. In April 2015, the Michigan Licensing and Regulatory Association (LARA) found Pol in violation for his treatment and care of that dog. His sentencing was overturned, however, by the Michigan Court of Appeals, which reversed and remanded, holding inter alia that there was no competent evidence that there was a breach of the standard of care. The judge cited a lack of evidence in LARA's decision and was perplexed by the fact there was even a complaint filed. He stated that “the owners of the dog were happy with the care it has been given,” calling the previous decision by the subcommittee \\"arbitrary and capricious\\". There were supporters of the ruling based on notions of elemental due process, including vagueness of the charge, lack of an objective and clear legal standard, and variance of the evidence presented from the charges lodged. At this juncture, a spokesman from Mackinac Center for Public Policy opined that consumers and the market place, not an officious government, should be able to make care decisions for their animals.  Personal life  Pol is married to Diane Pol and has three children. All of the Pol children are adopted, daughter Kathy and son Charles at birth and daughter Diane at age 17, after having been the Pol's foster child for eight years. Pol is color blind, unable to correctly distinguish certain colors like green and red.Meet Dr.Pol - website Santee School District (pdf)  References   External links  * * Category:1942 births Category:American veterinarians Category:Male veterinarians Category:Dutch emigrants to the United States Category:Dutch veterinarians Category:Living people Category:People from Isabella County, Michigan Category:People from Westerveld Category:Utrecht University alumni ","title":"Jan Pol (veterinarian)"},{"id":"62492543","text":"The 2019–20 Tennessee State Tigers basketball team represented Tennessee State University in the 2019–20 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

Activities  The organisation facilitates donation to the homeless through a project called StreetWear - an online shop that sells winter clothing and supplies. It operates on a One for one (business model) where for every purchase made on the platform, a matching donation is made to homeless people in London. Through its website, it sells winter supplies like blankets, jumpers, socks, gloves, etc. with the objective of donating equivalent, brand new items to make winters on the streets more bearable. Unhoused.org has also launched self-cleaning hoodies and jumpers, especially designed to repel dirt, liquid and stains. The start-up has developed its own proprietary Freshtech™ nanotechnology, which creates a Lotus Effect. Water and liquid beads off the surface of clothes without soaking through which keeps the fabric dry. Aimed at making it more sustainable and low maintenance for rough use on the streets, the clothing is made from 100% polyester and is claimed to dry 40 per cent faster than regular clothing and doesn't need to be washed for a month. For each of such an item bought on their online shop, one is donated to the homeless. In addition to clothing and winter supplies, the website hosts essentials like sanitary kits, haircuts, dental kits, and mobile phone top-ups that can be donated directly to a homeless individual. The platform distributes the items through its partner charities like Spitalfields Crypt Trust, The Salvation Army, and Sewa UK. Lack of transparency in donations and potential misuse of cash are issues that make people unwilling to make cash donations. The website enables buyers to track their donations to individual recipients. The charity claimed to have made 1500 donations within the first 3 months of its launch. with more than 100,000 items of clothing distributed till December 2019 . Unhoused shares photos, videos of items donated through the website, social media posts, emails and messages from the final recipients of the donations with its customers. This allows customers on the platform to get a sense of the on- ground impact of their donations. According to its website the average purchase from the website is around £23 compared to the median donation of £10 that goes for the cause of helping homeless people and housing shelters. The charity aims to develop technology solutions to help the homeless crisis in the UK and expand internationally. Founded by Varun Bhanot and Anisha Seth, the start-up also plans to set up a digital bank for the homeless with the objective of their financial inclusion.

Life  May Kennedy was born into a prosperous family in St. John’s, Newfoundland, and educated at a convent school in Waterford, Ireland. As the last remaining child in the family, May Kennedy inherited a substantial fortune. She became active in the Newfoundland suffrage movement as a single woman, independently wealthy, but not allowed to vote. Kennedy was active in the St. John’s-based Ladies Reading Room and the Women's Patriotic Association (WPA). During WWI, Kennedy worked at the Navy and Military Convalescent Hospital, Waterford Hall in St. John’s, as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD), providing nursing care to recovering soldiers. Many of the suffrage leaders sat on the committee of control for this hospital. May Kennedy joined the Newfoundland Women’s Franchise League at its founding meeting in 1920 and became Honorary Treasurer. She travelled to important international franchise meetings - Baltimore, Washington and Paris in particular - representing Newfoundland women for enfranchisement. In 1925, when women in Newfoundland achieved the right to vote, Kennedy, along with labour activist Julia Salter Earle and suffragist Fannie Knowling McNeil, ran for seats on St. John’s city council. All were defeated, but gained many votes and established women’s right to political office. She married Thomas Goodridge late in her life and had no children.

He was previously the longest-serving inmate incarcerated by the state of Illinois and the third longest in state history before his release on February 21, 2020. He was convicted in 1961 of the murder of one of three women found slain at Starved Rock State Park. He was held at Pinckneyville Correctional Center. On November 21, 2019, the Illinois Prisoner Review Board granted parole to Weger by a vote of 9–4. He was released on parole February 21, 2020.https://www.mywebtimes.com/2020/02/17/chester-weger-set-for-release- friday/agckjdr/https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/02/21/convicted-starved-rock- killer-chester-weger-released-from-prison/ Murders In March of 1960, three women, Frances Murphy (47), Mildred Lindquist (50), and Lillian Oetting (50), took a four-day trip to Starved Rock State Park in LaSalle County, Illinois, along the banks of the Illinois River. They arrived from the Chicago suburb of Riverside, about 90 miles northeast of the park, and were married to prominent Chicago businessmen. On March 14, after checking into the Starved Rock Lodge, the three took an afternoon hike through St. Louis Canyon, but never returned. Their disappearances went unnoticed until March 16 when the husband of Frances Murphy phoned the lodge to inquire about his wife. Police organized a search of the park which led to the discovery of the women's bodies, bound with twine and partially disrobed, inside a cave in the canyon. All three suffered severe head trauma and a blood stained tree limb found nearby was determined to have been used to bludgeon them to death. Weger, a dishwasher at the Starved Rock Lodge, was among those interviewed by Illinois State Police in the aftermath of the discovery. Several employees of the lodge told investigators that he showed to work the day after the women's disappearances with scratches on his face. Weger was questioned extensively in the weeks following the murders and was administered at least three lie detector tests, which he passed. However, investigators continued to pursue him owing to his past brushes with the law. He fit the description of an assailant who bound a teenage girl with twine and raped her at nearby Matthiessen State Park months earlier, and was later identified by the victim in a photo line-up. The twine used to bind the murder victims was the same as that found in the kitchen at the lodge, and he failed another lie detector test given to him in September. Based on this, investigators put him on nonstop surveillance. On November 16, the LaSalle County state's attorney ordered Weger arrested and brought in for further questioning. After lengthy interrogation, he confessed to the murders the next day and led police in a reenactment at the crime scene. However, just days later, Weger recanted his confession, claiming it was made under duress after being threatened by his interrogators. A grand jury returned indictments against Weger for all three murders, as well as the rape and robbery at Matthiessen State Park, however the state chose to only try him for the murder of Lillian Oetting. Weger's trial began on February 13, 1961. His defense relied on the claim that investigators were relentless in extracting a confession from him, that he was told they would convict him on circumstantial evidence if he didn't and send him to the electric chair, accusations the investigators and other witnesses denied. He claimed he was washing dishes at the time of the murders before going to the basement of the lodge, and that the scratches seen on his face in the days after the murders were from shaving. Bloodstains found on Weger's leather jacket analyzed by the FBI were inconclusive as to whether they were human or animal. On March 3, 1961, the jury returned a verdict of guilty and fixed a sentence of life imprisonment, rejecting the state's request to sentence him to death. Weger was formally sentenced on April 3, and began serving his sentence at Illinois State Penitentiary in Joliet. His attorney filed an appeal which made its way to the Illinois Supreme Court, however the verdict was affirmed in September 1962. Parole In prison, Weger repeatedly professed his innocence over the decades, but was constantly denied parole. On November 29, 2018, he fell one vote short of parole in a split vote of 7–7 before the Illinois Prisoner Review Board. One year later, on November 21, 2019, the same board voted 9–4 in granting his release after nearly 59 years in prison. He was released to a Chicago mission that aides parolees with rehabilitation. After a 90-day delay as the Illinois Attorney General sought an evaluation of Weger under the state’s Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, he was released February 21, 2020.https://www.mywebtimes.com/2020/02/17/chester-weger-set-for-release- friday/agckjdr/ See also *List of longest prison sentences served *William Heirens – served 65 years in Illinois detention *Richard Honeck – served 64 years in Illinois detention References Further reading * * * External links *American Hauntings: The Starved Rock Murders – Illinois History and Horror Category:1939 births Category:1960 murders in the United States Category:20th-century American criminals Category:American male criminals Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Criminals from Illinois Category:Living people Category:People convicted of murder by Illinois Category:People paroled from life sentence Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Illinois Category:Violence against women in the United States ","title":"Chester Weger"},{"id":"62492920","text":"Cornel Rusu (born 10 September 1944) is a Romanian water polo player.

Operating with Douglas DC-8 airplanes, it became the second Colombian cargo company. It ceased its entire operations in 1999. History ATC began work to operate between Miami and several points in Colombia with their own Douglas DC-8-51F, the HK-3816-X, with a capacity for 35 tons of cargo and it was acquired from Agro Air. Also, to satisfy their consumer demand, additional planes were occasionally leased to the Fine Air company localized in Miami. Its main partner in Colombia was a man named Miguel Canal. At the end of 1995, under the presidency of Carlos Child, a second Douglas DC-8-51F, the N507DC, was brought in and the rental system of additional aircraft to Fine Air company was continued, including the Douglas DC-8-61F, which were larger and therefore they could transport more cargo. Meanwhile, Fine Air company, which had shares in ATC, tried several times to obtain a license to fly to Colombia, which the American government always denied. That same year Miguel Canal, who ran the company for two years, retired from direct management of the company. In 1996 ATC made a special operation to become the number one company in the management of export flowers and the mobilization of this product between Bogotá and Miami. ATC inaugurated in September in the same year new facilities at the El Dorado Airport in Bogotá. In February 1997, when Colombian-American relations were going through their worst moment because of the scandal of the government of President Samper and the de-categorization of Civil Aviation, ATC was recertified by the Civil Aviation and the FAA of the United States. In this way, the company became the second Colombian freight transporter after Tampa. In the same year a Douglas DC-8-51F, the N508DC, was temporarily leased. ATC had 30 of its own crew, including pilots, co-pilots and flight engineers. The company's personnel plant in 1998 was 120 employees, counting those from Colombia and abroad. In 1999 ATC reached an agreement with the CARGOLUX company in Luxembourg, to operate direct flights to Europe, especially to transport flowers. In February 1999, a weekly frequency from Bogotá to Luxembourg was included using the Boeing 747-400 freighters. This cargo transport alliance is similar to a code-share agreement in the case of passenger flights, the transport of ATC cargo on CARGOLUX airplanes using ATC air guides. This arrangement was similar to what LAC, Caribbean Airlines reached to have with the same company some years before. Problems By 1999, the problems of noise levels in the Douglas DC-8 turbines began, ATC sought to convert the engines to Stage 3 or replace the flight equipment. Fine Air company managed to convert the turbines of its Douglas DC-8 to Stage 3, in the workshops it had in Miami. Meanwhile, the owners of Fine Air company (Frank and Barry Fine) bought Arrow Air Inc and started these two joint operations. At the same time, Arrow began leasing planes to ATC for operations in the high seasons. In this way, with the collaboration of ATC, Arrow was able to maintain their current permit in Colombia. Given the impossibility of negotiating with the Colombian Civil Aeronautics the problem of noise levels to convert the Douglas DC-8 turbines to Stage 3, Carlos Child withdrew the operating license to the airline in mid-1999, which forced the company to suspend operations definitively and went into liquidation immediately. The Douglas DC-8 HK-3816-X was scrapped in Miami in August 2000 and the Douglas DC-8 N507DC was returned to Fine Air company, the original owner. The ATC operation was replaced by the company, Arrow Air Inc . Fine Air company went bankrupt in 2002 and was sold by banks. Facilities The ATC facilities in Miami consisted of X-ray equipment, cold room and security personnel to receive the perishable cargo and warehouse for the receipt and palletizing of the merchandise. In Bogotá, an agreement was established with Aerosucre to use the cargo terminal at the airport, but with personnel hired directly by the airline. Sometimes special flights were made to Lima and Valencia.

It purports to be the diary of a farmer's wife, Anne Hughes, written in England in 1796–1797, which recounts details of her daily life, including recipes, and interactions with her family, servant and friends. There is much uncertainty about the origins of the diary, and it is at least possible that it is a \\"modern fiction\\", Roy Porter, Patients and Practitioners: Lay Perceptions of Medicine in Pre-industrial Society, Cambridge University Press, 2003, p.245 or at best a semi-fictional extrapolation of a now-lost original, although some have regarded it as providing genuine insights into the world of a late 18th-century farming community. Janet Theophano, Eat My Words: Reading Women's Lives Through the Cookbooks They Wrote, St. Martin's Publishing Group, 2016, pp.167–170 Origins of the publication The diary came to public knowledge through writer Jeanne Preston (born Sarah Jane Keyte, 1884–1952). According to the foreword written by Michael Croucher to the 1980 book version,Michael Croucher, \\"Foreword\\" to the 1980 edition, The Diary of a Farmer's Wife 1796–1797, AllenLane, , pp.9–10 the original diary, referred to at the time as Anne Hughes' Boke (or Anne Hughes, Her Boke), was owned by Anne Hughes' daughter, Mary Anne Thomas (née Hughes). When elderly, she read it to a young friend, Sarah Jane Keyte, who lived on a farm in Herefordshire (possibly Manor Farm at Ballingham) around 1896, and also wrote down some of the stories told to her by Mary Anne Thomas. She later described Mary Anne Thomas as having been a nurse to her own mother's family. The placenames mentioned in the diary – Gloucester, Hereford, and Chepstow – are generally consistent with it having been written in the southern Herefordshire area, but research into the people named in the diary has failed to identify any of the individuals. The Anne Hughes Research Team, \\"Anne Hughes Diary\\". Retrieved 1 December 2019 Keyte married a farmer, Frank Preston, in 1905, and wrote articles in the 1930s for the Farmers Weekly under the name Jeanne Preston. According to Croucher, when asked by the editor, Mary Day, to produce a regular series of articles: > ... Jeanne thought of Anne Hughes and assembled her various sources which > included Anne Hughes' Boke and the notes she had taken herself when a girl. > It could well be that she decided to present it in the form of a diary > rather than as a series of disconnected incidents, or it is possible that > the original was actually in diary form into which Jeanne then arranged all > her stories. One source for some, but not all, of the recipes was a thick > old book that had belonged to Jeanne's mother, Mary Keyte. None of the > original work can now be found... According to Mary Day, the diary was published as submitted by Jeanne Preston, though some repetitious material was removed and some archaic spellings were corrected. Frank and Jeanne Preston lived in Sarsden, Oxfordshire. She claimed that the original Anne Hughes' Boke was in her possession until, in 1944 during the Second World War, it was lent to an American serviceman, known only as Jack, who was stationed in that area, and was then lost after his unit was mobilised. Sarah Jane (Jeanne) Preston died in Sussex in 1952. Later editions and treatments The 1964 book edition of the Diary was prepared for publication by Suzanne Beedell, who was Mary Day's successor as the editor of Farmers Weekly. Both Jeanne Preston and Mary Day had already died, and it was assumed that the book transcription was both genuine and out of copyright. However, after the book had been published by Countrywide Books, Jeanne's daughter, Mollie Preston, successfully claimed the copyright on behalf of her mother's estate \\"on the grounds that it was not simply a copy, but that her mother had added to it\\". The book was re-published in 1965. On Christmas Day 1978, a dramatised version of the book, Anne Hughes' Diary, produced by Michael Croucher, was broadcast by BBC Television. The book was republished by Allen Lane in 1980, and in a Penguin paperback the following year. A further edition, with a rewritten introduction by Croucher, was published by the Folio Society, as Anne Hughes, Her Boke. At that time, a number of reviewers agreed that the book was a hoax, or faked. Richard W. Hoyle, The Farmer in England, 1650–1980, Routledge, 2016, p.26 In 1992, Penguin Books republished the diary with a new introduction by researchers Adele Davey and Frances Houghton. The same year, an audio version of the book was published. A further book edition, produced in collaboration with Jeanne Preston's grandson, was published with a new introduction in 2009, by the Good Life Press. Research into the origin of the diary, and the whereabouts of the supposed original, has been undertaken by Davey, Houghton and Ian Shankland. It was published as an introduction to the 2009 edition and has been updated on the dedicated Anne Hughes' Diary website.Anne Hughes Research Team, \\"Introduction\\" to the 2009 edition, The Diary of a Farmer's Wife 1796–1797: Anne Hughes – Her Boke, The Good Life Press, , pp.9–16 See also * List of fictional diaries References External links * Excerpts from the Diary, as edited by Suzanne Beedell * Category:Works of unknown authorship Category:Fictional diaries Category:1790s in England Category:1937 documents ","title":"The Diary of a Farmer's Wife 1796–1797"},{"id":"62492952","text":"Cornel Frăţilă (born 7 August 1941) is a Romanian water polo player.

Playing career Frye attended Elwood High School in his hometown of Elwood, Indiana, where he played on the offensive line. He went on to play college football for Indiana for five seasons, from 2002 to 2006. At Indiana, Frye set the school record for most consecutive starts by an offensive lineman, with 45 consecutive starts.https://www.dailynews.com/2019/08/23/ucla-offense-hopes-to-continue- growth-with-justin-frye-at-coordinator/ Coaching career Frye began his coaching career as a graduate assistant for his alma mater, Indiana. At Indiana, Frye worked with the offensive line and the tight ends from 2007 to 2008. He went on to serve as a graduate assistant for the Florida Gators, where he worked with the offensive line. At Florida, Frye worked with multiple future NFL Draft picks, including Maurkice Pouncey, Mike Pouncey, Marcus Gilbert, and Maurice Hurt. Following his stint at Florida, Frye landed his first job as an offensive line coach for the Temple Owls in 2011. In Frye's first year at Temple, the Owls ranked seventh in the nation in rushing yards, at 256.5 yards per game, and they set school records for the most rushing yards and most rushing touchdowns in a season. In 2012, Frye's second season with the program, the Owls once again enjoyed a prolific rushing offense with a Big East Conference-leading 201.2 rushing yards per game. In 2013, Frye left Temple to become the offensive line coach at Boston College, where he coached for five seasons. In Frye's first season with the program, his offensive line paved the way for Andre Williams to become the first Doak Walker Award recipient in Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) history. Guided by Frye's offensive line, Williams rushed for 2,177 yards, with a nation-leading 167.5 yards per game. Williams also finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting. In Frye's second season (2014), the Eagles rushed for 254.7 yards per game, and their offensive line allowed just 21 sacks, the 29th-fewest in the nation. Following that season, two of Frye's linemen, Ian Silberman and Adam Gallik, were both selected in the 2015 NFL Draft. In 2016, Frye's fourth season, the Eagles' offense led the ACC and ranked 11th in the country in time of possession. In Frye's final season at Boston College (2017), the Eagles averaged 220.4 yards rushing, good for 25th in the nation, and the Eagles' offensive line allowed only 15 sacks the entire season. In 2018, Chip Kelly hired Frye as the offensive line coach at UCLA. Despite UCLA's 3–9 record in Frye's inaugural season with the Bruins, the Bruins' rushing attack improved by over 40 yards per game from the previous season. Additionally, running back Joshua Kelley rushed for 1,243 yards in 2018, including 289 yards against crosstown rival USC; Kelley's 289 yards were the most generated by a running back in the history of the UCLA–USC rivalry. Over the final eight games of the season, UCLA averaged over 432 yards of offense per game, including over 164 rushing yards per game. Following the 2018 season, Frye was promoted to offensive coordinator, although he continues to coach the Bruins' offensive line.https://uclabruins.com/sports/football/roster/coaches/justin-frye/3453 Personal life Frye is married to Lauren Frye (née Torpeyhttps://owlsports.com/sports/football/roster/coaches/justin-frye/1069), with whom he has four children: Kevin, Zoe, Max, and Welles.

The subpoena was conducted by the grand jury empaneled by Robert Mueller in the Special Counsel investigation. United States District Court for the District of Columbia Contempt fine Federal prosecutors suggested that the company owned by 'Country A' pay a contempt fine of $10,000 per day for refusing to cooperate with Robert Mueller's grand jury. United States District Court for the District of Columbia Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell imposed a larger contempt fine of $50,000 per day. D.C. Circuit Dismissal of first appeal and filing of second appeal On September 25, 2018, the corporation owned by 'Country A' filed an appeal, Case No. 18-3068, which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. A second appeal, Case No. 18-3071, was filed on October 10, 2018 and argued on December 14, 2018. Panel selection and argument date Circuit Judge Gregory G. Katsas recused himself from the case. A three-judge panel was selected that was made up of judges Stephen F. Williams, Thomas B. Griffith, and David S. Tatel. The case was argued under seal on December 14, 2018. Opinion of the D.C. Circuit On January 18, 2019, the D.C. Circuit, in a opinion, ruled that the corporation owned by 'Country A' is not entitled to immunity in civil actions under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and must pay the contempt fine of $50,000 per day that was issued by a federal judge for defying Robert Mueller's grand jury subpoena until compliance is met. Concurrence With the exception of Part III.B., Senior Circuit Judge Stephen F. Williams concurred with all parts of the majority opinion. Williams also concurred in the judgment in his opinion. Williams stated: \\"I believe clause 1 of 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2) most compellingly establishes grounds for the government's contention that the Corporation is not immune to the subpoena.\\" Identity of corporation and 'Country A' The identity of the corporation and country have been subject to speculation. Russian-owned companies, like banks VTB Bank and VEB.RF, as well as oil company Rosneft have been mentioned as possibly being the company held in contempt. The corporation in question is said to be \\"wholly-owned by a foreign state\\", making it unlikely that VEB.RF is the company in question (VEB.RF is not a government-owned corporation). Saudi, Emirati, and Qatari-owned companies have also been discussed as possibly being the company owned by 'Country A'. VTB Bank has widely been speculated as the mystery company owned by 'Country A' because of allegations of involvement in a Trump Tower Moscow project. An email from Felix Sater to Michael Cohen imply that Sater and Cohen were inclined to use VTB Bank as a source for funding Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The email also suggests the Trump Tower Moscow project was connected to the presidential campaign. Supreme Court On February 21, 2019, Solicitor General of the United States Noel Francisco urged the Supreme Court of the United States to deny the corporation's petition to hear the case. On March 25, 2019, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

He worked for the Sydney Daily Telegraph from 1925 to 1930 and subsequently worked for Reuters in Australia, Britain and Canada. Mant married Marion Carroll in Melbourne in March 1933. The couple went straight to New Zealand, where Mant was covering the tour of the English cricket team. He had been covering the Australian leg of the tour, and intended to write a book about it, but Reuters refused him permission to do so when he told them he would be critical of the bodyline tactics of the English captain Douglas Jardine. He also accompanied the next English team on its tour of Australia in 1936-37 as the Reuters correspondent. He joined the Second AIF in July 1940 and served in Malaya until September 1941, when he was discharged and became a war correspondent for Reuters. He returned to Malaya for Reuters, escaping from Singapore in a British destroyer when Singapore fell to Japanese forces. He wrote the books Grim Glory (1942) and You'll Be Sorry (1944) about his experiences. His wife, who had accompanied him on many of his journalistic travels, replaced him as acting news editor of Reuters in Sydney when he enlisted. They had a daughter and a son. He left Reuters in mid-1942 and became State Publicity Censor for South Australia.

Formed in 1978, the group originally featured lead vocalist Mark Butcher who was replaced by Jess Cox, guitarist and backing vocalist Robb Weir, bassist and backing vocalist Richard \\"Rocky\\" Laws, and drummer Brian \\"Big\\" Dick. The group's current lineup includes Weir, drummer Craig Ellis (since 2000), vocalist Jacopo \\"Jack\\" Meille (since 2004), bassist Gavin Gray (since 2011). Jess Cox formed \\"Jess Cox's Tygers of Pan Tang\\" in 2015 and has featured members of Blitzkrieg. History 1978–1987 TOPT were formed in 1978 by Robb Weir, Rocky Laws and Brian Dick, who added Mark Butcher after Weir briefly considered performing lead vocals. He was replaced before the end of the month by Jess Cox. During the recording of their debut album Wild Cat, the band decided to add a second guitarist, and after several auditions brought in John Sykes. After the album's promotional tour ended in October 1980, Cox suddenly left. He was replaced the following month by Jon Deverill. The new lineup released Spellbound and Crazy Nights in 1981, before Sykes left to join Thin Lizzy and was replaced by former Penetration guitarist Fred Purser. Shortly after issuing The Cage in 1982, TOPT were dropped by MCA Records, and before the end of the year the group had disbanded. In 1985, Deverill and Dick reformed TOPT with new members Steve Lamb, Neil Sheperd (both guitars) and Colin Irwin (bass), the latter of whom was soon replaced by Dave Donaldson in time for the recording of comeback album The Wreck-Age. Lamb had recently been a member of Robb Weir's band Sergeant, while both Sheperd and Donaldson had worked with former TOPT frontman Jess Cox in recent years. For the 1987 follow-up Burning in the Shade, Deverill, Lamb and Dick worked with songwriter Steve Thompson as a guest contributor, before breaking up for a second time. 1999 onwards Jess Cox and Robb Weir reunited at Wacken Open Air festival in August 1999 to mark the 20th anniversary of the release of TOPT's first single \\"Don't Touch Me There\\", adding Blitzkrieg members Glenn S. Howes on guitar, Gavin Gray on bass and Chris Percy on drums. This led to a full reformation of the band the following year, with sole original member Weir joined by new vocalist Tony Liddell, guitarist Dean Robertson, bassist Brian West and drummer Craig Ellis. Shortly after the release of Mystical, the band's first studio album since 1987, Liddell was replaced by Angel Witch bassist Richie Wicks. The new vocalist remained until October 2004, recording Noises from the Cathouse before leaving due to \\"ongoing work commitments\\". Italian singer Jacopo Meille took over in December. After releasing Animal Instinct in 2008, followed by a series of re-recordings of earlier material, West officially departed in November 2011 to focus on his duties as bass technician for Uriah Heep, with Gavin Gray returning to take his place.

Individuals and organizations associated with the far-right in Spain often employ reactionary traditionalism, religious fundamentalism, corporate Catholicism, and fascism in their ideological practice. In the case of Spain, according to historian Pedro Carlos González Cuevas, the predominance of Catholicism played an essential role in the suppression of external political innovations such as Social Darwinism, positivism, and vitalism in Spanish far-right politics.González Cuevas, 2008, pp. 26-27  Cortes of Cadíz  In the Cortes of Cadíz of 1812, within the faction of realists (as opposed to the faction of more moderate reform conservatives), a subgroup of reactionary defenders of the Antiguo Régimen (Old Regime) was incorporated. One notable member of this subgroup was Pedro de Inguanzo y Rivero, a prominent Bishop (and later Archbishop of Toledo) who was proclaimed cardinal by Pope Leo XII.González Cuevas, 2001, p. 103.  Bourbon Restoration  During the Bourbon Restoration, the extreme right in Spain, though united by Catholicism, saw increasing plurality; differences in views the far-right included Carlism, Maurism, social Catholicism, and nationalism.González Cuevas, 2008, p. 25. This overarching Catholicism was reinforced by the work of prominent Spanish historian Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo, who asserted that the Spanish volkgeist was that of Catholicism.González Cuevas, 2008, p. 27. During the crisis of the Restoration, which was accentuated from 1914 onwards, the extreme right represented itself as a force against secularization of Spain and in favour of the interests of the Catholic elite; various far-right thinkers would meet in the Centro de Acción Nobiliaria (Nobility Action Centre).Carnero Arbat 2002, p. 100. In 1919, the Sindicatos Libres was founded in Barcelona; the organization represented Carlist workers and carried out acts of terrorism against the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo.Carnero Arbat 2002, p. 101. According to historian Colin M. Wilson, the Sindicatos Libres was a proto-fascist organization and was far-removed from the traditionalism that would come to define Spanish fascism.Álvarez Chillada 1996, p. 134.Winston 1982, p. 558. The period of the Alfonso XIII regime directly preceding the establishment of the Second Republic, marked by the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Dámaso Berenguer, and Juan Bautista Aznar-Cabañas (1923-1931), saw the consolidation and strengthening of ultra- conservative, anti-liberal, and anti-democratic forces within the Spanish Army, who promoted these far-right positions through the publications El Ejército Español (\\"The Spanish Army\\"), and from 1928 onwards, La Correspondencia Militar (\\"The Military Correspondence\\").Navajas Zubeldia 2001, pp. 74-75. In March 1931, mere days before the collapse of the Spanish monarchy, the far-right publication La Conquista del Estado (\\"The Conquest of the State\\") was founded to promote fascist views to the working masses.Gago Vaquero 2013, pp. 150-151. The publication's director, Ramiro Ledesma, was influenced by German philosophy and by the French philosopher Georges Sorel.Perfecto, 2012, p. 85. By 1931, Ledesma was receiving funding for the publication from Biscay monarchists such as José María de Areilza, José Antonio Sangróniz, and José Félix de Lequerica.González Calleja, 1994, p. 60.  Second Republic  According to Eduardo González Calleja, the predominant form of Spanish fascism in the interwar period was characterized by a \\"traditionalist ethos\\" and a \\"counterrevolutionary\\" character.González Calleja, 2008, p. 86-87. The Spanish right wing opted for violent political opposition of liberalism and embraced fascism.Saz, 2008, p. 85. With the advent of the Second Republic, ideologues of the far-right began to associate themselves with the Acción Española, a cultural and political association founded in late 1931, and began to take influence from the nativism and traditionalism of Action Française, of Italian fascism, of Portuguese integralism, and of the German authoritarianism of Carl Schmitt and Oswald Spengler.Rodríguez Jiménez, 1994, p. 36. Alfonso García Valdecasas (left), Julio Ruiz de Alda (center) and José Antonio Primo de Rivera (right), in 1933. After the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany in 1933, fascism in Spain increased; until then, according to Italian historian Gabriele Ranzato, fascism was a niche current and did not take space in public life beyond the half-cooked writings of Ernesto Giménez Caballero and the unpopular Partido Nacionalista Español (Spanish Nationalist Party).Ranzato, 2006, pp. 170-171. A number of fascist organizations were founded in this period, including the Movimiento Español Sindicalista (MES), and Falange Española and the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista. The Falange Española, founded by José Antonio Primo de Rivera, lawyer and eldest son of dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, aviator Julio Ruiz de Alda, and intellectual Alfonso García Valdecasas, would in 1934 merge with the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista to create the Falange Española de las JONS.Ranzato, 2006, pp. 171-173. The Falange counted a number of retired military officers and members of the pro-fascist Spanish Military Union in its ranks, including Emilio Rodríguez Tarduchy, Luis Arredondo, Ricardo Rada, and Román Ayza. Another member of the military and monarchist activist, Juan Antonio Ansaldo, was put in charge of organizing the paramilitary components of the party: the \\"Falange de Sangre\\" and the \\"Primera Línea\\".Muñoz Bolaños, 2018. During the period of the Second Spanish Republic, an increase in antisemitism, often apocalyptic in nature, resonated amongst Carlists and monarchists and led to the weakening of the moderate right.Álvarez Chillida, 2007, pp. 182-183. Ramiro de Maeztu, a member of Acción Española and one of the main theorists of the Spanish extreme right, promoted in En defensa de la Hispanidad (\\"In Defense of Hispanidad\\", 1934) one of the fundamental myths of the extreme right: \\"Hispanidad\\", the reimagination of imperialist and Catholic legacy of Spain. Hispanidad would be embraced by Acción Española, the Falange, and, later, by Fuerza Nueva (\\"New Force\\"). Both Maeztu and the politician José Calvo Sotelo published articles that promoted fascism and urged an anti-Republican alliance that would include traditionalists and Falangists in the lead-up to the Spanish Civil War.Morente, 2013, p. 119.  Francoist Spain  Franco visits Toloda, 1948. Following the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War, Spain was ruled by the FET y de las JONS-backed dictator Francisco Franco. The Franco dictatorship, analogous to that of other European fascist regimes of the twentieth century, incorporated into its ideology charismatic leadership, fascist imagery, and the embrace of an all-encompassing fascist state and nation.Cobo Romero, 2008 , p. 117. Two political cultures converged during the dictatorship: that of National Catholicism, and that of FET y de las JONS- style fascism.Saz, 2008, p. 153. Starting in the 1950s, a number of right-wing associations and organizations were created under the protection of the Delegación Nacional de Asociaciones (\\"National Delegation of Associations\\") and the FET y de las JONS, including the Círculos Doctrinales José Antonio, the Hermandad de Alféreces Provisionales, and the Hermandad de la División Azul. These organizations, alongside other prominent figures like the historian José Luis Rodríguez Jiménez, expressed concern in the longevity of the Franco regime and a concern about loss of power in post-fascist Europe.Rodríguez Jiménez, 2012, p. 237. During the 1970s, in the late Francoist period, a more radical sector of the ultra-right emerged.Casals, 2009 , pp. 2-4. The Círculo Español de Amigos de Europa (\\"Spanish Circle of Friends of Europe\\", or CEDADE), a neo-Nazi organization, achieved some public recognition and was supported by some leading figures of the Franco regime, such as Tomás García Rebull.Casals Meseguer, 2009, pp. 236-237. Among the prominent figures of the extreme-right who gained prominence in Franco's Spain was Gonzalo Fernández de la Mora, a member of Spain's Congress of Deputies who advocated for dictatorial monarchism, eugenics, and suppression of \\"egalitarian envy\\".Tusell, Javier (11 de febrero de 2002). «Gonzalo Fernández de la Mora, un reaccionario ilustrado». El País.  Transition to democracy  After Franco's death, during the period of transition to democracy in Spain, the far-right implemented a so-called \\"estrategia de la tensión\\" (\\"strategy of tension\\") aimed at preventing the smooth consolidation of a liberal democratic system, carrying out a number of acts of terrorism.Muñoz Alonso, 1986, p. 31. Groups such as the Alianza Apostólica Anticomunista (\\"Apostolic Anti-Communist Alliance\\"), the AntiTerrorismo ETA, the Grupos Armados Españoles (\\"Spanish Armed Groups\\"), the Guerrilleros de Cristo Rey, the Batallón Vasco Español, and a number of other right-wing groups organized demonstrations that called for the assumption of power by Spain's military, and publishing a number of calls for a coup.Muñoz Alonso, 1986, p. 31 The anti-communist and Nazi-aligned Blue Division also saw renewed interest.Núñez Seixas, 2005, p. 95-96. At the beginning of the transition period, the electoral division of the far-right was represented by the Alianza Nacional 18 de Julio coalition and by the Alianza Popular.Galician, 2008 , pp. 193-195. During the 1979 Spanish general election, the extreme right won a single seat through the Fuerza Nueva (\\"New Force\\") coalition led by the charismatic Blas Piñar. Fuerza Nueva attempted to stifle political reform through continuous activism and mobilization of far- right forces; the paramilitarism, uniforms, and violence of Fuerza Nueva attracted a number of young people to the organization.González Sáez, 2012, p. 366. The failure of the 1981 Spanish coup d'état attempt led to the abandonment of advocating for a military coup.Casals Meseguer, 2017, p. 3.  Post-transition period  Vox rally in Palacio Vistalegre, 2018. After Spain's transition to democracy, the far-right began to experience large-scale unpopularity and abandonment by members.Rodríguez Jiménez, 2006 , p. 93. This weakening of the far-right was compounded by splits between neo-Francoists and those who advocated for unity with other European far-right organizations.Casals Meseguer, 2009, p. 235. The 1990s saw the dissolution of a number of far-right organizations: CEDADE was dissolved in 1993, as well as the Blas Piñar-led Fuerza Nueva, and in 1995 the Juntas Españolas dissolved as well. The latter gave rise to the founding of Democracia Nacional (\\"National Democracy\\"), which competed without much success in elections against other marginal right-wing groups such as the Alianza por la Unidad Nacional (\\"Alliance for National Unity\\"), the Falange Española Independiente, and the re-founded Falange Española de las JONS.Casals, 2000, p. 166-167. In 1997, the Partido Demócrata Español (\\"Spanish Democratic Party\\") was founded, formed by militants that split from the Partido Popular and who achieved modest results in the 1999 elections to European Parliament.Casals, 2000, p. 167. The dawn of the 21st century saw the birth of two new far-right parties in Spain: the Plataforma per Catalunya (\\"Platform for Catalonia\\") and España 2000, based in Barcelona and Valencia, respectively. While the former attempted to integrate both Catalanists and non-Catalanists, the latter took the position of a more strict Spanish nationalism and Blaverism.Casals, 2017 , p. 8. Both the Plataforma per Catalunya and España 2000 achieved some success in elections.Casals, 2017 , pp. 7-8. In 2013, the far-right political party Vox was founded. In 2014, squatters in Madrid formed the \\"Hogar Social Madrid\\" (HSM, originally \\"Hogar Social Ramiro Ledesma\\"), a neo-Nazi collective inspired by Greece's Golden Dawn and Italy's CasaPound that distributes food to Spaniards.Ramos y Büttner, 2017, p. 120. Vox, a far-right party founded in 2013, began to see more success following the 2018 Andalusian regional election, and became the first far-right party to obtain parliamentary representation in an autonomous region of Spain. This election also saw the introduction of Super-PAC financing schemes in Spain. Vox benefited from donations by ultraconservative lobbies such as HazteOír and CitizenGo.Provos, Claire; Ramsay, Adam (26 de abril de 2019). \\"Exclusiva: un esquema de financiación coordinado internacionalmente trabaja para aupar a Vox y a la extrema derecha europea\\". openDemocracy.

Gameplay The game is presented from a top-down oblique projection. The player's health and equipped weapon are displayed at the bottom of the screen. The World Is Not Enough is an action-adventure game based on the 1999 James Bond film of the same name, where the player must control James Bond from a top-down oblique projection through eight mission-based levels. The game closely follows the plot of the film and its levels take place in film locations such as London and a Russian submarine. In each level, the player must complete a number of objectives and then escape. Objectives range from collecting keycards to gaining access to restricted areas of a level or using high-tech gadgets such as remote mines to destroy objects. Bond has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies, but the player can collect health-recovery items to restore a portion of his health. The player can also use several weapons to neutralize enemies, ranging from pistols to submachine guns, a grenade launcher, and a taser. If Bond dies, the player must start the level again from the beginning. Passwords must be used to restore the game to a specific level. The game is compatible with the Transfer Pak accessory, allowing players to transfer multiplayer character data to its Nintendo 64 counterpart, depending on how far they reached in the game.

It is part of the Joffre Group, which is a subset of the Lillooet Ranges. It is situated east of Pemberton, and northeast of Lillooet Lake. Its nearest higher peak is Slalok Mountain, to the east. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Joffre Creek, a tributary of the Lillooet River. The mountain's name was submitted by Karl Ricker of the Alpine Club of Canada to honor Ada C. Taylor, a Pemberton pioneer and the first nurse in that community. The name was officially adopted January 23, 1979, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Taylor is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Taylor.

The initial attack created an unexpected breakthrough of the German defenses and liberated the town of Nevel on the first day and subsequent attacks over the next four days created a salient about 35km wide and 25km deep at the junction between German Army Groups North and Center. Through the following weeks the forces of 1st Baltic Front continued to expand the salient and attempt to outflank and encircle the units of German 16th Army and 3rd Panzer Army to its north and south while those same units, at Hitler's orders, \\"held the goalposts\\" and attempted to cut off the salient itself. Hitler finally conceded these efforts were futile on December 16 as 1st Baltic continued attacking southwards toward Vitebsk. Background Following the Battle for Velikiye Luki in the winter of 1942-43 the 3rd Shock Army had remained on much the same lines east of Novosokolniki and Nevel through the spring and summer. During this time the railway from Vitebsk through Nevel to Pskov remained in German hands linking the two army groups, although it was under Soviet artillery fire near Novosokolniki. Breaking this line was an obvious objective. Although Army Group North had created a ready reserve of five infantry divisions to deal with threats on either end of its front, in early September the Army High Command ordered two of them transferred to Army Group South. On September 19 Army Group North took over XXXXIII Army Corps from Army Group Center, giving it an additional three divisions, 77km of front, and the responsibility of defending Nevel and Novosokolniki.Earl F. Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, Center of Military History United States Army, Washington, DC, 1968, pp. 197-98 Objective The Soviet position had the potential to serve as the springboard for a \\"big solution\\": an offensive to drive between the German army groups all the way to the Gulf of Riga. Given the nature of the terrain, with many forests, lakes and swamps and few roads even by Russian standards, plus the manpower demands from other sectors, this was impractical.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, pp. 198-99 Instead, General Yeryomenko planned the attack on Nevel as a supporting operation for his Front's wider offensive towards Vitebsk: Battle Nevelsk Church during German occupation, 1942The offensive began at 0500 hours on October 6 with a reconnaissance-in-force, followed by a 90-minute artillery preparation at 0840 hours and airstrikes by 21st Assault Aviation Regiment. 3rd Shock went over to the attack at 1000 hours on the Zhigary-Shliapy sector, precisely at the boundary between the two German army groups.\\"Possessing a vast and active intelligence network of partisans and agents, the Russians never had trouble locating the boundaries.\\" Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, p. 200 28th Rifle Division spearheaded the assault in the first echelon followed closely by an exploitation echelon consisting of the 21st Guards Rifle Division and the 78th Tank Brigade with 54 tanks. The assaulting force struck and demolished the 2nd Luftwaffe Field Division.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 39-41 Like all the Luftwaffe \\"divisions\\" the 2nd was in fact the size of a brigade, with only four infantry battalions, and was especially weak in artillery with just eight 75mm mountain guns and a battery of Stug IIIs. It had been badly damaged in its first action south of Belyi during Operation Mars nearly a year earlier.Kevin Conley Ruffner, Luftwaffe Field Divisions 1941-45, Osprey Publishing Ltd., Oxford, UK, 1990, pp. 10-12, 16 In addition to the flight of 2nd Luftwaffe Field Division the right flank of 263rd Infantry Division was badly smashed. While the attack of the 357th Rifle Division was contained the 78th Tank Brigade, carrying troops of 21st Guards Rifle Division with more mounted on trucks, along with the 163rd Antitank and 827th Howitzer Artillery Regiments, entered the gap and rapidly drove to the west and liberated Nevel from the march. General Galitskiy reported, \\"In the city of Nevel, the enemy garrison was destroyed, and many warehouses, vehicles, and other equipment were seized. There are prisoners. The quantity of trophies is being calculated.\\" At the same time the 4th Shock Army, deployed on 3rd Shock's left (south) flank, also launched an attack towards Gorodok. General Shvetsov had formed a shock group from two of his rifle corps, each advancing abreast in three echelons. 2nd Guards Rifle Corps led with its 360th Rifle Division, followed by 117th and 16th Lithuanian Divisions and two tank brigades. 83rd Rifle Corps had its 47th Rifle Division up, supported by 234th, 235th and 381st Rifle Divisions and another two tank brigades. Although there were no further panicked withdrawals by II Luftwaffe Corps the attack gained about 20km but ultimately faltered just short of the Nevel-Gorodok-Vitebsk railroad and highway.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, p. 41 Earl Ziemke wrote that the sudden collapse of 2nd Luftwaffe Division came as much a surprise to the Soviets as to the Germans: By Soviet reckoning the Nevel Offensive Operation ended on October 10, but the fighting in and around the salient continued at least into mid-December with the German forces attempting to cut off the salient as a whole while the Soviet forces expanded their hold to the north, south and west. German reaction The Germans' first impression was that they had fumbled badly but not irrevocably. Field Marshal G. von Küchler, commander of Army Group North, ordered his three remaining reserve divisions into the breakthrough area while Hitler ordered the \\"corner posts\\" (the positions on either side of the breakthrough gap) to be held at all costs. The initial efforts to counterattack failed due to transportation difficulties and superior Soviet strength and on October 9 Küchler decided to wait for reinforcements before trying again. Meanwhile Hitler berated his subordinates for failing to hold at unit boundaries, demanding that they should \\"consider it a point of honor\\" to maintain contact. When Army Group Center proposed merging the remnants of 2nd Luftwaffe Division with an Army division Hitler refused, remarkably stating he did not want to water down good Air Force troops with bad Army troops.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, pp. 199-200 Several days later the two army groups had gathered enough troops to plan a counterattack by two divisions from the north and one from the south but on October 14 Hitler forbade it because he believed the force was not strong enough.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, pp. 201 Beginning the next day 3rd Shock Army attacked the villages of Moseevo and Izocha on the northeastern flank of the salient with the 100th Rifle Brigade and eventually all of 28th Rifle Division, supported on the right by the 165th and 379th Rifle Divisions of the newly-arrived 93rd Rifle Corps. While this attack was held by the German forces, it did capture more favorable jumping-off positions for 6th Guards Army which was moving into the region. At about this time the boundary between Kalinin Front and Baltic Front (2nd Baltic as of October 20) was shifted to bisect the salient from east to west, and 3rd Shock was reassigned to the latter Front.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 54-55Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 273 On October 19 Army Group Center proposed a joint effort to close the gap but Küchler declared he had no troops to spare due to the threat to Novosokolniki. Army Group Center then asked permission to proceed alone but Hitler again demurred; on October 26 the Army Group was forced to transfer the panzer division it had been holding in reserve for the counterattack which put paid to all such planning for the foreseeable future.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, pp. 201 Renewed Soviet offensive In an early morning fog on November 2 the 3rd and 4th Shock Armies penetrated the defenses of the left flank of 3rd Panzer Army southwest of Nevel. After the breakthrough, which opened a 16km-wide gap, 3rd Shock turned to the north behind the flank of 16th Army while 4th Shock moved southwest behind 3rd Panzer Army.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, p. 203 4th Shock's part was described by Maj. Gen. A. F. Beloborodov, commander of 2nd Guards Rifle Corps:On November 4 Hitler called Küchler and Busch to his headquarters. He characterized the October battle around Nevel as a Schweinerei (a filthy mess). At the close of the conference he ordered the two army groups to be ready on November 8 to counterattack from north and south and close the gap.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, p. 203-04 3rd Panzer Army did launch its attack on that date with the 87th Infantry and 20th Panzer Divisions. The latter was relatively strong with 29 Panzer IVs and three Panzer Vs. Beloborodov received an alarming report in the morning from his 156th Rifle Division which read, \\"The enemy are advancing and attacking 417th Rifle Regiment with up to 50 tanks and infantry.\\" During the day the German force would advance as much as 8km between Lakes Ezerishche and Ordovo and capturing the villages of Blinki, Borok and several others. Beloborodov was forced to change the combat mission of his 47th Rifle Division to counterattack the penetration from the march. Army Group North was scheduled to attack from its side on the morning of November 9 but Küchler protested that all his units were tied down. Army Group Center accused Army Group North of refusing to attack simply \\"because it did not want to.\\" Hitler refused to \\"accept any further excuses\\" and ordered Army Group North \\"as a matter of honor\\" to begin its counterattack no later than the next day. Küchler assembled a scratch force of seven battalions which attacked as ordered on November 10, ran into heavy artillery fire and then were thrown back to their line of departure by a counterattack.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 131-32 On the night of November 9/10 the 4th Shock Army set about neutralizing the German breakthrough on its front. While 2nd Guards Corps contained 20th Panzer along the Gorodok-Nevel road, other forces of the Army regrouped and drove deep into the German rear areas. 357th and 119th Rifle Divisions advanced southwestward towards Polotsk while Beloborodov's 381st and 154th Rifle Divisions, supported by 236th Tank Brigade, wheeled southward to assault the German defenses at Gorodok from the west. 3rd Panzer Army moved 113th Infantry Division to block the advance on Gorodok while several combat groups covered the approaches to Polotsk. German resistance and deteriorating weather forced a temporary halt to the Soviet advance, but 20th Panzer was also forced to abandon its drive towards Nevel. While the immediate threat had been averted, on November 12 General Yeryomenko was chastised by the STAVKA for seeming to lose his composure over the German counterattacks:This critique foreshadowed Yeryomenko's dismissal from command of 1st Baltic Front on November 19. He was replaced by Army Gen. I. K. Bagramyan, who had previously commanded the 11th Guards Army.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 132-34, 138 Drive on Pustoshka 3rd Shock Army's part in the renewed offensive began with a through reorganization. By the start of November the 178th, 185th and 357th Divisions had been replaced by the 115th, 146th and 326th Rifle and the 18th Guards Rifle Divisions. It also received the 34th Guards and 118th Tank Brigades. Shortly after the offensive began on November 2 the new commander of 2nd Baltic Front, Army Gen. M. M. Popov, further reinforced the Army with the 119th Guards and the 219th and 245th Rifle Divisions.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, p. 146 It was soon clear that 3rd Shock had been assigned the main effort in the renewed offensive. Küchler transferred six infantry battalions from 18th Army to cover 16th Army's new rear as its southernmost forces were becoming enveloped from three sides.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, p. 203 The Soviet force headed deep into the German rear area towards its objective, the town of Pustoshka on the Velikiye Luki-Riga railroad line. By November 7 the 3rd Shock's lead elements had penetrated more than 30km deep on a 40km front. By mid-month the 119th Guards Division, flanked by the 146th Division and supported the 118th Tanks, had taken Podbereze and directly threatened to cut the Novosokolniki-Pustoshka rail line. At around the same time the 6th Guards Army went over to the attack on the east side of the Nevel-Novosokolniki salient in an effort to link up with 3rd Shock and jointly isolate and destroy the XXXXIII Army Corps. This made almost no progress and 6th Guards went back to the defensive on November 15. About a week later 3rd Shock made several futile efforts to break through the German defenses east of Pustoshka but made only minimal gains and on November 21 General Popov ordered his entire Front over to the defensive.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 146-51, 154 2nd Baltic planned a new offensive to clear the salient in early January, 1944. However this was preempted beginning on December 29 when General Küchler began a phased withdrawal which took place over six days. This caught the Soviets by surprise and while 3rd Shock and 6th Guards hastily organized a pursuit this did nothing but harass the retreating Germans.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 304-05 Drive on Vitebsk 11th Guards, like 6th Guards Army, had been originally committed in 2nd Baltic Front's sector of the salient, but from mid-November on were reassigned to 1st Baltic as STAVKA's priority became the drive on Gorodok and then Vitebsk. Despite an untimely thaw making the ground near impassable to vehicles on November 16th the 5th Tank Corps and 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps, backed by rifle divisions of 4th Shock Army, began an attack on November 16 that tore through the defenses of 3rd Panzer Army's 113rd Division and by November 18 reached within 5km of the main road from Gorodok to Nevel. At 2300 hours that evening three tanks of the 5th Motorized Rifle Brigade with mounted infantry penetrated into Gorodok from the southwest and reportedly destroyed 25 German vehicles and two tanks, but this forward detachment could not be supported and was wiped out by elements of 20th Panzer by 0300 hours on November 19. For the next week fierce combat raged just west of Gorodok as the Soviet mobile troops repeatedly maneuvered and attacked to take the town. In response the German command withdrew the remainder of 20th Panzer and part of the 129th Infantry Division from their counterattack positions south of Nevel.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 133-35, 138-39 Aftermath On December 13 the 11th Guards Army attacked the northern tip of 3rd Panzer Army's flank from three sides and in two days had nearly completed encircling two German divisions in separate pockets. Reinhardt requested permission to take the front back but was refused as Hitler remained determined to close the gap. A day later the northern division was encircled and Reinhardt had no choice but to order a breakout which occurred on December 16 at the cost of 2,000 of its 7,000 troops and all of its artillery, heavy weapons and vehicles. On the same day Hitler conceded the impossibility of sealing off the salient, bringing this phase of the overall battle to a close.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, p. 206 Order of Battle Soviet (as of October 1, 1943) *Kalinin Front [after October 20 1st Baltic Front] (Army Gen.

It is the main altarpiece of the first chapel on the right in the church of San Carlo ai Catinari in Rome, Italy. Description The Annunciation painting depicts the archangel Gabriel, aloft on a cloud, revealing to the Virgin Mary that she was pregnant with Jesus (Luke 1:10-20 King James Bible). The archangel, whose face is in shadows, points to the heavens. Above, a group of cherubs open the heavens to allow for light to fall on the Virgin, and to allow the descent (in the form of a dove) of the Holy Spirit The edge of an orange curtain, lit from above, creates a diagonal rising from the right of the canvas, behind the Virgin, up to the clouds. Mary's face is flooded with light, while her hands take on the demure posture of troubled surprise. On a surface in front of Mary is the common iconographic symbol of the Annunciation, white lilies. On the floor is an empty basket and sheet, foreshadowing the coming child. The painting has striking chiaroscuro contrasts, with a mainly dark background behind Mary and the Archangel. The Annunciation, Hermitage Museum The date of the painting is variously reported as 1616Grove Art entry dating painting to circa 1616. or 1624. There is a second, smaller version of The Annunciation by Lanfranco, now displayed at the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia.

History  Different scholars variously name the misl's founder as Sadho Singh, his descendant Bagh Singh, or Bagh Singh's nephew Jassa Singh Ahluwalia. The misl rose to prominence under Jassa Singh, who was the first person to use the name \\"Ahluwalia\\". Originally known as Jassa Singh Kalal, he styled himself as Ahluwalia after his ancestral village of Ahlu. Even after other misls lost their territories to Ranjit Singh's Sikh Empire, the emperor permitted the descendants of Jassa Singh to retain their estates. After the British took over the Sikh territories in 1846, Jassa Singh's descendants became the ruling family of the Kapurthala State.

The Ahluwalias originally belonged to the Jat caste, whose traditional occupation was farming. In the 18th century, the Sikh chief Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, who belonged to the caste, adopted the surname \\"Ahluwalia\\" after the name of his ancestral village. His descendants became the ruling dynasty of the Kapurthala State. In the late 19th century, other people also adopted the Ahluwalia identity, as part of a Sanskritisation process to improve their social status, resulting in the formation of the Ahluwalia caste. They gave up their traditional occupations, as they gained political power and as the colonial British administration started regulating distribution and sale of goods. This attempt was successful, and the Ahluwalias came to be considered equal to the high-ranked Rajputs in the caste hierarchy. The Ahluwalias took up new occupations, and in particular, a large number of Ahluwalias served in the army. Some of the Ahluwalias further tried to enhance their social status by claiming Rajput descent. For example, a legendary account traces the ancestry of the Kapurthala royal family to the Bhatti Rajput royal family of Jaisalmer (and ultimately to Krishna through Salibahan). According to this narrative, a group of Bhattis migrated to Punjab, where they came to be known as Jats, and became Sikhs. The account states that Sadho Singh and his four sons married into other families, because of which the family came to be known as Ahluwalia. Lepel Griffin (1873), a British administrator who wrote on the history of Punjab's rulers, dismissed this account connecting the Ahluwalias to the Jaisalmer royal family as spurious. The Sikh author Gian Singh, in his Twarikh Raj Khalsa (1894), noted that the Ahluwalia family had adopted the royal caste identity much before Sadho Singh. Most of the Ahluwalias follow Sikhism.

Early life Simmons was born in Jersey City, New Jersey on August 21, 1876. He was a son of Charles Dewar Simmons (1847–1926) and Cornelia \\"Lilly\\" Neilson (née Harriman) Simmons. Among his siblings was Harriman Neilson Simmons, Charles Dewar Simmons Jr., Mary Elizabeth (née Simmons) Goff, and Cornelia Neilson (née Simmons) King. His paternal grandparents were Thomas Corbett Simmons and Mary Elizabeth Simmons and his maternal grandparents were Orlando Harriman and Cornelia (née Neilson) Harriman. His maternal uncle, and namesake, was railroad executive Edward Henry Harriman, and his maternal aunt, Annie Ingland Harriman, was married to James Fleming Van Rensselaer. Among his cousins were diplomat and future New York Governor W. Averell Harriman and bankers Oliver Harriman Jr., and E. Roland Harriman. After attending the Stevens School in Hoboken followed by the Drisler School, Simmons trained as a doctor at Columbia University, graduating in 1898. Career Shortly after Columbia, he decided to give up medicine for a career in finance. Not long thereafter, he set up his own brokerage business and became a director of the Harriman National Bank, of which another cousin, Joseph Wright Harriman, was president. In 1900, Simmons became a member of the New York Stock Exchange and, beginning in 1909, a member of the governing committee. From 1921 through 1924, he served as vice-president of the Exchange, followed by a six year term as president beginning in 1924 (when he was a member of the firm of Rutter & Gross at 52 Broadway). Throughout his tenure, he was a vocal opponent of stock frauds, utilizing the facilities of the Exchange to aid members \\"in connection with the nation-wide campaign to eliminate bucket shops, unscrupulous stock promoters and other schemes which result in the American investing public being swindled out of millions.\\" In 1928, he spearheaded efforts to form \\"an international campaign against security swindlers and fraudulent promoters, with the leading fraud-fighting agencies of the United States and in cooperation with those of the nations of Europe.\\" Reportedly: > \\"The spiteful said that Simmons would really have preferred canonization, > election to the papacy, or the role of lord mayor of London; that he had > accepted only as a poor alternative the most important electoral office in > the financial world. His few friends said that he was born for his exalted > and unsalaried post. For them he epitomized the puritanism of those twenty- > four brokers who in May 1792 gathered under a buttonwood tree and drew up a > written agreement to deal only with each other on a common commission basis, > so forming the Exchange Simmons now presided over.\\" A prominent speaker and writer, in 1925, he delivered a speech before the annual convention of Investment Bankers of America in St. Petersburg, Florida entitled The Stock Exchange and American Banking. Also in 1925, he wrote Modern Capitalism: And Other Addresses, followed by New York, Metropolis and Capital Market in 1927, Safeguarding the Nation's Capital in 1928, and Speculation in Securities in 1929. In January 1930, he delivered an address entitled: The Principal Causes of the Stock Market Crisis Of 1929 at the thirty first annual dinner of the Transportation Club at the Pennsylvania Railroad in Philadelphia. Upon his retirement from the presidency in 1930 after six years in office, he was succeeded by Richard Whitney. In May 1935, Simmons became vice-president of the Exchange at the suggestion of Charles R. Gay, Whitney's successor as president of the Exchange. Whitney, however, was later convicted of embezzlement and imprisoned and Simmons had to testify multiple times in 1938 before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, regarding Whitney and the Richard Whitney & Co. insolvency. Personal life Simmons was twice married. He married his first wife Caroline G. Comstock (–1920), a daughter of Clarence M. Comstock, in 1901. In New York City, they lived at 570 Park Avenue and had a summer home on Sicomac Road in Franklin Township, New Jersey (now Wyckoff). Together, they were the parents of: * Harriet C. Simmons, who married banker and soldier Sheldon Townsend Coleman (1901–1963). They married at St. George's Church in Stuyvesant Square in 1923. * Cornelia Neilson Simmons (1905–1995), who married Theodore Cole Romaine (1900–1968), a son of Louis T. Romaine, in 1928. The wedding was held at St. Bartholomew's Church with a reception at Sherry's. After the death of his first wife in 1920 from an \\"overdose of a drug taken to induce sleep,\\" he remarried to the former Beatrice Vanderpoel Bogert (1881–1942) at the Park Avenue Presbyterian Church on October 4, 1929, just twenty days before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. After a two month honeymoon to Hawaii, they lived at his home at 812 Park Avenue on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Beatrice, a divorcee who was the daughter of Eugene Thurston Bogert and Anna (née Vanderpoel) Bogert, had been previously married to lawyer William Bayard Blackwell II (with whom she had William Bayard Blackwell III). Beatrice left her husband for his friend John Mayer Jr., a grandson of Theodore Havemeyer, prompting a $200,000 lawsuit from Blackwell for the \\"alleged alienation of affections of Mrs. Beatrice Bogert Blackwell\\" in 1914. Beatrice and John married in September 1915, but later divorced in Reno in April 1929 before she married Simmons in 1929. His second wife died at their home, 812 Park Avenue, in June 1942, and Simmons died on May 21, 1955. Descendants Through his daughter Cornelia, he was a grandfather of Arthur Comstock Romaine, a Harvard University graduate who married Dorothy Stevens in 1964. Romaine, president of Webster Management, a Kidder, Peabody & Co., later married Deborah Vaughan in 1982. References External links *Edward H.H.

The Carrier Linguistic Society also worked in collaboration with Nak’azdli Elders and the First Peoples' Cultural Council to establish an online Dakelh language archiving, teaching, and learning platform on the website FirstVoices. The CLS has also played a large role in the curriculum development and the implementation of Carrier language classes being taught at eight local schools and worked in collaboration with the University of Northern British Columbia to establish Carrier language classes and the Education Diploma in a First Nations Language and Culture (Dakelh / Carrier) at the University of Northern British Columbia.

Fenoglio quickly grasped the ascendancy of Art Nouveau as it appeared in Italy at the turn of the century as the \\"Stile Floreale\\" or \\"Stile Liberty\\" (Liberty style, named after the British department store Liberty & Company, a major purveyor of Art Nouveau furniture and decorative arts), during a period when Italian architects were searching for a national style of modern architecture. He took advantage of the very favorable economic climate to become one of the style's most fervent supporters in northern Italy before the First World War. Building little after 1912, Fenoglio parlayed his success as a designer into a diverse set of economic ventures, eventually landing him the directorship of a bank in 1915. Life and Career Built in 1902, Fenoglio's own house, the Casa Fenoglio-LaFleur, remains his most famous work. Pietro Fenoglio was born in 1865 in Turin, four years after the modern unification of Italy into a single kingdom.Though Italian unification would not be completed until the acquisition of Rome in 1870. His father Giovanni was an administrator, while his mother Giacinta (née Guillot) was the daughter of the former Préfect of Chambéry, who had moved to Turin after Chambéry had been annexed by France in the Treaty of Turin in 1860. After studying civil engineering under Carlo Ceppi at the Regia Scuola di Applicazione per gli Ingegneri di Torino (now the Politecnico di Torino), from which he graduated in 1889,Metodi e strumenti per la conoscenza di un patrimonio industriale: il caso di Morano Sul Po, Clara Bertolini Cestari e Manuel Fernando Ramello, 2006, abstract su www.ticcihcongress2006.net (consultato il 16 dicembre 2009) he worked first for the firm of Brayda, Boggio and Reyend before forming his own firm. His first independent commissions in the 1890s exhibited a Gothic- revival style reminiscent of the historical building traditions of Piedmont. Sensing the fashion of the time, however, his interest subsequently turned to Art Nouveau, and after 1900 he became the leading protagonist of the style in Turin. Commissions in a period of rapid economic expansion and prosperity were plentiful and Fenoglio became extremely prolific, establishing his studio at 60, Via XX Settembre, where he designed some of the major Italian examples of Art Nouveau.Coda, B. N., R. Fraternali, C. L. Ostorero, Turin Liberté. 10 promenades dans les quartiers de la ville. Turin: Editions du Capricorne, 2017, p. 151. Over the course of thirteen years he designed and built over three hundred projects for villas and palaces, many of which were concentrated in the area centered on the Corso Francia. Fenoglio's work became increasingly recognizable by his strategic use of pastel colors, the ornament that alternates between floral subjects and circular geometric elements, and from the wide use of cement frameworks combined with the sometimes-daring decorative elegance of iron and glass.Coda, et al., pp. 151-152. Fenoglio was also one of the organizers of the 1902 and 1911 International Expositions in Turin, but he was also active in the publishing field, numbering among the founders and serving as one of the most important contributors to the magazine L'architettura italiana moderna. At the same time, the intense spate of construction activity meant that he also became part of the emerging Turin industrial and financial bourgeoisie, consolidating his influence in the construction sector. Fenoglio became vice-president of the well-known Impresa Porcheddu, of the Società Anonima Cementi del Monferrato, and a partner in the Accomandita Ceirano & Company, and managing director of the emerging Banca Commerciale Italiana.Coda, et al., pp. 152-153. Casa Girardi, an apartment building on the Via Cibrario in Turin. Among Fenoglio's best known works are the Villino Raby (1901);Located in corso Francia 8 and built in collaboration with the architect Gottardo Gussoni. the famous Villa Scott (1902),Located in a hilly area, it was chosen by director Dario Argento as a set for the famous film Profondo Rosso. a triumph of loggias, turrets, bay windows and oriels; and, above all, his own home, the Casa Fenoglio-Lafleur (1902);It was built by Fenoglio as a \\"home-studio\\", a fairly common practice at the time: even the architect Bonelli, Vandone di Cortemilia, and, before them, Antonelli himself did so. Later the Casa Fenoglio was sold to a wealthy Frenchman named Lafleur and from then became Casa Fenoglio-Lafleur. considered by many to be \\"the most significant example of liberty style in Italy.\\"M. Lever Pistoi, Un demi-siècle d'architecture 1865-1915. Des suggestions post-Risorgimento au nouveau siècle fermente. Turin: Typographie Torinese, 1969), pp. 176-80.R. Nelva, B. Signorelli, Les œuvres de Pietro Fenoglio dans le climat international Art Nouveau, (Bari: Daedalus, 1979), pp. 207-09.Coda, et al., pp. 152-53 (Consulted 16 December 2009). Other buildings worthy of note that reproduce decorative elements deriving from the success of the Casa Fenoglio-Lafleur are the Casa Galateri, one of the many commissioned by the same client, recognizable for the remarkable oriel bay overlooking the Via Cibrario; and the no-less-remarkable Casa Rossi-Galateri on the Via Passalacqua. Fenoglio was especially known for the number of Art Nouveau apartment buildings during this period: Casa Rossi Galateri (1903), Casa Rey (1904), Casa Boffa/Costa (1904), Casa Macciotta (1904), Casa Balbis (1905), Casa Ina (1906),an example of a rental house built for the insurance company Ina-Assitalia. Casa Guelpa (1907), and the council houses of via Marco Polo (1904), realized in collaboration with the architects Vicary and Molli. Outside Piedmont, he designed the villa of Magno Magni in Canzo, near Como. After 1904, his work as a designer expanded into the nascent world of Italian industry, which found Turin a favorable place to establish new companies. Among the best known commissions of Fenoglio's industrial architecture are the Conceria Fiorio (1900), the Stabilimento Boero (1905), the Fonderie Ballada (1906), the car factory of Officine Diatto (1907) and the large building of the first Italian brewery Bosio & Caratsch, with the attached manor house (1907).Coda, et al., pp. 151-52. Thanks to his newly-acquired experience in the field of industrial plant design, Fenoglio was also entrusted with of the vast project of the Leumann Village, the working-class neighborhood in nearby Collegno where, in addition to the Cotonificio Leumann, he built the houses and the school and the church of Santa Elisabetta, one of the handful of ecclesiastical structures in the world built in Art Nouveau.Art Nouveau was considered an inappropriate style for sacred architecture since it supposedly flaunted forms considered too frivolous, sometimes sensual and often evocative of a feminine stereotype thought to be decadent and lecherous.Coda, et al., 155. In the Monferrato area, together with the engineer Giovanni Antonio Porcheddu, he designed the first factory for the fiber cement company Eternit di Borgo Ronzone. Fenoglio's activities were not confined to that of an esteemed professional designer. He was also politically active, holding positions as city councilman and consultant for the study of the new town plan that was completed in 1908. In 1912 he also joined the Board of Directors of the Banca Commerciale Italiana and in 1915, when the then-managing director Otto Joel was removed from his position due to his German origins, which were incompatible with the nationalistic climate following Italian entry into the First World War, he was replaced by Fenoglio himself along together with Giuseppe Toeplitz.Roberta Garruccio, Minoranze in affari-La formazione di un banchiere: Otto Joel, Catanzaro: Rubbettino Editore, 2002, pp. 154, 179. In 1917 they were elected managing directors. In this capacity Fenoglio continued to promote quality architecture by actively participating in the bank's expansion and construction of branch offices, including enventually the construction of the new headquarters in Piazza Colonna in Rome, for which he appointed young Marcello Piacentini as director of works. Piacentini soon became the one of the principal figures in the emergence of the rationalist architecture that characterized the next twenty years in Italy.

She also researches ways to improve microbiology laboratory practices in Africa. She is a Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Sciences and the African Academy of Sciences.  Early life and education  Okeke was born in England to Nigerian parents. She later moved to Nigeria to attend secondary school. She attended Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria, where she obtained a BPharm, an MSc, and a PhD. As part of her PhD she spent a year at the Centre for Vaccine Development, University of Maryland as a Fulbright Scholar.  Research career  Okeke carried out her postdoctoral research at the University of Maryland, USA and Uppsala University, Sweden. In 2000 she moved to the University of Bradford, England, as a teaching faculty member. She then moved to Haverford College, USA in 2002 where she worked as an Associate Professor before becoming a full Professor in 2014. During her time at Haverford College she was a Branco Weiss Fellow of the Society of Science between 2004-2009, and a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies, Berlin from 2010-11. Her research has focused on using bacterial genetics to understand the molecular epidemiology, colonization, pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance of enteric bacteria. She has studied the surface proteins of E. coli and described how these proteins help the bacteria colonize the gut. Whilst at Haverford College, she received several National Science Foundation grants to fund this work. In 2014, Okeke moved to the University of Ibadan, Nigeria to continue her research. She is supported by the UK Medical Research Council and UK Department for International Development as an African Research Leader. In 2019 she was awarded funding from the Grand Challenge Africa drug discovery scheme to strengthen drug discovery capacity and identify potential drugs compunds against bacterial disease at the University of Ibadan. She is also working on low-cost technology solutions to monitor antimicrobial resistance in low-income settings, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. As part of her work on science and technology studies, Okeke aims to improve laboratory practices in Africa. In 2015 she was awarded funding from the Microbiology Society to reform a Masters course in Pharmaceutical Biology at the University of Ibadan. Having observed that students had limited laboratory experience, she developed a course that included more practical laboratory elements. This involved a collaboration of scientists from different fields including bacteriologists, molecular biologists, and natural product researchers. The course content focused on studying leaf microbiomes of plants used in Nigerian ethnomedicine. She has also written a book, Divining Without Seeds: The case for strengthening laboratory medicine in Africa, with the aim to assist researchers as well as policy makers. Okeke's expertise has been recognised by global policy initiatives, including the World Economic Forum, where in 2018 she spoke about ways to improve antimicrobial surveillance in African countries. She has also served on committees and acted as a consultant for the Wellcome Trust Surveillance and Epidemiology of Drug Resistant Infections Consortium, the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, the World Health Organization, and the Nigerian Global Antibiotic Resistance Partnership Network.

The department is headed by a Secretary that is appointed by the Governor. The Secretary is a member of the Governor's Cabinet. Currently, the department is responsible for administering the collection of the North Carolina state income tax, gasoline tax, sales tax, beverage tax, inheritance tax, . History In 1849, North Carolina first imposed an income tax of three percent of interest, dividends, profits, wages, and salaries and a fixed fee of $3.00 on citizens with incomes in excess of $500. The income tax supplemented an existing tax on property and the poll tax. Local officials were responsible for collecting the new income taxes. Although the income tax provide a major portion of the state revenue, the income taxes were rarely collected after the civil war due to a lack of a way to verify income sources. When the North Carolina Constitution was rewritten after the Civil War in 1868, the North Carolina State Tax Commission was authorized to tax trades, professions, franchises, and incomes. In 1903, the State Tax Commission recommended transferring property tax assessments to local authorities vice the state and income, license, franchise, and inheritance taxes would remain with the state. In 1921, the General Assembly enacted a state-administered personal and corporate income tax. As part of this new tax legislation, the assembly created the Department of Revenue to administer, enforce and collect the income tax. When the financing of schools, roads, and prisons was shifted from local government to state government responsibility in the 1930s, a retail sales tax of three percent was enacted to pay for it with the Department of Revenue responsible for collecting it. The tax system under the Department of Revenue management has remained almost unchanged since then. Secretaries/Commissioners of the Department of Revenue The Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Revenue is appointed by the Governor. From 1921 to 1873, the position was called Commissioner of Revenue. While the position was initially created in 1921 to be nominated by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate and elected in the same manner as other public offices in 1924, this was changed in 1929 to allow the Governor to appoint the commissioner as it has been done since then.

She is an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Career After earning her PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, Mahendra accepted a research scientist position at Rice University. At Rice, Mahendra studied how silver nanoparticles contained in water filtration membranes, polymers, and oil paints, worked to disinfect viruses, bacteria, and fungi. She also lead a project to explore natural and engineered bioremediation of 1,4-dioxane in colder climates. Mahendra joined the faculty of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2009. Two years later, she was elected a Hellman Fellow and she conducted a project entitled “Biodegradation of Perfluorinated Compounds\\" which was submitted to the US Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment. As a result of her research, Mahendra received the 2013 Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award from the National Science Foundation and UCLA's 2013 DuPont Young Professor award. The Dupont award was given to Mahendra for her development of cost-effective detection and remediation of microbes and fungi that could remedy chemical contaminants in groundwater at industrial sites. The next year, Mahendra was promoted to Associate Professor for the 2014–15 academic year. As an Associate Professor, Mahendra teamed up with Leonard Rom to develop a new technique that uses enzymes to remove pollutants from water which also minimizes risks to public health and the environment. In 2017, Mahendra and her research team developed a method to package enzymes capable of destroying contaminants through biodegradation together into nanoparticle “vaults.” They then immobilized the enzyme vaults in sol-gels, which would help scale up production and integrate vaults at treatment plants.

In 2016 they received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Pacific Music Awards. They are the longest running Pacific contemporary performing arts organisation in New Zealand, and the book Floating Islanders, Pasifika Theatre in Aotearoa by Lisa Warrington and David O'Donnell has two chapters dedicated to their history and legacy. Pacific Underground has produced plays, music, workshops and events and continues to be an active influence on performing arts culture within New Zealand. In 2018 Pacific Underground celebrated their 25th anniversary with a number of events.  Background  The founding members of Pacific Underground were Mishelle Muagututi'a, Oscar Kightley, Simon Small, Erolia Ifopo and Michael Hodgson supported by Tanya Muagututi'a, Pos Mavaega and Fuarosa (Losa) Luafutu-Tamati and Vic Tamati. Their first play, Fresh Off The Boat, written by Oscar Kightley and Simon Small, was produced in 1993. This play was groundbreaking partly because of its humour and partly because of the theme of a rift between the generations: those born in Samoa, and those born in New Zealand. Fresh Off The Boat was directed by Nathaniel Lees, who brought his experience to help shape the work. It was performed in theatres in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland in New Zealand as well as in Samoa. It was published in 2005 by The Play Press. Pacific Underground went on to write and tour plays during the 1990s for school audiences with a theatre-in-education focus. The best known of these plays was Romeo and Tusi by Erolia Ifopo and Oscar Kightley, which has been revived frequently. The first presentations of Romeo and Tusi were as a schools tour in 1996, after which a bigger version with a band for outdoor summer presentations was developed in 1997. In the 1990s Members of Pacific Underground tutored a school holiday programme called Culture Shock at the Christchurch youth centre. Pacific Underground continued with theatre-in- education and producing main-stage plays. They also developed music, and in 1994 Pos Mavaega joined the group as musical director for productions. Under the name Pacific Underground Music Production (P.U.M.P.) they produced two albums, Landmark (1999) and Island Summer (2010), as well as playing at different events, and in 2016 received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Pacific Music Awards. Pacific Underground were an intrinsic part of the Christchurch Arts Centre with an office for many years at the Dux de Lux, famous as a live music venue. The Arts Centre was deemed unsafe following the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes and Tanya Muagututi'a and Pos Mavaega after losing their work space relocated to Auckland. In 2019 the Court Theatre presented Fresh Off The Boat by Oscar Kightly and Simon Small 25 years after its debut. Original cast member Tanya Muagututi'a directed, with one review saying of the production: \\"It gathers us all in and gives us an opportunity to start the conversation around Pacific people and the challenges of prejudice in an inclusive way that highlights the aspiration of New Zealanders to understand each other in our diversity and beyond our stereotypes.\\" The company has had many different performers, directors and production people over the years, many of whom have continued in the arts and the film and TV industry. This includes Barbara Carpenter who went to Culture Shock, the holiday programme. She says: \\"I found Pacific Underground, and the women in particular, to be strong, encouraging and empowered by their passion for performing and expressing themselves.\\" Well-known New Zealand artists who started out with Pacific Underground include Oscar Kightley, David Fane, Shimpal Lelisi, who are all members of the Naked Samoans. Music artists include Ladi6, Brent Park, Dallas Tamaira of Fat Freddy's Drop and Scribe. Anton Carter was manager for three years starting in 1994.

The higher copy of the negation, in the matrix clause, is pronounced; but the semantic meaning is interpreted as though it were present in the embedded clause.  Background  The NEG-element was first introduced by Edward Klima, but the term neg raising has been accredited to the early transformational analysis as an instance of movement. Charles J. Fillmore was the first to propose a syntactic approach called neg transportation but is now known solely as negative raising. This syntactic approach was supported in the early beginnings by evidence provided by Robin Lakoff, who used, in part, strong/strict Polarity items as proof. Laurence R. Horn and Robin Lakoff have written on the theory of negative raising, which is now considered to be the classical argumentation on this theory. Chris Collins and Paul Postal have also written in more recent times in defense of the classical argumentation to negative raising. These early accounts attributed negative raising to be derived syntactically, as they thought that the NEG element was c-commanding onto two verbs. Not all agreed with the syntactic view of negative raising. To counter the syntactically derived theory of neg raising, Renate Bartsch and a number of others argued that a syntactic analysis was insufficient to explain all the components of the neg raising (NR) theory. Instead they developed a presuppositional, otherwise known as a semantically based account.  English  In English, negative raising constructions utilize negation in the form of, \\"not,\\" where it is then subject to clausal raising. In the phenomenon of negative raising, this negation cannot be raised freely with any given predicate. Consider the following example proposed by Paul Crowley, in which the verb \\"say\\" attempts to display negative raising: # Mary didn’t say it would snow # Mary said it would not snow. As seen in this example, \\"say\\" is not a predicate that can be used for Neg-Raising, as the raising of the negation to the matrix clause creates the reading \\"Mary didn’t say it would snow,\\" which holds a different meaning than \\"Mary said it would not snow,\\" where the negation resides in the embedded clause. To account for this fact, Laurence Horn has identified 5 distinct classes to account for the general predicates involved negative raising, as seen below in English: {  +Horn's Classification of Neg- Raising Predicates !Class of Predicate !Examples - Opinion think, believe, suppose, imagine, expect, reckon, feel - Perception seem, appear, look like, sound like, feel like - Probability be probable, be likely, figure to - Volition want, intend, choose, plan - Judgement be supposed to, ought, should, be desirable, advise, suggest } Consider the Perception predicate, \\"look like,\\" in which we can posit the following readings: # “It looks like [it will not rain today]” # “It does not look like [it will rain today]” In this regard, “It does not look like [it will rain today]” is seen as a paraphrase of “It looks like [it will not rain today].\\" This is because even with the raising of the negation to the matrix clause, both sentences convey the same meaning, thus the matrix clause negation is to be interpreted as if it were within the embedded clause.  Position and Scope of NEG In English, syntactically we can have negative phrase structures with the NEG in the matrix clause - the semantic interpretation of these phrases can be ambiguous; * The negation could apply to the verb in the matrix clause * The negation could apply to the verb in the embedded clause  Phrase structure with ambiguous and unambiguous NEG interpretation  {  + ! !Phrase structure with NEG in Matrix clause - !  - !Phrase [DP I ] do _not_ believe [TP we are having a review session] - !Interpretation 1 I don't believe that there's going to be a review session - !Interpretation 2 I believe that there is not going to be a review session } Syntax Tree 1 509x509px {  + ! !Phrase structure with NEG in embedded clause -   - !Phrase [DP I ] believe [TP we are _not_ having a review session] - !Interpretation I believe that there is not going to be a review session -   } Syntax Tree 2 500x500px The English language has a rich inventory of operators; these operators (in this case NEG specifically), differ from each other in terms of their scope orders with respect to other operators (in this case Verb). When we look at negative raising - we are thus looking at the operator NEG, and its scope over the Verbs in a phrase. Sentence with negative raising are thus ambiguous in terms of NEG - * In one reading NEG has scope over the matrix verb (Tree 1) * in the other reading NEG has scope over the clausal verb (Tree 2)  Phrase structure showing NEG Raising - from lower to upper position  504x504px This tree illustrates how NEG can be raised from the embedded clause to the Matrix clause; thus it can be pronounced in the higher position while retaining its scope from the lower position.  Negative raising in other languages  Aside from English, negative raising has been an apparent phenomenon in a variety of languages:  Modern Greek  negative raising works similar to English in Modern Greek but there appears to be clearer evidence of its existence in the language. This is evidenced in the usage of Negative Polarity Items and the usage of \\"αkόmα\\" (the time Adverb) in this language.  \\"αkόmα\\" (the time Adverb)  When the adverb αkόmα (translated as \\"yet\\" or\\"still\\" in English) is paired with a verb in the aorist, the negation \\"δεν\\" makes the clause grammatical (e.g δενaorist αkόmα) as it imperfectivises it. This clause cannot stand as an independent clause if the negation is not present, showing that the pair appear together in the same context (for it to be grammatical, another verb form would have to be used). However when the ungrammatical clause (e.g * aorist αkόmα) is embedded in a matrix clause, a negation appears before a \\"Neg-raiser\\" verb that is located in the higher clause - suggesting that the negation was moved from the embedded clause into the matrix clause. Negative Polarity Items (NPI)  When an embedded clause (consisting an NPI) is embedded in a matrix clause (consisting a \\"Neg-raiser\\" verb), the negation could appear before or after the \\"Neg-raiser\\" verb. In both cases, the sentence would remain grammatical. However when a non \\"Neg-raiser\\" verb is used in the matrix clause, the negation is only allowed after the verb, before the embedded clause.  French  In French, evidence of negative raising can be demonstrated through the use of tag questions and corrective responses, where negation is primarily depicted by the negative construction, \\"ne...pas.\\" ref>  Tag questions  When analyzing French tag questions, the tags 'oui' or 'non' are both seen with affirmative statements, while the tag 'non' is only selected by negative statements. negative raising can be demonstrated through the observation that when the negation is in the embedded clause, it is able to take a tag. This can be seen through the use of the verb 'supposer,' to suppose, which coincides with Horn's proposed classes of negative-raising predicates: {  +Tag Questions in French with the verb 'Supposer' !French + Tag !English Translation - i) Je suppose que Max est parti, oui / non? I suppose Max has left, yes / no? - ii) Je ne suppose pas que Max soit parti, non? I don't suppose Max has left, no? - iii) Je suppose que Max n'est pas parti, non? I suppose Max hasn't left, no? } Through this depiction, with both the matrix clause negation in ii) and embedded clause negation in iii) possessing the ability to take a tag, evidence is given that ii) surfaces via negative raising from the structures like iii). Thus, despite the movement of the negative \\"ne...pas\\" to the matrix clause, the meaning of ii) is seen as a paraphrase of iii).  Corrective responses  The use of corrective responses in French is similar to that of Tag Questions, with the exception that there are three attested answers to corrective responses: 'oui', 'si,' and 'non.' 'Oui' or 'non' are used to express affirmation, while negative questions are expressed by 'si' or 'non.' As seen through the continued use of the verb 'supposer,' to suppose, negative raising can be demonstrated in the following examples: {  + Corrective Responses in French with the verb 'Supposer' !French !English Translation !Possible Responses in French - i) Je suppose que Jean vient de Djibouti I suppose that Jean comes from Djibouti Mais oui! / Mais non! - ii) Je suppose que Jean ne vient pas de Djibouti I suppose that Jean does not come from Djibouti Mais si! / Mais non! - iii) Je ne suppose pas que Jean vienne de Djibouti I do not suppose that Jean comes from Djibouti Mais si! / Mais non! } In this data, it appears that the way in which the possible responses 'si'/'oui' are distributed relies upon the polarity of that to which it is a response. This statement further infers that negative raising is a process involved, given that ii) and iii) both permit the answer “Mais si!” or “Mais non!” despite the negation surfacing in separate clauses. This prompts evidence that they depict the same meaning despite the movement of the negation in the phrase, and thus, both structures originating their negation in the embedded clause.  Japanese In Japanese, there are instances of neg-head raising. This is evidenced, in part, through negative polarity items and the negative nai 'not'. It is suggested that one of the main differences between Japanese and English is that the extent of negative scope is based on whether there is or is not any neg-head raising to a higher position. In addition, neg-head raising has been to attributed to being responsible for clause-wide negative scope in Japanese. This is different from English in that the negative scope in Japanese extends over the tense phrase (TP) because of neg-head raising.  Negative polarity item (NPIs)  In Japanese there are two types of NPIs: an argument modifier type and a floating modifier type. In Japanese, NPIs need to occur within the scope domain of the negator. What this means is that if the NPI were to occur in the matrix clause and the negator in the embedded clause, it would be considered to be ungrammatical, as it would not be within the scope domain of the negator. Another aspect which differentiates Japanese from English, in reference to Japanese NPIs, is that NPIs are considered to be legitimate regardless of whether they appear in the subject or the object position in simple verbal clauses. Listed below are some example of Japanese NPIs. {  +Japanese Negative Polarity Items !Japanese !English translation - dare-mo anyone - amari very - ken-sika 'ken'-only }  Negative Nai 'Not'  Neg-head raising is also evidenced from the negative nai 'not'. The negative nai 'not' is neg-head raised, but it seems presently to only be raised when with a predicate with some verbal properties, as is shown by the NPI data. The evidence provided from the negative nai 'not' shows that the scope of nai moves from only being in the negative phrase (NegP) to extending over the tense phrase (TP). Additionally, when nai doesn't undergo neg-head raising, it results in subject-object/complement asymmetry.  Serbo-Croatian In Serbo-Croation there is Obligatory NEG Raising in sentences which contain the ni-NPI accompanied by the NEG ne. This happens, as unlike English, SC does not have no-forms i.e Unary NEG structures, without a DP external NEG. Thus sentences in Serbo-Croation, lacking a clausally located NEG are ungrammatical. {  +Ungrammatical sentence lacking clausal NEG !Serbo-Croation *Marija ce videti niko-ga - !Gloss Mary will see no-one-ACC } Instead the raising process is employed;the underlying NEG ne originates in the lower embedded DP, and raises to the matrix, leaving behind a copy. Only the upper copy of the word is pronounced, so there is no possibility of an incorrect double negation analysis of the meaning. This can be seen as analogous to English sentences that contain a NEG internal to the DP combined with an NPI. The structure of the sentence in these cases is as follows - {  +Grammatical sentence structure with NEG raising !Serbo- Croation Mian NEG1, vidi [DP[D cNEG1 i] [NP šta - !Gloss Milan not see something }  See also  * Negative Polarity Items * Negative Inversion * Verb Phrase Ellipsis References Category:Linguistics ","title":"Negative raising"},{"id":"62494272","text":"Lure of the Gold is a 1922 American silent western film directed by and starring Neal Hart.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films 1893-1993: Lure of the Gold Cast *Neal Hart as Jack Austin *Hazel Deane as The Singer *William Quinn as Chuck Wallace *Ben Corbett as Latigo Bob Preservation The Lure of the Gold survives in the Library of Congress.Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress, p. 108, c.1978 by The American Film InstituteThe Library of Congress / FIAF American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: Lure of the Gold References External links * * Category:1922 films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:1922 Western (genre) films ","title":"Lure of the Gold"},{"id":"62494284","text":"Aaron Henry (born August 30, 1999) is an American college basketball player for the Michigan State Spartans of the Big Ten Conference.

Fair Fight and Fair Fight Action are two separate organizations, but share the same website.  Origins  154x154px Stacey Abrams had long been involved with the Democratic Party and had served as a Democratic leader in the Georgia House of Representatives. In 2018 Stacy Abrams ran for Governor of Georgia against Republican Brian Kemp. The 2018 gubernatorial race received national attention for irregularities in voter access to the ballot. At the time, Kemp was serving as Secretary of State and was responsible for the state's voter rolls. He stalled 50,000 votes while he held this position. Civil rights groups interpreted this as intentional voter suppression since his action affected predominantly black voters. In the aftermath of her loss to Kemp, Abrams established Fair Fight Action, \\"after witnessing the gross mismanagement of the 2018 election by the Secretary of State's office.\\" Abrams decided not to run for president and instead commit to this interest group in the 2020 election. In 2019, Abrams created Fair Fight 2020, an initiative aimed at monitoring voting practices in key battleground states .  Goals and initiatives  Fair Fight Action aims to make elections in Georgia and the rest of the U.S. more equitable by advocating for changes in voter registration laws that will increase the number of eligible voters. Their goals are to encourage voter turnout and to ensure that all votes are accurately counted. They also want to make absentee ballots more consistent. Abrams has stated she will, \\"...use my energies and my very loud voice to raise the money we need to train those across the country in our 20 battleground states...\\". Fair Fight Action joined the Voter Empowerment Task Force, which is composed of other civil rights groups such as GA NAACP, Black Voters Matter Fund, and the Georgia Coalition for People's Agenda. The coalition's mission was to fight voter intimidation and Raffensperger's fraud task force. The organization has also condemned Brian Kemp's signing of House Bill 838, which further strengthened protections for first responders, including police officers. Fair Fight Action believes that police officers already have more than sufficient protections, and this legislation will only make black people more vulnerable to corrupt officers.  Legal action  Fair Fight Action is currently suing the state of Georgia's secretary of state office over what they consider to be unconstitutional voting issues. Fair Fight Action was a party to the court case Curling v. Raffensperger which ordered the state of Georgia to dispose of all old Diebold voting machines prior to Georgia's 2020 presidential preference primary in March 2020.

This was in line with the inclusion of the social and recreational aspects of Scotland's new view on woodlands expansion. However, design, conservation and recreation all fell behind the commercial aspect of afforestation. In 1981 the Thatcher government amended the 1967 Forestry Act that included a shift in favor of privatization of woodland expansion. Grants for afforestation were simplified as incentive to private landowners and would work in conjunction with the tax deductions in place since the 1950s. Tax breaks lured investors looking for long-term investments. This eventually led to expansion into areas less conditioned for forest. This included the Flow Country, which was drained and used for commercial timber, mostly Sitka Spruce. This resulted in 90% of Scotland's afforestation being carried out through tax break and grant. In 1982 the Forestry Commission and the Institute of Chartered Foresters organized a conference on broadleaves in Britain. This marked a turning point for afforestation. After the conference the British government reviewed all aspects of broadleaves policy. On July 24, 1985 the government presented a new broadleaved woodland policy.Forestry Commission. The Policy for Broadleaved Woodlands. Edinburgh : Forestry Commission, 1985. Even with the new policy in place that sought to protect and further afforestation of native woodlands, the northern highlands and Flow Country were still seeing commercial afforestation of non-native species. In 1987 the Nature Conservancy Council published Birds, Bogs and Forestry. The publication took aim at the use of the Flow Country for commercial plantations. It argued that the use of the land was having a big impact on wildlife. Other publications enforced the claim made by the NCC and it also came at a time of public allegations of the government catering to the wealthy. In 1988 the Chancellor of the Exchequer canceled all tax incentives. The late 80's and 90's saw an increased interest by the public in Scotland's forests and the Forest commission was on board. As a result, in 1992 the Forest Commission established the Native Pinewoods Initiative, who's goal was to increase the area of native pinewood to 6,000 hectares by the late 90's. The rise of the Labour Party in 1997 gave a further boost to afforestation of native tree species. Environmental preservation was high on the list of importance as was the inclusion of community in afforestation of woodland. Devolution from the U.K. took place in 1999. The Forestry Commission was dissolved and reorganized as the Forestry Commission Scotland.Forestry Commission. Great Britain and England annual Report and Accounts2003-2004. Edinburgh : FC, 2004. In 2000 Forestry Commission Scotland released the first Scottish Forestry Strategy. In 2006 it was revised to reflect the issue of climate change as an important factor in woodland expansion. Scottish Executive. The Scottish Forestry Strategy. Edinburgh : Forest Commission Scotland, 2006. Scotland's emission target was not met in 2017 due to adjustments made in the EU's Emissions Trading System. In 2018 Scotland met their tree planting goal and introduced 11,200 new hectares of afforestation and helps solidify Scotland's position as leader in new tree planting with 84% new tree planting taking place in Scotland. In April 2019, Forestry Commission Scotland was dissolved and formed into two new Scottish government agencies, Forestry and Land Scotland and Scottish Forestry. Forestry and Land Scotland is responsible for the conservation, management and promotion of Scotland's forest. Scottish Forestry is responsible for forestry policy, support and regulation.Scotland Forestry. Forestry Commission Scotland no longer exsists. https://scotland.forestry.gov.uk. [Online] April 1, 2019. [Cited: December 1, 2019.] https://scotland.forestry.gov.uk. The Future The Scottish Government's Draft Climate Change Plan was published in 2017 and has set goals for the future of Scottish afforestation. Targets range from the years 2020–2050. This includes a woodland creation target of 12,000 hectares per year by 2020/21, 14,000 hectares by 2022/23 and 15,000 hectares per year by 2024/25. Included in the draft is the 2050 goal of greater ecosystem services through forestation that contributes to natural flood protection, biodiversity improvement and the country's natural capital.

The IMF has three main goals, those of which include: surveillance, lending, and technical assistance. Surveillance comes in a multifaceted approach on the economies of the nations it surveils. The IMF monitors the economies of its respective constituent nations and also delivers policy memos in order to stabilize the economies. The IMF issues short-term loans typically directed at the balance of payments of a nation. Other loans given are for the correction of an underlying issue within a nation or for poverty stricken nations to jumpstart their respective economies. The IMF has 189 member nations, and all of the member nations participate in the IMF by paying a quota. The quota is assessed through an analysis of the GDP of a country. The richer the country, the larger the quota. In order to accomplish tasks within the IMF, bankers, government officials, and CEOs/CFOs of major corporations work in tandem. Of the countries involved there are 24 executive directors. Executive directors are chosen by the country which has the most voting power within its respective groups.Hence, the countries within the group that have the most economic power carry the vote for their entire grouping. Most importantly the IMF is often described as the 'lender of last resort'. The Islamic Republic of Iran has only gone to the IMF on 2 occasions, both occurring before the 1979 revolution of Iran.  The Islamic Republic of Iran and the IMF   History of Iran and the IMF  While the Islamic Republic or Iran is a different regime than that of the Shah's regime, the state of Iran joined the IMF on 29 December 1945. There's been 2 scenarios in which Iran used IMF funding. The first stand-by arrangement occurred on 18 May 1956 where the IMF approved a 17.50 SDR million loan package. Iran used the entirety of the offered loan. The second stand-by arrangement the IMF approved of for Iran occurred on October 10, 1960. The amount approved was 35 SDR million; however Iran chose to draw only 22.50 SDR million of the available loan. Iran has no outstanding loans or purchases with the IMF.  Iran and the IMF Present Day  As of 2019, the IR Iran's special drawing rights (SDR) is 1549.18 million and its remaining callable capital brings Iran to its IMF quota of 3567.1 million SDR. Iran is one of the two largest economies in the Middle East & North Africa (MENA) region, trailing only behind the economy of Saudi Arabia and trails in population only to Egypt. Due to these socioeconomic factors, Iran has significant power in the IMF in its grouping. Iran holds the executive directorship in its grouping; the other countries in the IR Iran's group are the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Algeria, Ghana, Libya, Morocco, Pakistan, and Tunisia. The total voting power (% of total IMF funding) of IR Iran's IMF group is 2.54, where Iran carries the most individual votes having 37,136 votes of the 128, 046 votes in its grouping. Although the Islamic Republic of Iran carries the overall vote for its group in the board of directors meeting, its power doesn't go far in comparison to that of the United States (16.52% of the total fund). The voting bloc of the United States, Japan, UK, France, and Germany along with the other EU directors makes it nearly impossible for the economic policies of IR Iran to be implemented in any effective manner.  The IMF in Conflict with Iran  Sanctions on Iran have hampered the growth the nation was seeing since the nuclear deal was in place in 2015. Compared to 2017/18, 2018/19's fiscal year has seen a 9.5% drop in GDP and a 37.5% inflation hike due to the restricting economic environment that was created by President Donald Trump. The tightened economy has led the IMF to recommend through its many policy memos that the IR Iran raise its price of barrels of oil to $194.60. The domestic economy is projected to go from 2019/20's fiscal year $60.3 billion in goods and services to $55.5 billion in 2020/21's fiscal year. OPEC is expected to increase its deficit of 4.5% in 2019/20 to 5.1% in 2020/21 in large part due to the restrictions on Iran's economy. The IMF implements its policies through the use of a conditionality, but since the IR Iran hasn't used the fund to lend since 1960, the fund can only send policy memos. In the 2018 Article IV Consultation of IR Iran, the fund dictates the manners in which the country can fix its economy through restructuring the banks and political infrastructure. The political reforms the IMF recommends will in turn help solve the increasing unemployment of its youth in the country.

It is the highest point of the Spearhead Range, which is a subset of the Garibaldi Ranges. It is situated southeast of Whistler, and south of Wedge Mountain, its nearest higher peak. Precipitation runoff from the south side of the peak as well as meltwater from the Platform Glacier drains into Fitzsimmons Creek which is a tributary of the Cheakamus River. Meltwater from the Tremor Glacier on the northwestern slope drains to Wedge Creek, and meltwater from the Shudder Glacier on the northeast slope drains into Billygoat Creek, a tributary of the Lillooet River. Tremor Mountain is often climbed as part of the Spearhead Traverse. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1928 by A.J. Campbell Garibaldi survey party. The mountain's name origin refers to unexplained earth tremors when the first ascent party was on the summit. The mountain's name was officially adopted on September 6, 1951, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Tremor Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The design is a development of the Hans Christian 38 and 42. Production The design was commissioned from Harwood Ives by Hans Christian Yachts founder John Edwards circa 1979. Ives was paid for his work with a production Hans Christian 33. The design was initially built by Hans Christian Yachts at the Hansa Yachts Und Shifbau yard in Taiwan. Production then passed in 1987 to the Shing Fa Boatbuilding Company, also in Taiwan. Disagreements with several boat building yards resulted in some of the completed boats being sold under various other names. In 1990 production was moved to Thailand in search of cheaper labour and lower taxes under the name Dutch East Indes Trading Company, although the company seems to have completed only one boat before production was moved to Andersen Yachts. In 2004 production moved again to a New Zealander-owned company, Pantawee Marine, still in Thailand, using the model name Traditional 33. The design was still available in 2018, although it is unlikely any were built after 2009. By 2019 that company was also out of business. A total of 168 boats were constructed from 1980 to 2018. Design The Hans Christian 33 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a cutter rig, a spooned raked stem, a bulbous rounded transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a wheel, an optional bowsprit and a fixed long keel. It displaces and carries of iron ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar diesel engine of for docking and manoeuvring. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of or . The below decks accommodation is unconventional, with a double Pullman berth aft on the starboard side and another forward on the port side. The galley is on the port side at the foot of the companionway steps, and is just aft of the dinette table. The galley includes a three-burner gimballed stove and an icebox. The dinette table does not convert to a berth, but the starboard settee does, for a total sleeping accommodation for five people. The head is located in the very bow and includes a hanging locker and a shower. There are provisions for a generator and also for air conditioning. The boat makes extensive use of teak above decks and mahogany below. The cockpit, the decks and the cabin trunk roof are all made from teak. Ventilation is provided by three pairs of dorade vents, two hatches and six opening bronze ports. Sheet and halyard winches are located on the cockpit coaming and on the mast. The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 95.0. Operational history In a 1992 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"this is a small ocean cruiser that evolved from the Hans Christian 38 and 42. The design emphasizes appearance and cruising accommodations. The rudder is very large and, for a full-keel boat, far aft.\\" A 2015 review in Blue Water Boats, noted of its sailing qualities, \\"Under sail, she’s seakindly without the tendency to bounce or bob over waves and owners report hoving-to in relatively high comfort when the going gets rough. Fully laden at over 25,000 lbs in typical cruising trim there can be no expectation for fast passages yet the HC33 can perform well, you can expect easy 125 mile days in the trades and we’ve heard of a 7 knot overall average from Mexico to San Francisco via Hawaii.\\" A 2017 used boat review by Jack Hornor in the SpinSheet concluded, \\"The Hans Christian 33 is a stout, safe, and comfortable bluewater cruiser that is reasonably priced. But, be aware that these will be high maintenance boats to keep in Bristol fashion, and age will take its toll on teak decks. If your love of this style overwhelms your practical side, she will also make a very handsome coastal cruiser or day sailer.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Abbott 33 *Alajuela 33 *Arco 33 *C&C; 33 *Cape Dory 33 *Cape Dory 330 *CS 33 *Endeavour 33 *Hunter 33 *Hunter 33.5 *Mirage 33 *Nonsuch 33 *Tanzer 10 *Viking 33 *Watkins 33 References Category:Keelboats Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Hans Christian 33"},{"id":"62495087","text":"History Garage interior Mega Web, or Megaweb, is a car theme park operated by Toyota in Odaiba's Palette Town, Tokyo, Japan.

The Project for the Royal Palace in Campo de Ourique was an ambitious 18th century proposal for a monumental royal palace to be built in the Campo de Ourique neighborhood of Lisbon. Portuguese architect Dionizio de S. Dionizio planned the palace for King Joseph I of Portugal as part of the reconstruction efforts following the destruction of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake. Context The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, with its ensuing tsunami and fire, devastated much of Lisbon, notably destroying the city's Ribeira Palace royal complex centered at the Terreiro do Paço, including the Tagus Royal Opera House and the new cathedral of the Patriarch of Lisbon. Ribeira Palace had been the primary Lisbon residence of the King of Portugal since the 16th century, when it substituted the Royal Alcáçova at São Jorge Castle. Following the earthquake, King Joseph I of Portugal and the Portuguese Royal Family established themselves in the western reaches of Lisbon, which survived the earthquake, first at Belém Palace and then at Ajuda Palace. Reconstruction efforts for the city as a whole were charged to Manuel da Maia, Eugénio dos Santos, and Carlos Mardel by the Marquis of Pombal, King Joseph's prime minister. Manuel da Maia, as High-Engineer of the Kingdom, was charged with personally leading the efforts to rebuilt a royal palace in central Lisbon. History In February 1756, Manuel da Maia selected Campo de Ourique to be the site of the new royal palace and began studies into the geography of the area and the urban planning of the palace and its integration into the larger urban environment.Junta da Freguesia de Campo de Ourique - Um Palácio Real em Campo de Ourique Campo de Ourique was purposefully chosen as an area not located near the Tagus river waterfront, which suffered the most destruction from the earthquake and tsunami. In 1758, Maia charged Carlos Mardel with the objective of contextualizing the chosen palace site into the larger urban fabric of the rebuilding city and Eugénio dos Santos with the execution of plans for the palace and its environs.Diccionario Historico e Documental dos Architectos, Engenheiros e Constructores Portuguezes ou a Serviço de Portugal The two alternative elevations of possible main façades done by military engineer Captain Dionizio S. Dionizio in 1760 are thought to have been executed under the guidance of Eugénio dos Santos, though the details surrounding the palace's planning are unclear. Owing to the primary concern of rebuilding the vast amounts of housing and commercial buildings destroyed by the earthquake, the Portuguese Royal Family eventually began to settle at Ajuda Palace, with many families of the Portuguese nobility choosing to establish themselves in the Belém district of Lisbon, which was spared from devastation. A sentiment arose among nobles who had rebuilt their own estates in the Belém and Ajuda districts that the King should not relocate and rebuilt a palace in Campo de Ourique, which was a considerable distance from Belém and Ajuda. This sentiment coupled with the complications that arose in the reconstruction of Lisbon, particularly of the scarcity of materials and labour, led to the decision to ultimately abandon the project for a palace in Campo de Ourique. Discovery The façade elevations of the palace were discovered in 2014 by researchers at the Lisbon Academy of Sciences in the academy archives.Revista de História da Arte - Dois Alçados Inéditos do Palácio Real de Campo de Ourique Hélder Carita, a researcher with NOVA University Lisbon's FCSH, lead the investigation into the origin and context of the architectural plans. While it is assumed that Dionizio S. Dionizio executed these plans while under the leadership of Eugénio dos Santos, the prominence of his name on the plans, while also not being one of the prominent engineers and architects leading Lisbon's reconstruction, raise questions about the context in which these elevations were drawn up.Universidade Nova de Lisboa/Mais Lisboa - Um Palácio Real em Campo de Ourique See also *Project of Filippo Juvarra for the Royal Palace of Lisbon  References  External links *Palácio de Campo de Ourique (1st elevation) at A Casa Senhorial *Palácio de Campo de Ourique (2nd elevation) at A Casa Senhorial Category:Unbuilt buildings and structures in Portugal Category:Palaces in Lisbon Category:Royal residences in Portugal ","title":"Project for the Royal Palace in Campo de Ourique"},{"id":"62495239","text":"Marco Zambuto (born 10 April 1973 in Agrigento) is an Italian politician.

She is the Peter B. Ritzma Professor of the Humanities and Professor of History at Northwestern University. Education and career Cohen is of Ukrainian Jewish descent and grew up the daughter of a lawyer in Louisville, Kentucky. Her interest in British history stems from her father's interest in British modernist literature, and her feminist approach to history was influenced by Harvard University professors Susan Pederson, Alexandra Owen, and Olwen Hufton. She graduated summa cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1990, and completed her Ph.D. in history at the University of California, Berkeley in 1996. After working as a faculty member in the history departments of American University from 1997 to 2002 and Brown University from 2002 to 2010, she joined Northwestern University as Ritzma Professor in 2010. Books Cohen's first book was The War Come Home: Disabled Veterans in Britain and Germany, 1914–1939 (University of California Press, 2001). In it, she contrasted the generous treatment by the Weimar Republic of veterans returning from World War I, and the lingering resentment of those veterans toward the Republic, with the more meager support by Britain for its veterans and their loyalty to their state. Rather than attributing these differences to the different outcomes of the war for the two countries, she credits Britain's encouragement of private philanthropy towards veterans for their happiness. Her second book, Household Gods: The British and their Possessions (Yale University Press, 2006), studies the rise of the middle class in Britain from the Victorian era to the present, through the mirror of their household possessions. Her themes include the descent of popular tastes from the individuality of the Victorians into mass conformity, and (triggered by the 1895 libel and indecency trials of Oscar Wilde) a perceived linkage between aesthetic taste and homosexuality that led British men to retreat from home decor, leaving it to women. Family Secrets: Shame and Privacy in Modern Britain (Viking Penguin and Oxford University Press, 2013), her third book, concerns British families and the ways they handled issues that might be considered shameful, including birth defects, mixed-race and illegitimate children, adoption, divorce, homosexuality, and abusive family members. As with Household Gods she mainly focuses on the middle class. Cohen studies the way that the balance between privacy and secrecy has been transformed by developments including the enforced openness of mid-19th-century divorce courts, the early 20th-century legalization of adoption and abortion, and the changing sizes and composition of family units. Recognition Cohen's book The War Come Home won the Allan Sharlin Memorial Book Award of the Social Science History Association. Her book Household Gods won the Morris D. Forkosch Prize of the American Historical Association, was co-winner of the Albion Book Prize of the North American Conference on British Studies, and was shortlisted for the Hessell-Tiltman Prize of the English PEN. Her book Family Secrets also won the Forkosch Prize, and was the winner of the Stansky Prize of the North American Conference on British Studies.

Discovery and etymology  This species was named and described by John Marris and Paul J. Johnson in 2010, based on a type specimen collected in 2006 at Lighthouse Bush on Great Island, Three Kings; the holotype was deposited in the Lincoln University Entomology Research Collection (LUNZ). The name manawatawhi is taken from the Māori name for Great Island, Manawa Tawhi, which translates as \\"panting breath\\", referring to the feat of Te Aopuri chief Rauru swimming to the island from the mainland.Cheeseman, T.F. (1888) \\"Notes on the Three Kings Islands.\\" Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute: 20, 141–150. Description Adult A. manawatawhi can be distinguished from other Amychus species by its lack of small nodules on the back, especially on the head and elytra, compared to A. granulatus and A. candezei. It is the largest of the three Amychus species, ranging from 16–24 mm. It has a flattened body shape and small vestigial wings. Click beetles are named for their ability to make an audible click when on their back to jump into the air. However, Amychus do not have the ability to defend themselves in this way.  Gallery  Holotype in Lincoln University Entomology Research Collection File:Amychus manawatawhi HT Habitus lateral Whole.jpgLateral view File:Amychus manawatawhi HT Habitus frontal.jpgFrontal File:Amychus manawatawhi HT Habitus ventral Whole.jpgVentral  Distribution  This species has only been collected from Great Island and South West Island in the Three Kings group. These islands have been isolated from the New Zealand mainland since the late Miocene, and have numerous endemic species; it seems likely that A. manawatawhi evolved on the Three Kings and has always been restricted to those islands.  Ecology  The adult beetle has been collected at night from logs and the trunks of tree species such as Cordyline kaspar, Kunzea sinclairii and Meryta sinclairi, and by day from pitfall traps, litter samples, and under logs and rocks. Only a single larva has been collected, from South West Island.  Conservation  A. manawatawhi has been classified as \\"Naturally Uncommon\\" by the Department of Conservation. Goats were introduced to Great Island in 1889, but removed in 1946.

According to the ADB, the Philippines has heavily relied on the ADB for development assistance, borrowing a total of $19.3 billion in the last decade. The Philippines has been commended by the ADB for being a fast-growing economy despite increasing inflation and a plummeting global economy. The ADB also deemed the country one of its “special” partners; it is the location of their headquarters. The IMF considered it one of 24 emerging countries. ADB projects in the Philippines Since its founding, the ADB has been heavily involved in the modernization and development initiatives in the Philippines.  Agriculture  In 1968 an ADB project aimed to improve the country's irrigation system, mostly in rural areas. It was believed to improve many aspects of rural economies by providing access to education and healthcare.  Transportation  After discovering that the Philippines' transportation system was in poor condition, the ADB proposed the EDSA Greenways Project, to improve commuter facilities for safer, more efficient and comfortable pedestrian travel. The ADB deemed all water, air, and land transportation in the Philippines outdated; most of the day, roads become impassable and congested due to the lack of other effective transportation infrastructures/methods. The ADB is also reviving and building railways to connect provinces and provide access to and from the cities.  Education  The Asian Development Bank created a program called Facilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition Program. This program facilitates job training for out-of-school, at-risk, and less fortunate youth. In the long run, this project aims to maintain the economic growth in the country.  Governance reform  The ADB's current Local Governance Reform Program was created in order to provide quality service to local communities, and also promote the establishment of new businesses in different areas in the country.  Emergency assistance  In order to restore order after the 2017 urban war between the Philippine Armed Forces and ISIL, the ADB provided the Philippines emergency assistance in the form of loans and grants. This monetary assistance covers the reconstruction and recovery of Marawi, its transportation system, health system, and the restoration of the province's livelihood and education.

She has been included in the BBC's list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world for 2019.  Life  Born August 1997 in Ajigasawa, Aomori, Kon started wrestling in first grade when she was six, inspired by her siblings' interest, and began competing and winning against boys. When she reached university, studying gender theory at Ritsumeikan University, she became the third woman to join its sumo club. Kon believes sumo wrestling is not just a sport, but a form of expression. Japan is the only country in the world where sumo is practiced professionally, governed by the Japan Sumo Association. According to sumo's ancient Shinto and Buddhist beliefs, women are not allowed to enter or touch the wrestling ring (dohyō) as they are \\"impure.\\" The JSA follows this tradition that has been firmly maintained through the centuries, believing it would be a dishonor to all of their ancestors to change it. This has been enforced to the point where two women had gotten in trouble with a referee for entering the ring to perform first aid on a man who had collapsed in 2018. Although a JSA official later disapproved of the referee's actions as it was a life-threatening situation. There are several amateur sumo competitions in Japan and around the world where women compete. Kon won the heavyweight division of the Women Junior World Sumo Championships in 2014 and 2015. She also competed in the 2018 and 2019 Sumo World Championships, where she won silver both times. Kon was the subject of Little Miss Sumo, a 2019 Netflix documentary directed by Matt Kay that followed her to the 2018 championship. After graduating from university, Kon joined the sumo works team sponsored by Aisin Seiki as its first female member.月刊「相撲」(ベースボールマガジン社)2020年1月号・国技を支えるこの情熱を見よ アマ翔る！ 立命館大学相撲部 今日和選手 132-134p  References   External Links  * *Short video on Kon by the BBC Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Aomori Prefecture Category:BBC 100 Women Category:Female sumo wrestlers ","title":"Hiyori Kon"},{"id":"62495760","text":"Governor Strong may refer to: *John Clifford Strong (born 1922), Governor of the Turks and Caicos from 1978 to 1982 *John Franklin Alexander Strong (1856–1929), 2nd Governor of Alaska Territory from 1913 to 1918 ","title":"Governor Strong"},{"id":"62495762","text":"The 2019 All-Big Ten Conference football team consists of American football players chosen as All-Big Ten Conference players for the 2019 Big Ten Conference football season.

The Dominican Republic is a lower middle-income country stretching over 18,172 miles on the Island of Hispaniola. It has the tenth largest economy in Latin America, and the largest economy in the Caribbean region. Agriculture, tourism, Free Trade Zone (FTZ) Manufacturing, and mining (gold, ferronickel, silver, bauxite, limestone, and zinc) drive the economy. Due to the FTZ Model, the DR has an open market economy that is free from tariffs, subsidies, licensing requirements, unions, and other regulations which has made trade with other countries easier, quicker, and cheaper. This is why there was a recent boost in exports resulting in an improved GDP growth. Relationship with the World Bank The World Bank has sent the Dominican Republic $230 million (2016), $1 million (2017), $150 million (2018), and $180 million in 2019. The loans vary each year depending on existing loans, urgency, and other factors that influence the Project Cycle. World Bank projects in the Dominican Republic vary from expanding the energy sector, improving education, to strengthening infrastructure. Relationship with IMF The Dominican Republic joined the IMF December 28, 1945. The goal of the IMF is to ensure financial stability and are the final resort for countries who are struggling. Government officials have abused the IMF by using them as a way to save the economy to cover up scandals of corruption. For instance, in 2002 the Dominican Republic went through a Recession after the Bank, Baninter went bankrupt. President Mejia bailed out the bank despite the negligence of the Bank management resulting in the loss of $2.2 billion. President Mejia only received $120 of the $600 million he asked from the IMF. The Dominican Republic lost 67% of the annual budget and about $700 million. The Dominican Recession (2002) brought a halt to the steady rapid growth brought by the telecommunications and mining sectors. The DR was exporting good and unemployment was down. However, due to the corruption and decision by President Mejia to bail out the bank, Baninter, that went Bankrupt. President Mejia only received $120 million of the $600 million he asked from the IMF to save the country. In 2004, an additional $66 million was disbursed to aid the economy after losing $700 million in bank bailouts. The economy Rural and underdeveloped areas of the Dominican Republic and cheap immigrant labor (usually from neighboring country, Haiti), provide most of the labor force behind the growing economy. The economy grew 7.1% between 2014-2016 by exporting at low prices. The DR exports 50% of their products to the U.S., and over 500 U.S companies manufacture products in the Dominican Republic. The downside to the FTZ model is that it strongly depends on the global market and will not sustain itself in the long run. The country still has high levels of poverty despite a growing economy because it continues to lack investing in human capital. There continues to be tension with the Dominican people because much of this economic strength has come at the cost of depleting natural resources and heavily impacting the health of many Dominicans, especially those who work/live near mines. In order to achieve economic prosperity, they must lower their dependency on the global market, prepare for natural disasters (infrastructure, emergency/medical personnel), improve human capital (investing in education), manage natural resources carefully (overmining & polluting water sources), and government officials must be held accountable for decisions they make that affect the Dominican population.

Behavior  The banded rainbowfish is an active shoaling fish, that typically occurs in the surface and mid-level areas of fresh water environments. As seasonal spawners the banded rainbowfish breed intermittently throughout the year, males compete with one another for territory and female attention in contests where they compare body coloration and size buy swimming side by side whilst extending their fins too appear larger. After mating females can produce between 200-500 eggs which they affix to vegetation using adhesive threads after which it leaves, the male will continue to guard their territory and by extension the eggs until they hatch 6–7 days later.  Habitat and diet  The banded rainbowfish lives in a wide variety of habitats, such as rivers, lagoons and slow moving streams and prefers areas with strong water flow, sandy substrate, dense sub surface vegetation and submerged logs and branches. Banded rainbow fish are opportunistic omnivores, the bulk of their diet being arthropods such as aquatic insects, arachnids and crustaceans as well as algae and terrestrial insects that have drowned on the water surface such as green ants.  Etymology  The name Melanotaenia trifasciata was proposed by Hialmar Rendahl in 1922 while describing the species; the name Trifasciata means \\"three-banded\\", however live individuals do not typically have more than a single \\"band\\". This discrepancy is due to the original museum specimen described by Hialmar, which had its pattern altered by being preserved in spirits.  In captivity  younger rainbowfish are typically more streamlined in appearance. Rainbowfish are relatively new to the aquarium hobby, and were up until recently kept by only a small group of hobbyists they have since seen a significant rise in popularity owing to their generally colorful patterns, energetic behavior and ease of care, the banded Rainbowfish itself is exemplary of these traits a hardy and peaceful shoaling fish, they make easy editions to most peaceful community aquariums and can tolerate a wide range of water parameters, like most Rainbowfish the banded Rainbowfish should be kept in an aquarium with a lid as they are capable of jumping out.

Its plot follows four people who seek refuge in the home of an insane transsexual who collects the corpses of women. The film was released in late 1972 and was subsequently thought to be a lost film, having never received a home media release. In 2018, it was restored and released on Blu-ray and DVD in the United Kingdom by Network Distributing. Plot Leslie Lamont is a deranged transsexual woman who lives in isolation in a rural farmhouse. Leslie spends her time studying the occult, grave robbing, and collecting the corpses of biological women, whose bodies she aspires to possess. Late one night, young professor Alma Frost, along with three of her students, Lily, Martha, and Roy, are forced to stop their drive back to Boston due to a torrential downpour. They seek shelter in Leslie's house, and she agrees to let them stay. Leslie is visibly disturbed by Martha, whom she says resembles a woman who worked in her mother's doll factory, also named Martha, who died two decades prior in a fire; the fire also claimed the life of Leslie's mother. In a room in the basement, Roy finds a small stage with what appears to be multiple lifelike female mannequins posed around a goblet of fire. Disturbed, Roy brings Lily and Martha to see the room. Leslie enters the room with Alma, and explains that the room is a place of worship for her own self-constructed religion. Leslie prepares a meal for her guests, consisting of sandwiches, coffee, and wine, the latter two she has drugged. As the four eat, Leslie listens in on their discussion, in which Roy chastises Alma for being uptight. As the group retire for the night, Martha and Roy begin to have sex to the chagrin of Lily, who is sharing a room with Alma. Alma, a repressed lesbian, attempts to make a sexual advance on Lily, who declines. Alma persists, and the two have sex. After, Alma complains that she feels she has been drugged. After Alma falls asleep, Lily confronts Martha and Roy in bed, and asks to stay in their room. Meanwhile, Leslie preserves a woman's corpse in the basement before communing with her dead mother's skull. Leslie chastises her mother, accusing her spirit of causing Leslie's various attempts to possess a female corpse to fail. She also reveals that she murdered her mother to prevent her from having Leslie committed. Leslie unveils her plan to be reincarnated in the young Martha's body. Roy goes downstairs to obtain more wine, and is followed by Lily. In the kitchen, Leslie strangles him unconscious with the handle of an axe. Lily walks in on the murder, and is attacked by Leslie, who hacks her to death. The screams stir Martha, who rushes downstairs and stumbles upon the scene. Leslie attacks Martha on the staircase and hypnotizes her with her pendulum necklace. Meanwhile, Alma has a nightmare in which she is chained in Leslie's altar room, and the mannequins come to life and torment her. Alma awakens from the nightmare and stumbles through the house, finding her students missing. In a chamber in the basement, Alma finds Lily's bloody corpse. Leslie confronts Alma, and in a struggle, Alma removes a prosthetic mask, revealing Leslie is in fact a man with severe burn scars. Alma flees outside, while Roy awakens in a locked cage. Leslie chases Alma into the woods and to a graveyard, where Alma collapses. There, Leslie's body suddenly disintegrates, and her spirit successfully inhabits Alma's body. Now possessing Alma's body, Leslie returns to the house and seduces Roy. Cast Release The film opened in Pensacola, Florida on December 19, 1972. It later screened in Fort Walton Beach, Florida on March 3, 1973. Home media Miss Leslie's Dolls was never released on VHS or DVD.

Through his foreign policy, which relied on different alliance partners, he succeeded in giving the Hochstift Münster a semi-independent role for the last time during the Palatinate Succession War. On July 29, 1688, he was elected prince-bishop. He brought significant diplomatic experience in his office. Likewise, he knew his way through the offices held in the past in the government of the congregation. As a bishop, Friedrich Christian tried to improve the education of priests. He loved and organized many magnificent liturgies and church festivities. For the cathedral, he donated, among other things, new windows, silver candelabra and a marble floor. To strengthen the independence of the bishop, he built, among other things with foreign aid, the Munster military. He had the neglected land fortresses repaired. In Munster, an armory was built and the fortifications of Meppen improved. Since the foreign funds were not sufficient, he took without the approval of the estates, loans of 100,000 Reichstalern to bring the army to a strength of 6000 men. The loan was repaid through additional subsidies. Shortly after the death of the bishop in 1706, the army consisted of a bodyguard of 126 infantrymen and 70 cavalrymen. The main force consisted of seven infantry regiments with a combined total of about 3,000 men, two cavalry regiments with 660 men and an artillery division. The maintenance of the army, fortresses and magazines amounted to 200,000 Reichstaler per year. Most soldiers were mercenaries, often older and unreliable. After the Imperial War against Louis XIV was declared in 1689, he participated in pressure from the Holy Roman Emperor on the war against France. Troops from Munster and Brandenburg arrived too late in the theatre of war, which contributed to the defeat of the allies in the Battle of Fleurus. On the orders of his sovereigns, the Munster General Schwartz stopped at Jülich. His epitaph was created by Johann Mauritz Gröninger and is located in St. Paul's Cathedral in Münster. Striking is the large clock dial, which serves not only as a symbol of transience but also purely practical as a time display. It is synchronized with the beat of the astronomical clock of the dome.

Early life On August 15, 1881, Halvor Langdon Halvorson was born in Henning, Minnesota. In 1902, he graduated from the University of North Dakota with a law degree and in 1908, moved to Minot, North Dakota. Career In 1910, he ran for state treasurer against incumbent Republican Gunder Olson and in September was named as vice chairman of the state Democratic party, but was defeated. Following the resignation of former Commission President Arthur LeSueur on May 17, 1911, a special election was held on June 6, in which Halvorson narrowly defeated Dorr H. Carroll and Peter Vandenoever with 232 votes against 196 and 94 votes. In 1912, 1914, and 1918, Halvorson ran for North Dakota's third House district, but lost each time with his best showing being 31.16%. He served as a delegate to the 1916 Democratic National Convention and gave his support to incumbent President Woodrow Wilson. In 1916, Halvorson attempted to win the Democratic nomination for governor, but was defeated by D. H. McArthur who went on to lose in a landslide to Lynn Frazier. In 1924, he narrowly defeated L. S. Platon for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination with 6,020 votes to 5,244 votes and was narrowly defeated by Arthur G. Sorlie with 53.93% to 46.07% of the vote.

During his long career, film director Robert Rodriguez has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects are officially cancelled or fell apart in development. 1990s Madman film According to Mike Allred, he was first offered the chance to sell the movie rights to Madman in 1992 (he has not said who made the offer, only that he declined). Since 1998, Rodriguez has owned the film rights to Madman. Both he and Allred have given numerous signals as to the start of production over the years, but with no result. Although both have been occupied with other projects (Allred was instrumental in connecting Rodriguez with Frank Miller, leading to the production of Sin City), both have been eager to see this film made. Robin Williams was mentioned as being under consideration for the role of Dr. Boiffard before his death. At the 2006 WonderCon in San Francisco, Allred announced that Madman the Movie was in pre-production and hoped to begin filming before the end of the year. He teased fans in attendance by saying that the titular role had already been cast, \\"but I can't tell you who it is yet.... When we announce it, you're gonna be like 'What?', then you'll think about it for a second and see that it's perfect.\\" In 2015, Allred indicated on Twitter that the rights to Madman had reverted back to him, and in September 2019 has stated that he prefers to focus on comics rather than film or television adaptations for the time being. Predators In 1994, Rodriguez wrote an early script for a third Predator film for 20th Century Fox while he was working on Desperado at the time. Rodriguez presented the script to the studio, but was denied when they realized that the budget would be too large. Fifteen years later, the studio decided to go with his script. Rodriguez stated: > It's the story from that script I had written way back then. They had hired > me to write a Predator story while I was waiting to do Desperado back in > 1995. It was crazy, this thing I came up with. So then fast-forward to now > and, like, six months ago, they found the script and called me up. 'Hey, we > want to redo this franchise and we found your old script. This is where we > should have gone with the series! We want to move forward.' And that's what > we're doing. In 2009, 20th Century Fox studio executive, Alex Young, called Rodriguez to consider using his treatment to revive the individual Predator franchise. Predators was produced at Rodriguez's Troublemaker Studios as opposed to 20th Century Fox so that Rodriguez had more creative control over the film. It was originally thought that Rodriguez would direct, but on July 1, 2009, Nimród Antal was officially signed on to direct. The Mask of Zorro In 1995, Rodriguez signed on to direct The Mask of Zorro with Antonio Banderas for TriStar Pictures and Amblin Entertainment. TriStar and Amblin were impressed with Rodriguez's low budget filmmaking, however, he pulled out of the project 1996 due to budgetary problems. Rodriguez wanted a budget of $45 million and the studio only wanted to do a $35 million film. The film was eventually released in 1998, directed by Martin Campbell, who reteamed with Banderas in 2005's The Legend of Zorro. Kiss Me Deadly remake On the director's commentary track for Sin City, Robert Rodriguez said that he had been attached, in 1997 or 1998, to direct a remake of the 1955 film noir, Kiss Me Deadly. It was to have been produced by Michael Mann. Rodriguez said he left the project because he thought it was \\"too nostalgic\\". 2000s John Carter In 2004, Rodriguez signed on to direct the film John Carter after his friend Harry Knowles showed him Mark Protosevichs script. Recognizing that Knowles had been an adviser to many other filmmakers, Rodriguez asked him to be credited as a producer. Filming was set to begin in 2005, with Rodriguez planning to use the all-digital stages he was using for his production of Sin City, a film based on the graphic novel series by Frank Miller. Rodriguez planned to hire Frank Frazetta, the popular Burroughs and fantasy illustrator, as a designer on the film. Rodriguez had previously stirred-up film industry controversy owing to his decision to credit Sin Citys artist/creator Miller as co-director on the film adaptation; as a result, Rodriguez decided to resign from the Directors Guild of America. In 2004, unable to employ a non-DGA filmmaker, Paramount assigned Kerry Conran to direct and Ehren Kruger to rewrite the John Carter script. Barbarella remake In May 2007, it was announced that Rodríguez had signed on to direct a remake of Barbarella for a 2008 release. At the 2007 Comic-Con convention, actress Rosario Dawson announced that because of Barbarella, production of Sin City: A Dame to Kill For would be put on hold. She also announced that she would be playing an amazon in the Barbarella film. As of June 2008, plans to remake the film Barbarella with Rose McGowan as the lead have been delayed; the actress and director are instead remaking the film Red Sonja. Red Sonja remake A second Red Sonja film had been in development for several years. In 2008, Rodriguez and his production company Troublemaker Studios were working on a version that would have starred Rose McGowan as the titular character. Woman in Chains! In May 2008, Rodríguez is said to be shopping around a prison drama television series called Woman in Chains!, with Rose McGowan being a possibility for a lead role. Grindhouse 2 Both Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have said that they are interested in making a sequel to Grindhouse. Tarantino said that he wants to shoot an \\"old-school Kung Fu movie in Mandarin with subtitles in some countries, and release a shorter, dubbed cut in others\\" for his segment. It has also been reported by Rotten Tomatoes that Edgar Wright may expand Don't into a feature film. According to Eli Roth, he and Edgar Wright have discussed the possibility of pairing Don't with Thanksgiving for a Grindhouse sequel. Roth is quoted as saying \\"We're talking to Dimension about it. I think they're still trying to figure out Grindhouse 1 before we think about Grindhouse 2, but I've already been working on the outline for it and I would do it in a heartbeat.\\" Electra and Elise Avellan, Rodriguez's nieces who play the Crazy Babysitter Twins in both films, originally stated their uncle wanted to do a sequel featuring both Machete and The Babysitter Twins, but the latter concept did not materialize with the former's release. In an interview, Electra Avellan discussed a sequel with \\"Robert mentioned something about the end of the world and Hollywood action films, where we'd be trained in Mexico to come back here and fight\\". The Jetsons film In May 2007, Rodriguez was in talks with Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. to make a CG adaptation of the 1960s Hanna-Barbera TV show The Jetsons for a potential 2009 theatrical release, while also offered at the time to direct a film adaptation of Land of the Lost with Universal. Rodriguez was uncertain which project he would pursue next, though the latest script draft for The Jetsons by Adam F. Goldberg was further along in development. 2010s Predators 2 Nimród Antal had talked about a direct sequel to Predators and said he would love to do one. Rodriguez has said that he has interest in a sequel because of the large number of potential ideas the Predator planet setting provides: In 2010, Rodriguez confirmed that there would eventually be a Predators sequel: Adrien Brody also spoke about reprising his role in a possible sequel: In June 2014, Fox announced plans for a new movie, with Shane Black co-writing and directing, Fred Dekker co-writing and John Davis producing (without the involvement of Rodriguez). At the time, Black said the film is a sequel, rather than a reboot. In August 2015, Davis said the film would \\"reinvent the franchise.\\" In November 2016, it was explained that since the plot takes place on Earth, the story will be more closely linked to the first two films. In January 2017, it was announced that while the film would acknowledge the events of Predator and Predator 2, it was unknown if it would acknowledge the events of Predators. From Dusk Till Dawn 4 In December 2010, the production of a fourth From Dusk till Dawn film was in the planning stages, but further work on this possibility has not been revealed. In November 2013, it was reported that From Dusk till Dawn: The Series had begun production, without any further mention of the film. Fire and Ice remake In 2010, Rodriquez had plans to make a live-action remake of the 1983 cult classic Fire and Ice, originally directed by Ralph Bakshi. Despite wanting no involvement in the remake, Bakshi agreed to license the rights to Rodriguez. The deal closed shortly after the death of Fire and Ice's concept artist Frank Frazetta. By December 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired the rights to make the remake, with Rodriguez still attached to direct the film. Heavy Metal remake In July 2011, Rodriguez announced at the Comic-Con that he had purchased the film rights to Heavy Metal and planned to develop a new animated film at the new Quick Draw Studios. On March 11, 2014, with the formation of his very own television network, El Rey, Rodriguez considered switching gears and bringing it to TV. Spy Kids 5 Dimension Films had announced the fifth installment in the Spy Kids series following Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. It was under talks to have the original cast expected to return. However, the film was permanently delayed from its intended 2012 production, as the film's stars Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook, who are no longer kids, were both committing to current projects (Girl Meets World and Speechless respectively), and the planned sequel got cancelled as a result. On June 16, 2016, Netflix and The Weinstein Company announced an animated CGI reboot of the Spy Kids film series titled Spy Kids: Mission Critical, which was released in 2018. Machete Kills Again... In Space At the end of the first film theatrical version, two sequels are mentioned, Machete Kills and Machete Kills Again. The trailer for the third film titled, Machete Kills Again... In Space,Robert Rodriguez Tells Vulture About Machete in Space, Sin City 2, and Fire and Ice precedes the second film as a \\"Coming Attraction\\". In 2015, Trejo told Halloween Daily News that the third film is happening. Machete Kills grossed a worldwide total of $15 million, on a budget of $20 million, making a sequel unlikely. Sin City 3 Wallace is set to appear in Sin City 3, to be directed by Rodriguez and Frank Miller. Rodriguez has said he wants Johnny Depp to play the part. Depp was originally supposed to play the part of Benicio del Toro's Jack \\"Jackie Boy\\" Rafferty. However, filming of Sin City conflicted with that of Depp's movies. Depp has expressed great interest in being a part of the Sin City franchise. Frank Miller revealed at the 2014 Comic-Con that he and director Robert Rodriguez have had discussions about a potential third Sin City film. Miller said at the event, \\"So you better show up for number two, or they won't pay for it\\". Sin City: A Dame to Kill For grossed a worldwide total of $39.4 million, against a production budget of $65 million, making a sequel unlikely. Jonny Quest film In May 2015, it was announced that Rodriguez would direct a live- action adaptation of Jonny Quest, with a script co-written by Rodriguez and Terry Rossio. Adrian Askarieh has stated to IGN that the film will be Indiana Jones meets James Bond with a PG-13 rating. In July 2016, Forbes reported that the film would start a franchise with Rodriguez and Rossio's script and will be directed by either Joe Cornish, Justin Lin or Scott Derrickson. The film will position Jonny in the film as \\"Harry Potter inside an Indiana Jones movie\\" and specifically sets the film up with the potential for spinoffs. The script also took inspiration from a few specific stories and elements in the original 1960s TV show. The site reported that the studio was considering actors Idris Elba, Bradley Cooper and Will Smith for the role of Race Bannon. In November 2018, Warner Bros. announced that the movie would be instead directed by Chris McKay. Escape from New York remake In March 2017, it was announced that Rodriguez will direct the remake of the 1981 dystopian sci- fi action film Escape from New York, with the original's director Carpenter producing. In February 2019, new development surfaced when Leigh Whannell and Luther creator Neil Cross were hired by 20th Century Fox to write a new script. UglyDolls On March 28, 2017, Rodriguez signed on to direct, write, and produce the film UglyDolls. He was replaced by Kelly Asbury, after Rodriguez left production to focus on Alita: Battle Angel. He remained intact with a producer and story credit. Alita: Battle Angel 2 James Cameron and Rodriguez have hinted that Alita: Battle Angel could lead to multiple sequels. On February 6, 2019, they announced that they have plans for Alita: Battle Angel 2 in the future. The casting of Edward Norton in a non-speaking role as Nova in this film was intended to be a setup for the sequel. Additionally, the uncredited cameos by Michelle Rodriguez and Jai Courtney were meant to set up larger roles in a sequel. In July 2019, Salazar urged fans to buy the film on physical media and expressed her hope that a sequel would be made. In an interview with BBC Radio 1, Cameron explained the reason for rearranging the film title from the initial source material, allowing the possibilities of sequel titles, \\"It's Alita, colon, Battle Angel. Because the next one will be \\"Alita: Fallen Angel\\" and then Alita... you know \\"Avenging Angel\\" and then Alita whatever. I mean, that's assuming we make some money\\". On December 2, 2019, John Landau, discussing the possibility of the sequel in an interview with CinemaBlend, said the following: \\"What I think the Alita Army should do is keep peppering our family now at Disney and [let them know] how important it is to have another Alita movie and hopefully we'll venture there one day.\\" The film is listed with losses as high as $53 million, making a sequel unlikely.

Early life  Carolyn Harding Beebe was born in Westfield, New Jersey, the daughter of Silas Edwin Beebe and Helen Louise Tift Beebe. She was a piano student of musician Joseph Mosenthal, and from 1903 to 1905 studied in Europe with German composer Moritz Moszkowski.

The Society gave first performances of dozens of new compositions, featuring works by Deems Taylor, Samuel Coleridge- Taylor, Henry Holden Huss, and Ethel Leginska. In 1919 she founded her own teaching studio near Carnegie Hall. Beebe declared radio \\"valuable to art\\" in an 1922 interview. \\"The radio audience in no different than the concert, opera, or vaudeville audience.

They are a low-income country with 41.3% of their population living under the poverty line in 2019. Additionally, Mali is a landlocked country whose economy is vulnerable to changes in climate. Thus, Mali has relationships with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), International Development Association (IDA), International Finance Corporations (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). In 2019, the IBRD and IDA committed to lending 500 million US dollars to projects in Mali, a large jump from 2018, where only US$178 million was lent. The bank group is currently involved in 30 projects in the region.These projects focused on areas such as mining, cotton, climate change, good governance, and health. Since 2013, the World Bank Group has worked alongside their UN mission counterpart, MINUSMA (U.N. Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali) to create stability and growth in the region. The current World Bank Country Director for Mali is Soukeyna Kane.  Resource Projects  Gold Mine in Mali  Mining Projects  Since the late 1990s, Mali’s economy has mainly been focused on gold mining. Consequently, since this time the World Bank has funded projects to increase foreign investors in this sector.The IDA has funded structural and good governance projects for the mines, including a recent US$40 million in June 2019. The IFC is invested in the Sadiola mine as a shareholder. Given the World Banks involvement, the mine is required to follow certain IFC guidelines. In terms of the environmental impacts of mines, the World Bank provides required norms be followed. However they are self tested and reported by companies. Cotton Harvesting  Cotton Projects  Before the late 1990s, Cotton was the main industry of Mali under the Mali Company for Textile Development. It was majority owned by the Malian Government and had “guaranteed prices of 210 FCFA/kg.\\" The World Bank wanted to privatize the industry under 3-4 companies.However, Mali paused discussions until 2008. In the early 2000s, the World Bank used the withholding of US$25 million to influence cotton privatization. Additionally, World Bank environmental requirements related to fertilizers and pesticides in cotton agriculture have harmed farmers.  Environmental Projects  Sahel forest near Kayes Mali Environmental regulations are often instituted as a component in other projects — such as mining or cotton projects. However, there are many cases in which the World Bank has gotten involved directly in environmental projects — especially in the realm of deforestation and mitigation of climate change. Two Forestry Projects — one from 1979-1985 and one from 1986-1992 — were funded US$4.5 million and US$6.3 million respectively by the IDA and IBRD. These projects centered on decreasing deforestation through tax reforms, national forest reforms, and increasing fuel wood. From 1993-2001, the National Agricultural Research Project was formed to connect agriculture research and technology to local farmers to mitigate agricultural output with declining natural resources. US$20 million was committed to this project by the IDA and IBRD. In May 2019, the IBRD and IDA committed US$8.25 million for the Strengthening Climate Resilience Project to “improve...access to the country’s hydro-meteorological, early warning and emergency response services.”  Good Governance Projects  Outside of prioritization, the World Bank has been involved in a number of good governance projects. This includes the Government Action Pan, Mali Poverty Reduction Strategic Framework, and the First Recovery and Governance Reform Support Operation. In 2014, US$63 million was given to improve transparency, public sector spending, and accountability in the government.Additionally, in the same year, the World Bank pushed Mali’s government to fire the ministers of defense, finance and investment, who were all involved in a corruption scandal. In 2019, the World Bank supported decentralization and capacity efforts with the goal of facilitating “democratization and local participation in the management of public affairs in priority sectors such as health and education.” This was done through a US$50 million grant.  Voting Power  Mali is part of Cameroon's constituency. The constituency holds 3.74% of the total votes in MIGA, 4.26% of the total votes in the IDA, 1.33% of the total votes in the IFC, and 2.03% of the total votes in the IBRD.

After studying at the Gymnasium in Hagen, he joined the Prussian army as a cavalry lieutenant. Along with his parents, the family moved to the United States in 1864, and Lugger found work as an engineer in the army. While working on surveys around the Great Lakes, he also began to collect insect specimens and came to know C.V. Riley. When Riley became State Entomology of Missouri in 1868, Lugger became an assistant. He helped produce nine annual reports before 1875 when he married Lina Krokmann and moved to Baltimore to become curator of the collections of the Maryland Academy of Sciences. He became an assistant in the entomolgy division of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1885. He was appointed entomologist and botanist at the Minnesota Station in 1888 and later became a state entomologist, a position he held until his death from pneumonia.

He was chair of the Board of Music for 14 years. He retired in 2002 and was made an honorary research associate. He was conferred an honorary fellow of the University of Sydney on 13 May 2016. In 1974, Jack co-founded the cross department discipline of Historical Archaeology at the University of Sydney with Judy Birmingham and introduced the first undergraduate subject in that area. Although their course proposal was opposed by conservative members of the archaeology department, it was ultimately accepted and became the first course in historical archaeology in Australia. Subjects were taught by Birmingham and Jack, as well as geographer Dennis Jeans and historian Ken Cable. The course also had a significant fieldwork component to give student essential practical training.Jack, Ian 2006 \\"Historical Archaeology, Heritage and the University of Sydney\\", Australasian Historical Archaeology 24:19–24 This including digs at places like Hill End, home to the largest gold specimen ever found: the misname Holternmann's nugget, Jack had a long association with St Andrew’s College at the University of Sydney, being appointed Wilson Fellow in 1979, holding positions including Senior Tutor, Hunter Baillie Fellow in Oriental and Polynesian Languages, Senior Fellow, Woodhouse Fellowship, President of the Senior Common Room, College Archivist and Librarian.Citation Associate Professor Ian Jack, University of Sydney He also organised numerous musical events and regularly played the college organ. Jack was the longest- serving President of the Royal Australian Historical Society, from 2003–2011 and was elected a Fellow in 2004. He was a member of the NSW Heritage Council and joined the committee of the Blue Mountains Association of Cultural Heritage Organisations in 2006, as an inaugural member, later becoming vice- president, and president. He was also president of Hawkesbury Historical Society, and vice-president of The Friends of the Paragon. Jack has published extensively in the areas of heritage, local history and historical archaeology from Medieval Wales to the Hawkesbury and Nepean Valley.

Biography Grzegrzulka earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy and a master's degree in Polish. She joined the Socialist Party in 1979. She worked with Jack Lang at the Ministry of Culture from 1981 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1993. She was in charge of relations with parliamentarians. She was at Blois in 1989, where she was an assistant of social affairs and solidarity. Afterwards, she joined Daniel Vaillant in the 18th arrondissement of Paris. During the 1997 French legislative election, she ran for Aisne's 2nd constituency. She came first in the first round with 28.63% of the vote, ahead of outgoing deputy and chairman of the regional council Charles Baur at 27.84%. She was elected in the second round with 56.52% of the vote. She joined the Socialist Party in the National Assembly, and in January 1999 she published a report to Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, titled Propositions pour un renforcement de la sécurité sanitaire environnementale (Proposals for a Strengthening of Environmental Health Security). In the 1998 French cantonal elections, Grzegrzulka ran in the Canton of Saint-Quentin-Nord after Jacques Braconnier announced his retirement. She was beaten by deputy mayor of Saint-Quentin, Xavier Bertrand, who received 53% of the vote. In the 2002 French legislative election, Grzegrzulka ran against Bertrand in the second round after Bertram received 43.13% and she received 26.91% of the votes. She would lose the second round as well, allocating 43.04% of the votes, while Bertrand received 56.96%. Her term in Parliament ended on 18 June 2002. Grzegrzulka ran again in the 2007 French legislative election, but lost to Bertrand after only one round of votes. Bertrand received 53.28% of the vote, while Grzegrzulka received 22.81%. She returned to the Ministry of Culture after her defeat, and was then assigned to the Embassy of France in Moldova in 2009. Odette Grzegrzulka died on 30 November 2019.

In fact, the terms ‘multifactorial’ and ‘polygenic’ are used as synonyms and these terms are commonly used to describe the architecture of disease causing genetic component. Although multifactorial diseases are often found gathered in families yet, they do not show any distinct pattern of inheritance. It is difficult to study and treat multifactorial diseases because specific factors associated with these diseases have not yet been identified. Some common multifactorial disorders include schizophrenia, diabetes, asthma, depression, high blood pressure, Alzheimer’s, obesity, epilepsy, heart diseases, Hypothyroidism, club foot and even dandruff. The Multifactorial threshold model assumes that gene defects for multifactorial traits are usually distributed within populations. Firstly, different populations might have different thresholds. This is the case in which occurrences of a particular disease is different in males and females (e.g. Pyloric stenosis). The distribution of susceptibility is the same but threshold is different. Secondly, threshold may be same but the distributions of susceptibility may be different. It explains the underlying risks present in first degree relatives of affected individuals.  Characteristics  Multifactorial disorders exhibit a combination of distinct characteristics which are clearly differentiated from Mendelian inheritance. * The risk of multifactorial diseases may get increased due to environmental influences. * The disease is not sex-limited but it occurs more frequently in one gender than the other. * The disease occurs more commonly in a distinct ethnic group (i.e., Africans, Asians, Caucasians etc.) * The diseases may have more in common than generally recognized since similar risk factors are associated with multiple diseases * The recurrence risk of such disorders is greater among relatives of an affected individual than in the common population. Additionally, the risk is higher in first degree relatives of an affected individual than distant relatives. * Multifactorial disorders also reveal increased concordance for disease in monozygotic twins as compared to dizygotic twins or full siblings.  Risk Factors  The risk for multifactorial disorders is mainly determined by universal risk factors. Risk factors are divided into three categories; genetic, environmental and complex factors (for example overweight). Genetic risk factors are associated with the permanent changes in the base pair sequence of human genome. In the last decade, many studies have been generated data regarding genetic basis of multifactorial diseases. Various polymorphism have been shown to be associated with more than one disease, examples include polymorphisms in TNF-a, TGF-b and ACE genes. Environmental risk factors vary from events of life to medical interventions. The quick change in the patterns of morbidity, within one or two generations, clearly demonstrates the significance of environmental factors in the development and reduction of multifactorial disorders. Environmental risk factors include change in life style (diet, physical activity, stress management) and medical interventions (surgery, drugs). Many risk factors originate from the interactions between genetic and environmental factors and referred as complex risk factors. Examples include epigenetic changes, body weight and plasma cortisol level.  Multifactorial Disorders; Continuous or Discontinuous  Autosomal or sex-linked single gene conditions generally produce distinct phenotypes, said to be discontinuous: the individual either has the trait or does not. However, multifactorial traits may be discontinuous or continuous. Continuous traits exhibit normal distribution in population and display a gradient of phenotypes while discontinuous traits fall into discrete categories and are either present or absent in individuals. It is interesting to know that many disorders arising from discontinuous variation show complex phenotypes also resembling continuous variation This occurs due to the basis of continuous variation responsible for the increased susceptibility to a disease. According to this theory, a disease develops after a distinct liability threshold is reached and severity in the disease phenotype increases with the increased liability threshold. On the contrary, disease will not develop in the individual who does not reach the liability threshold. Therefore, an individual either having disease or not, the disease shows discontinuous variation. An example of how the liability threshold works can be seen in individuals with cleft lip and palate. Cleft lip and palate is a birth defect in which an infant is born with unfused lip and palate tissues. An individual with cleft lip and palate can have unaffected parents who do not seem to have a family history of the disorder.  History  Francis Galton was the first scientist who studied multifactorial diseases and was the cousin of Charles Darwin. Major focus of Galton was on ‘inheritance of traits’ and he observed “blending” characters. The average contribution of each several ancestor to the total heritage of the offspring and is now known as continuous variation. When a trait (human height) exhibiting continuous variation is plotted against a graph, the majority of population distribution is centered around the mean. Galton’s work is contrary to work done by Gregor Mendel; as the latter studied “nonblending” traits and kept them in different categories. The traits exhibiting discontinuous variation, occur in two or more distinct forms in a population as Mendel found in color of petals.

Only one player tested positive and no staff members. One player tested positive for the antibody test, indicating the player had it in the past, but no longer had it. On July 3, the team announced that another 11 players had tested positive and that they would be suspending in-person voluntary workouts. Kansas was scheduled to play New Hampshire, but the game was cancelled following the CAA’s decision to not play football during the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the cancellation, KU athletic director Jeff Long said in a statement that they will look into finding an opponent to replace New Hampshire in the opening of the schedule. On July 25, Kansas announced it had replaced the game with New Hampshire with a game on August 29 against Southern Illinois, but that game was later cancelled. On July 29, their game against Boston College was also canceled. On August 3, the Big 12 announced they would play a 10-game schedule that included all conference games and one non-conference game. On August 12, the Big 12 announced the conference portion of the revised schedule. On August 31, the school announced that they will begin the season without fans in attendance, but did not specify how many games will be played without fans. On September 24, Long announced a maximum of 10,000 fans would be allowed to attend through the month of October. On October 8, head coach Les Miles announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19. Because of his positive test, he will not coach the game against West Virginia.

Early life  Wrixon James Gasteen was born in Brisbane, Queensland in 1922. He grew up on farms around Thrushton, Queensland where his father used the mulga lands as feedstock. Gasteen educated himself in a number of subjects including land management, geology, botany, biology and wood-turning. The family farm completely regenerated over time and Gasteen petitioned the Queensland government to make it a national park. Gasteen's book Under the Mulga (2005) reflected his early life on the land.  Career  In the 1960s and 1970s Gasteen was involved in surveying and promoting National Parks proposals across Queensland. This was unpopular with many graziers and politicians. He worked to protect remnant patches of Central Queensland scrub but also surveyed land from the Gulf of Carpentaria in Queenland's north to the Scenic Rim on the Queensland/New South Wales border. His survey work or reports led to the establishment of Expedition National Park, Nuga Nuga National Park, New England National Park, Northern Rivers National Park and Border Ranges National Park.  Memberships and awards  * Appointed Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for \\"nature conservation and as an advocate of balanced land use management\\" in 1993. * Life member of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland. Gasteen also wrote They All Left Tracks (2003) and Back to the Bush (2011). Gasteen died in Lismore, New South Wales in August 2017 He was married and had four children. Ten boxes of Gasteen's notebooks, photographs and correspondence are held in the University of Queensland Fryer Library.

It is located in the former Security Central Bank Building, which was built in 1918 in the Beaux Arts style. It has been open as a museum since 1979. Permanent Exhibits The museum features two permanent exhibits, one devoted to the work of Portsmouth native, Clarence Holbrook Carter, known for his work in the American Scene style, and “Art of the Ancients,” which contains over 10,000 prehistoric Native American objects. Other Exhibition Spaces The remaining galleries at the museum are devoted to rotating exhibitions of contemporary Ohio and regional artists. Representative exhibitions include “The Cream of the Crop,” a biennial, juried exhibition with a thirty-year history, \\"Art 360\\" which presented a commissioned collection of artist-decorated ostrich eggs from the collection of Charles Bluestone as juxtaposed against the \\"egg series\\" of Clarence H. Carter, and \\"Waiting For Transcendence,\\" a solo exhibition by Columbus artist April Sunami. History The Southern Ohio Museum was built as the Security Savings Bank & Trust Company in 1918 by shoe manufacturer George D. Selby. In 1978, after the bank had moved to a new location, the company became the trustees of an artistic bequest from Dr. Russell Leiter (developer of the Leiter International Performance Scale). This inspired the company to donate its old building as a home for a new museum, with Leiter's bequest as its first permanent collection. The museum was initially funded by a $100,000 donation from Edmund J. Kricker, the chief executive officer at the First Federal Savings and Loan Association. Cultural Center The Cultural Center portion of the building includes a live performance theater, a reading room and art studios.

He is noted for inventing the Binishell, which is a reinforced thin concrete shell structure that can be lifted and shaped by air pressure. He is also considered a pioneer of automated building construction sequences or automated building construction systems.  Background  Bini was born in 1932 at Castelfranco Emilia, a commune in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. He was the son of Giovanni Bini and Maria Cavallini. Bini completed liberal studies in Bologna. He then attended the University of Florence and obtained a doctorate in Architecture in 1962. He became influenced by the works of Heinz Isler, Felix Candela, Frei Otto, and Buckminster Fuller. Bini married Adria Moretti in 1963. In 1981, he immigrated to the United States.  Career  After leaving the University of Florence, Bini became interested in thin-shell concrete domes. He later developed a shell system technology that gave him international recognition.  Binishell  By the 1960s, he started developing a system for inflating concrete domes after experimenting with inflated balloons as formwork. He was able to design a unique pneumatic formwork using a huge low-pressure balloon. This technique was patented in 1964. An example of the shell-structure Dante Bini built for a public works initiative by the Australian government. In July 1965, he was able to lift his first concrete shell near Bologna. It was a sphere with a 12-meter diameter. By the end of that year, Bini successfully built four such domes. During this period, Bini struggled with several problems, which included the uneven distribution of the wet concrete due to asymmetric inflation. By 1967, improvements were made and Bini demonstrated the prototype - a 12-meter dome constructed in a span of few hours - at the Columbia University in New York. This particular construction and those built afterward required helical “springs” reinforced with steel bars to ensure a geometrically controlled inflation, allowing for an even distribution of wet concrete. From 1970 to 1990, Bini constructed thousands of Binishells around the world, serving different purposes such as homes, schools, sports facilities, and industrial storage units. He stayed for six years in Australia after he was contracted to build Binishells for the Australian government. One of the most notable of these was the Space City Shopping Center in Queensland, which is the world's biggest structure composed of intersecting Binishells. Other Binishells constructed include the Cupola built for Michelangelo Antonioni and Monica Vitti as well as the Binishells built for the Fuji Pavilion during the 1970 Expo at Osaka. The Binishell technology is also considered a potential solution to housing problems for displaced people, refugees, and evacuees, particularly in areas consistently damaged by disasters. Bini has offered the technology royalty-free to governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that intend to build shelters for these people. The original Binishell has withstood recurring volcanic eruptions and earthquakes on Mount Etna.  Other works  After the Binishell, Bini started developing the so-called Binishelter automated construction method. It uses prefabricated structural components, which is a combination of eight structural or building materials (four for walls and four for roofs) such as wood, concrete, steel, reinforced clay, durock, sheetrock, concrete, bricks, and bamboo. Bini, together with architect David Dimitric, also designed Shimizu Corporation's Mega-City Pyramid project, a proposed vertical city over Tokyo Bay built by robots. This structure, which is intended to address urban congestion, is projected to accommodate from 250,000 to 750,000 people. Bini has also invented a movable, self-erecting tent for the U.S. Army. The architect has participated in initiatives advancing shell-concrete technology such the colloquium at the University of Stuttgart which focused on air and pneumatic structures.

It is situated above the north shore of Wedgemount Lake, northeast of Whistler, and its nearest higher peak is Mount Weart, to the southeast. The Armchair Glacier is set between Cook and Weart, and the Weart Glacier rests on the northern slope of Cook. Precipitation runoff from the peak and meltwater from the glaciers drains into Wedgemount Lake and Green River. The mountain was known as Miniweart and North Wedge before the Cook name was submitted June 1977 by mountaineers Neal Carter and Karl Ricker of the Alpine Club of Canada. The mountain's name was officially adopted March 9, 1979, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Cook is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Cook.

Life and work His father, Jan de Hoop, was a wood miller. His family wanted him to pursue a career in commerce, but he chose to go against their wishes and become an artist.Kramm, Christiaan, De levens en werken der Hollandsche en Vlaamsche kunstschilders, beeldhouwers, graveurs en bouwmeesters, van den vroegsten tot op onzen tijd, Part III His initial lessons came from Joost Zeeman (1776-1845), a local painter who specialized in still-lifes. He then became apprenticed to Cornelis Kruseman in Amsterdam. This was followed by advanced instruction at the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten. During his stay there, he won several awards. At first, he focused on still-lifes, but expanded into portraits and genre scenes, generally lit by candles or lamps; a style that was very popular for a time. Later, he taught Petrus Kiers, who would be considered the master of candlelight painting. He also made sketches of the February flood of 1825, many of which were made into prints. His oeuvre is relatively small, due to his early death at the age of thirty. His work may be seen at the Rijksmuseum, the Fries Museum and the Fries Scheepvaart Museum.

His name means \\"Agni-holder\\", \\"Agni\\" being the fire, for which the later god Agni is well known. The Mathura Museum describes his statue as \\"Agnipani Yaksha\\",Mathura Museum notice but Sonya Rhie Quintanilla simply identifies the statue as that of the Vedic God Agni. A Yaksha Yakshas seem to have been the object of an important cult in the early periods of Indian history, many of them being known such as Kubera, king of the Yakshas, Manibhadra or Mudgarpani. The Yakshas are a broad class of nature-spirits, usually benevolent, but sometimes mischievous or capricious, connected with water, fertility, trees, the forest, treasure and wilderness, and were the object of popular worship. Many of them were later incorporated into Buddhism, Jainism or Hinduism. Sculptures Some of the earliest works of art of the Mathura school of art are the Yakshas, monumental sculptures of earth divinities that have been dated to the 2nd-1st century BCE. Yakshas became the focus of the creation of colossal cultic images, typically around 2 meters or more in height, which are considered as probably the first Indian anthropomorphic productions in stone. Although few ancient Yaksha statues remain in good condition, the vigor of the style has been applauded, and expresses essentially Indian qualities. They are often pot- bellied, two-armed and fierce-looking. The Yashas are often depicted with weapons or attributes, such as the Yaksha Mudgarpani. Agnipani (\\"Fire- holder\\") Yaksha from Bharana Kalan A statue of Agnipani (\\"Fire-holder\\") Yaksha from Bharana Kalan, visible in the Mathura Museum, is dated to circa 100 BCE. It was discovered in Bharana Kalan, 32 kilometers northwest of Mathura. In the statue, Agni has a flame-shaped \\"aureole\\" with incised tongues of flames behind his turbanned head, and he hold a water flask in the left hand, some fragments of which remain.Dated 100 BCE in Fig. 86-87, page 365-368 in His right hand may have been held out in \\"Abhaya mudra\\", as also seen in other statues of Agni. The inscription in Brahmi script on the base of the statue is in very bad condition, but has been partly deciphered. Some parallels with the contemporary Mudgarpani statue, probably manufactured and dedicated by the same person, also helped interpretation: Style A later relief from the 1st century CE, showing Agni (right) with water pot and left hand in Abhaya mudra. He appears with his son Skanda (Karttikeya) on the left. It is often suggested that the style of the colossal Yaksha statuary had an important influence on the creation of later divine images and human figures in India.\\"The folk art typifies an older plastic tradition in clay and wood which was now put in stone, as seen in the massive Yaksha statuary which are also of exceptional value as models of subsequent divine images and human figures.\\" in The female equivalent of the Yashas were the Yashinis, often associated with trees and children, and whose voluptuous figures became omnipresent in Indian art. A relief is also known from the Mathura Museum, which shown the Mudgarpani with the same attributes.Fig. 85 in Some Hellenistic influence, such as the geometrical folds of the drapery or the walking stance of the statues, has been suggested. According to John Boardman, the hem of the dress in the monumental early Yaksha statues is derived from Greek art. Describing the drapery of one of these statues, John Boardman writes: \\"It has no local antecedents and looks most like a Greek Late Archaic mannerism\\", and suggests it is possibly derived from the Hellenistic art of nearby Bactria where this design is known. Under the Indo-Greeks, the cult of the Yakshas may also have been associated with the Bacchic cult of Dionysos.\\"We have no way of knowing whether there was any direct association between the cult of the Yashas and Dionysos during the Indo-Greek era, but this is a distinct possibility\\" in In the production of colossal Yaksha statues carved in the round, which can be found in several locations in northern India, the art of Mathura is considered as the most advanced in quality and quantity during this period.\\"With respect to large-scale iconic statuary carved in the round (...) the region of Mathura not only rivaled other areas but surpassed them in overall quality and quantity throughout the second and early first century BCE.\\" in Exemples File:Agnipani aureole, rear view.jpgAureole with tongues of flames (back view) File:Agni - Kushan Period - ACCN 40-2880 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-23 5714.JPGA Kushan Empire-era Agni statue References Category:Yakshas Category:Mathura art ","title":"Agnipani"},{"id":"62497244","text":"Port of Meeruse (port code EE MRS,Meeruse Sadam ) is a seaport situated on the southwestern coast of Kopli, Tallinn, Estonia, located in eastern area of Kopli Bay.

She served as Chairperson of the Council of Entrepreneurs under the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine from June 11, 2008 to May 17, 2010. During Oksana Prodan's leadership, the mechanism of formation of the Council was changed. The Council began including not only representatives of Ukrainian associations but also representatives of public councils under central executive authorities and regional councils of entrepreneurs. During this period, the Council focused its activity on deregulation issues, creating conditions for entrepreneurship, promoting the development of small and medium-sized businesses. In 2010, following the appointment of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov, the Cabinet of Ministers canceled the election of the Chairperson of the Council of Entrepreneurs under the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine establishing the administrative procedure for appointing the Chairman and members of the Council relieving Oksana Prodan of her duties. She was Chairwoman of the Committee for the Protection of Entrepreneurs under the Opposition Government from May 27, 2010 to December 2011.

In 2014 Prodan was re-elected deputy in the pre-term parliamentary elections. Following the signing of the political agreement between the UDAR and Solidarity parties, Oksana Prodan ran for parliament as the candidate of Petro Poroshenko Bloc (No. 15 in the list). In the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, she headed the deputy group “UDAR”, which included 33 deputies of Ukraine of the 7th convocation. Since 2015, Oksana Prodan has been the representative of the Chairperson of the Association of Ukrainian Cities Vitaly Klitschko in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.

She participated in the competition for the position of Head of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine. Despite the support of Prodan's candidacy by a considerable number of experts and public figures, Roman Nasirov was elected Head of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine. The organization of the competition provoked many complaints, and Oksana Prodan herself accused Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk of unwillingness to change the existing corruption and punitive model of the SFS. During her work in the 8th convocation of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, Prodan initiated 144 bills, 29 laws were adopted. In addition, she introduced 1,776 amendments to 115 bills, prepared 57 requests and more than 1,800 appeals. The public association OPORA added Oksana Prodan to the list of five most efficient MPs by the number of bills passed [13].

Broadcasting on 990 kHz, the station was branded as \\"La Fabulosa\\", and served the Cuban community in Miami. It operated from 1962 to 1977, after which its license was revoked by the Federal Communications Commission for billing improprieties. History Before going on air Louis G. Jacobs obtained the construction permit for a new 5,000-watt radio station to serve Miami and South Miami in 1958, selecting the call letters WFAB for the new station. In 1959, the construction permit was sold to WFAB, Inc., in a sale of 60 percent of the station from Louis G. Jacobs to Harold King. Both parties sold the station for $40,000 to United Broadcasting of Eastern Virginia, Inc., the next year. While the new station's transmitter was under construction at 7500 SW 107th Avenue in South Miami, vandals stole of coaxial cable from the site. On the air WFAB signed on after years of delays on February 15, 1962, carrying programming for the African American community during the day and Spanish-language fare in the evenings. However, WFAB's Spanish-language programming came to dominate the station's identity. Within months of signing on, it struck a pact with WCKT-TV to air a Spanish simulcast of WCKT's 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts. As Miami's Cuban population boomed, ratings for WFAB and WQBA (1140 AM) rose: WFAB was third in the market in 1970 and WQBA fifth, putting two Spanish-language stations in the top 5. In 1971, newsman Óscar Angulo was arrested by the United States Coast Guard along with three other exiles for planning a commando raid on Cuba. The station maintained an extensive news service, including two mobile units, because, in the words of news editor Tomás Regalado, \\"Cubans have so many rallies and pickets that we need on-the-scene reporting.\\" WFAB rallied the Hispanic community in Miami to aid Nicaragua after the country was damaged by a major earthquake in 1972, with the station presenting the consul general of the country a $75,000 check garnered from donations to the station by listeners. In 1973, Regalado recorded and aired a 20-minute phone conversation with the mother of dead dissident Pedro Luis Boitel, unusual because foreign telephone calls out of Cuba were closely monitored. By 1975, the station aired a four-hour morning newscast. License renewal fight and closure Even as WFAB demonstrated its ability to rally the Hispanic community in Miami, an existential threat formed at the Federal Communications Commission, one that hung over the entire United Broadcasting Company group, controlled by Richard Eaton. At the start of 1973, the FCC ordered that WFAB, which had filed its license renewal application, join seven other United stations in comparative hearing for fraudulent billing practices. The FCC review board then expanded the scope of the hearing at the petition of United Broadcasting Company of Florida that the station's public service record be considered. In May 1974, FCC administrative law judge Byron Harrison handed down his initial decision denying the license renewal application. Harrison held WFAB responsible for the record-keeping failures that allowed Miami appliance dealer Crown Trading Company to double- and triple-bill its suppliers for advertising reimbursements, using doctored WFAB letterhead, which continued even after a November 1970 management changeover. It was not the only high-profile incident that month: on May 16, a dispute between rival factions over station control, stemming from its coverage of the April funeral of exile leader José Elías de la Torriente, spiraled out of control and prompted the station manager to call police. Local politicians pressured the station to rehire Tomás García Fusté, the news director who was forced out. In October 1975, the FCC upheld the judge's ruling, noting that the inexperienced local management had supplied blank WFAB letterhead to Crown in support of its misrepresentations and notarized incomplete documents. The FCC allowed WFAB to remain on the air to wind up its affairs until December 17, 1975. Earlier in the year, \\"La Fabulosa\\" had retooled its format in order to draw a younger audience, airing more music and consolidating its news into two daily bulletins at noon and 5 p.m. United attempted an appeal; in the meantime, in January 1976, Eaton fired the entire 25-man air staff of WFAB and suspended normal programming. The Cuban employees claimed they were fired for insubordination; Eaton cited the need to improve falling ratings. Among the members of the new air staff was Fusté, who had been fired two years earlier. Regalado returned to La Fabulosa in October 1976 as its news director. The FCC denied United's efforts for a reprieve in November 1976, stating that it could not bring up new issues that could have been discussed previously in the proceeding. A further blow to United came the next month, when the employees it had fired at the start of the year won a $60,000 settlement at the National Labor Relations Board. WFAB was ordered by the commission to cease operations on the 22nd of the month; Congressman Claude Pepper introduced a bill to give United more time to respond to the FCC. The station ceased operating on February 21, 1977, at 12:01 a.m., after playing the Cuban and American national anthems. On February 20, its final day of broadcasting, some 6,000 people visited the station to sign a petition asking the FCC to reconsider; the station broadcast the opinions of listeners who called the closure an attack on the anti-Communist editorial stance of the station; and Latin-owned stores in Homestead closed their doors for an hour in protest. The license was canceled and call letters deleted on February 23. The effects of the closure continued to ripple for some time after. In March, 10 leaders appeared before a House subcommittee on behalf of Pepper's bill, which was soon tabled. The next month, United Broadcasting Company sued its lawyers, the law firm of Smith and Pepper, for $50 million, alleging that the firm mishandled the WFAB renewal fight and failed to file a timely appeal. Hearings for a successor With WFAB deleted, the FCC received eight applications to build a new station at 990 kHz in Miami, from The New Continental Broadcasting Company, Central Broadcasting, Dadeland Broadcasting Company, Women's Florida Association of Broadcasters, Latin American Broadcasters, Community Broadcasters, Dade Communications and Radio America Broadcasting, which went into comparative hearing. In an initial decision in 1979, The New Continental—owned by Emilio Milián, a WQBA reporter who had lost his legs in a 1976 bomb attack—was given the nod; however, the FCC review board ruled in favor of Radio America the next year. In 1983, the FCC remanded the case after it was discovered that Radio America may have misrepresented its financial qualifications. As a result of a settlement, RAB's application was dismissed, leaving three remaining contenders for the frequency; citing its higher percentage of female and minority principals than The New Continental, the FCC selected the application of Community Broadcasters, Inc., owned by María Teresa Saldise, Carrie Meek and María Elena Prío de Durán. The new station was granted its construction permit in 1988 and signed on in 1997 as WFBA, now WMYM.

It is located one block west of the National Parliament of East Timor, and faces Rua de Moçambique (formerly Rua Dom Fernando). Today, it houses the Faculty of Education, Arts and Humanities of the National University of East Timor. History The school building was constructed between 1922 and 1924, and was originally occupied by the Dili Municipal School (Escola Municipal de Díli). By governmental decree of 22 January 1938, a new high school was founded to provide indigenous Timorese with sufficient education to allow them to enter the lower level of the public administration. It was installed in the school building, and named after , the Portuguese Minister for the Colonies (1936–1944) who was responsible for its foundation. However, high school education could not be established at that time, because of the upheavals associated with World War II, during which Japanese forces invaded Timor, and the school building was one of the many buildings destroyed in the conflict. In 1952, after the restoration of the building, the school opened its doors to its first High School pupils. In 1955 and 1956, the building was expanded according to a 1953 design by Eurico Pinto Lopes. Upon the opening of the High School, secondary education became available to the local population for the first time. However, the school was available primarily to Mestiço, despite a legal prohibition of discrimination. Attendees of the high school included the later freedom fighter and first Prime Minister of East Timor, Nicolau dos Reis Lobato, and the later Minister of Social Solidarity, Maria Domingas Alves. In 1961, the school building was enlarged on the basis of plans were drawn up by Eurico Pinto Lopes and António Sousa Mendes. However, those plans were not fully implemented, as only the wing facing the Avenida Cidade de Lisboa (now Rua Formosa) and a new elementary school were built. After the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, the building was no longer used for teaching purposes until 1979, when it started to house the Public School of Middle Education (in indonesian: Sekolah Pendidikan Guru Negeri; SPGN).Guterres, Guilherme Bonifácio.

The school that operated in the Liceu Dr. Francisco Machado building was transferred to the Becora neighborhood, in the city of Dili, in 1986, and is currently called 28 de Novembro Public Secondary School. During the 1999 East Timorese crisis, the building was destroyed by Aitarak, one of the pro-Indonesian militias. In 2001, the Council of the City of Lisbon financed its reconstruction. The building's exterior was rebuilt along the lines of the original design, but its interior was substantially modernised to house the Faculty of Education, Arts and Humanities of the National University of East Timor. , the Faculty was still located in the building.

Yoga tourism is travel with the specific purpose of experiencing some form of yoga, whether spiritual or postural. The former is a type of spiritual tourism; the latter is related both to spiritual and to wellness tourism. Yoga tourists often visit ashrams in India to study yoga or to be trained and certified as yoga teachers. Major centres for yoga tourism include Rishikesh and Mysore. While India is the birthplace of yoga and a major yoga tourism destination, yoga retreats and holidays are provided in many countries, varying from simple stays in guesthouses and ashrams to 5-star comfort in luxury resorts. Venues A yoga holiday in Fiji Yoga tourism is not necessarily to an ashram (a Hindu monastery), nor necessarily to India, though as the birthplace of yoga it is the activity's locus classicus. Ashrams offering yoga exist, for example, in Canada. Other possible types of venue describe themselves as \\"holistic centres\\" and \\"yoga holidays\\", including holidays at \\"a 5-star resort with a celebrity Yoga Teacher\\". Yoga holidays are provided in countries including Greece, Sri Lanka, Japan, Thailand, Scotland, France, Morocco, England, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the Maldives and Wales. Yoga retreats can be found in many countries, including for instance Costa Rica and Italy. Hotels and guesthouses around the world similarly offer yoga holidays in countries such as Bulgaria and Turkey; \\"pastoral yoga\\" can be found in countries including France. India India has become a major destination for yoga tourism, especially since the English rock band the Beatles travelled to Rishikesh in 1968 to take part in a Transcendental Meditation training course at Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram. The visit sparked widespread Western interest in Indian spirituality, and has led many Westerners to travel to India hoping to find \\"authentic\\" yoga in ashrams in places such as Mysore (for Ashtanga Yoga) and Rishikesh. That movement led in turn to the creation of many yoga schools offering teacher training and promotion of India as a \\"yoga tourism hub\\" by the Indian Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of AYUSH. Reception Youthful Westerners' sometimes naive spiritual quests to India, and the many varieties of ashram and yoga on offer to them, are gently satirised in the Mindful Yoga instructor Anne Cushman's novel Enlightenment for Idiots. Elizabeth Gilbert's 2006 memoir Eat, Pray, Love, now also a romantic Hollywood film, describes her experiences in an Indian ashram on her journey of self- discovery. Gilbert is thought to have stayed in the Siddha Yoga ashram Gurudev Siddha Peeth in Maharashtra; the film's \\"Pray\\" section was set in Ashram Hari Mandir at Pataudi, near Delhi.

In 1951, the World Bank approved an Agriculture project in Paraguay marking the beginning of a partnership that persists to this day and has given rise to 76 development projects of which 6 are currently active. Paraguay has received $2,718,521,989 in total commitments from the World Bank. Paraguay saw an annual growth rate of 4.5% per year until 2016 making it one of the fastest growing economies among regional neighbors.The implementation of steady and dependable macroeconomic policies have fostered a friendly environment for investors that largely contribute to Paraguay's consistent economic growth, however much of Paraguay's economic development has resulted from the replacement of forests with agriculture operations. As forests become increasingly scarce and climate change disrupts agricultural output, Paraguay will be forced to adapt its economy and society to meet a number of targets including strengthening the rule of law, achieving sustainability in regards to its natural resources, investing in human capital, and improving government services. To achieve these goals, Paraguay is collaborating with the World Bank including strategic partnerships with IBRD, and IFC. Jordan Schwartz is the World Bank director for Paraguay and Matilde Bordón is the World Bank representative.  Economy  According to World Bank Data, Paraguay has a $40.842 billion GDP and a population of 6,956,071. Poverty has been steadily decreasing from 57.7% of Paraguayans living below the national poverty line in 2002 to only 26.4% in 2017. The GNI per capita in Paraguay is roughly $5,680 as of 2018 and the GDP per capita is roughly $11,790. Paraguay has a score of 0.53 on the Human Capital Index which allows a range of scores from 0 to 1. Annual GDP growth is projected to increase from 3.3% in 2019 to 4% in 2020. Agriculture is the largest contributor to Paraguay's GDP at 17.7% and 26.5% of Paraguay's labor force works in agriculture. Other important economic sectors of Paraguay include electricity and mining.Paraguay's banking industry is still recovering from a liquidity crisis in 1995 which saw the shutdown of several important banks following news of financial malpractice and money laundering. An IMF bailout aided in the recovery and reform of Paraguay's financial sector but Paraguay still struggles to find willing creditors.  Energy Exporter/ Itaipú Dam  Itaipu Dam Paraguay is one of the largest energy exporters in the world, and the World Bank places an emphasis on the realization and optimization of Paraguay's energy sector in order to boost its economy. Almost all of Paraguay's energy is produced at the massive Itaipú hydroelectric dam which lies on the Paraná river bordering Brazil and Paraguay. Though Paraguay could not contribute financially to the construction of the dam, it was able to contribute by conceding ownership of the construction site to Brazil and agreeing to export energy to Brazil at a discounted rate. Paraguay's economy was completely revitalized by the project and thousands of jobs were created. Construction spanned nine years from 1973 to 1982 and during this period the Gross Domestic Product of Paraguay grew at a rate of 8% annually and Brazil's appetite for Paraguayan energy provided the necessary stimulus for Paraguay to rapidly develop its agriculture sector.  Strategic Partnerships   IBRD  The World Bank logo. The World Bank is the umbrella organization containing both the IFC and IBRD. Paraguay is a middle income developing country. As such, it is not eligible to receive loans from the IDA but can draw funds from the IBRD. Paraguay has collaborated with the IBRD on a total of 58 projects in 10 sectors including agriculture, health, education, and central governance. In 2017, the IBRD approved $100 million in loans to Paraguay and one additional project. The IBRD has committed $315 million to Paraguay in 2019 of which $93.51 million has been disbursed as of July 31 2019. A total of $1,877,481,989.20 has been committed to Paraguay by the IBRD. Paraguay holds 0.10% of IBRD votes.  IFC  The International Finance Corporation (IFC) works with private sector in developing nations. Paraguay is currently working with the IFC on 22 investment projects with total board approval amounts of $1,877,481,989.20. The IFC is working with Paraguay on 3 advisory projects with a total budget of $2,833,285.00. The IFC is currently working with Paraguayan cattle farms to increase both profit and sustainability. Paraguay is one of the top 10 largest exporters of beef in the world. Much of its beef production occurs in the Chaco region of Paraguay which has lost 250,000 hectares of bio diverse forest per year. IFC intervention is expected to increase productivity from 140 to 250 kilograms of beef per hectare while preserving 50% of the regions native forests. Greenhouse gasses are expected to fall by 23% and the IFC is investing in energy and water efficient meat processing plants.  Projects   PRODERS  The Sustainable Agriculture Agriculture and Rural development Project (PRODERS) is a $116 million dollar project by the IBRD. It was approved in 2013 and has helped 24,875 households increase their agriculture output and profitability in rural regions of the country by providing technical assistance and connecting them to markets and value chainswhile also ensuring long term sustainability and environmental preservation. There will be an estimated total of 256,000 beneficiaries experiencing improved living conditions because of the project.  Water Sanitation Sector Modernization Project  The Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization project was improved in 2009 and has improved water access to 10% of the population in Asuncion. Key water sanitation and sewage facilities throughout the city were upgraded and modernized as well as 16 rural sewage networks for indigenous populations. Over 33km of pipes were installed in total reducing the spread of disease and improving living conditions for thousands of Paraguayans.  Paraguay Health Sector Strengthening Project  The Paraguay Health Sector strengthening project has received a commitment of $115 million by the IBRD and is a project aimed at tackling a multitude of healthcare related goals in Paraguay. Firstly, it aims to strengthen Primary Care micro-networks by creating a centralized system for them to report performance through. The goal of the project is for 152 new family health care centers to be integrated into a new system so that a total of 225 are operating at a more efficient and improved national standardThe project also aims to increase those covered by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare with access to primary care from 32% to 40%. These Family Health Care Centers will also be improving their services and expanding them so that more women receive prenatal checkups, more hypertension patients are correctly diagnosed, and the amount of TB cases diagnosed can increase from 78% to 88%. These goals will be met through the use of investments by the IBRD to build new care centers, train more staff, revise practice guidelines, increase patient registration in the new centralized database to 70%, and the implementation of a system to control the stock of certain medicines within the country.  Controversy   Minerva Foods  Clearings for cattle grazing in the Chaco region of Paraguay In 2013 The World Banks private lending institution (IFC) approved a loan of $85 million to Brazilian beef company Minerva in an attempt to boost economic growth in the Chaco region of Paraguay. The loan was supposed to create employment opportunities and bring a much needed investment stream to the region, however investigative journalists from Reporter Brasil found evidence that the company was exploiting indigenous workers, including children, and clearing bio diverse forests to make way for cattle production. The loan was classified by the IFC as carrying \\"significant potential\\" for destructive environmental and social effects but was approved nonetheless. One condition of the loan was the inclusion of an \\"Environmental and Social Action Plan\\" which included a supply chain verification system to ensure that only ethical suppliers were being used. One element of that supply chain verification system required Minerva submit a map to the IFC outlining suppliers most likely to exploit slave and child labor, however no such map was ever submitted to the IFC nor were other actions undertaken to meet the conditions of the Environmental and Social Action Plan. Labor Unions in Paraguay that oppose the loan argue that without stringent safeguards, the program was certain to cause negative environmental and social implications from the start. The Chaco region is roughly the size of the United Kingdom and lacks the resources to enforce labor laws and carry out cattle farm inspections. Yacyretá Dam  Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project  The Yacyretá Dam is a dam and hydroelectric power plant located between Argentina and Paraguay on the Paraná river. The project received a total of $766 million from the World Bank between 1979 and 1992 while initially being projected to cost around $2.6 billion.This estimate proved to be incorrect as the project has ended accumulating a price tag of over $12 billion to date and still does not operate at maximum capacity. This drastically increased project cost is attributed to a corruption scandal. During the construction of the project, engineering and construction companies and politicians siphoned off billions of dollars meant for the construction of the dam. Further sources of controversy include allegations that the World Bank violated its own environmental and supervision policies, accusations that were confirmed when the World Bank Inspection Panel visited the project and submitted a report outlining the policies that were violated. This did not stop the loans from being processed and in 1994, the floodgates of the dam were closed. The resulting flooding displaced 40,000 people and ravaged local infrastructure. Two species of aquatic snail are now extinct and pampas deer, capybara, certain water birds, and yacare cayman all suffered catastrophic population declines. There was also a large decline in the volume of certain species of fish in the Paraná river such as the Surubí. In 1997, World Bank Management issued a letter to the Paraguayan press claiming that it did not violate its policies on resettlement, environmental impacts, and community participation.

In the first period, the County of Loon led by claimant Diederik of Heinsberg managed to maintain its autonomy in relation to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. During the second period, however, Arnold of Rummen, the last indigenous claimant to the title of count of Loon, first had to sell the County of Chiny to the Duchy of Luxemburg to cover his military expenses, and soon after conceded defeat. The wars came to an end with the annexation of Loon by Liège in 1366. Since there was a time of peace between 1346 and 1361, it is common to refer to the Wars of the Loon Succession in plural, as it is to call it the War of the Loon Succession in singular with two 'periods', 'acts' or 'phases'.  First period (1336–1346)   Escalation  Diederik of Heinsberg, the son of Louis' sister, claimed the title of Count of Loon, and had himself proclaimed the heir with the assistance of John III, Duke of Brabant.Encarta- encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993-2002) s.v. Loon [geschiedenis]. Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. Even before his death, Louis had in fact designated Diederik as his successor. However, the chapter of Saint Lambert's Cathedral in Liège, of which Loon was a fief, refused to appoint him. The chapter invoked a decision made at the Diet of Frankfurt of 13 August 1246, which stipulated that all ecclesiastical fiefs should return into the Catholic Church's possession if the vassal died without children. Moreover, the chapter argued, because Loon was a so-called swordfief, meaning women cannot inherit the fief according to the old German customary law, Diederik could not gain his uncle's inheritance via his mother. The chapter allotted 40,000 guilders for the conquest of Loon, and requested and received the support of the Pope in Avignon, Benedict XII. The Liégeois cities supported the chapter's demand, but the Liégeois nobility preferred a different hereditary custom, in which sisters and sons are allowed to inherit fiefdoms. The prince-bishop of Liège himself, Adolph of the Mark, was a brother-in-law of Diederik, and initially did not want a conflict with his own family, and distanced himself from the demands of his chapter.  Diederik versus Adolph  While the Pope was putting the prince-bishop under pressure to claim Loon by military force in the name of the Church, Diederik was appointed as the count of Loon by Emperor Louis the Bavarian on 12 April 1336. Although Adolph occupied Kolmont (near Tongeren), this was more of a symbolic act than a strategic move, and on 13 August 1337 he received a new papal reminder to annex Loon in its entirety. As soon as Diederik heard the demand to surrender his county to the Church of Liège, he deliberately turned towards Liège's arch enemy, the Duchy of Brabant, on 19 December 1337. He concluded a military alliance with duke John III, agreeing to support each other if either of them was attacked, especially by Liège. Thus, Diederik became the de facto count, while he placed himself under the aegis of the duke of Brabant and the emperor; in Chiny he was the undisputed ruler. Godfrey of Loon-Heinsberg, Diederik's only son, died in battle in 1342, rendering his succession uncertain.  Second period (1361–1366)   Arnold and Godfrey versus Engelbert  Post-war situation (1477) When Diederik died in January 1361, his succession was challenged by Arnold of Rummen and Godfrey of Dalenbroek (both cousins of Diederik) on the one hand, and prince-bishop Engelbert III on the other, who once again tried to annex Loon. The prince-bishop proclaimed the attachment of Loon to Liège, and had his troops occupy the county. Godfrey gave up the fight in 1362, and sold his rights to Loon and Chiny to Arnold. The latter managed to rally the assistance of duke Wenceslaus of Brabant and Luxembourg (whom he was already serving as an advisor) and his half-brother, emperor Charles IV; moreover, his wife Elisabeth was rich. The Liégeois army could not maintain its position and was forced to withdraw.  Arnold versus John of Arkel  However, Arnold's odds were turning: duchess Joanna of Brabant abandoned him in 1363 by retracting her support for Loon. The next year, Engelbert III became archbishop of Cologne; John of Arkel, the bishop of Utrecht, replaced him as prince-bishop of Liège. That same year, John of Arkel invaded Loon anew; the ongoing war forced Arnold to sell Chiny to Wenceslaus, who merged it into the Duchy of Luxemburg. In 1365, Arnold and Elisabeth's family fortress \\"De Warande\\" at Rummen (near Geetbets) was besieged for nine weeks from 9 August until 21 September by the prince-bishop, who conquered it and razed it to the ground. Incidentally, the defenders reportedly used gunpowder and small blunderbusses for the first time in this region. The next year, 1366, the County of Loon definitively lost its autonomy and was annexed by the Prince- Bishopric of Liège.

As of March, 2020 the Bill is being analyzed by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) in consultation with experts and stakeholders. The JPC, which was let up in December, 2019, is headed by BJP Member of Parliament (MP) Meenakshi Lekhi. While the JPC was tasked with a short deadline to finalize the draft law before the Budget Session of 2020, it has sought more time to study the Bill and consult stakeholders. The JPC report is expected to be submitted by the second week of the upcoming Monsoon Session of the Indian Parliament.https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/jpc- wants-more-time-to-submit-data-bill-note/articleshow/74800912.cms?from=mdr https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1601695 The Bill covers mechanisms for protection of personal data and proposes the setting up of a Data Protection Authority of India for the same. Some key provisions the 2019 Bill provides for which the 2018 draft Bill did not, such as that the central government can exempt any government agency from the Bill and the Right to Be Forgotten, have been included. Forbes India reports that \\"there are concerns that the Bill [...] gives the government blanket powers to access citizens' data.\\"  Background  In July 2017, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology set up a committee to study issues related to data protection. The committee was chaired by retired Supreme Court judge Justice B. N. Srikrishna. The committee submitted the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 in July 2018. After further deliberations the Bill was approved by the cabinet ministry of India on 4 December 2019 as the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 and tabled in the Lok Sabha on 11 December 2019.  Provisions  The Bill aims to:The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019  Criticism  The revised 2019 Bill was criticized by Justice B. N. Srikrishna, the drafter of the original Bill, as having the ability to turn India into an “Orwellian State\\". In an interview with Economic Times, Srikrishna said that, \\"The government can at any time access private data or government agency data on grounds of sovereignty or public order. This has dangerous implications.” This view is shared by a think tank in their comment number 3. Apar Gupta of Internet Freedom Foundation notes that \\"Privacy is mentioned just once in this voluminous document — 49 mentions of ‘security’ and 56 mentions of 'technology'\\" implying that the Bill doesn't do enough to protect an individual's privacy. Fresh criticism on the international level comes from an advisor to a group proposing an alternative text. A moderately critical summary is available from an India scholar working with an American co-author. The role of social media intermediaries is being regulated more tightly on several fronts. The Wikimedia Foundation is hoping that the PDP bill will prove the lesser evil compared with the Draft Information Technology [Intermediary Guidelines (Amendment) Rules] 2018.

Locations  Activity in Europe The company is active in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, UK, Italy, Malta, France, Spain, Turkey, United States, South Africa and India. Its German airport operations include Hamburg, Frankfurt/Main, Stuttgart, Cologne, Düsseldorf and Munich.  History   From the beginning to 2010  In 1998, the entry into aviation fuelling business led to the idea of purchasing Omnitank’s 50-percent interest in Omni Aircraft Service at Munich Airport. At that time, the company was offered for sale to Marquard & Bahls AG, Skytanking’s parent company. Skytanking was established as a separate division of Marquard & Bahls, Hamburg, in 2001. One year later, in 2002, Skytanking bought Merlin Fuels NV at the cargo airport in Ostend, Belgium, and positioned itself strategically in that region. In 2003, Skytanking started operations in Miami, United States, and was responsible for fuelling the two Star Alliance airlines United and Air Canada at Miami International Airport. Two years later, in 2005, the company acquired the Belgian Fuelling & Services Company, which handled half of the into-plane fuelling operations at Brussels International Airport. It also had an extensive portfolio of contracts to provide services for fuel companies at other European airports, including Athens International Airport, Luxembourg Airport and Liège Airport. Skytanking Zurich also launched into-plane operations in October 2005. In 2006, Skytanking Vienna started business activities in Austria. At the beginning of 2006, Skytanking and its partners Indian Oil and IndianOiltanking were granted a 20-year fuel facility concession for new Bangalore International Airport, India; the joint venture IndianOil Skytanking Limited launched its fuelling operations at Bangalore International Airport in 2008. By mid-2006, aviation fuelling had become Marquard & Bahls’ third-largest business area, with Skytanking operating at 14 European and American airports and employing about 320 people around the world. Tank-Fuel-Farm-and-Bowser-Truck In 2007, Skytanking and Stuttgart Airport signed a 30-year BOOT contract for the construction and operation of the new aviation fuel storage facility, which opened in 2009. The new Indianapolis International Airport, USA, opened in November 2008; Skytanking was awarded a contract for management and operation of the fuel storage and hydrant system. In 2009, besides starting its facility operations at Stuttgart Airport, Germany, Skytanking took over AirFuel, a joint venture between Air France and Kuwait Petroleum Aviation France that worked in into-plane fuelling at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, handling more than 1 million tons of jet fuel per year. The acquisition marked Skytanking’s market entry in France. In the same year, Skytanking purchased two aircraft-fuelling service companies in Italy, HUB Srl and PAR Srl, and provided aviation fuelling at five airports in this country: Milan Malpensa Airport, Milan Linate, Rome Fiumicino, Naples and Palermo airports, servicing over 200,000 aircraft per year. At that time, Skytanking’s overall network comprised 26 airports in Europe, the US and Asia, employing 508 people.  Since 2010  In 2010, Skytanking Calulo started aviation fuelling operations in Durban, South Africa, at the new King Shaka International Airport, including into-plane fuelling and the operation of the tank storage and hydrant system. Furthermore, Skytanking entered the into- plane fuelling market in the UK by acquiring 51% of shares in North Air Limited, a company that provided into-plane fuelling and jet fuel storage management services at 17 airports across the country. In 2012, Skytanking added jet-fuel storage and into-plane services at two more airports in France: Nice Cote d'Azur and Bordeaux Mèrignac.Skytanking Signs Contract for Aviation Fuelling Services at Nice and Bordeaux Airports. Retrieved August 2019. Later that same year, in November 2012, Skytanking began providing into-plane fuelling services at Frankfurt Airport – the 50th airport in Skytanking’s portfolio. Frankfurt, alongside the existing sites in Munich and Stuttgart, gave Skytanking a presence at three of Germany’s ten busiest airports by passenger volume; Frankfurt Airport was the third-largest airport in Europe, and the ninth-largest worldwide. In 2013, Skytanking USA added Austin- Bergstrom International Airport, Texas, to its network. Skytanking sold its subsidiary Skytanking USA with its 14 US sites to Aircraft Service International Group (ASIG) in 2014, and in return, took over ASIG’s business at Munich, Vienna, Linz and Klagenfurt airports to strengthen its network in Germany and Austria. Following this transaction, the company was operating at 40 airports in 11 countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. In addition, Skytanking started into-plane fuelling operations at Hamburg Airport, Germany, where its corporate HQ is located. Skytanking Tank Fuel Farm and Bowser Trucks In December, 2014, Skytanking completed the purchase of an 84-percent shareholding in Hydrant Refuelling System NV (HRS), which owned and operated the jet fuel storage and hydrant system at Brussels National Airport, Belgium. At the end of 2016, Skytanking and the Turkish company Ovenon founded the joint venture Skytanking Ovenon; it provided aircraft fuelling personnel to oil companies at 18 airports in Turkey including Istanbul, Ankara Esenboğa Airport and Antalya Airport. In March 2017, Skytanking was re-awarded the contract for aviation fuel storage and hydrant system management at Munich Airport, where it has operated the fuel facilities since 1999. One month later, in April 2017, Skytanking Limited, a joint venture between Skytanking and the Maltese company Attard Services Limited, started into-plane fuelling operations at Malta International Airport.Skytanking starts into-plane fuelling at Malta International Airport. Attard Services, Retrieved August 2019.The WorldNews (WN) Network: Skytanking Starts Into-Plane Fuelling at Malta International Airport. Retrieved August 2019. In October 2017, Skytanking completed the acquisition of the employees and assets of Sun Jet Services at Germany’s Frankfurt, Düsseldorf and Cologne airports. As Turkey is an emerging aviation hub, Skytanking Ovenon AS has taken over the aviation fuelling operations of Petrol Ofisi Vitol in Turkey in May 2018, offering into-plane fuelling and tank farm management services at 21 Turkish airports today. In April 2019, Skytanking added another country to its network with Barcelona El Prat Airport in Spain; Spain is the third largest aviation market in Europe. Barcelona is the first location where Skytanking operates, followed by Valencia in May 2019.

Reception The Guardian reviewer Lucy Mangan gave the series three out of five stars, describing it as an \\"improbable, action-packed romp for all your escapism needs.\\" She described Alex Rider as a teenage James Bond, praising the lead star Otto Farrant for bringing more to the role than was written into what she described as a \\"serviceable script.\\" She described the series as a blend of Jason Bourne and Spooks. NME Will Richards gave the series three out of five stars, describing it as a second-chance for the Alex Rider series following the failure of the 2006 Stormbreaker movie adaptation. Richards observed that the series avoided the clichéd James Bond gadgets for the first two episodes. Richards praised Farrant's performance as Alex Rider but opined that the series needed tinkering to identify its target audience. Richards also described co-star Brenock O'Connor's performance as Alex's best friend Tom Harris as charismatic. While praising Marli Siu's character Kyra as a worthy addition to the male-centric world of the series, he expressed disappointment that Vicky McClure and Stephen Dillane's characters were under- utilised. The Independent Ed Cumming awarded the series three out of five stars, describing it as \\"stylish but not sanitised, catching more of the books' momentum and bringing them up to speed with the 21st century.\\" He regarded Alex Rider as more faithful to the series than the 2006 Stormbreaker film. He also praised Farrant's version of Alex Rider as more plausible than Alex Pettyfer's version of the character, describing the \\"former as a teenage schoolboy with a footballer haircut but less of a male-model energy.\\" Cumming also praised the series for aiming at both young adults and adults, inclusion of modern communications technologies like smartphones and social media, and more diverse cast. The Spinoff reviewer Sam Brooks praised the TV series for capturing the spirit of the original novel series and appealing to both teenagers and adult fans who had grown up reading the novel series. Brooks also praised Farrant's performance as Alex Rider, opining that he nailed the soul of the teenage protagonist by capturing his strengths, moods, and fears. The Telegraph Anita Singh gave the series four out of five stars, describing it as \\"slick and stylish, bringing the stories up-to-date with smartphones and cybertechnology while sticking to the spirit of Boy’s Own adventures\\". She regarded it as far superior to the 2006 film and praised the series for its unique cinematography of London. Singh also positively compared it to the Bourne franchise and praised the series for being able to entertain adults and teenagers alike. Emmy Griffiths of Hello! magazine compared the television series favourably to the 2006 film, praising the show's pacing, worldbuilding, and family-oriented audience. She described the series as both a \\"coming-of- age tale\\" for Alex Rider with a police-procedural subplot focusing on MI6's efforts to track down Alex's uncle Ian's killer. Griffiths also praised Farrant, McClure, and O'Connor's performances.

At 385.3 m above sea level, the Jenzig is one of the highest mountains in the Saale Valley area and is located northeast of the city center. Due to its distinctive shape (\\"Jenzignase\\", German for \\"Jenzig nose\\") it is considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of Jena. On the summit stands the Jenzighaus, a restaurant with excellent views over the city. The Jenzig forms the southwestern end of a semicircular ridge, the Hufeisen (\\"Horseshoe\\"). This wooded plateau runs from the Jenzig eastwards, forming an arc as it continues further north and then back westwards, where the Alte Gleisberg along with the Kunitzburg forms the other end. In the interior of this \\"horseshoe\\" is a small side valley of the Saale valley, containing the villages of Kunitz and Laasan.  Formation  From its dome-shaped and elongated form, the mountain is evidently an eroded plateau formed by the action of the Saale river on the limestone of the area. This landscape is typical of the Middle Saale region.  Prehistoric fortifications  Based on archaeological discoveries, the Jenzig was a fortified hilltop settlement during the time of the Urnfield culture (about 1300 BC to 800 BC), offering protection to the surrounding population. It was examined between 1856 and 1891 by Friedrich Klopfleisch, who performed several excavations. In 1936, a hoard was discovered while quarrying, which can now be found in the prehistoric collection of the University of Jena. The nearly 3.5 kg complex consists of 28 bronze objects such as neck and arm rings, spirals, a bejeweled disc, two sickles, a knife, a hatchet and a spiral plate fibula. It testifies to the religious sacrificial practices of people in the late Bronze Age. Fortified prehistoric hill settlements contemporary to those found on the Jenzig are also known in the vicinity of the Alte Gleisberg near Bürgel, the Johannisberg near Lobeda and the Dohlenstein near Kahla. The first mention of the mountain as \\"montem genzege\\" appears in a document of Frederick Barbarossa from 1158. It also mentions the Gleisberg. From the 12th to 19th centuries, the slopes of the Jenzig were used as vineyards. In the 21st century, a group of hobby winemakers have revived the tradition of viticulture on the Jenzig. In 2018, a series of plastic models of prehistoric reptiles, the \\"Saurierpfad\\" (\\"Saurian Path\\") was installed along the walking path leading up to the Jenzig summit. This was inspired by the discovery of Triassic reptile fossils discovered at the base of the mountain.  Trivia  The Jenaer neofolk-group Forseti named their first album, released in 1999, after the Jenzig mountain. In March 2010, a camel born during a guest performance at the circus \\"Eros\\" in Jena, was named \\"Jenzig\\". The 2090-meter high Mount Jenzig in northern Victoria Land in Antarctica was named in 1988 by Klaus Duphorn (Kiel University) after the Jenzig. Jenzig-Verlag, a regional publishing house based in Golmsdorf (Saale-Holzland-Kreis) near Jena, took its name from the mountain.

She has served as the Secretary General of the European Green Party (EGP) since November 2014. She is also a member of the Executive Committee and National Council of the Catalan Greens, Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds (ICV).  First years and education  Mar Garcia was born in Sabadell, Spain. She has a bachelor's degree in Political Sciences from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. She also studied Public Administration at the ESADE Business School. Her native languages are Spanish and Catalan. She is also fluent in English.  Professional and political career  In order to finance her studies, she worked several part-time jobs throughout her university education. After graduating, her first professional experience was as a Junior Consultant in an international consultancy group specialized in health care. Following this experience, she worked at the City Council of Barcelona for 12 years. During the coalition government between Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya and ICV that lasted from 1999 to 2011 (without Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya from 2007) - she worked as an Advisor to the Deputy Mayor in charge of sustainability, the environment and urban services for five years (2002 – 2007). After that, she was the Chief of Cabinet of the Deputy Mayor for four years (2007 - 2011). While in the opposition she was an Environmental and Local Economic Development Advisor for three years (2011 – 2014). In June 2003 she began her involvement in politics by becoming a member of the Catalan Green Party (Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds) where she has held several different responsibilities: a member of the Political Commission of Barcelona, a member of the National Council, a member of the Executive Committee and a member of the International Relations Working Group. She is also member of the trade union Comissions Obreres. In November 2012 she was elected as an Executive Committee Member of the European Green Party at the 17th Council Meeting of the European Greens held in Athens. Throughout her mandate she was responsible for strategy planning for the Green family, for the party's Gender Network, and for capacity building and networking coordination among member parties. Two years later, in November 2014, Mar Garcia was elected as the Secretary General of the European Green Party at the 21st Council Meeting of the European Greens in Istanbul (2014), taking over from the previous Secretary General who stepped down from the role. Garcia was re-elected at the 23rd Council Meeting of the European Greens in Lyon (2015) for an extended mandate that would cover the 2019 European Election campaign. In November 2019 she once again ran for the position of Secretary General and was elected. The election took place at the 30th Council Meeting of the European Greens in Tampere. She attended the 2018 and 2019 Netroots Nations, a political convention for progressive political activists in the USA. She is the only female Secretary-General of a pan-European party.  Mandate as Secretary General  During Mar Garcia's first two mandates (2014 – 2019) her political priorities have been: * Strengthening and supporting the member parties for better political coordination and cooperation at a European level; * Campaigning for the divestment from fossil fuel; * Gender equality and equal rights for LGBTI people; * Launching a Green platform for citizen engagement: the ChangeMaking Network – Tilt! During this period, the European Green Party created several spaces for diverse stakeholders in Green politics to connect, such as: * Green Local Councilors network: provides a platform for Green Councilors that work on a local or regional level to share their experiences and best practices; * Global Greens and European Green Party Congress: held in Liverpool and gathered more than 2.000 Greens from all over the world; * European Ideas Lab (EIL): The European Green Party together with the Greens/EFA Group in the European Parliament brought together change-makers from all over Europe, representing civil society, activists, movements and Green politicians. There have been two editions in Brussels: February 2017 and March 2018 and some regional editions: Dublin (2017), Graz (2018), and Madrid (2018). During this mandate, a high priority was given to the enhancement of collaboration among the European Green family, namely among the Member Parties spread across Europe, the Greens/EFA Group in the European Parliament, the Federation of Young European Greens and the Green European Foundation. Also during her mandate, the Change Making Network Tilt! was born. This citizens’ movement demanding a fairer and greener Europe, has 200.000 members. During her term as Secretary General, the European Greens achieved the best ever results in a European Election. Through an innovative digital campaign present all over the European Union, the share of votes for the European Greens increased from 7 to 10 percent. The number of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) elected to the Greens/EFA group increased from 52 to 75. In 2018 Politico ranked her as one of the 20 women who shape Brussels.  Stances  Garcia is an enthusiastic pro-European. “Europe is the best instrument to manage the global challenges that we face in a globalised world, the best structure to deal with environmental and democratic problems” she said in an interview with La Vanguardia. She is a convinced ecologist with a social approach and considers climate issues and social justice to be interrelated: “the backbone is the fight against climate change and the preservation of the planet as it is the unique ecosystem compatible with the human existence. From this, you can tackle social, labour and economic rights”. She considers that the European Greens are the best alternative to fight against national populism as Greens stand for “[we stand for] open and inclusive societies which manage refugees and migration. A feminist society”. “We have three main pillars: the fight against climate change, more democracy and rule of law”. Despite being happy with the success of the Greens following the 2019 European Elections, she wants one of her biggest future challenges to be “strengthen the Green presences in the East and South of Europe”.  Personal life  Mar Garcia has two children and is married to Jordi Guillot Miravet.

Her research focuses on the transnational interaction between narrative and cultural memory and is authoritative in the field of Memory Studies. Life Rigney was born in Dublin and studied English and French at University College Dublin (BA 1978, MA 1980). In 1987 she gained her PhD at the University of Toronto in Comparative Literature . From 1988 to 2000 she was a lecturer in Literary Theory at the Comparative Literature programme, University of Utrecht; in 2000 she was appointed Professor of Comparative Literature at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. In 2003 she was appointed to the Chair of Comparative Literature at the University of Utrecht. Rigney is married to the Dutch cultural historian Joep Leerssen; they have two children. Research Most of Rigney's research deals with the interactive dynamics between narrative (in literature and other media) and cultural memory.History as Text: Narrative Theory and History” in The Sage Handbook of Historical Theory, eds. Nancy Partner and Sarah Foot (New York: Sage Publications, 2013), 183-201 Her early work dealt with narrative and imaginative strategies in history-writing and historical novels, with special attention to writers like Jules Michelet, Thomas Carlyle and Sir Walter Scott. She then turned to more general models of how the past is configured in the present-day imagination, and to the question how this imagination is expressed and communicated. Building on the earlier work of Hayden White, Pierre Nora and Aleida Assmann, Rigney's research focuses on the dynamics of cultural memory: how are memories expressed across different media and how do they move between different audiences, generations or nationalities? Rigneys work has recently shifted from a nineteenth-century to a contemporary focus. Her work since 2000 has dealt with the poetics and function of public apologies“Can Apology End an Event? Bloody Sunday, 1972-2010”, in Marek Tamm, ed. The Afterlife of Events: Perspectives on Mnemohistory (London: Palgrave Macmillan), 242-261 and with the cultural memory of political activism“Differential Memorability and Transnational Activism: Bloody Sunday, 1887-2016”, Australian Humanities Review, 59 (2016) Among Rigney's theoretical concepts and models are * the principle of cultural scarcity,“Plenitude, Scarcity and the Production of Cultural Memory”, Journal of European Studies 35.1/2 (2005): 209-26 meaning that cultural expressions have to compete for a limited reservoir of public attention and will try to pack a maximum of historical significance into as concise an expression as possible; * the fact that the canonicity of historical memory is commensurate with its likelihood to be expressed in different media; ** these media involve, besides the textual or visual, also the tactile and the performative (tourism, memorabilia, re-enactment events); ** these media all have their specific conventions and formal structures, which will in turn affect the nature of how memories are articulated and communicated.“Cultural Memory Studies: Mediation, Narrative and the Aesthetic”, in Anna Lisa Tota and Trever Hagen, eds. Routledge International Handbook of Memory Studies (London: Routledge, 2016), 65-7 * the mobility of memories along a twofold axis: intermedial as well as transnational,“Transnational Memory,” Testimony Between History and Memory (Auschwitz Foundation International Quarterly) 120 (2015): 170-71. The transnational dimension is indebted to Michael Rothberg’s notion of multidirectionality and their wide impact on social practices. * the role of \\"embodied communities\\" (analogously to Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities): physical gatherings of people (often festive) for commemorative or identity-affirming purposes.“Embodied Communities: Commemorating Robert Burns, 1859”, Representations 115.1 (2011): 71-101 Rigney has evinced a wish to seen Memory Studies move beyond its “traumatic paradigm”, i.e. its tendency to concentrate on those collective memories that involve suffering and catastrophes.“Remembering Hope: Transnational Activism Beyond the Traumatic,” Memory Studies 11.3 (2018): 368-80 In her historiographical theory she resists a view of history centered on ideal-typical historians (as academics in history departments writing archive-based books on the social and political history of their own country); this, she argues, fails to do justice to the wide range of practices, academic and otherwise, through which societies take account of the past.“Introduction”, in Joep Leerssen and Ann Rigney (eds.) Historians and Social Values (Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2000), 7-15; “Being an Improper Historian”, in Keith Jenkins, Sue Morgan and Alun Munslow, eds., Manifestos for History (London: Routledge, 2007), 149-59; “When the Monograph is no Longer the Medium: Historical Narrative in the Online Age”, History and Theory, 49.4 (2010): 100-117. Honours, awards and grants Rigney's book Imperfect Memories was awarded the 2001 Jean-Pierre Barricelli Award by the American Conference on Romanticism. She held visiting research fellowships at the University of Liège (1984-1985), Trinity College Dublin (1995), the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies (2009-2010), the University of Konstanz (research group History and Memory, 2011), and at the Lichtenberg Kolleg (Institute for Advanced Study), University of Göttingen (2012). She was one of the working group leaders in the COST action “In Search for Transcultural Memory in Europe” (2012-2016). This led to the establishment of the Network in Transnational Memory Studies (NITMES), which won a €59,000 grant from NWO, the Netherlands national funding agency for scientific research, in 2015. In 2018 she was awarded a European Research Council Advanced grant for the research project Remembering Activism: The Cultural Memory of Protest in Europe (REACT). Rigney has been an elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences since in 2005. She is also an elected member of the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities (Koninklijke Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen), and of Academia Europaea.

He played high school basketball at Westerville South High School in Westerville, Ohio, and played college basketball with the Butler Bulldogs, staying for four years and leading the team in scoring for two consecutive seasons. After going undrafted in the 1994 NBA draft, he started his professional career in the Continental Basketball Association. After playing in Portugal and Israel as well as in minor leagues in the United States, Guice moved to France where he was a three-time All-Star selection, MVP in 2005 and won the league title in 2006.  High school career  Guice was born in Columbus, Ohio and attended Westerville South High School in nearby Westerville, where he was a multi-sport athlete: he was part of the varsity basketball, soccer (where he played in the defender position) and track teams. In his senior year of high school he earned all-state honors in all three sports. While playing for the basketball team he averaged 19.1 points, 7.6 assists, 4.1 rebounds and 4.1 steals per game and was a first-team all-state selection and District III Player of the Year.  College career Guice was recruited since his junior year at Westerville South by Butler's head coach Barry Collier and assistant coach Jay John, who personally attended some of Guice's games in high school. Guice signed to play for Butler in mid- November 1989, preferring the Bulldogs to Yale and St. Peter's, the other two programs that showed interest in signing him. In his freshman year Guice played as the team's sixth man, and averaged 10.3 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.2 assists per game, ranking fifth on the team in both scoring and rebounding.

The group carries out direct actions to raise awareness of the issues facing people who cycle in Dublin and to pressure the authorities to do more to provide safe conditions for cycling. Die-in by I BIKE Dublin at Dublin City Council, 2019, in Dublin The group's activities have included People Protected Bike Lanes, Die-ins and slow cycle protests. The first action took place on Andrew's Street, Dublin on June 27, 2017 and involved the protection of a contraflow cycle lane which was a black spot for illegal parking. The action immediately attracted media attention and a follow up action a week later made the main evening news on national television channel RTÉ.https://lovindublin.com/news/dublin-traffic- standstill-as-cyclists-protest-in-bike- laneshttps://www.dublininquirer.com/2017/07/05/from-hashtag-to-direct-action- freeing-the-cycle-laneshttps://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/dublin- cyclists-stand-up-to-illegal-parking-1.3143444 In December 2017, I BIKE Dublin coordinated a crowd sourcing of illegal parking on cycle lanes in Dublin in response to claims by the Garda Síochána that they were taking the issue seriously. More incidents of illegal parking were recorded in one week in Dublin than had been recorded by the Garda Síochána in an entire year, nationwide. In April 2018, following the death of a young man while cycling in Donnybrook, Dublin, I BIKE Dublin teamed up with other cycling groups and organisations to stage a die-in outside Dáil Éireann to highlight the dangers faced by people cycling in Dublin.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/cyclists-lie-down- on-kildare-street-in-protest-at-road-deaths-1.3474267 In June 2019, the group presented its work at the Velo-city conference hosted by Dublin City Council. They presented Klaus Bondam, head of the Danish Cyclists' Federation, with a t-shirt in recognition of his outspoken criticism of the Council and their lack of action in delivering safe cycling infrastructure.https://www.weelz.fr/fr/dublin-face-a-un-challenge-velo- immense/https://twitter.com/IBIKEDublin/status/1144543857104904193 In October 2019, I BIKE Dublin teamed up with Extinction Rebellion to stage a slow cycle along the streets of Dublin as part of Extinction Rebellion's Week of Action.

Brewer's writing has appeared internationally through literary magazines, and most recently in podcasts and short films. Career Writing Tania Hershman, author, and judge of the 2017 UK Retreat West Flash Fiction Prize, has described Brewer's writing as \\"[taking] risks in its structure, going off on tangents, not following a linear narrative, and the risks pay off. It is dark and funny and moving and strange. There is not a word too many or too few, and every word is precisely chosen, the character’s voice never strays…I could read this again and again and again.\\" Two of Brewer's short literary fiction pieces were adapted for his podcast Storytellers Telling Stories with Brewer narrating. He has mentioned compiling his stories into a full-length novel. Most recently, his screenplays have been adapted into short films set for a 2020 release. Podcasting Around early 2017, Brewer launched John Plays the Piano, a roundtable film discussion podcast, breaking down and analyzing classic films such as Brazil (1985 film), Being John Malkovich, and even Small Soldiers. Eight episodes were released, but only three episodes are currently available. Brewer has said John Plays the Piano is on an \\"indefinite hiatus\\". In October 2017, Brewer launched the Storytellers Telling Stories podcast as a means to take a break from writing, craving something \\"more experimental and a little less predictable\\", toying with different instruments while warping and distorting their sounds. The show has been described as an audio drama \\"pushing the evolution\\" of podcasting. The initial concept was to simulate a movie within the listener's mind, to create a sense of total immersion without requiring any visuals. Lights Out (radio show) has been cited as an influence for Brewer, as was listening to concept albums and following their track listings to outline his stories and novels as a teenager. Storytellers Telling Stories wrapped with its series finale in August 2019, bringing together 27 different writers reading the work of author Traci Foust, as Foust had passed away the previous year. In October 2019, Lit Hub announced a partnership with The Podglomerate, launching the Storybound (podcast), a new podcast created and hosted by Brewer. The show will explore themes of \\"family life to friendship, relationships to histories, and how everything in life can be impacted by the power of a good story\\". Season One was sponsored by Powell's Books, including musicians who originally appeared on Storytellers Telling Stories, alongside critically acclaimed and bestselling authors such as Mitch Albom, Lidia Yuknavitch, Matt Gallagher, Kim Barnes, Adelle Waldman, Diksha Basu, Nathan Hill, Caitlin Doughty, as well as a story told by Jack Rhysider, creator of the popular podcast Darknet Diaries. Another podcast is rumored to be in development with a recurring writing collaborator, Brianna Barrett, officially funded by a grant from the Regional Arts & Culture Council. The show will be a radio drama adaptation of Barrett's historical fiction play based on the life of Frances Fuller Victor, an American historian and novelist living in Civil War era San Francisco.

It was released on 22 April 2011 for Microsoft Windows and macOS on Steam. It was ported and published to iOS in Q2\`2012 by Colibri Games. It was ported to Android and published on Google Play by HeroCraft in Q3\`2012. A port for Linux was made available in June 2015, for AppleTV on 2 Februari 2016, and a Nintendo Switch version was released on 4 October 2019 in collaboration with Ellada Games. A ports to Windows phone exists as well.  Gameplay  The goal of The Tiny Bang Story is to find hidden objects in the form of jigsaw pieces and solve a series of 30 logical puzzles. The puzzles are connected together in a point and click adventure story, consisting of 5 short chapters that each end with a splash screen where the user has to piece the found jigsaw pieces together. The protagonist of the adventure story is the user, and is never portrayed, although there is some minor interaction with in-game characters. The Tiny Bang Story is notable in that it contains no spoken or written dialogue.  Development  The Tiny Bang Story was developed by Colibri Games, an independent game development studio based in Kaliningrad, Russia. Eduard Arutyunyan is the artist for the game, and Dmitriy Sannikov is the programmer. Andrey Arutyunyan was later added to the team to handle the business aspects.. The art of the game was inspired by Dutch classic art, and the video game Machinarium by Amanita Design.  Reception  The Tiny Bang Story got mixed reviews on release. The average score on critic aggregate site Metacritic is 63/100, and 58% on GameRankings. Reviewers unanimously applaud the hand-drawn art style, calling it \\"gorgeous\\" or \\"absolutely stunning\\", which contributes to the charming atmosphere of the game. At the same time, most reviewers criticise the short playtime. The puzzles stir more debate amongst the reviewers. Rock Paper Shotgun is outright enthusiastic by declaring hidden object games as potentially great puzzles, and The Tiny Bang Story is a superb piece of evidence for that, and subsequently declaring it the #20 \\"Best Puzzle Games Ever Made\\". XGN and AdventureGamers on the other hand think the puzzles are \\"easy\\" and \\"repetitive\\". GamePitt turns this same judgement into an advantage by noting that the easiness makes the game suitable for the whole family, including younger children.

They were deported to the concentration camps Buchenwald, Dachau and Sachsenhausen by the NSDAP organizations and the police in the days after the pogrom. This put pressure on the deportees and their relatives in order to speed up the only seemingly voluntary emigration from their homeland and to \\"Aryanize\\" Jewish assets. The vast majority of the detainees were released by the beginning of 1939. Around 500 Jews were murdered, committed suicide or died as a result of ill-treatment and refused medical treatment in the concentration camps. According to contemporary witnesses, the perpetrators' designation as Aktionsjuden was common at least in the Buchenwald concentration camp. Presumably the name was derived from Aktion Rath, as the pogrom was sometimes called.  Commands  Joseph Goebbels wrote in his diary that Adolf Hitler himself had ordered the arrest of 25,000 to 30,000 Jews. Late in the evening of 9 November 1938, Heinrich Müller announced the planned \\"actions against the Jews\\" to the \\"Stapo\\" offices. The arrest of 20,000 to 30,000 mainly wealthy Jews had to be prepared. In the early morning hours of 10 November, Reinhard Heydrich forwarded an order by Heinrich Himmler to all state police headquarters and SD top sections. Soon in all districts as many healthy male Jews - \\"especially wealthy\\" and \\"not too old\\" - were to be arrested as could be accommodated in the existing detention rooms. Maltreatment was forbidden.  Arrest  Mass arrest of Jews in Baden-Baden The arrest action started immediately on 10 November and was stopped on 16 November by an order from Heydrich. In addition to the Gestapo and the local police, even the SA, SS and the National Socialist Motor Corps became active. Heydrich's exact instructions were hardly taken into account. On 11 November, an express order was issued to immediately release women and children arrested during the action. On 16 November, the dismissal of sick persons and persons over the age of sixty was ordered. Most male Jews were arrested in their homes, but arrests were also made at work, in hotels, schools and train stations. While the deployment of police officers in large cities was mostly formally correct and without additional humiliation or maltreatment, elsewhere insults, kicks and blows were not uncommon. Some of those arrested were coerced into singing National Socialist songs and exhaustive physical exercises and led through the city in \\"raids\\". In most cases the Jews taken into \\"protective custody\\" were held captive for the first two to three days in police stations, prisons, gyms or schools and from there transferred to concentration camps. The historian Wolfgang Benz recorded that up to 10,000 Jews remained in prisons or local collection points because the accommodation available in concentration camps was insufficient. Reliable figures and comprehensive information on their release from prison or the duration of their imprisonment are not available and there is a research deficit.  Transfer to concentration camp  SS propaganda photograph of disabled Jews at Buchenwald, arrested after Kristallnacht Most of the prisoners arrived in the three concentration camps of Dachau, Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald in the first two to three days after the pogrom night. Further transports from Vienna arrived on the 22 November. The \\"Aktionsjuden\\" from Berlin were driven by trucks to the camp gate of Sachsenhausen. Others were transported by bus, train or suburban railway and then on foot. For Dachau, 10,911 Jews were committed, Buchenwald 9,845 and for Sachsenhausen the figure is estimated at 6,000. This means that the total number of prisoners in concentration camps had doubled in an instant. In many cases, the detainees were subjected to the brutality of the escorts during transport. According to some reports, \\"almost all prisoners\\", when they arrived in Dachau as well as in Buchenwald, showed traces of injuries, some of them serious, that they had suffered during or after their arrest. Other police officers accompanying them testified that they had behaved correctly or even shown compassion.  Camp stay  A humiliating admission procedure with hours of standing for appeals, undressing, hair cutting and putting on the prisoners' clothes had a shocking effect on the victims and is widely described in eyewitness accounts. Bourgeois values and honorary titles suddenly no longer applied. This created feelings of degradation, lawlessness and being at the mercy of others. The accommodation in Buchenwald was completely inadequate, where five windowless barracks were each occupied by 2000 \\"Aktionsjuden\\" and sanitary facilities were initially lacking. The daily routine was structured by three appeals, which often lasted for hours and became a torture in rain and cold. Sometimes the detainees had to exercise and perform meaningless and physically demanding tasks. In Dachau, the number of registered deaths rose disproportionately.  Parole  The duration of the imprisonment was very different. From the end of November 1938, 150 to 250 \\"Aktionsjuden\\" were released daily. On 1 January 1939, 1,605 Jews were still imprisoned in Buchenwald and 958 in Sachsenhausen. The reports of the 'Aktionsjuden' show that they could not identify any system or criteria for the dismissals. On 28 November 1938, the release of young people under the age of sixteen was ordered, as was the release of front fighters. As of 12 December, the inmates over 50 years of age were to be released, and as of 21 December, Jewish teachers were to be given preferential dismissal. Others gained their freedom because their plans to leave the country had already reached an advanced stage or even their visas were threatening to expire. Still others were released immediately after the transfer of their villa. Jewish car owners, who had their driving license revoked from 3 December 1938, were pressured to sell their cars at a ridiculous price. Anyone who refused to make such a request could nevertheless be unexpectedly dismissed.  Repercussions  Arrival of Jewish refugee children, port of London, February 1939 The number of \\"Aktionsjuden\\" who died in the concentration camp was at least 185 in Dachau, 233 in Buchenwald and 80 to 90 in Sachsenhausen. Reports cite physical overexertion, septic illnesses, pneumonia, lack of prescribed medication and diet as the main causes of death. Many men suffered from the consequences of the prison conditions and became ill after release. In the Jüdisches Krankenhaus Berlin, about 600 emergency amputations had to be carried out, which were necessary due to untreated wounds and frostbite. Relatives noticed psychological changes in their returned men. Speechlessness, sleep disturbances, fear and shame were often the reaction to the sudden loss of bourgeois reputation, the raw assaults experienced and the experience of absolute powerlessness and lawlessness. The halfway regulated emigration became a panic flight. Families were forced to separate in order to flee individually to a foreign country or at least to remove their children from Germany. At least 18,000 children were transported with Kindertransport to Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands or Switzerland.

It was later ported to the FM Towns, Sharp X68000, and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The SNES version was published by I'Max. It is a sequel to Data East's 1989 arcade title Hippodrome. Plot The king is dead, and a combat tournament is being held to determine a new ruler. The player faces twelve opponents sequentially in one-on-one combat, and upon defeating them all, is crowned ruler of the kingdom. Gameplay Mutant Fighter's roster includes eight playable characters - three human characters and five monsters; the human characters are the Fighter, Amazoness, and Hercules. The monster playable characters are a Werewolf, Golem, Minotaur, Dragon, and the Beast. The SNES version instead has five playable characters, omitting the Werewolf, Golem and Dragon from the roster. Non-playable characters faced as opponents include the Hydra, the Doppleganger, the demon Pazuzu, and the Archmage. Different characters have different Power, Speed, and Defense stats. Mutant Fighter features one-player mode versus AI or a two-player cooperative mode, where the players compete against two AI opponents simultaneously. The player may choose which opponents they face in the first three matches, sans the unplayable characters; after these three matches the opponents are chosen by the computer. When successfully hitting their opponent, characters accumulate Energy, which can be used for special attacks. Each character has unique special moves. In addendum to each character's unique move, there are 19 different attacks which can be achieved through different combos. The arcade version's title screen demo mode serves as a tutorial for the player to learn these moves.Mutant Fighter (1991), Arcade. Data East. Data East. Development Mutant Fighter underwent location testing in the UK in 1991, although under an alternate title: Heroes. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Mutant Fighter on their August 15, 1991 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year. The One reviewed the arcade version of Mutant Fighter in 1991 as it was undergoing location testing under the title Heroes, stating that \\"Wonderful graphics, animation and sound make Heroes an outstanding game\\" and furthermore praises its gameplay and number of different attacks. Sinclair User reviewed the arcade version as it was also undergoing location testing, giving it 87 out of 100 and calling it \\"very classy\\", praising the game's \\"amazing\\" sound effects, and stating that \\"[Heroes has] great animation and action, particularly if you can find the combination that produces your 'special attack', which will cause serious damage to your opponent.\\" German gaming magazine Video Games reviewed the Japanese SNES version of Mutant Fighters under the name Death Brade, giving it an overall score of 22%. Video Games begins their review by criticising the game's gameplay, sound, and graphics, stating \\"What got into I'Max, so that they would let loose this pathetic effort unto humanity? The graphics are only just 8-bit capable and the fighters are teeming with clumsiness and legoland- style animation cycles. When you land a hit [on your opponent], it sounds like a baby slurping porridge. Moreover: the likelihood of the Großglockner collapsing is greater than discovering a special move in Death Brade.\\" In regards to Death Brade's combat, they expressed that \\"no matter what you try, your fighter will be guaranteed to do the thing that is the most useless\\". Video Games also criticized the number of stages available, and called the names of the characters \\"irrelevant\\".

Born in Bucharest, Romania, he is still fluent in Romanian. He and his family emigrated from Romania in the mid 1960s, when he was nine years old. Zuckerman was a real estate lawyer and partner with the New York City law firm Seyfarth Shaw. Education Zuckerman graduated from Hamden Hall Country Day School in 1975. He earned a BS in Life Sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a BS in Management from the MIT Sloan School of Management and his JD from New York Law School. While at MIT, Zuckerman became a brother of the Lambda Phi Chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity.Notable Alumni of The Alpha Delta Phi Zuckerman and Rudy Giuliani During his confirmation hearings in June 2019, Zuckerman testified “If confirmed, I would offer continued support for Romania’s noteworthy anti-corruption efforts. ... Fighting corruption and support[ing] judicial independence are vital to Romania’s long-term prosperity and security.” But Rudy Giuliani “appeared to contradict the U.S. State Department’s existing policy position” in August 2018 by writing a letter, at the request of former FBI director Louis Freeh, to Romania’s president “claiming Romania’s National Anticorruption Directorate had crossed the line of acceptable behavior.” Giuliani “requested amnesty be granted to various people prosecuted in Romania, shortly after the State Department urged Romania to continue its ‘considerable progress in combatting corruption and building effective rule of law.’” In 2007, when Giuliani was seeking the Republican nomination for President, Zuckerman donated $2000 to his campaign. He is also a member of one of Donald Trump’s golf clubs. Career Before his tenure at Seyfarth Shaw, Zuckerman was co-head of national real estate and corporate services at Epstein Becker & Green. Sexual harassment claim When Zuckerman was a partner at Lowenstein Sandler, a sexual harassment claim was made against him by one of their legal secretaries in 2008. Both Zuckerman and the firm were sued by the secretary and the suit was settled in 2009. It appears the Trump administration knew about the allegations and lawsuit.

It began in the early spring of 1929, when the Qashqai, led by Ali Salar Hishmat Qashqai rose up against the Persian government. The rebels mainly operated from village of Siyuk, south of Shiraz. As the year continued, additional rebellions by the Khamseh and the Buyir Ahmadi in eastern and northern Fars province respectively. In early May 1929, Ali Qashqai offered a list of conditions for peace with the government: * the release of Sawlat al- Dawlah from Prison in Tehran * the appointment of Sawlat or, failing him, or his elder son, Nasir Khan, as the ilkhani of the Qashqai * the Qashqai not to be deprived of their arms * conscription not to be applied to the Qashqai * the law of uniformity of clothing not to be applied to the Qashqai * the census department and the department for the registration of title deeds to be abolished These terms were refused. By early June, the government had lost complete control of Fars province outside of Shiraz, which came under rebel siege in mid-June. Following an additional Bakhtiari uprising in Dih Kurd, Isfahan Province on 9 July led by Mardan Khan, the government agreed to the peace terms and most rebel tribes in Fars province, except for Ali Qashqai surrendered. The Bakhtiari continued to fight and Safid Dasht was under siege by mid-July. In late July, the government offered amnesties and most Bakhtiari rebel leaders surrendered then. Mardan Khan, the nominal leader of the revolt, refused to surrender until autumn. In 1932, the government sent a contingent of 500 troops to defeat Ali Qashqai, but was unsuccessful.

History The temporary church The population of the new Nørrebro and Østerbro districts grew rapidly in the second half of the 19th century. The first church in the area, St- John's, had soon become too small. A young catechist named C. J. Holt conducted open air services in the garden at Ruesgade 105. A church society was therefore established with the purpose of building a church in the densely populated Ryesgade neighborhood. A temporary church financed by the Copenhagen Church Foundation was constructed in 1892. In 1897 a committee was established with the goal of raising enough funds for the construction of a proper church. The new church was designed by the architect Victor Nyebølle and was his first work in Copenhagen. The temporary church was therefore moved to Sjællandsgade in Nørrebro. The foundation stone was set on 8 May 1902 and the church was inaugurated on 8 May 1904. The parish was in 1905 divided in two when the Church of Peace was completed further down the street. Architecture The church is designed with inspiration from Romanesque churches of Northern Italy. It is constructed in red brick and stands on a foundation of granite ashlars. The narrow facade towards the street consists of a gable motif flanked by a tall, slender tower to the right and a lower pinavle to the left. The facade features a relief with piblical motif created by Thomas Bærentzen (1869-1936). Over the entrance sits a Christ figure.

Life  Pritchard was born in Yorkshire and brought up on a farm near Marlborough, Wiltshire. His parents were not musicians, but his family inherited a piano when he was 11 and he began to teach himself to play and to compose. At 13 he also took up the cello, developing quickly, and in 1966 he was accepted to the Royal Scottish Academy in Glasgow to study the instrument with Joan Dickson, and composition with Dr Frank Spedding. After graduating he worked briefly as Director of Music at Salisbury Cathedral School, then as a freelance cellist in London. In 1971 he was employed by the BBC, firstly as an orchestral cellist, and later as the subject of a documentary film. In the late 1970s performances of his Objects in Space and Mercurius at London’s South Bank attracted national and international attention. Since then he has worked as a freelance composer, ensemble and festival director, and a teacher. Since 2008 he has taught composition and orchestration at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London, where he was appointed a Professor in January 2017. The composer Alwynne Pritchard is his daughter.  Career  In 1979 Pritchard’s music was performed at the Warsaw Autumn Festival for the first time, and his career has since been divided between his home country, mainland Europe and many other countries around the world: more than half of his commissions and first performances have taken place in countries outside the UK. As well as Poland these include Switzerland, where he has an ongoing association with several ensembles based in Basel; Italy, where he founded the Reggello International Festival of Contemporary and Classical Music in 2003; and Germany, where he has been closely associated with a number of festivals, including the Weimar Spring Days for Contemporary Music, at which he has been represented as a composer, conductor and competition judge since 2008. His principal publisher, Verlag Neue Musik, is based in Berlin.

He flew for the No. 311 Squadron RAF, a Czechoslovak bomber squadron during World War II. Šiška and his crew are known for their journey of the North Sea and as prisoners of war. He was a decorated veteran and a member of the Guinea Pig Club, an association that focused on the treatment, rehabilitation and socialization of airmen who suffered serious injuries in the war.  Early life  Šiška was born in Kroměříž in 1914. His family had a small farm, and he was one of three children. From a young age, Šiška wanted to fly and to become a pilot. However, he became an apprentice locksmith and later a mechanical engineer. He then joined the Bata Aviation Factory in Otrokovice. He would later earn a reward of 5000 crowns for his improvement proposal for the Zlin Z-XII aircraft, but he preferred pilot training. In September 1936, aged 22, he passed the pilot tests for tourist aircraft. He entered military service and decided to become a military pilot. He mastered combat training, served in aviation units and in September 1938 was at the field airport in Ivanovice among the prepared crews.  World War II  Šiska was a member of an illegal cell through which he helped Jews and others escape to Poland and later to Hungary. He remained in the republic until the outbreak of war. At that time, fear grew that the Germans would discover a hidden prototype of the Z-XIII aircraft. In order not to fall into their hands, it was decided within the illegal group that the prototype must fly to the Balkans. However, this plan failed. Together with Alois Bača, they fled across the frozen river Morava to Slovakia, then with the help of a Hungarian pastor, they crossed the Slovak- Hungarian border and continued by train to the border with Yugoslavia. There they were arrested by a Hungarian border guard and imprisoned in Hodmezövasárhely prison for several weeks. After a failed escape attempt, they were deported to the Citadella in Budapest. Here they were held in harsh conditions together with another hundred and twenty Czechs and a similar number of Poles. An opportunity to escape did not come until 30 March 1940, when Šiška reported to the doctor suffering from scabies. He managed to escape his guards and took a taxi to the French consulate. From there he was secretly taken to the Yugoslav border at night, and made a successful crossing. His following steps, already a member of MS. foreign troops, headed through Turkey to Syria, where he joined with other members of the army on a boat trip across the Mediterranean to France. They landed in Marseille on 25 April, briefly served at an airport near Bordeaux, but did not intervene in the ongoing fighting for France, and on 21 June were on their way to the English coast. In England, he joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve, becoming a sergeant pilot. He was assigned to No 311 (Czechoslovak) Bomber Squadron based at RAF East Wretham, Norfolk. He belonged to a few MS. pilots who participated in the crossing of the Alps with subsequent bombing of the industrial Italian city of Turin.  The North Sea and prisoner of war  On 28 December 1941, a six- member crew of 311 Squadron had to make a rough emergency landing in the North Sea after damage to the plane KX-B after the bombing of Wilhelmshaven. During the landing, one of his crew lost his life, while the remaining five members had to make use of an inflatable boat to survive. At sea, they had close encounters with rescue planes, but rescue did not come despite the unwritten agreement in RAF to save castaways at all costs. The planes dropped parcels full of resources, but due to the rough sea, the crew members did not dare go into the water to retrieve the packages. Due to poor health and no help in sight, Šiška and the crew members contemplated suicide but decided against it as they had no means to carry out the deed and did not want to do it by self- drowning. Not all survived the drift at sea. Out of the six original crew members, Alois Šiška, Pavel Svoboda, and Josef Ščerba were the only ones to survive. Much to their astonishment, they drifted towards the Dutch coast and when they were found near the Petten, they were arrested by the German Coast Guard. The crew members were arrested and taken to hospitals. Šiška was in the worst state of the three as he had gotten severe frostbite and gangrene of the feet, and doctors were preparing for amputation when Šiška experienced a sudden heart attack. This experience and his subsequent apparent clinical death ultimately saved his feet from amputation, but he could not walk until after the war when he underwent multiple surgeries to help repair the damage. During captivity, Šiška was held at multiple prison camps and was questioned by the Gestapo as a \\"traitor to the Great German Empire\\" as he was viewed as a deserter (Czechoslovakia was then German territory). The Gestapo ordered a death sentence for Šiška, but that order was never enforced due to threats from Winston Churchill that for every soldier killed in a British uniform, two high-rank German officials would be killed in response. Until the end of the war, he was held at Oflag IV-C in Colditz Castle, a notorious prison camp that held military elites. He was liberated on April 7th, 1945, and was immediately sent to the United Kingdom for treatment.  Post-war  After liberation, Šiška underwent 14 spine and leg surgeries at the Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, thereby gaining membership of the Guinea Pig Club. He returned to his homeland in 1947 to serve in the military in Prague. While in the military, he rejected invitations to join the Communist Party. He was arrested multiple times between 1948 and 1950, and had to retire from the Air Force. Šiška and his family were evicted from Prague after he was named as a \\"dangerous person\\", and was limited in his work thereafter. He worked in agriculture and as a TV repairman because as an ex-RAF pilot he was not allowed to hold a career. He was briefly recalled to military service in 1968, but released in 1970 due to health issues. He was completely rehabilitated in 1989 and was allowed back to Prague. On 3 May 1995, he was appointed Major General. Šiška authored the book No Response KX-B.  Recognition  Šiška was honoured many times throughout his life and posthumously. For instance, on 17 October 2012, a monument was unveiled in Petten, Holland, in honor of the Czech crew of the Wellington KX-B plane that went down in the North Sea on 28 December 1941. Petten is the town nearest where Šiška and the remaining crew members were found. Šiška holds the highest Czech honour, the Order of the White Lion class III. It was conferred posthumously on 28 September 2003, as he had died a few weeks previously.

Settlement - the city of Korsakov, Sakhalin Oblast. The Korsakov Sea Trade Port provides a passenger-and-freight line with the Kuril Islands, constant line communication with South Korea, Vladivostok, as well as direct links with the West Coast of the USA and countries of the Asia-Pacific Region, and the Wakkanai ferry line (Japan) - Korsakov. History The construction of the port of Korsakov was begun by the Japanese in 1907. Initially, from 1907 to 1912, a 142-meter-long wooden pier was built on the site of the now- existing South. The depths of the berths were 3 meters. The pier was connected to the shore by a bridge. In 1920, work began on the reconstruction of the pier, and in 1923 the bridge. In 1928, civil engineering work was completed to reconstruct the South Pier, which is a gravitational-type structure. The mooring wall is made of massive folds and a concrete superstructure. The head part is made of reinforced concrete masses of giants installed on a stone bed. An iron-concrete parapet was built to protect against unrest. Later, work was done to expand the port: in 1939 the North Pier was built, which is a gravitational type structure from giant arrays, the length of the giant array is 1 5 m, the width is 7.2 m and the height is from 9.4 to 9.65 m. The pier consists of 9 berths with a length of 1058.7 m. and bank protection in the area of the power plant 91 m. Out of 9 berths, two berths (Nos. 1, 9) are inactive due to shallow depths. After the end of World War II and the liberation of the south of Sakhalin from the Japanese invaders, in August 1946, based on cargo turnover and its importance as a transshipment point, the Korsakov Sea Commercial Port was established. On the basis of the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Union of the RSFSR of July 5, 1946 on the administrative territorial structure of the South Sakhalin Region by order of the Minister of the Navy No. 935 of 08.08.1946, based on cargo turnover, its importance as a transshipment point, its technological equipment for berths, transshipment routes, the Korsakov Sea Trade Port of the 1st category was created. The structure and functions of the port, the main standard facilities of the commercial sea port were approved on 10/14/1947 and announced by order of the Ministry of the Navy No. 373 of 10/15/1947 In the development of the economy of the young Sakhalin Region, the Korsakov port was of paramount importance, representing a gate to Sakhalin, a connecting point between the mainland and the island. Korsakov port is one of the largest ports in the Far Eastern basin, navigation in which continues throughout the year. V 1949 godu na Sakhalin s materika v osnovnom postupali khlebnyye i prodovol'stvennyye tovary, stroitel'nyye materialy, metall i oborudovaniye, otpravlyali iz Sakhalinskoy oblasti, v osnovnom, bumagu, les i ryad drugikh tovarov, proizvodimykh na Sakhaline. In order to solve production and social issues, the port created the following: Motor depot, on the territory of which there were four repair boxes, six parking boxes for cars, four parking boxes for forklifts. The energy sector - the main equipment of a thermal power plant - boiler No. 3, was put into operation in 1952, boilers No. 1, 2 - in 1961. During 1969-1971, all three boilers were converted from solid to liquid fuel. Mechanical workshops located on the territory of a small bucket. The repair and construction department of the port had a construction yard, a carpentry workshop with machine tools, a sawmill workshop. The port fleet has had 32 submarines since 1949 (tugboats, boat, ram boats, barges). In the port there was a recreation center \\"Mayak\\" in the area of Ozerskoye, a yacht club in the village. First Pad, the Pioneer Camp “Sailor”, where the children of port and city workers had a rest, the Vodnik Stadium, where the ice rink worked in the winter. There were also the student’s rooms “Albatross” and “Petrel”, two well-maintained dormitories where port workers lived. Three kindergartens Nos. 6, 25, 29 were visited by the children of the port workers; there is a private clinic. The following events were held: Initiation to Young Workers, the Portovik newspaper was published, an amateur art group was organized, and annual sports and athletics meetings were held. In 1992, the Port Fleet disconnected and became the Port Fleet small business. In 1993, housing was transferred to the city administration, and kindergartens were transferred in 1994.

Nicholas was a United States Army major of an anti-aircraft unit in the Pacific War and was one of the most decorated Pacific War veterans from Wayne County, Georgia. Early life and career Alexander Nicholas at a military academy in the 1880s. Leslie \\"Nick\\" Nicholas was born on June 21, 1902 in Dales Mill, Wayne County, Georgia as the only child of Eva Melissa Robinson (1876-1975) and Alexander Stephens Nicholas (1862-1938). His father Alex was one of eight siblings born in 1862 during the American Civil War to farmer James Hamilton Nicholas (1832-1910) the son of Jonathan Nicholas Jr. Anne Nichols, also born in Dales Mill, is the granddaughter of James and cousin of Leslie. His maternal grandfather James Robinson was a pioneer of Volusia County, Florida working in real estate, mercantile and agriculture. Nicholas' middle name comes from James Robinson. Nicholas in his youth lived in Waycross, Screven, Jacksonville and White Springs because of his father's profession as a merchant. His father had also attended a military academy in the 1880s which later influenced Nicholas' intentions on attending Gordon College a military school in Barnesville, Georgia. In his youth and throughout his life Nicholas went by the nickname Nick. In 1930 Alex moved to Seville, Florida where he had a naval store called A.S. Nicholas Company. In 1919 Nicholas enrolled at Georgia Institute of Technology where he joined the Alpha Kappa Psi, Sigma Phi Epsilon and Phi Kappa Phi fraternities.

Nicholas' rank at Gordon College was First Sergeant of Company B from 1918 to 1919 and then Lieutenant in 1919. Nicholas graduated from Gordon College in 1919. Because Nicholas was 16 years old when he first attended Gordon College he did not have to register for service in World War I due to not meeting the age requirement of 18 years old. Nicholas enlisted in the United States Army Reserve beginning in the early 1920s while pursuing a career in real estate and then insurance. Nicholas was ranked Lt. in the C.A.C. artillery group and regularly gave speeches to fellow active duty reserve members. World War II On February 14, 1942 Nicholas registered for military service as part of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 at 39 years old. Nicholas entered active duty on July 20, 1942 and was transferred to Camp Blanding where he became a major of the 117th AAA Group. After serving time at Camp Blanding Major Nicholas was transferred to Camp Stoneman and then to the Pacific to take part in the Pacific War where he was in the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps. During the six month Guadalcanal Campaign Major Nicholas commanded the 117th AAA Group. Artillery groups such as Nicholas' helped ensure an American victory at Guadalcanal where over 8,000 Japanese were killed during the campaign. After Guadalcanal Nicholas and the 117th joined the Bougainville campaign, Battle of Leyte, and the Battle for Cebu City. While Nicholas was in the South Pacific he was wounded at an undisclosed location and later received the Purple Heart. Leslie's grave at Arlington National Cemetery. On July 30, 1944 Nicholas' wife Sybil died while he was in the South Pacific. His son Leslie Jr. was forced to go to Riverside Military Academy while his father was in the South Pacific. After the academy, Leslie Jr. served in the United States Merchant Marine Cadet Corps for two years as a cadet midshipman. Major Nicholas returned from the war on November 21, 1945 at Camp Blanding. Later life and death Nicholas returned to his career in insurance as agency secretary after the war in Jacksonville, Florida. He became the director of the Jacksonville Lions Club and the YMCA. Nicholas met Louise Knight in Jacksonville and they married in 1947. In February 1946 Leslie was given a discharge from the United States Army after serving 20 years. In December 1946 the Board of Directors at Guardian Life Insurance appointed him as an officer at the home office in New York City. Nicholas directed Guardian Life's field training division to help select candidates for manager positions. In 1947 Nicholas was diagnosed with cancer and gradually declined in health. He most likely developed the previously undiagnosed cancer while serving in the Pacific. In 1948 Nicholas had a son named after his father Alexander Stephens \\"Alex\\" Nicholas in New York City. In that same year on December 17, 1948 Nicholas died at 46 years old in Port Chester, New York. Nicholas was interred at Arlington National Cemetery for his service in the Pacific War.

On 26 January 2020, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) confirmed the itinerary for the tour. It was the first time that a tour between the two sides featured a one-off Test match. Zimbabwe last toured Bangladesh in October and November 2018, and last won a series in the country during their tour in November 2001. On 9 February, the BCB moved the three ODI matches from Chittagong to the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium, to give the venue more exposure and international attention. The one-off Test match was the 100th international match to be played between the two sides. Zimbabwe Cricket announced the squad for the one-off Test, with Craig Ervine named as the team's captain. Sean Williams, Zimbabwe's regular Test captain, took leave ahead of the match for the birth of his first child. Bangladesh won the one- off Test match by an innings and 106 runs. Ahead of the tour, the BCB announced that it would be Mashrafe Mortaza's last series as captain of the ODI team. Prior to the third ODI, Mortaza confirmed that he would be stepping down as Bangladesh's ODI captain after the series. Bangladesh won the ODI series 3–0, with Mashrafe Mortaza recording his 50th win in an ODI match as captain with victory in the third match. Tamim Iqbal was appointed as the new ODI captain ahead of Bangladesh's next fixture, the one-off match against Pakistan. In an attempt to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the BCB restricted ticket sales for the first T20I match to one per person. Bangladesh won the T20I series 2–0, to win all six international fixtures against Zimbabwe in the series. It was the first time that Bangladesh had whitewashed a team in a single series across all three formats of international cricket.

The school's curriculum is organized into 13 subject area departments, and students can take up to seven classes a day. Senior students can enroll concurrently at Butte Community College. Sports offered by the school are football, basketball, volleyball, cross country, swimming, and cheerleading.  History   Fire and relocation  When the Camp Fire destroyed most of the town of Paradise in November 2018, the school campus was mostly spared, losing only a half dozen temporary classrooms. The wildfire, the worst in California's history, burned down 19,000 structures and killed 85 people. The population of the town of Paradise plummeted from 26,800 to 2,034. The campus was shut down for the remainder of the 2018–2019 school year; students studied in nearby Chico, California or via online courses wherever they were staying. In June 2019, 220 seniors returned to the empty campus for their graduation ceremony on the football field. When the school reopened its doors in the fall of 2019, an enrollment of 600 was expected, but 900 showed up on the first day of school. Many of the students had lost their homes in the fire, and some were living with friends or driving long distances to attend school each day. The school made national news when its football team, less than a year after the fire, had an undefeated regular season and went to the section championship. Only three members of the varsity team were living in Paradise; the rest were commuting from locations up to 90 minutes away.

Personal  Maiklem was born in 1971 on a dairy farm in Surrey, 30 miles from Central London. Her father's family have been farmers for at least 400 years. Her mother's family are from London, until the early 20th century they worked as shipbuilders on the Thames and lived in the East End. She earned a degree in Sociology and Social Anthropology from Newcastle University in 1993. She lived in London for 25 years and now lives on the Kent coast with her partner and two children. She is licensed to mudlark on the River Thames by the Port of London Authority and has been searching the foreshore in her spare time for over 15 years.  Career  Her first job after graduating was as a bookseller with Waterstones. In 1994 she began work at Dorling Kindersley and has worked in publishing ever since. In 2012 she collaborated with the rock band KISS to produce the KISS Monster Book, which was shortlisted for Illustrated Book of the Year at the British Book Awards. She currently works as a writer, freelance editor, copywriter and publishing consultant. In 2012 Maiklem began the London Mudlark Facebook page in 2012 as a place to share her finds online and to open the hobby up to a wider audience. It was the first time anyone had shared their finds on social media.  Mudlarking: Lost and Found on the River Thames  In August 2019, Maiklem's first book Mudlarking: Lost and Found on the River Thames was published by Bloomsbury in the UK, Australia and New Zealand and under the title Mudlark: Searching for London's Past Along the River Thames by Liveright in the US and Canada. It received wide critical acclaim from, amongst others, The Sunday Times, The Times, The Observer, The Guardian, The Times Literary Supplement, Literary Review, the Daily Mail, the Daily Express, The Spectator, The Economist, Current Archeology, The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, The New Yorker, Maclean's, The Australian and Sydney Morning Herald. Mudlarking appeared in a cartoon by Nick Newman in Private Eye. The Guardian called it \\"A fascinating insight into the discarded objects and lost things that wash up on the foreshore\\". The Daily Telegraph considered her description of the fog to be \\"worthy of Dickens or Joseph Conrad\\". Literary Review described it as \\"A lovely, lyrical, gently meandering book, filled with fascinating diversions and detail\\". The Wall Street Journal \\"A riveting crash course not only in the history of London from prehistoric times to the present, but also in urban geography and how to read a living environment from organic clues\\". Ian Mortimer said of the book: \\"Whoever buys it is blessed. I love the fact that [Maiklem] makes herself the centre of this huge, timeless, endless story that reaches from the distant past and flows past all our consciousnesses out to a place far beyond the reach of the estuary. Lara is such a natural writer; every page just tingles with her imagination. It is a love letter to life itself.\\" The Financial Times and The Guardian tipped Mudlarking as a 'Book to Read in 2019' in January 2019. On publication it became a Sunday Times Bestseller and was a BBC Radio 4 Book of the Week in August 2019. Mudlarking was Book of the Month at Foyles, an Observer Book of the Year 2019, a Daily Express Greatest Read 2019 and an Apple Books pick for 2019. Mudlarking won the 2020 Indie Award for Non Fiction. Maiklem has made numerous radio and television appearances on the BBC, Channel 4, Channel 5, The Travel Channel, BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 5, Scala Radio, Monocle Radio, ABC (Australia) and NPR (US). She has collaborated on podcasts with Spectator Magazine, BBC History Magazine, The Economist, the National Maritime Museum, Talking Tudors, Dan Snow's History Hits, Preservecast and Living History. Maiklem did a TED Talk in October 2019 and a Google Talk in September 2019. She wrote a short series about mudlarking for BBC Radio 3, has written articles for the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Financial Times and The Spectator and regularly speaks on mudlarking at private events and festivals.

Biography Alois Dorn was born at Mühlheim am Inn, a rural village in Upper Austria approximately equidistant between Munich and Linz: he grew up in conditions of some poverty in nearby Suben am Inn. He was one of the ten recorded children of the small businessman Johann Dorn and his wife, born Maria Karl. Several of his siblings would also pursue artistic careers, including the sculptor Conrad Dorn (1915–1987) and the artist Johanna Dorn- Fladerer (1913–1988). He attended junior school in Suben and middle school (\\"Bürgerschule\\") in the regional capital, Schärding. That was followed by his first piece of vocational training, which set him on course for his subsequent career: he attended the woodwork academy (\\"Fachschule für Holzbearbeitung\\") at Hallstatt. A flavour of his life at this time can be found in the short story \\"Eine kleine schwarze hölzerne Hand\\" (\\"A little black wooden hand\\") by Gertrud Fussenegger whom some time later, in 1950, Alois Dorn married. Working with wood would remain a particular preference during his career.Einladung zur Gedächtnisausstellung Prof. Alois Dorn 1908–2008 in Leonding Between 1927 and 1933 Alois Dorn studied at the prestigious Academy of Fine Arts (\\"Akademie der Bildenden Künste\\") in Munich, emerging with as \\"Akademischer Bildhauer\\" qualification. At Munich he was a \\"Master Student\\", studying under Joseph Wackerle. Dorn was seeing himself at this time primarily as an \\"architectural sculptor\\", producing figures and decorations suitable for imposing public buildings rather than as a producer of free-standing forms for exhibitions in museums and parks. Between 1933 and 1939 Dorn was working in Munich as a fashionable freelance sculptor. Most of his pieces remained in Bavaria and many of the more significant ones were prominently displayed in Munich. Partly on account of this, much of his work was degraded or destroyed by British and American aerial bombing during the Second World War. In 1933 the National Socialists had taken power and transformed the country into a one-party dictatorship which lasted for slightly more than twelve years. Austria was formally integrated into Nazi Germany in 1938. Through the filter of subsequent decades, most available sources are silent on the details of Alois Dorn's relationship with National Socilialism during these years. According to at least one source, however, Alois Dorn became a party member in May 1938. Although he was not much of a political activist, there are instances that can be adduced to show that he was broadly sympathetic towards aspects of government policy that mainstream opinion after 1945 found deeply unpalatable. Investigation of Dorn's own archived papers indicates that in 1935 he became a member of the Reichskammer der bildenden Künste (loosely, \\"National Chamber of Visual Arts\\", the organisation for visual artists created by the party, membership of which would greatly have eased his professional progress under the dictatorship. After 1945 Dorn was released from war service: he set up a studio in his parent's house. Between 1949 and 1951 he was professionally active in Salzburg. He married Gertrud Fussenegger in 1950 The couple's son Lukas was born the next year. There were also already four children in the family from Gertrud's first marriage which had ended in divorce during the war. Between 1952 and 1960 the family lived at Solbad Hall (as the town was called between 1938 and 1974) where Gertrud had been living since 1943. In 1960 or 1961 they moved to Upper Austria, which for Alois Dorn represented a return to his roots, and where they now settled at Leonding, a small prosperous town just outside Linz. During the final decades of his life the title of \\"Professor\\" was conferred on Alois Dorn. He became a member of the Linz-based \\"MAERZ\\" arts association which had been relaunched in 1952, and was also, like his brother Conrad and his sister Johanna, a member of the \\"Inn Region Artists' Guild\\" (\\"Innviertler Künstlergilde\\") in the region of his birth, to the west of Linz. Alois Dorn died in Linz on 24 August 1985. He was buried in the cemetery by the church of St. Gallus at Gallneukirchen, which contains several examples of his art, and where at the time of his death he had recently completed his final major commission, a mosaic on the cemetery wall showing the Stations of the Cross, intended to \\"join the commemoration of the dead with the Passion of Our Lord\\". Slightly less than quarter of a century later, following the death of Gertrud Fussenegger, the mortal remains of Alois Dorn were dug up and removed to the cemetery at Leonding, near the home the couple had shared.

Early life Sage was born on October 11, 1978, in Ventura County, California. In his high school years, Sage lived in Sparks, Nevada and attended Edward C. Reed High School. Playing career Sage played as a tight end for the Sacramento City College football team in the 1998 and 1999 seasons. While Sage was at Sacramento C.C., his team won conference championships and bowl championships. Sage then transferred to Cal State Northridge. He played there as a tight end in 2000 and 2001—the program's final two seasons—and earned his bachelor's degree in kinesiology in 2002. Coaching career Sage embarked on his coaching career in 2003 as a graduate assistant at Nevada. He spent two seasons with the program, working with the defensive backs in 2003 and with the wide receivers in 2004. In 2005, Sage landed his first job as a wide receivers coach at New Hampshire, where he first met Chip Kelly, who was offensive coordinator at the time of Sage's hire. Sage mentored All-American receiver David Ball, who became the NCAA career leader in touchdown receptions, with 58, and amassed 4,655 receiving yards in his collegiate career—a school record for New Hampshire. Following a five-year stint at New Hampshire, Sage became the wide receivers coach at Wyoming in 2010. At Wyoming, Sage mentored future NFL Draft pick Robert Herron. Sage coached four all-conference receivers during his time with the Cowboys, which lasted from 2010 to 2013. In 2014, Sage became the wide receivers coach at Toledo, where he coached for three seasons. In 2016, Sage's third and final season with the Rockets, Sage oversaw a receiving corps that featured two All-Mid-American Conference receivers. The Rockets ranked seventh in the NCAA in total offense that season, averaging 517.8 yards of offense per game. The Rockets' passing offense that season averaged 322.8 yards per game, which was an improvement of over 88 yards per game from Sage's first season (2014).

Sherwood attended Mercer University in Georgia, and then Shurtleff College. He graduated from Cincinnati Law School in 1857 and was admitted to the bar in Missouri the same year. He commenced the practice of law at Springfield, Mo., in 1864, and soon entered into an extensive practice in the circuit courts as well as in the supreme court. Sherwood was elected to the supreme court in 1872, for a term or ten years, under an amendment of the constitution adopted in 1865. The term of supreme judges had previously been for six years, but under the amendment, the number of judges was increased from three to five, and the terms were extended to ten years. At his election in 1872 Judge Sherwood received the highest vote of the five persons in nomination, he was elected for ten years, while others were elected for shorter terms. Sherwood was also named chief justice, because he was the oldest in commission at the time the act went into force. He ceased to be the oldest in commission on January 1, 1883, when Judge Warwick Hough became chief justice. Sherwood was twice reelected to the court, in 1882 and 1892.

It implies two other degree-based sufficient conditions, Dirac's theorem on Hamiltonian cycles and Ore's theorem. Unlike those conditions, it can be applied to graphs with a small number of low-degree vertices. It is named after Lajos Pósa, a protégé of Paul Erdős born in 1947, who discovered this theorem in 1962. The Pósa condition for a finite undirected graph G having n vertices requires that, if the degrees of the n vertices in increasing order as :d_{1} \\\\leq d_{2} \\\\leq ... \\\\leq d_{n}, then for each index k < n/2 the inequality k < d_{k} is satisfied. Pósa's theorem states that if a finite undirected graph satisfies the Pósa condition, then that graph has a Hamiltonian cycle in it.

Biography   Early life  Amin Nakhlé was born in the town of Majdal Maouche in the Chouf district on 25 July 1901. He is the son of Rachid Nakhlé who was nicknamed \\"the Prince the zajal\\" and was author of the Lebanese National Anthem.

After that, he completed his studies at the University of Damascus (Faculty of Law) and at the French College of Beirut. A graduate in administrative law, he practiced as a lawyer from 1928 and as a journalist. He is the owner and editorialist of newspapers and became MP for Mount Lebanon in 1947. He is also a poet and literary man since 1920. He was a member of the Arab Academy from 1967. He obtained a good job in the office of the French Governor-General, but he rejected it and went to the law firm.

He had a sister named Marcel wife of George Faya. Among his works are his long story Muhsin al-Hazzan and his popular poetry collected by his son Amin Nakhle as Mu’anna Rashid Nakhle.  Death  At the end of his life, Amin Nakhla worked on his memories, and involved his pain with his companion.He suffered a brain haemorrhage that led to his loss of memory, and his friends and supporters gradually separated from him, until he died in silence, without a farewell or memorial service, on 13 May 1976. In Beirut at the age of 75, he was buried in his ancestral country in Barouk Lebanon [2]. It was planned to pay tribute to two last-minute concerts, the first following the assassination of Kamal Nasser and his group by Israeli intelligence, and the second because of the 1975 civil war in Lebanon.  Works   Poetry  Amin Nakhlé's poetry is characterized by sweetness and tenderness and was echoed in the literary and poetic circles. This has increased because of his relations with the great poets of his time in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq: This is the crown prince and assess the poetry after me And the era of the Secretary of the best and early Saad Whoever said poetry in people is Abdi Abdi On this occasion, Amin Nakhleh himself said that one day, the mail carried a letter addressed to the \\"Prince of Poets\\". The message continued to pass from one great poet to another without anyone daring to receive it. Amin Nakhla was a prose beside his hair, and his prose was elegance and ease abstained, and the topics addressed by Amin Nakhla in his poetry and prose three: spinning, nature and death. It is his hair in the yarn saying: I love you in despair and wishful thinking as if I became of you, and became of me I love you above what I expanded my ribs and over the reach of my hand, and reach my thought Feeling groggy, tendering, divorced, on the plain of the reassuring youth He was obsessed with death in many hours of the day and night, and in many of his positions laments himself when he laments others. He said in his poem \\"After Youth\\" The youth and his soft age are gone Is it back to the dice again and to me my next living In the last Dimna, his neighbor, me every day a funeral exists I rush to leave, and my companions preceded me on their news wanderer Nature has inspired him with a lot of poetry and prose, and devoted a book entitled \\"rural notebook\\" and was characterized by the beauty of his style and elegance, in which he regains a daily image abounds in the countryside simply and spontaneously. It is prose in his book saying: (A loaf enters the oven of the estate, and a thousand loaf comes out of it, my beloved, there is no God what I saw my eyes a loaf has red Khaddk, nor saw my loaf has burned as my heart). He used to believe that the county-side will disappear in the future  Awards  In 1965, he won the President of the Lebanese Republic Award for Best Book of the Year  Other works  Amine Nakhlé only wrote one book in 1942 called al-mufakkira al-rifiyya, that talked about the innocence that presided over the people that live in the country- side versus the people that live in the city. Once the book was released it was viewed as a discursive event in the arabic world. In the book he encourages rural life because he believed that the city life was always about gaining more. When he published some chapters of his Mufakkira in the press he chose a pseudonym which was Fuad Effendi since he believed that the author should show himself through his works not necessarily by his name.

Key players included halfbacks Twillie Bellamy and Jim Jackson, fullback John Turner, end Bill Elliott, tackle Gladstone Booth, guard Leroy Way, and center Kermit Booker. In post-season discussions about the black college football national championship, Shaw was criticized for a weak strength of schedule, having failed to schedule games against the three CIAA opponents that were ranked in the top 10 under the Dickinson Rating System: Hampton (No. 4), Virginia State (No. 7), and Morgan State (No. 9). In the final Dickinson ratings, Tennessee A&I; was determined as the black college national champion with Shaw in fifth place.

It crosses the Severomuysky Range and will go along the ‘first’ Severomuysky Tunnel constructed in 1975-2003. The new tunnel will allow to increase the annual freight capacity of that particular part of the BAM from 16 to 100 million tons. The construction started in August 2019.  History  In 2010, the Russian Railways president Vladimir Yakunin announced his ambitious plan to reconstruct the BAM to reach a freight capacity of 100 million tons by 2050. The main obstacle was the worst ‘bottleneck’ of the BAM — the aging one-way Severomuysky Tunnel.https://www.gazeta.ru/business/2019/12/02/12831566.shtml «Великое будущее»: как расширят БАМ и Транссиб] The idea to build a new tunnel was first made public in the summer of 2018. In November, it was announced that the second tunnel would add another 68 daily trains to today’s 38, and the budget for the new tunnel construction was estimated at 190 billion rubles, excluding VAT ($2.89 billion). In March 2019, Dmitry Bosov, the owner of Siberian Anthracite Group, sent a letter to the Russian president Vladimir Putin, proposing to build the new tunnel in 5 years and privately finance it in exchange for the Group’s priority access to the BAM and the Trans-Siberian Railway to transport 50 mln tons of cargo annually for the next 25 years. Such a deal will allow Sibanthracite to significantly increase its delivery of anthracite and metallurgical coal to the Pacific Rim. The content of the letter was disclosed by Vedomosti, a Russian business daily. Dmitry Bosov suggested that Sibanthracite Group will require 60 billion rubles ($0.92 billion) to construct the new tunnel.  Concession  According to the Russian Railways president Oleg Belozyorov, his colleagues together with the Federal Agency for Railway Transport, the Ministry of Transport, and the Federal Antimonopoly Service are still working on forming a public-private partnership that would legitimise the proposed ‘concession with lease’ and still provide Russian companies with a non-discriminatory access to the railways.  Construction  Sibanthracite Group commissioned a US company The Robbins to design and construct two tunnel boring machines Crossover XRE. On August 20, 2019, the pre-construction work began on the site. The excavation of 10,3 m wide tunnel will begin from two sides: from the Western portal in October 2020 and from the Eastern portal in January 2021. Based on the experience of the excavation of the ‘first’ tunnel, Russian specialists claim that the Severomuysky Range is one of the most complicated subjects for the tunnel excavation.

It is characterized as a tubular fossil found in the Nama group (570-543 Ma) of South West Africa. The lobe projecting from the lower part of the bedding plane On a slab of quartzite Description Archaeichnium is a tube-shaped fossil that may be preserved as hollow or infilled tubes. The overall shape of the tube is slightly tapered at one end so that it is vaguely conical. The structure is typically between 3-5 cm long with a 0.5 cm diameter, and the walls of the tube are 0.1 cm thick. Typically, the tubes exhibit longitudinal ribbing on the exterior, which creates 10-12 distinct \\"ribs\\". Archaeichnium also has latitudinal restrictions that organize it into approximately three sections cranio-caudally. When cross-sectioned, the tube lacks septae. The fossil is typically found in cross-bedded sandstone that is interpreted as a shallow marine depositional environment. Walls of the tube are typically agglutinated with small quartz grains. Diversity Archaeichnium haughtoni is the only described species of Archaeichnium. Discovery The rock containing the fossil that would eventually be named Archaeichnium haughtoni was first discovered in 1927 by Dr. H. F. Frommurze and S. H. Haughton while the two were doing geological mapping in Southwest Africa. The rock was found in the Nama group of Cambrian age in Central/ Southern Namibia. In 1959, Haughton published the paper that described the fossils as early archaeocyathids, a taxon of sedentary reef-building organisms that doesn't usually appear in the fossil record until the late Cambrian. However, in 1963 Martin Glaessner revisited the rocks and determined that the fossilized animals did not actually distinctly possess the features that would classify it as an archaeocyathid, nor did he find it to share features with any known species. Glaessner dubbed the fossil anew as Archaeichnium haughtoni Distribution Archaeichnium fossils are found in the Nasep quartzite stratigraphic unit within the Nama group at the following sites: * Nevada, United States of America * Namibia, Africa * Nilpena, Australia See also * List of Ediacaran genera * Ediacaran biota * Nama group References Category:Index fossils Category:Cambrian sponges Category:Ediacaran first appearances ","title":"Archaeichnium"},{"id":"62501616","text":"During the 2019–20 season, PSV participated in the Eredivisie, the KNVB Cup, the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League and the Johan Cruyff Shield.

She is sometimes known as Hava or Hana of Manosque. As one of many Jewish medical practitioners during the Middle Ages, Fava apparently received her training from family members. She was part of a prominent medical family with her mother (Astrugus), husband, son (Bonafos) and two grandsons also practicing surgery. At the time, medical training was restricted. \\"Since they were not allowed into the medical schools, Jewish doctors, both male and female, learned through apprenticeship to other doctors.\\" They were known to treat the maladies of Christian men and women as well as members of the Jewish community. In late 1321 or early 1322 Fava was charged with inappropriately treating a Christian man with injuries to his testicles, which were described at the time as \\"the most intimate organs of his body.\\" In court, she was asked if she had palpated the wound, but she denied this saying she had merely described the procedure to her son, Bonafos, who had conducted all physical contact with the patient, though she had examined the wound and dictated the medicines used in the procedure.

Spanning several centuries of the history of the city of Shanghai, it is one of the longest novels ever published. While Shanghai was written as a stand-alone story, it includes cameo appearances by young versions of characters who appear in Rotenberg's detective series set in contemporary Shanghai. Shanghai received critical acclaim and sold well worldwide. Shanghai Theatre Academy Map of Shanghai, 1884 Synopsis With his last breath, Q'in She Huang, the first Emperor of China, entrusts his followers with a sacred task in the year 207 BCE. Scenes intricately carved into a narwhal tusk show the future of a city \\"at the Bend in the River,\\" and the Emperor's chosen three — his favourite concubine, head Confucian, and personal bodyguard — must set events in motion so that these prophecies are fulfilled, by passing their traditions down through the generations. About two thousand years later, in the mid 19th century, the descendants of the chosen three watch as Shanghai is invaded by opium traders and missionaries from Europe, America, and the Middle East. Of them all, two families, locked in a rivalry that lasts for generations, are central to the evolution of the city. As history marches on, they clash and intertwine with other locals and foreigners, shaping what will become the centrepiece of the new China, the city of Shanghai. One family is that of Silas Hardoon, an Iraqi Jew at the centre of more than one scandal, marrying his Chinese mistress and later adopting nearly forty neighbourhood orphans. Hardoon and his heirs become a force to be reckoned with from the 1880s to the 1940s. Publication history Background In 1994, David Rotenberg was invited to direct the first Canadian play to be staged in the People's Republic of China. Rotenberg mounted a production of The Ecstasy of Rita Joe in Mandarin at the Shanghai Theatre Academy at a time when China was going through a \\"massive transition from a profoundly oppressive socialist state to a basically free market economy – a thrilling time\\". Rotenberg had six weeks until rehearsals began, and used this time to explore the city with his translator: \\"Instead of visiting all the usual tourist sites, he went into all the small, dark alleys and chalked up impressions.\\" Rotenberg recalled: \\"Here was a city that was actively involved in moving from being ignored by the great powers in Beijing to becoming the centre of Asian capitalism... You could feel it all around you. Some of my actors would leave rehearsals because they were setting up kiosks to sell produce on the street.\\" The experience led to him beginning what became his second career, writing the Zhong Fong mystery series set primarily in contemporary Shanghai. Publisher and commission Just before the latest Zhong Fong novel, The Golden Mountain Murders, was published in 2005, Rotenberg received a lunch invitation from Penguin Canada publisher David Davidar and assumed that they would be discussing a sixth Zhong Fong novel, but Davidar had other ideas. \\"He wanted to know if I could do for Shanghai what James Clavell did for Hong Kong. It gave me pause because I love Clavell's writing.\\" Davidar has said he had \\"long admired\\" how well the Zhong Fong novels were written, and how they convey a \\"sense of place\\". Whereas the kinds of sagas James Clavell and James A. Michener wrote had since \\"fallen out of fashion,\\" making the idea \\"a risky proposition\\", yet it was still a \\"publisher's dream\\". Format Rotenberg wrote Shanghai as three novels, and always counted them as such, even after Penguin decided to issue the work as a single volume for publication in 2008. At about 800,000 words, Shanghai is one of the longest novels ever published; Rotenberg said he received complaints from readers that it was \\"too heavy for them to carry around\\". Silas Hardoon (1851–1931) Inspiration, genre, and writing David Rotenberg said the inspiration for the novel was a line in a children's book about Silas Hardoon, an Iraqi Jewish opium trader who married his Chinese mistress: \\"That line was the genesis of Shanghai: The Ivory Compact.\\" Rotenberg's portrayal is quite different from what is known about the historical figure: he was \\"much more of a bad guy in reality, someone who would threaten people if they didn't pay the rent on time. But the novel needed a more sympathetic main character, and since there aren't too many details known about him or his life, I had more creative licence.\\" To that end, emphasis is placed on the character being \\"caught between his Jewish roots and his new home's ancient philosophies,\\" and he is witness to his father Richard's \\"crippling\\" addiction. The bulk of the novel spans the history of Shanghai from the Opium Wars in the mid-19th century through to the Chinese Communist Revolution roughly a century later, mixing fact and fiction. Rotenberg compared his novel to Philip Roth's The Plot Against America, a \\"counterfactual\\" historical narrative that imagines a Nazi takeover of the United States in the 1930s. \\"This goes the other way... These were the events of Chinese history. But it imagines that the reasons behind those events are different from the ones historians have given. The novel postulates a series of other forces at work.\\" Rotenberg did \\"extensive research\\", thereby allowing him to address \\"difficult subjects\\" such as the practice of foot binding, depicted in what Sarah Weinman calls a \\"horrifying scene\\" in which a young girl reacts stoically to the process: the description is \\"rooted in verisimilitude from consulting doctors on the precise procedure\\". Likewise, Rotenberg did not describe the six-week-long Nanking massacre until he learned more about it: > I hesitated to write about it for a long, long, time because it is such a > largescale human event. But then I saw a photo exhibit in London about the > massacre, where I learned about 18 American missionaries who convinced the > Japanese to mark a safe zone in Nanking, and found my way in. At the same > time, I wanted to be careful not to portray the Japanese as outright > monsters. Reception Commercial performance By September 2008, Shanghai had acquired foreign rights sales as far afield as Bulgaria, Australia, and Russia. It reached the 9th position on The Globe and Mail's National List of Canadian Bestsellers in June 2009. Critical response Stephen Patrick Clare asserts that the novel's success demonstrated that Rotenberg could \\"break away from convention without loosening his hold on the imagination of his readers.\\" Sarah Weinman described Shanghai as \\"jam-packed with story and adventure\\". Jurgen Gothe calls it \\"a massive, fascinating, and powerful book that spans genres, maybe confounds them\\", and asserts that Rotenberg \\"possesses a prodigious memory for atmosphere and place, and good research skills.\\" > What makes Shanghai so readable and well paced is the unique mix Rotenberg > throws into the ring: grace, style, sensitivity, anger, questions... And so > the story comes out dreamy and hallucinatory, mysterious and mystical, > spiritual and ghostly; comic at times, from lyrical subtlety to total > slapstick. Shanghai is heart-pounding and brutal. It puts you right into the > thick of the city, its people, its passions. Adaptations Shanghai: The Ivory Compact has been reported as being optioned both in the U.S., and in Canada, by Darius Films and by Jane McLean for television as recently as late 2018. Related works Zhong Fong Though Shanghai is not part of the Zhong Fong series, the character nevertheless makes a cameo appearance towards the end of the novel as a four- year-old. Sequel In 2008, Rotenberg talked about the possibility of a sequel to Shanghai set in post-Second World War Shanghai, contingent on a return visit to the city for more research. However, when Rotenberg was approached by Simon & Schuster \\"to write something other than about China\\", after what amounted to \\"eight novels about and around China\\" (Rotenberg counting Shanghai as three novels), he was \\"ready for a change\\", prompting the writing of the Toronto-set Junction Chronicles series.

(All the world is subject to Austria). His successor Emperor Maximilian I expanded Habsburg territories and did so with marriages rather than war, thus establishing the motto \\"Bella gerunt alii, tu felix Austria nube\\" (\\"let others wage war; you, happy Austria, marry\\"). Charles V notably attempted to actually enforce the hegemonical peace in Europe. Further attempts to establish a Pax Habsburgica in Europe continued until the 30 years war.

It is divided into ancient, medieval and new. The city is known mostly for Konstantin Dragash, whose name bears. Constantine Dragash is the grandfather of the last Roman emperor (Constantine XI Dragases Palaiologos) and at the same time the great- great-grandfather of the first Russian tsar (Ivan the Terrible). Kyustendil is also known in military history for the Battle of Velbazhd. In Ottoman times the city was the Ottoman military capital in Europe,Edirne is symbolic and the place where the Ottoman military campaigns began in Europe. Sofia is the administrative center of Beylerbeylik of Rumeli, and Skopje is the largest Ottoman city in Europe and a place for Uch (ottoman military corridor) to conquer Serbian and Greek lands. However, the Sanjak of Kyustendil /the former Province of the Dejanović family/ remains with the largest contingent in the Ottoman army at all times. and during the First World War—the Bulgarian military capital. Rila Monastery is located on the territory of the Kyustendil Province. The city, especially because of its historical significance, was specially visited by the first person to take off in space—Yuri Gagarin.  Before Christ  Thracian tribes inhabiting the area around the city are participants in the Trojan War on the side of Troy. A Thracian settlement was founded at the place of the modern town in the 5th-4th centuries BC and was known for its asclepion, a shrine dedicated to medicine god Asclepius (the second largest in the Balkans, after the one in Epidaurus). Dentheletae in the period 186 BC – 16 BC are allied to the Romans and assist in the conquest of neighboring Macedonia by the Romans, fighting against Perseus of Macedon. In 55 BC in the famous speech of Cicero before the Roman Senate against Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC), who is still governor of Macedonia (57–55 BC), criticizes the Roman governor of Macedonia that by his unwise policy made the Dentheletae of Rome's most loyal subjects into the most eminent enemies.  New era  Under the name Pautalia ( or Πανταλία) it was a town in the district of Dentheletica. Pautalia obtained town rights in 106 with Serdica, Philippopolis and Augustae Traiana in the Roman province of Thrace. In the reign of Hadrian, the people both of Pautalia and Serdica added Ulpia to the name of their town, probably in consequence of some benefit received from that emperor. Stephanus of Byzantium has a district called Paetalia (Παιταλία), which he assigns to Thrace, probably a false reading. In the 1st century AD, it was administratively part of Macedonia. Later the city was part of the province of Dacia Mediterranea and the third largest city in the province. From the end of the 2nd century to the beginning of the 3rd century Pautalia cut his bronze coins (more than 900 species have been found so far) with testimonials on them and on the emperors Septimius Severus with Julia Domna and Caracalla. The Roman fortress of Pautalia of the 2nd to 4th century had an area of over 29 hectares (appr. 72 acres). The fortress wall was built mainly of granite blocks and unusually its façade was supported with pillars and arches behind. The wall was 2.5m wide allowing small catapults to be mounted atop. A second, smaller fortress of area 2 hectares was built in the town in the 4th century (known by its later Ottoman name Hisarlaka). Recent excavations have revealed an early Christian, late Roman monumental bishop's palace.Archaeology in Bulgaria  Middle Ages  In the Razmetanitsa locality, east of the town, were located the father lands of Cometopuli dynasty, and in Tsarichina (locality) /Palatovo/—the summer residence of Tsar Samuil. The town was mentioned under the Slavic name of Velbazhd in a 1019 charter by the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. It became a major religious and administrative centre of the Byzantine Empire, and subsequently the Second Bulgarian Empire after Kaloyan conquered the area between 1201 and 1203. In 1282, king Stefan Milutin defeated the Byzantine Empire and conquered Velbazhd.  Ottoman era  Skopje was set on fire and the city was attacked by the Hajduks of Strahil voivode. Mehmed the Conqueror sat with his viziers in the city. Despite his faith, he is one of the Ktetors of the Osogovo Monastery. A traveling knight reports that in 1499 the Ottoman sultan kept his harem in the city. The city was a sanjak centre initially in Rumelia governorate-general, after that in the Bitola and Niš vilayets (province). It was a kaza centre in the Sofia sanjak of Danube Province until the creation of the Principality of Bulgaria in 1878. In 1561 and in 1655 the city was struck by the plague. In 1585 and in 1641 the city was destroyed by two major earthquakes.  Modern  By the 20th century the town extended south of the Banska River. He had four gates called kapı – Palanechka /to Kriva Palanka/ to the west; Niška to the north /to Niš/; Stambolska to the east /to Istanbul/ and Granitska to the south /to the Granitsa, Kyustendil Province/. The city is the military capital of Bulgaria during the two world wars. In 1916, Kyustendil was visited by Field Marshal August von Mackensen and Gustav Stresemann. In May 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Emperor Charles I of Austria was here, and on September 9, 1918, the Bavarian King Ludwig III of Bavaria.Доц. д-р Ангел Джонев: Кюстендил е военната столица на България по време на Първата световна война Adolf Hitler was also in Kyustendil during the First World War. He was treated between October 1916 and March 1917 at a military hospital in the city during his service on the Macedonian front, to which the 11th Army, composed mainly of Bavarians, was deployed.Адолф Хитлер е бил в Кюстендил по време на Първата световна война. Since 1966, every year on March 21, the city celebrates its holiday called \\"Kyustendil Spring\\". On June 11, 1966, Yuri Gagarin visited the city, symbolically planting a tree. In 1977 the city center was declared an Architectural and archeological reserve \\"Pautalia – Velbazhd\\".

The exact extent of these blocs has never been defined or agreed upon. Origin and development of the term Usage is found in peace negotiations at Camp David in July 2000 and subsequently in The Clinton Parameters According to a 2001 Foundation for Middle East Peace report, Israel’s Final Status Map at Taba, is both \\"conceptually and territorially reminiscent of\\" the 1995 Beilin–Abu Mazen agreement that established a Palestinian willingness to consider trading settlement blocs for equivalent Israeli land.Report on Israeli Settlement in the Occupied Territories, https://fmep.org/wp/wp- content/uploads/2015/01/11.2.pdf 2001 p=4 Palestinian leaders have accepted the principle of swaps although neither they nor the United States have ever agreed on a delineation of the blocs. 2000 and 2001 Starting with Camp David, Palestinians agreed (while differing on the size and location of swaps) Israel could annex some settlement blocs (including Ariel in the north, some parts of the Latrun salient, and the Etzion bloc near Bethlehem) as well as Israeli/Jewish settlements established in East Jerusalem since 1967 such as Gilo, Neve Ya'acov, and Pisgat Ze'ev At Camp David, Israel offered to establish a sovereign Palestinian state encompassing the Gaza Strip, 92 percent of the West Bank (91 percent of the West Bank plus the equivalent of 1 percent of the West Bank in land from pre-1967 Israel), and some parts of Arab East Jerusalem. The Palestinians used a total area of 5,854 square kilometers whereas Israel excluded the area known as No Man's Land (50 sq. km near Latrun), post-1967 East Jerusalem (71 sq. km), and the territorial waters of the Dead Sea (195 sq. km) giving 5,538 sq. km. So 91% of 5,538 sq. km of the West Bank translated into 86% from the Palestinian standpoint. 2003 The Geneva initiative includes land swaps of 2.2 percent, with the settlement blocs of Gush Etzion (excluding Efrat), Ma’aleh Adumim (excluding \\"E1\\"), Modi’in Ilit and Givat Ze’ev becoming part of Israel. 2008 As part of the Annapolis plan, Olmert proposed annexing all the major settlement blocs (about 5.9 percent of the West Bank territory), in exchange for 5.2 percent of Israeli territory whereas Abbas proposed giving Israel 1.6 percent of the West Bank in exchange for 2 percent of Israeli territory. Abbas did not include Ma’aleh Adumim or Givat Ze’ev but did agree to Modi’in Ilit and Gush Etzion (excluding Efrat). Alan Dowty makes use of the Palestine Papers to refer to a \\"Summary of Olmert's Package Offer to Abu Mazen\\" of August 31, 2008,http://www.ajtransparency.com/files/4736.pdf based on information provided by Palestinian spokesperson Saeb Erekat, to describe an offer whereby Israel would annex 6.8% (calculated excluding No Man's Land and East Jerusalem and including Gush Etzion (with Efrat), Ma'ale Adumim, Givat Ze'ev and Ariel as well all settlements in East Jerusalem) in exchange for 5.5% of Israeli territory. 2015 Meeting with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, Netanyahu voices willingness for the first time since taking office to discuss size of settlement blocs and their borders with Palestinians. In a report using data through 2015, Haaretz, without specifying how it had defined settlement blocs, gave the total number of settlers in blocs in the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem) as 214,459 (56% of 382,916) located in 19 (of 125) settlements (excluding outposts). 2017 The \\"Greater Jerusalem\\" law was introduced in 2016 and intended to include (but not annex) five settlement blocks (Ma’aleh Adumim, Gush Etzion, Efrat, Beitar Illit and Givat Ze’ev, 19 settlements), about 150,000 settlers, within Jerusalem’s municipal jurisdiction. International pressure, mainly from the United States, resulted in the draft bill being withdrawn from consideration in October, 2017. 2019 Speaking at a public conference on December 8, 2019, Netanyahu said: > I think the time has come to extend Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan > Valley, and also arrange the status of all the settlements in Judea and > Samaria, those inside the settlement blocks, and those that are not in the > blocs. They will be part of the state of Israel.

In a historic pro-democracy landslide in 2019 District Council election, the group won a total of four seats in the Tuen Mun District Council.  History  The group was formed in 2015 as a Tuen Mun-based community group by a group of young people in their 20s to early 30s. It was notable for their involvement in revealing the scandal of the high repairing cost of the elevators in Leung King Estate and a protest caused by hawkers issue in 2016. It was part of the Community Network Union, a localist political alliance of six community groups led by pro-independence Ventus Lau. Due to its association with independence movement, its convenor Wong Tan-ching was deported from Macau in May 2017. The Tuen Mun Community Network later quit the Union in 2018. Tuen Mun Community Network was also active in social activism. In 2017, it organised more than 13,000 people signing a petition demanding pro-Beijing legislator Junius Ho who was a member Tuen Mun District Council to resign over his remarks on killing independence advocates. In the 2019 anti-extradition bill protests, the group also arranged coaches to drive residents to Hong Kong Island to join the June 9 protest. Tuen Mun Community Network filled five candidates in the 2019 District Council election, with Poon Chi-kin in Tsui Hing, Wong Tan-ching in Shan King, Law Cheuk-yung in King Hing, Tsang Chun-hing in Hing Tsak and Wong Tak-yuen in Leung King. Four of the five candidates were elected in the pro-democracy historic landslide victory except for Law Cheuk-yung who lost in King Hing, which saw the pro- democrats gaining control of the Tuen Mun District Council and the group becoming the third largest grouping.
