Today it's a residential area with a very few palm trees remaining. == Location == Ezbet El Nakhl is lodged between the Ain Shams and El Marg districts. The district has old Coptic Churches which is St. Virgin Mary Church -Ezbet El Nakhl. == About == Ezbet El Nakhl is partly a slum. One part belongs to the Cairo Governorate and the other to the Qalyubia Governorate. Being divided between two governorates means services like education and health are unreliable.

The church's name refers to the ancient Christian belief that the mother of Jesus Christ was Theotokos or \\"God-bearer.\\" The church spire towers 197 feet (60 m) above street level making it a prominent landmark and the tallest building in the historic German Village neighborhood south of downtown Columbus. With the rest of German Village, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 30, 1974. ==Early history and construction== In the year 1865, approximately one third of the Columbus population was ethnically German due to decades of immigration. Many German immigrants settled in the South End neighborhood (as German Village was then called). The Catholic population had outgrown nearby Holy Cross Church and the German-speaking South End residents wanted their own parish. It was in that same year, St. Mary's parish was formed with the newly ordained Fr. Francis X. Sprecht as its first pastor. Construction began in 1866 and the church was dedicated two years later by Bishop Sylvester Rosecrans on November 29, 1868. The spire was erected in 1893 at a price of $5,000 (.) The clock was installed the next year. ==InteriorChancel=== The white walnut reredos behind the main altar is 20 feet wide and 45 feet tall. Carved by Allard Klooter in 1866 at a cost of $2,500, it was moved to St. Mary Church from another church in Cincinnati. As the church patroness, a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary stands in the center of the reredos. It is flanked on the left by a statue of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, and on the right by Saint Boniface. All of these statues are made of carved wood. The crucifix hanging from the dome of the apse is 10 feet wide and 12 feet long, with a symbol representing one of the four Gospels at each extremity. Created by a parishioner, it was first hung in the church during the early 1930s. ===Stained glass windows=== The original stained glass windows in the church building were composed of religious symbols and geometric designs. Some of these can still be found in stairways, the choir loft, the sacristy, and in the vestibule. The original windows along the north and south walls of the nave have been replaced with windows depicting saints and the life of Jesus Christ. :{  + ! colspan=12  Subjects of the pictorial stained glass windows as arranged from east to west - !

The ceiling was originally painted in the 1890s and restored in 1987. Munich native, Gerhart Lemars, executed the sanctuary paintings between 1930 and 1935. The apse ceiling depicts a Trinitarian rendering of the Eye of Providence. Oval symbols running vertically near the face of the apse represent salvation. Angels holding instruments of the Passion of Christ stand over a Latin phrase taken from the Adoration of the Cross portion of the Roman Catholic Good Friday liturgy. Translated, it says, ‚ÄúBehold the wood of the cross on which hung the salvation of the world‚Ä¶ Faithful cross, most noble tree of all.‚Äù Oil frescos are located over the side altars flanking the sanctuary.

The current pastor, Father Kevin Lutz, regaled onlookers in downtown Columbus and German Village with hymns played on the 48-bell carillon. The motorcade reenacted the November 1868 procession which preceded the church's dedication. ==Closure and restoration== On Sunday, August 28, 2016, lightning struck the church building. On Friday, October 7, 2016 structural engineers recommended St. Mary Church temporarily condemned due to significant damage to the roof trusses, exterior brick, and ceiling. While under repairs, Masses were held in the St. Mary School gymnasium, with special Masses held at Saint Leo Church in Merion Village. The parish used the closure as an opportunity to renovate and restore nearly the entire church. The parish funded the project via a $7.5 million capital campaign with support from Columbus community leaders. Architect William Heyer and general contractor Corna Kokosing executed the project, which according to Fr. Kevin Lutz, ‚Äú‚Ä¶encompassed the roof, the foundations, wall supports, choir supports, new front stairs, a prayer garden, a new sidewalk, rewiring the entire church, new heating, ventilating and air conditioning system, a new church and sanctuary floor, repainting the statues, and restoration of the confessionals, baptistery and Piet√† shrine‚Ä¶ For financial reasons, the original plan also did not include work on our stained-glass windows. But when they were looked at more closely, we realized they had to come out for re- leading. These are the kind of previously unknown issues that add layers to the original task.‚Äù EverGreene Architectural Arts (Brooklyn, New York) and Martin Painting and Coating (Grove City, Ohio) jointly restored the painted ceiling with digitally printed canvasses. The order of the images was rotated 180 degrees so that the reflective images are near the sanctuary and the tower images are near the church's tower. Matthew Indrutz of Muralworks (Columbus, Ohio) painted additional interior decoration. The church reopened for worship on April 19, 2019 for the Palm Sunday Vigil Mass. == Gallery == File:Saint Mary of the Assumption Church (Columbus, Ohio) - nave after 2019 restoration.jpg File:Saint Mary of the Assumption Church (Columbus, Ohio) - sanctuary after the 2019 restoration.jpg File:Saint Mary of the Assumption Church (Columbus, Ohio) - confessional after 2019 restoration.jpg File:Saint Mary of the Assumption Church (Columbus, Ohio) - baptismal font after 2019 restoration.jpg File:Saint Mary of the Assumption Church (Columbus, Ohio) - ambo after 2019 restoration.jpg File:Saint Mary of the Assumption (German Village, C-bus, Ohio) - reredos, detail, St. Catherine of Alexandria, the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Boniface.jpg File:Saint Mary of the Assumption Church (Columbus, Ohio) - interior, crucifix.jpg File:Saint Mary of the Assumption (German Village, C-bus, Ohio) - ceiling, Litany of Mary, Vessel of Honor.jpg ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Columbus, Ohio Category:Roman Catholic churches in Columbus, Ohio Category:Churches completed in 1893 Category:Historic district contributing properties in Ohio Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:German Village ","title":"Saint Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church"},{"id":"46885703","text":"Rachel Miriam Marcia Free Rinast (born 2 June 1991) is a Swiss footballer who plays as a defender for 1.

She has collaborated with artists Vieux Farka Tour√©, Bill T. Jones, Kris Bowers, Shahzad Ismaily, Bobby McFerrin, and Alex Toth of Rubblebucket, among many others. She has also worked as a co- writer and contributing vocalist with Mason Jar Music for The New York Times. Her early work entails extensive use of a BOSS RC-50 loop pedal to compose and perform wide-ranging a'capella music for a single voice. She departed from this style briefly in 2015 with the release of Touristes, her collaborative project with Malian guitarist and singer Vieux Farka Tour√©. In 2017, Easterlin set her loop pedal aside indefinitely to release her first full-length solo album: an acoustic chamber-pop work Light of a Strange Day, under the moniker Hite. The album was produced by Shahzad Ismaily and Charles Van Kirk and released to critical acclaim. In 2019, Easterlin joined the touring ensemble for dream-pop artist Barrie as a bassist and background vocalist. She currently lives in Brooklyn, New York. ==Biography== Born into a musical family, Julia Easterlin cites her mother's singing and her grandfather's gift of a piano as formative parts of her musical experience. She enrolled in a school of fine arts after moving to Augusta, Georgia at age 6 where she learned about world music, jazz, and opera. Later, in 2007, she started studying at Berklee College of Music on a full merit scholarship. Her accomplishments have included performing as part of the TEDxWomen L.A. event in 2011, being named one of only 20 U.S. Presidential Scholars in the Arts in 2008, and performing at the Stockholm Jazz Festival in 2015. As of fall 2014 she has also played in 10 Sofar Sounds shows. Known for her looping technique, Easterlin uses primarily a BOSS RC-50 loop station, a Shure SM58 vocal mic, and, sometimes, a floor tom. The vocal looping technique has since been popularized by tUnE-yArDs, Andrew Bird, and Imogen Heap. Easterlin's experimental style can be described as a combination of several different musical genres which she came across through her education and upbringing such as jazz, gospel, and Southern folk. She has named Bj√∂rk and Philip Glass as influences. In 2017, Easterlin began pushing her music outside the realm of her usual looping and layering with the release of \\"Light Of A Strange Day\\" via Six Degrees Records. Featuring baroque pop and Appalachian folk music elements, the acoustic album soars with lyrical expression, focusing on storytelling rather than the twirling and twisting of sound. The result is a whole new kind of musical work for Easterlin which John Schaefer of NPR Music calls \\"at once lovely and unsettling... a striking debut.\\" This departure from her previous use of looping also marks a departure from her artistic identification as Julia Easterlin, hence the use of her new pseudonym \\"Hite.\\" She explains that \\"releasing [the record] under the Julia Easterlin name (which is so attached to loops and upbeat, poppy vocal music) felt somehow‚Ä¶ dishonest. It's been a decade since I wrote my first piece of looped vocal music, and I needed a fresh new home for my new music, so different from previous work.\\" When it came to choosing a new name, the choice seemed obvious; \\"Hite\\" is her middle name and her great-grandmother's maiden name. ==Discography== * Go Straightaway!

He is currently playing with the Binghamton Devils of the American Hockey League (AHL). Paliotta was selected by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 3rd round (70th overall) of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. ==Playing career== As a youth, Paliotta played in the 2006 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the New York Rangers minor ice hockey team. On March 26, 2015, the Chicago Blackhawks signed Paliotta to two-year contract, and on April 11, 2015 he made his NHL debut skating against the Colorado Avalanche in the Blackhawks' final game of the 2014‚Äì15 regular season. Paliotta was among the Blackhawks train on squad during the playoffs, in which the Blackhawks claimed their third championship in six years. His tenure with Chicago was short-lived as on June 30, 2015, he was included in the trade of Brandon Saad to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Jeremy Morin, Marko Dano, Artem Anisimov, Corey Tropp and a fourth-round draft pick in 2016. After one season with the Blue Jackets, and having completed his entry-level contract, Paliotta was not tendered a qualifying offer to remain with the club. As a free agent Paliotta was signed to a one-year, two-way contract with the New York Rangers on July 1, 2016. He spent the duration of the 2016‚Äì17 season, with AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. On July 14, 2017, Paliotta signed as a free agent to a one-year AHL contract with the Toronto Marlies. He appeared in 8 scoreless games with the Marlies to start the 2017‚Äì18 season before he was traded to the Texas Stars on January 11, 2018. Paliotta went un-signed from the Texas Stars over the summer, before agreeing as a free agent to a one-year AHL contract with the Stockton Heat, affiliate to the Calgary Flames on September 14, 2018. In the 2018‚Äì19 season, Pailotta recorded 4 assists in 32 games from the blueline for the Heat. At the conclusion of his contract with the Heat, Paliotta familiarly continued his journeyman career, agreeing to a one-year AHL contract with the Binghamton Devils, affiliate to the New Jersey Devils, on August 29, 2019. ==Career statisticsRegular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text- align:center; width:60em;\\" - e0e0e0;\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"101\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"101\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - e0e0e0;\\" !

Photograph by L√©opold-√âmile Reutlinger. C√©line √âmilie Seurre, known as C√©cile Sorel or the Comtesse de S√©gur, by marriage (7 September 1873 in Paris ‚Äì 3 September 1966 in Trouville-sur-Mer) was a French comic actress. She enjoyed great popularity and was known for her extravagant costumes. ==Biography== Sorel was attracted to the theater at an early age, studying with Louis-Ars√®ne Delaunay and Marie Favart. In 1899, she began her career at the Od√©on and then, in 1901, became a member of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, where she specialized in playing a stock character known as the \\"grande coquette\\". She was especially well known for her portrayal of C√©lim√®ne in The Misanthrope. In 1904, she became the 339th \\"Soci√©taire de la Com√©die-Fran√ßaise\\" and remained with the theater until 1933. Although long engaged to Whitney Warren, an American architect who was related to the Vanderbilts, she eventually married the Comte de S√©gur-Lamoignon, great grandson of the famous Comtesse de S√©gur, who acted under the name Guillaume de Sax. They were sometimes mocked as \\"beauty and the beast\\" and were separated after fifteen years, but she kept the title of \\"Comtesse\\" for the rest of her life. Cecile Sorel by Fran√ßois Flameng c. 1903 In 1909, she had the starring role in La Tosca, a film by Andr√© Calmettes and Charles Le Bargy. Her next film role did not come until 1937, when she played an aged courtesan in Pearls of the Crown by Sacha Guitry. Four years later, she essentially played herself in a sketch comedy called Les Petits riens, written by and starring Yves Mirande. In 1944, she barely escaped the bombing that destroyed the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais in Rouen. In 1950, she underwent a \\"conversion\\" and, following the lead of the original Comtesse de S√©gur, took her vows as a Third-order Franciscan. She adopted the name \\"Soeur C√©cile de l'Enfant-J√©sus\\" and devoted her time to writing. A television documentary of her career was produced in 1965. She died of complications from a fractured hip, suffered in a fall at her rented ch√¢teau on the French coast, and was buried in the Cimeti√®re du Montparnasse. She was painted by Fran√ßois Flameng and her likeness appears in a fresco by Charles Hoffbauer on the ceiling of the cupola at the Ch√¢teau d'Artigny in Montbazon, once owned by Fran√ßois Coty. A college in the town of M√©riel is named after her. ==References Further reading == * C√©cile Sorel: An Autobiography (\\"Les Belles Heures de Ma Vie\\") translated by Philip John Stead, Staples Press, 1953.

All 43 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Barcelona (, ) was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Barcelona, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Barcelona and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-nationals whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes‚Äîwhich included blank ballots‚Äîbeing applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <250  5 -  251‚Äì1,000  7 -  1,001‚Äì2,000  9 -  2,001‚Äì5,000  11 -  5,001‚Äì10,000  13 -  10,001‚Äì20,000  17 -  20,001‚Äì50,000  21 -  50,001‚Äì100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Barcelona, as its population was over 1,000,001, at least 8,000 signatures were required. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \\"Lead\\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 22 seats were required for an absolute majority in the City Council of Barcelona. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; line- height:16px;\\" - style=\\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\\" !

It is concerned with understanding of economic phenomena by using network concepts and the tools of network science. Some main authors in this field are Sanjeev Goyal, Matthew O. Jackson and Rachel Kranton. This term should not be confused with network economics or network externality, a theory explaining that a product or service has an increasing demand, that is, the more people use it, the more utility it brings. == Models of networked markets == Using the concept of networks during the analysis of markets can enable us to better understand its functioning. On the border of network science and market theory, several models have emerged explaining different aspects of markets. === Exchange theory === Exchange theory explains how economic transactions, tradon of favors, communication of information or other goods‚Äô exchanges are affected by the structure of relationship among the involved participants. The main concept is that the act of exchange depends on the agents‚Äô other opportunities and their environment, and thus getting a deeper understanding is possible only by examining these factors. The position of a given agent in the network, for example, can endow her with power over the auctions and deals she make with her partners. === Bilateral trading models === As part of exchange theory, bilateral trading models consider sellers and buyers and use game theory models of the bargaining in networks in order to predict the behaviour of agents depending on the type of network. The outcome of transactions can be determined by, for example, the number of sellers a buyer is connected to, or vice versa for which Corominas-Bosch built a very simple model. Another case is when the agents agree on the transaction through an auction and their decision making during the auction depends on the link structure. Kranton and Minehart came to the conclusion that if we consider markets as networks it can enable sellers to pool uncertainty in demand. As building links is costly, due to the trade-off not everybody need to be linked to everybody in the network. Sparsity in the network will prove to be efficient. === Informal exchange === The first networks in economics were discovered prior to the development of network science. K√°roly Pol√°ny, Claude L√©vi-Strauss or Bronislaw Malinowski studied such tribes where complicated gift exchange mechanisms constructed networks between groups, families or islands. Although modern trade systems differ fundamentally, such systems based on reciprocity can still survive and reciprocity-based or personalised exchange deals persists even when a market would be more efficient. According to Kranton, informal exchange can exist in networks if transactions are more reciprocal than market-based. In this case, market exchange is hard to find and associated with high search costs, therefore yields low utility. Personalised exchange agreements ensure the possibility of long term agreements. == Scale-free property and economics == Recent studies have tried to examine the deeper connection between socioeconomic factors and phenomena and the scale free property. They found that business networks have scale-free property, and that the merger among companies decreases the average separation between firms and increase cliquishness. In another research, scientists found that payment flows in an online payment system exhibits free- scale property, high clustering coefficient and small world phenomenon, and that after 9/11 attacks the connectivity of the network reduced and average path length increased. These results were found to be useful in order to understand how to overcome a possible contagion of similar disturbances in payment networks. == World trade web == World trade is generally highlighted as a typical example for huge networks. The interconnectedness of the countries can both have positive and negative externalities. It has been shown that the world trade web exhibits scale free properties, where the main hub is the United States. 18 out of 21 analyzed developed countries showed large synchronization in economic performance and cycles with the US during 1975-2000. The remaining three countries are special cases. Austria‚Äôs performance correlates highly with that of Germany, though Germany and Japan took completely different economic paths. It seems, despite their embeddedness into the global economy, that the unusual economic measures following Germany‚Äôs unification in 1992 and the Plaza Accord in 1985 (which appreciated the Japanese Yen), drove these two countries off the normal economic track. The importance of regional economic (and political) cooperation also appears in this analysis. ==See also== * Critical mass (sociodynamics) * Critical Mass (book) == References Literature== * * == External links == * Economics of Networks, Duke University Category:Interdisciplinary subfields of economics Category:Network theory ","title":"Economics of networks"},{"id":"46885962","text":"Emmanuel Alejandro Tapia Estrada (born January 22, 1989) is a Mexican footballer who plays as forward. ==Career== Emmanuel Tapia began in the Atlas youth academy.

The Panorama of the Battle of Waterloo () is a rotunda in Belgium that houses a monumental panoramic painting depicting the Battle of Waterloo. The neoclassical building is located immediately to the north of the Lion's Mound on the battlefield of the Battle of Waterloo in the municipality of Braine-l'Alleud in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant. == Design == The rotunda was designed by the architect in 1911. It has an external diameter of and stands high, with a conical roof. The white painted brick walls of the rotunda are decorated with recessed blind arches separated by Ionic pilasters, and crowned with parapet with a frieze of palmettes. The entrance porch has two pairs of Tuscan columns supporting a triangular pediment. The rotunda houses an oil-on-canvas painting completed by French artist Louis Dumoulin in 1912, with 14 canvas panels sewn together to create a cylinder approximately in circumference and high. It is lit from above by a ring of glazing around the edge of the conical roof and is viewed from a high platform at the centre of the rotunda. The painting depicts several different episodes from the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, concentrating on charges by French cavalry. Physical elements in front of the painting, including cut-out figures, fences and bodies made of plaster and papier mache, disguise the lower edge of the painting and enhance its immersive quality. The building and the painting were protected as historical monuments in 1998. In 2008 the Belgian government proposed that the panorama should be included within a UNESCO World Heritage Site listing. The Waterloo Panorama is one of few original panoramas that have survived and which are still exhibited in their original location.

He played four years of college basketball for Nevada, where he was a three-time WAC All- Defensive Team member and a two-time second-team All-WAC honoree. Hunt's professional career has been spent mostly in Europe, with stints in Ukraine, Austria, Italy, France, and Belgium. He has also played in the NBA Development League. In 2019, he moved to Australia to play for the Perth Wildcats. ==Early life== Hunt, the son of two Air Force veterans, was born in Tampa, Florida. Growing up, he lived in Japan and Turkey, as well as in six or seven different states. He attended four or five different elementary schools and two middle schools. ==High school career== Hunt spent his first three years of secondary school at Pine Creek High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado. With the basketball team, he earned second-team all-state honors his junior year after leading the team in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots. He averaged 15 points and 12 rebounds per game as a junior. He set school records for career rebounding and blocks, as well as single-season records for scoring, rebounding and blocks. For his senior year, Hunt moved to North Carolina to attend Charis Prep School. During the 2007‚Äì08 season, he averaged 16.1 points, 15.3 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, and helped Charis Prep to a 43‚Äì3 record.

Dik's study of extra- clausal constituents, on the other. Initiated by Gunther Kaltenb√∂ck, Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva, the framework is based on the distinction between two organizing principles of grammar where one concerns the structure of sentences and the other the linguistic organization beyond the sentence. In accordance with the perspective adopted in this framework, linguistic units such as formulae of social exchange, interjections, discourse markers and other prefabricated expressions, which tend to be assigned a more marginal status in many models of mainstream linguistics, are interpreted as playing an important role in structuring linguistic discourse. ==Influences== Work on Discourse Grammar (DG) has been inspired by a number of different works, in particular by Simon C. Dik's theory of Functional Grammar according to which linguistic discourse is composed of two different kinds of linguistic material, referred to, respectively, as clausal and extra-clausal constituents. On the other hand, it has benefitted greatly from research on the nature of parenthetical categories and the concept of supplements. ==Principles and concepts== DG is composed of all the linguistic resources that are available for designing texts, irrespective of whether these are spoken or written (or signed) texts. It is viewed both as an activity, a real-time interactional tool, and a knowledge store consisting of a set of conventional linguistic units plus their combinatorial potential. An elementary distinction between two main domains of speech processing is made, referred to as Sentence Grammar and Thetical Grammar. Sentence Grammar is organized in terms of propositional concepts and clauses and their combination. It has been the only, or the main subject of mainstream theories of linguistics. The concern of Thetical Grammar is with theticals, that is, with linguistic discourse units beyond the sentence, being syntactically, semantically, and typically also prosodically detached from expressions of Sentence Grammar. These units include what is traditionally referred to as parenthetical constructions but are not restricted to them. The main categories of Thetical Grammar are conceptual theticals (including comment clauses, discourse markers, etc.) as well as various other extra-clausal categories such as vocatives, formulae of social exchange, and interjections. While being separate in principle, the two domains interact in multiple ways in shaping linguistic discourse. The main way of interaction is via cooptation, an operation whereby chunks of Sentence Grammar such as clauses, phrases, words, or any other units are deployed for use in Thetical Grammar. ==Application and further work== Being a relatively young framework, DG has so far found only limited applications. Work has focused mainly on comment clauses, discourse markers, final particles, and insubordination. Furthermore, DG as a descriptive tool has for the most part been restricted to the study of English. Analysis within this framework is now being extended to non-European languages. More detailed research has been carried out already on Akie, a traditional hunter-gatherer language of the Nilotic family spoken in north-central Tanzania. A grammar of this language based on DG has been published, the use of theticals in the organization of texts has been studied, and institutional frames surfacing from the analysis of Akie texts have been identified using Thetical Grammar as a basis. In another line of research, DG has been extended to the study of language contact. As the work on the discourse in bilingual situations has shown, theticals play an important role both in code-switching and borrowing. Furthermore, there is reason to assume that the distinction between Sentence Grammar and Thetical Grammar may shed new light on the question of how human language or languages evolved. Finally, a considerable part of the research is devoted to the question of whether the distinction between the two domains is reflected in neural activity. As this research suggests, there appears to be a corresponding distinction in brain lateralization, in that Sentence Grammar correlates primarily with left-hemisphere activity whereas Thetical grammar appears to be more strongly associated with right-hemisphere activation. ==Related work== That discourse organization operates simultaneously in two different dimensions has also been pointed out in a number of other research traditions. Thus, a distinction akin to that between Sentence Grammar and Thetical Grammar is also made in some psycholinguistic studies on comprehension where a contrast between propositional representation and discourse model is made, and in neurolinguistic discourse analysis there is a related distinction between referential and modalizing speech. In other frameworks, specific manifestations of the distinction are highlighted, such as that between microgrammar and macrogrammar, or between an analytic and a holistic mode of processing, or between conceptual and procedural meaning in the theory of Relevance Grammar. ==ReferencesExternal links== OTC Workshop: https://otc-workshop.univie.ac.at/ Category:Grammar Category:Grammar frameworks ","title":"Discourse grammar"},{"id":"46886178","text":"Wilson Creek (also known as Elk Creek) is a tributary of the Lackawanna River in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately long and flows through Fell Township. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is impaired by metals and pH from abandoned mine drainage. Some reaches of it also experience total flow loss. There are three discharges of acid mine drainage entering the creek: the Upper Wilson Outfall, the Lower Wilson Outfall, and the Molensky Slope Outfall. The watershed of the creek is in the Appalachian Mountain section of the Ridge and Valley physiographic province. The main rock types in the watershed are interbedded sedimentary rock and sandstone. The creek flows past areas of disturbed mining land. Wilson Creek is a first-order stream with a relatively narrow watershed. The watershed is mostly forested, with the upper reaches being largely undeveloped. Other land uses include abandoned mine lands, developed lands, and open fields. Various coal mines, breakers, and collieries historically existed in the creek's vicinity. Additionally, a number of bridges have been constructed across the creek. Wilson Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the creek, but it has a low concentration of macroinvertebrates, as of the early 1990s. A possible greenway/trail along the creek could provide a link between the communities of Simpson and Richmondale. ==Course== Wilson Creek begins in a small lake in Fell Township, near the Lackawanna County/Susquehanna County line. It flows east-southeast for a few tenths of a mile before passing through another lake, turning southeast, and flowing down a slope. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, the creek turns south-southwest for several tenths of a mile, flowing between the base of a mountain and Pennsylvania Route 171. It then turns south for a few tenths of a mile before very briefly turning east and crossing Pennsylvania Route 171. The creek then turns south for more than a mile, still flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 171. It eventually enters Simpson and turns south-southwest. After a short distance, it turns south for several tenths of a mile before turning southeast and reaching its confluence with the Lackawanna River. Wilson Creek joins the Lackawanna River upriver of its mouth. ==Hydrology== Wilson Creek is designated as an impaired stream. The causes of the impairment are metals and pH. The likely source of the impairment is abandoned mine drainage. In 1996 and 1998, were impaired, while in 2002 and 2004, were impaired. Reaches of Wilson Creek experience total flow loss. A loss of base flow in the stream was observed at the Richmondale Pile in September 2000. In 2002, the discharge of Wilson Creek in its upper reaches ranged from per minute, with an average of per minute. In the creek's middle reaches, it ranged from 0 to per minute, with an average of per minute. In its lower reaches, the discharge ranged from per minute, with an average of per minute. In 2002, the concentration of iron in Wilson Creek ranged from less than 0.30 milligrams per liter to 0.39 milligrams per liter in the creek's upper reaches. In its middle reaches, the iron concentration was less than 0.30 milligrams per liter and in its lower reaches, it ranged from 0.01 to less than 0.30 milligrams per liter. In 2002, the concentration of manganese in Wilson Creek ranged from less than 0.05 milligrams per liter to 0.12 milligrams per liter in the creek's upper reaches. In its middle reaches, the manganese concentration was less than 0.050 milligrams per liter and in its lower reaches, it ranged from 0.02 to less than 0.12 milligrams per liter. In 2002, the concentration of aluminum in Wilson Creek was less than 0.5 milligrams per liter in its upper and middle reaches. In its lower reaches, the aluminum concentration ranged from 0.01 to 0.15 milligrams per liter. In its upper reaches, the concentration of acidity in Wilson Creek ranged from 0 to 31 milligrams per liter, with an average of 21 milligrams per liter. The concentration of alkalinity ranged from 10.4 to 17.8 milligrams per liter, with an average of 13.2 milligrams per liter. The pH ranged from 5.8 to 6.7, with an average of 6.1. In its middle reaches, the concentration of acidity in the creek ranged from 0.8 to 22.0 milligrams per liter, with an average of 10.5 milligrams per liter. The concentration of alkalinity ranged from 8.6 to 15.0 milligrams per liter, with an average of 10.5 milligrams per liter. The pH ranged from 5.6 to 6.2, with an average of 6.0. In its lower reaches, the concentration of acidity in Wilson Creek ranged from 0 to 2 milligrams per liter, with an average of 0.25 milligrams per liter. The concentration of alkalinity ranged from 32 to 44 milligrams per liter, with an average of 37 milligrams per liter. The pH ranged from 5.9 to 6.9, with an average of 6.3. There are three discharges of acid mine drainage that flow into Wilson Creek: the Upper Wilson Outfall, the Lower Wilson Outfall, and the Molensky Slope Outfall. The first was found to have almost no flow, the second was found to have a flow of 10 gallons per minute, and the third was found to have a flow of 80 gallons per minute. The last of these accounts for most of the flow that Wilson Creek contributes to the Lackawanna River. The water from this outfall has a slightly sulfuric odor, but has low concentrations of metals. In the early 1900s, the creek had no culm at its mouth, but did have high concentrations of sulfur. The creek also historically carried some silt. ==Geography and geology== The elevation near the mouth of Wilson Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The watershed of Wilson Creek is in the Appalachian Mountain section of the Ridge and Valley physiographic province. The topography of the watershed mainly consists of long, steep ridges with valleys interspersed. This is similar to the topography of the Lackawanna River watershed as a whole, but on a smaller scale. The creek has a defined channel. Various small bogs, ponds, and wetlands are in the watershed. The headwaters of Wilson Creek are in a wetland pond. The first of the creek are largely unimpacted, with an intact stream corridor. However, it eventually begins to flow alongside Pennsylvania Route 171, where it receives impacts from stripping pits and waste rock piles left over from past mining operations. The creek is also impacted by Pennsylvania Route 171 itself in this reach. Around the time that it begins flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 171, it passes through the Richmondale Pile, an area of disturbed mining land with some culm. The creek has been channelized near its mouth. A report from the early 1900s noted that the streambed of Wilson Creek was rocky in certain reaches, with culm deposits of up to in area. The report also stated that the creek was fairly large, with banks high enough to avoid overflowing in most reaches. The uplands of the watershed of Wilson Creek lie on poorly-drained, rocky soil. The other parts of the watershed have rapid permeability. Interbedded sedimentary rock is the most common type of rock in the watershed, occupying 53 percent of its area. The remaining 47 percent is occupied by sandstone. ==Watershed== The watershed of Wilson Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Waymart. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Clifford. Wilson Creek is a first- order stream. The watershed is relatively narrow. The vast majority of the creek's drainage basin is in Fell Township. However, a small part of the northernmost reach is in Clifford Township, in Susquehanna County. The upper reaches of the creek's watershed are largely undeveloped. However, residential land lines the creek in Simpson. A total of 84 percent of the watershed is forested. The remaining 16 percent consists of abandoned mine lands, developed lands (which are mostly concentrated near the creek's mouth), and open fields. Wilson Creek can be accessed by taking US Route 6 to Carbondale and then taking Pennsylvania Route 171 to Simpson. ==History and recreation== Wilson Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1191536. The creek is also known as Elk Creek. This name appears on county highway maps published by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. The Williams Coal Mine was constructed on Wilson Creek by J.W. Williams and J.P. Williams in 1864. The Elk Creek Mine was constructed along the creek in 1873 by Clarkson and Brennan. Their breakers were built in 1874 and 1873, respectively. Additionally, the Richmond Number 4 Colliery was historically located near the creek's headwaters and the Buffalo Breaker was also in the watershed. Wilson Creek overflowed its banks during a 1924 flood. During the same flood, the creek inundated a road to Forest City, rendering it impassible. A concrete stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying T604/Midland Street was constructed across Wilson Creek in 1930. It is long. A steel stringer/multi- beam or girder bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 171 was constructed over the creek in 1953. This bridge is long and is situated in Fell Township. Wilson Creek was given a stream ranking of \\"Moderate\\" in the Lackawanna Valley Industrial Highway Project's Environmental Impact Statement in 1992. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan proposed the Wilson Creek Trail. A greenway and trail along the creek could link Simpson and Richmondale. The Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan also recommended that Fell Township include protection of Wilson Creek in its comprehensive plans, as well as their ordinances for land use, zoning, and subdivision. The creek is on the Watershed Restoration Priority List of the Lackawanna River Corridor Association. In 2006, the Lackawanna County Conservation District received a letter of support for a Growing Greener grant for a Wilson Creek Watershed Implementation Plan. ==Biology== The drainage basin of Wilson Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in Wilson Creek from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. As of the early 1990s, the creek has a low density of macroinvertebrates. Native trees and understory plants occur in the riparian buffer of Wilson Creek upstream of Pennsylvania Route 171. There is successional vegetation along the creek at the Richmondale Pile. In Simpson, the vegetation alongside the creek is either mowed or consists of successional and invasive understory plants. ==See also== *Coal Brook, next tributary of the Lackawanna River going downriver *Rogers Brook, next tributary of the Lackawanna River going upriver *List of rivers of Pennsylvania *List of tributaries of the Lackawanna River ==References== Category:Rivers of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the Lackawanna River Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Wilson Creek (Lackawanna River tributary)"},{"id":"46886210","text":"Jordan Jes√∫s Silva D√≠az (born August 30, 1994 in Matehuala, San Luis Potos√≠) is a Mexican professional footballer who currently plays for Club Tijuana in Liga MX. ==Career== On 13 April 2014, Jordan Silva made his professional debut against Club Le√≥n.

Galician People in Galician language; EGPGC) was an armed organization formed in 1986 mainly by members of Galiza Ceibe-OLN. It was considered a terrorist by the Spanish Government. The main goals of the organization were the independence of Galicia and the transformation of society according to the principles of socialism. The EGPGPC was operative between 1987 and 1991, a time during which the EGPGC made a total of 90 armed actions and a multitude of provisioning actions. ==HistoryOrigins=== The EGPGC was founded in 1986 by militants of two nationalist and socialist organizations and Galician, Galiza Ceibe-OLN and the Communist Party of National Liberation, a split of the Galician People's Union (UPG) in 1986, when the V Congress of the UPG decided to accept the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and to abandon the idea of armed struggle. The first leader of EGPGC, Antom √Årias Curto came from a previous armed organization, Loita Armada Revolucionaria (LAR), active between 1978 and 1980. ===First actions=== The first action of EGPGC took place in January 1987 and consisted in the robbery of dynamite from the mines of As Pontes de Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez. This dynamite was used in seven bombs that were placed in banks the 5 of February of the same year. The attacks were claimed on Radio Galicia as a sign of support for the three independentist militants who were being tried in the Provincial Court of A Coru√±a that morning: Manuel Chao Dobarro (Galiza Ceibe-OLN), Jaime Castro Leal and Jos√© Manuel Sanmart√≠n Bouza. and the prosecutors requested 15 years in prison by frustrated robbery, unlawful annuity weapons and exchange of vehicle plates. On May 1, the EGPGC struck again with eight bombs, in banks of A Coru√±a, Compostela, Vigo, Betanzos and As Pontes de Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez, causing serious material damage. The attack was claimed by the group two days later. On 12 November, the EGPGC blew a tower of a high-voltage line in Matam√° (Vigo). Another bomb against a similar infrastructure was placed two days later in Lugo. On 17 December, the Guerrilla Army bombed the delegation of the Spanish government in A Coru√±a, and exploded an artifact in the city of Ferrol. 1988 continued with the line of attacks on banking interests in Galicia. ===Security forces and Manuel Fraga=== In spring 1988 the EGPGC opened another line of targets for their actions. Without abandoning the attacks on banks and industrial facilities, in March the group redirected its attacks against the Spanish security forces. On 9 and 14 March of that year the EGPGC attacked different vehicles of the security forces, destroying various vehicles of the Guardia Civil in Santiago de Compostela and 1 of the National Police in Vigo. The night of the 14th a tower of electric supply was attacked in Castro Caldelas. Due to the use of Portuguese explosives in those attacks, the police considered that the EGPGC maintained contacts with the Popular Forces 25 April. On 30 April 1988 the EGPGC attempted against two chemical companies in Pontevedra: ENCE and ELNOSA. The attacks were motivated by the social opposition to those plants due to the continuing uncontrolled dumping of waste in the R√≠a of Pontevedra, managing to paralyze the industries for two days. In the same month, on the 27th, the EGPGC carried forward one of their most important attacks by destroying the summer residence of Manuel Fraga Iribarne, former Minister of Information and Tourism (1962‚Äì1969) during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, MEP at the time by the Popular Alliance, and that only two years later would become president of Galicia. That was the first and only action against a politician by the EGPGC. The attack also caused interest and preoccupation in the Spanish press, until then much more concerned by the activity of ETA. The coincidence of the attack on Manuel Fraga with the murder of the A Coru√±a businessman Claudio San Mart√≠n by the First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups (GRAPO), made the press speculate about the possibility of an intense relationship between the two organizations, which was discarded later by the police. During the election campaign of 1989 in Galicia Manuel Fraga blamed the PSOE for the situation of political violence in Galicia caused by the GRAPO and the EGPGC. ===First arrests=== The first arrests occurred on 29 May 1988. The Civil Guard arrested six people in Castro Caldelas. Among them were Antom √Årias Curto, main leader of EGPGC; Miguel Anxo Campuzano, union leader and general secretary of the fishers union of the Intersindical Nacional dos Traballadores Galegos (INTG) or Susana Maria Lopes Pogas, who was accused of belonging to the Popular Forces 25 April. The next day, the Civil Gua arrested another four people. The Civil Governor of A Coru√±a then stated that he considered the EGPGC to be \\"disarticulated\\". However, a phone call on behalf of EGPGC directed the Radio Galicia ensured that the structure of the group remained intact. After the arrests the leaders of all the nationalist arties rejected the EGPGC, with the exception of the Communist Party of National Liberation. Later in the same day (31 May) another supposed member of the EGPGC was arrested. The members of the group denounced tortures by the security forces, which led the Galician Socialist Party-Galician Left (PSG-EG) and the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG) to denounce tortures and to demand a decent treatment for the detainees. Two of the arrested were later freed without charges, while the rest were sent to prison and dispersed. All of them, with the exception of Manuel Campuzano, recognized being members of the EGPGC. As a response to this process, the EGPGC exploded a car bomb in the police station of Ourense, leaving an injured policeman. The next day the members of the EGPGC started a hunger strike to protest dispersion and isolation. Due to this strike the 11 members of the EGPGC were relocated in the jail of Alcal√°-Meco. On 25 July of that year more than 100 people went to celebrate the National Day of Galicia as a denounce of the health conditions of the prisoners. On August 9 the EGPGC attacked the statue of Francisco Franco in Ferrol with a bomb. ===New Galician Poetry manifesto=== On August 31, 1988, the Guerrilla Army made a public manifesto with the title of New Galician Poetry (Nova Poes√≠a Galega), which set as targets foreign companies, entities that manufacture in Galicia harmful products, drug traffickers, beneficiaries of burned wood in the hills during the common summer forest fires in Galicia and the fascist symbolism maintained since the death of Francisco Franco. The EGPGC rejected, however, \\"direct confrontation\\" with the \\"occupation forces\\". ===New offensive and new arrests=== Despite significant members of EGPGC being in prison, the actions of the armed group continued to be directed against their usual targets, causing only material damage. Just a week after sending the first statement, the EGPGC exploded seven bombs in Compostela, A Coru√±a, Ferrol and Vigo, against banks and the electric Uni√≥n Fenosa. The decision of not to attack people's lives or physical integrity constituted a differential facts of the EGPGC on other armed groups acting at the time, like the maoist GRAPO, ETA in the Basque Country or Terra Lliure in Catalonia. In this line, the leader of the group Antom √Årias Curto assured that the EGPGC would not undermine human lives. On February 2, 1989, the EGPGC starred, however, an important qualitative leap: a command formed by four militants attacked two Guardia Civil officers in the municipality of Irixoa. One of the agents died and the other was severely wounded. Minutes later, two of the four members of the command were arrested by the Guardia Civil in the vicinity of the place, while the two others managed to escape. That was the first time that a person was killed in an EGPGC attack. Two days after the events, Josefa Rodr√≠guez Porca was arrested in A Coru√±a, accused of being the leader of the Irixoa command. As a result of the Irixoa shooting a total of 8 people were jailed and took to a prison in Madrid. One of them, Ram√≥n Pi√±eiro, member of the INTG nationalist union, said that the death have occurred \\"in random way\\" and that the goal of the operation was not murder the agent, but to steal their weapons. All the arrested denounced being tortured by the Guardia Civil, including Francisco Ni√±o and some the other detainees that denied being part of the EGPGC. The press speculated then that the qualitative leap of EGPGC responded to an infiltration of militants of the GRAPO in the EGPGC, a hipotesis that was rejected by the autoridades. Soon later the EGPGC attempted again with a bomb, this time against the Vigo police station. The EGPGC continued, in effect, attacking industrial facilities and on December 18 bombed one electric tower near the Alumina-Aluminio factory in San Cibr√°n (Lugo), where the toxic products recovered from the Cason boat (sunk at A Costa da Morte) were relocated, which had produced a great social conflict in the region. ===New objective: drug trafficking=== Since 1990, the EGPGC began to attack narcos and known drug dealers. On 6 February, the Spanish police defused a bomb placed in a car of a dealer in A Coru√±a that was linked to the laundering of money from drug trafficking. The group also continued attacks against interests of foreign companies in Galiza. At the beginning of June that year, coinciding with the trials of various militants of the organization, the Guerrilla Army attacked Uni√≥n Fenosa and Telef√≥nica facilities in Doz√≥n and Ourense, respectively. On the morning of July 2, the EGPGC attacked a bank in Cerceda and two INEM offices in A Coru√±a and Ferrol. The group attacked narcos again on 11 October 1990: a bomb in a disco in Santiago de Compostela that should have exploded when the local was empty, was accidentally activated prematurely causing injuries of varying severity to 49 people and the death of three people, including two members of the EGPGC commando that were putting the bomb in the nightclub, owned by several drug traffickers, among them Oubi√±a Laureano and Manuel Charlin. This attack led to widespread condemnation of the EGPGC actions and a sharp fall in popularity of the group. Simultaneously to this, other bombs in the Arousa area exploded, causing property damage in shops linked to drug trafficking in Vilanova de Arousa, Vilagarc√≠a de Arousa and Pontevedra. After the attack, the EGPGC claimed that the deaths had been a \\"human error\\" and \\"understood and feel the pain in the act\\". The group also continued attacking industrial facilities: on March 1, 1991, five electricity towers were destroyed in O Bierzo; on July 10 explosives were placed in ENCE, Pontevedra. Simultaneously, other articles plow explosion causing property damage in shops linked to drug trafficking also in Vilanova de Arousa, Vila Garcia de Arousa and Pontevedra. That was the second action with fatalities in EGPGC and produced an important condemns response among students of the University of Santiago de Compostela. In the attack claim, the EGPGC claimed to have been a \\"human error\\" and \\"understand and feel the pain in the act\\" [8] and continued attacking industrial facilities: March 1, 1991, electric deputy minister five towers were destroyed in region of Bierzo; July 10 explosives were placed in ENCE and timber Tafisa, both in Ponte Vedra; and on the 13th two electricity towers were attacked in Ferrolterra, leaving 300,000 people without electricity. ===End of the EGPGC=== According to police informations in 1991, the leadership of EGPGC was based in Portugal, including its leader, Manuel Chao Dobarro, who was in charge of the organization since 1988, after the historical leader, Antom √Årias Curto, was jailed. The Guerrilla Army had not acted since July 1990, and was very weakened after the arrests and the loss of social prestige due to the Clangor bombing. A part of the organization continued advocating for armed struggle, led by Manuel Chao Dobarro from Portugal.El Pa√≠s (7/11 1991). La polic√≠a portuguesa descubre una base de apoyo del Ex√©rcito Guerrilleiro. On September 21, 1991, the Spanish police arrested Manuel Chao and other members of EGPGC in the Franco-Spanish border in Catalonia, dismantling the organization. The wave of arrests continued and on November 19 eight people linked with the Assembleia do Povo Unido were arrested. Despite this several members of the group they were arrested later, in 1998 and 2002. == References  Sources == * Various Authors.

She was regarded as a local pioneer of women's education in Malm√∂, Sweden. She was the founder and manager of the Malm√∂ High School for Girls (Malm√∂ h√∂gre l√§roverk f√∂r flickor) from 1874 until 1899. ==Biography== Maria Stenkula was the daughter of physician Zacharias Fredrik Agathon Stenkula and Hedvig Margareta Maria Borg. The second eldest of 11 children, she was the sister of professor and educational reformer Anders Oskar Stenkula.(1841-1922). She spent part of her childhood as the foster child of her maternal grandfather, who was a vicar. She never married. As a person, she is described as strict but a skillful pedagogue who devoted her life to her educational ambitions. Stenkula had educational ambitions early on, and wished to become an educated teacher rather than to support herself as a governess without formal education, as was by then most common. She was educated at the Statens normalskola f√∂r flickor in 1866-67 and the H√∂gre l√§rarinneseminariet in 1867-70, from which she graduated in 1870. ===Malm√∂=== In 1874, she and her fellow student Elin Lunnerquist co-founded a girls' school in Malm√∂, Maria Stenkulas skola (in 1883 named Fr√∂ken Maria Stenkulas h√∂gre elementarskola f√∂r flickor, and in 1884 Malm√∂ h√∂gre l√§roverk f√∂r flickor). She served as its principal between 1874 and 1899, and was also its teacher in German language and church history. Elin Lunnerquist married and left the school in 1878. Maria Stenkula was inspired by the progressive ideas of the time, in which females should be given a serious education to enable them to be useful to society as professionals, which had been the focus in the Girls' School Committee of 1866 (Flickskolekommitt√©n 1866) . The school of Stenkula has been referred to as the first notable school for girls in Malm√∂: while there were several serious secondary education schools for girls in Stockholm and Gothenburg, such opportunities had been closed to females in Malm√∂, the third largest city in Sweden. While this is in fact not literary true, as Caroline Kl√©ens skola managed the first girls' school of note in Malm√∂ between 1850 and 1870 and Fru Elise Mayers h√∂gre l√§roverk f√∂r flickor the second in 1857-1888, her school was nevertheless a local pioneer establishment and known and respected for its innovations. It was very successful, arguably the largest school open to females in Malm√∂. In 1883, it had 200-300 students with an eight-year elementary and primary school and a three-year secondary education class. She focused in humanistic subjects, offered Swedish, French, German and English, singing education, introduced home economics, daily gymnastics, education in health, school trips and school libraries. ===Later life=== In 1899, Stenkula resigned from her position and left Malm√∂ for √ñrkelljunga in Sk√•ne, where she founded and managed a small school from 1900 until 1917. It too became a local pioneer institution, and lay the foundation of the local high school and public secondary educational school in √ñrkelljunga. In 1932, her former students founded the Maria Stenkula Memorial Fund (Maria Stenkulas minnesfond) . In 1940, Malm√∂ h√∂gre l√§roverk f√∂r flickor as well as the other girls' schools of Malm√∂: Tekla √Öbergs h√∂gre l√§roverk f√∂r flickor dating from 1857 and Anna och Eva Bundts skola f√∂r flickor which dated from 1887, were all united into Malm√∂ kommunala flickskola, the governmental girls' school which was later made co-educational. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==Related reading== *Malm√∂ skolors historik 1400 till 1995 Category:1842 births Category:1932 deaths Category:Swedish women's rights activists Category:Swedish feminists Category:19th-century Swedish educators ","title":"Maria Stenkula"},{"id":"46886290","text":"The 1998 British Open Championships was held at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, from 27 March - 5 April 1998.

Ward won a competition organised by the British Institution in 1816 to create an artwork to celebrate the final victory over Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo the previous year. He was commissioned to create a full-size painting, and paid 1,000 guineas. Rather than painting portraits of the Duke of Wellington and his generals, or a scene from the battle, Ward proposed an allegorical treatment. Ward's painting showed the Duke of Wellington in the red uniform of a British Field Marshal with decorations and sashes, standing in a triumphal chariot accompanied by the figure of Britannia. The chariot was drawn by four white horses, led by allegorical figures. Above was a sweltering orange sun and an angel, while more allegorical symbols and characters littered the canvas. Twisted Solomonic column to the left and right sides framed the image, supporting a swagged entablature above. Peter Paul Rubens ‚Äì The triumph of the Eucharist over Ignorance and Blindness Study for a figure in the painting The painting seems to have been inspired by a 17th-century tapestry, Triumph of the Eucharist over Ignorance and Blindness, from a 20-part series by Rubens on the Triumph of the Eucharist commissioned by Infanta Clara Eugenia, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, for the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales in Madrid; six of Ruben's preparatory oil sketches are held by the Prado Museum in Madrid. Ward's painting took 6 years to complete, and the final work measured , more than three times the expected size. Although his concept won the first prize in 1816, praise had turned to criticism by the time the painting was completed in 1822. The monumental image was exhibited at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly in 1822, and then donated to the Royal Hospital Chelsea, but it was so large it was rarely hung in the hall there as intended. It was later cut into several pieces which have been lost. Some studies and drawings survive. The historical collections of the Royal Hospital Chelsea hold Ward's original oil-on-canvas study, exhibited at the British Institution in 1816, which measures , and there is a detailed drawing held by the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge which measures .

His first sojourn in Australia was in Maitland, New South Wales and his last near Maitland, South Australia. ==History== Cottrell emigrated to New South Wales, arriving in Sydney on the ship Orient in February 1839. He ran a coachbuilding business in Maitland, New South Wales from 1843 to 1845. Cottrell married Abina Ledsam; their two elder sons were born in Maitland, where various members of the Ledsam family had settled from the early 1830s including poundkeeper John Ledsam and auctioneer Jeremiah Ledsam, with whom he was closely associated. Cottrell, his wife and four children moved to Adelaide by the brig Phantom, accompanied by brother-in-law John Ledsam (1785‚Äì1856), in June 1847. In 1848 he opened a coachbuilding business in Rundle Street, which prospered, enabling him to move several times, finally to Grenfell Street. He was member for East Adelaide in the South Australian House of Assembly April 1868 ‚Äì February 1875, and was an advocate of protection. In 1875, he stood again for East Adelaide, but was defeated by William Kay. He purchased a farm \\"Brook Cottage\\", Woodforde, near Magill around 1865, where they lived, and later moved to a much larger property at Urania, some from Maitland, South Australia. He had been an invalid for some time, and died of bronchitis. ===G. T. Cottrell=== His eldest son George Thomas Cottrell joined the second (\\"relief\\") party of B. T. Finniss's surveying expedition to Adam Bay in the Northern Territory as a labourer, It was not unusual for young men of well-to-do families to enlist in such expeditions, whether for the adventure, or to expand their opportunities or some other motive, perhaps sent by their parents to \\"toughen them up\\". leaving Port Adelaide on 29 October 1864. He brought with him six rabbits, a gift of land agent Samuel Pearce, later his father-in-law, but there is no record of their being released, and they certainly failed to \\"be fruitful and multiply\\". Although his contract would not expire until October 1865, he was one of those who on 6 May 1865 left Escape Cliffs on the ship Bengal for Surabaya, and with J. R. (T. R. ?) Atkinson travelled on to Singapore, while the rest transshipped via Douglas to Melbourne, and thence to Adelaide. :In the prosecution of W. P. Auld for having on 8 September 1864 shot dead a defenceless Aborigine, the Government's case relied on testimony from two witnesses, and had to be dropped after one witness (F. J. Packard) had drowned, and the other had left the country. It is possible the second witness was Atkinson, who appears never to have returned to Australia. He died of smallpox in India sometime around June 1868 While in Singapore he found a shipmaster's wallet, and was able to return it to its owner, who treated him to a passage to Hong Kong. There he was introduced to the Governor, Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, who found an appointment for him with the Customs Department in Canton. Two years later he returned to Adelaide, married, and had a successful career as an accountant. ==Family== Robert Cottrell married Abina Ledsam (c.1813 ‚Äì 30 May 1890) around 1838. Among their children were: *George Thomas Cottrell (c. 1839 ‚Äì 14 December 1917) was student at Adelaide Educational Institution, married Sarah Pearce (c. 1842 ‚Äì 28 September 1930) on 21 August 1869 *Thomas Ledsam Cottrell (1841‚Äì), also AEI student, married Martha Rebecca Galway on 1 January 1861. :*Abina Ledsam Cottrell (1863-1928) married David Halliday Irving *Robert Cottrell ( ‚Äì ) married Jane Lowe on 25 December 1865 :*George Edwin Cottrell (1868‚Äì ) :*Isabella Roberta Cottrell (1870‚Äì ) married George Lionel Throssell in 1896 :*Annie Abina Cottrell (1871‚Äì1871) :*Fanny Ethel Cottrell (1873‚Äì ) *Walter Cottrell (c.

It was designed by the architect Anton Rosen (1859‚Äì1928). She had great success, added a women teachers' seminary to her school and was given the right to administer school leaving exams in 1887. In 1889, she received state aid for a study trip in Germany, Switzerland and France. In 1891‚Äì1892, she was given the task by a government minister to lobby for the foundation of a governmental women teacher's training seminary, though she was not successful. In 1893, she founded the Danish Girl School Association (Den danske Pigeskole) which held regular debates over issues of women's education; this organized the first exchange between teachers and students in the Nordic countries. In 1906 she was the co-founder of the Girls' School Help and Pension Fund (Pigeskolernes Hj√¶lpe og Pensionskasse). In 1927, her niece Karen Linderstr√∏m-Lang (1894‚Äì1964) became her successor as seminary leader and principal of the upper secondary school. .

Known onstage as \\"Charlie the horn man\\", his saxophone playing helped earn the group a Grammy Award for best pop instrumental performance. ==Life== The second oldest of the four Neville brothers, Charles Neville was born in New Orleans on Dec. 28, 1938 to Arthur Lanon Neville Sr. and Amelia (Landry) Neville and was raised in the Calliope housing project with his musical brothers, Art, Aaron, and Cyril. Their uncle, George \\"Big Chief Jolly\\" Landry, was lead singer of the Mardi Gras Indian group The Wild Tchoupitoulas. Charles left home when he was 15 to play saxophone with the Rabbit‚Äôs Foot Minstrel Show. When back in New Orleans, he played in the house band at the Dew Drop Inn. He served in the Navy from 1956 to 1958 and discovered the music scene on Beale Street while stationed in Memphis, Tennessee, later touring with B.B. King and Bobby (Blue) Bland. He joined the band of fellow New Orleanian Larry Williams, but his addiction to heroin landed him short jail terms for the shoplifting that sometimes supported his habit. He finally overcame his addictions in 1986. Beginning in 1963 he served three and a half years at Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola for possession of marijuana. He practiced in the prison music room with other incarcerated New Orleans musicians, notably pianist James Booker and drummer James Black. Moving to New York City after release from prison, he explored modern jazz and toured with Johnnie Taylor, Clarence Carter, and O. V. Wright. In 1976 he returned to New Orleans when his maternal uncle, George \\"Big Chief Jolly\\" Landry, called Charles and his brothers Art, Aaron, and Cyril together to record with his Mardi Gras Indian group, The Wild Tchoupitoulas. The blend of traditional and funk music on The Wild Tchoupitoulas album (1976) has made it an icon of New Orleans musical culture. Shortly afterward, the four brothers formed The Neville Brothers, recording more than a dozen albums and building a worldwide following. For years they were the closing act on the main stage of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. Charles's saxophone playing was especially notable on the title track of their best-selling album, Yellow Moon, and helped earn the group its only Grammy, for best pop instrumental performance, for the album's, \\"Healing Chant\\". For \\"Healing Chant\\" on Yellow Moon He moved to rural Massachusetts in the 1990s with his wife, Kristin Neville, and children and continued to perform and record with family members and a wide variety of musicians for the rest of his life. His recordings include an album with the groups Diversity, with jazz and classical musicians, and Songcatchers, with Native American musicians. In 2008 he released his own album, reflecting his interests in Eastern spirituality, Safe in Buddha‚Äôs Palm. He returned often to New Orleans, playing with his jazz combos at Snug Harbor and with his daughter, jazz and funk singer Charmaine Neville. He also performed with two of his sons, Talyn and Khalif, as the New England Nevilles. After 2012 he toured with Aaron Neville's solo band and appeared with him for Aaron's first performance at the French Quarter Festival in 2017. Charles's last Jazz Fest performance was with Dr. John in 2017. He was scheduled to join in \\"The Neville Family Groove\\", a musical celebration of the Nevilles at Tipitina‚Äôs in November 2017, but was by then hospitalized with pancreatic cancer, from which he died on April 26, 2018 at the age of 79 years old. ==Discography== * 1990 Charles Neville & Diversity (Delta) Diversity * 1994 Dreaming in Color (A&M;) Songcatchers * 2008 Safe in Buddha‚Äôs Palm (CD Baby) Charles Neville == Further reading == * ==ReferencesExternal links== * Interview, with playlist and transcript Category:1938 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Jazz musicians from New Orleans Category:Rhythm and blues musicians from New Orleans Category:Neville family (show business) Category:Grammy Award winners Category:African-American musicians Category:American people who self-identify as being of Native American descent Category:The Neville Brothers members ","title":"Charles Neville (musician)"},{"id":"46886486","text":"Norwell Lionel Roberts (n√© Gumbs; born 23 October 1946) is a British former police constable‚Äîthe first black police officer to join London's Metropolitan Police. He eventually rose to the rank of Detective Sergeant. During his career, he was considered to be the first black police officer in the United Kingdom, although it has since been revealed that he had been preceded by Metropolitan Police Superintendent Robert Branford and Constable John Kent in Carlisle, both in the 19th century. ==Early life== Norwell Roberts was born Norwell Lionel Gumbs on 23 October 1946 in Anguilla, in the Leeward Islands in the West Indies. His grandfather was a police sergeant, and three uncles were high-ranking officers, one of whom was awarded the Colonial Police Medal for his services. They all attended 12-week courses on the familiarisation of police procedure at Hendon Police College, where Roberts later trained. His father died when he was three years old and his widowed mother, lured by promises of job opportunities and a better life, sailed for England in 1954. Roberts was left behind, to be raised by his strict preacher grandparents. His grandmother was a Methodist deaconess. When he misbehaved, he recalled with some horror, his grandmother would send him to the local shops wearing her dresses. He arrived at the port of Dover at nine years old, when his mother secured employment as a housemaid in London. Roberts and his mother found life in England difficult, as with most post-war immigrants; securing housing was hard due to racial prejudices at the time. At home in Anguilla, Roberts' mother had run several neighbourhood shops but in London she took any domestic jobs she could get. Roberts and his mother eventually settled in Bromley, Kent. In 1956, Roberts was the only Black child in his primary school, and when he passed the eleven-plus, the headmistress told his mother that Roberts would not be going to grammar school because he had to 'learn the English ways'. As a result, Norwell instead went to the local secondary modern school in Bromley, where the older sixth form students dropped him head first to the ground in order to see the colour of his blood. He still carries the scar on his forehead, but never once complained to his mother, because he understood that she had been powerless to act. In 1959, his mother remarried and moved to Camden Town, North London, where Roberts went to Haverstock Hill Comprehensive School. He did not have a good relationship with his stepfather and he left his London home when he was just fifteen years old. Having passed O-Levels in Religious Knowledge and Chemistry, Roberts started work as a scientific laboratory technician in the Botany Department at Westfield College, University of London. In 1966, while working at Westfield College, Roberts responded to a newspaper advertisement and completed the police recruitment application form. While on day release to Paddington Technical College, one of his fellow students who read the Daily Telegraph saw a headline which read ‚ÄòLondon to have first coloured Policeman soon‚Äô. Roberts enlisted on 28 March 1967. This intake also included Paul Condon, now Baron Condon, who went on to become Metropolitan Police Commissioner. After constant misspelling of the name \\"Gumbs\\", he changed his name in 1968 by deed poll, taking his mother's maiden name of Roberts. ==Police career== On 3 April 1967, when Roberts was 21, he officially joined the Metropolitan Police and achieved media and public attention because he was the first black police officer in the Met, which covers the Greater London area. At that time the only black people in uniform were working for London Transport on the buses or the underground and British Rail. Under the scrutiny of the popular press of the time, Roberts completed his initial training at Hendon Police College. Roberts stated about his early years with the Met that, \\"nobody should be subject to that treatment, ever\\". He was initially stationed at Bow Street Police Station, in Covent Garden, London, where the first words his reporting sergeant said to him were, \\"look you nigger, I'll see to it that you never pass your probation\\". Police chiefs outwardly presented Roberts as an example of progressive policing, while Roberts faced racial abuse, harassment and persecution from his own colleagues. Colleagues that talked to him at work were ostracised, including some of those that trained with him, so would only speak to him at the section house. Roberts later claimed he would cope by weeping in the bath at the section house privately, since he feared showing weakness. He found the police station so hostile he would avoid eating with fellow officers, preferring to visit members of the community that invited him in for tea. One sunny afternoon outside the Royal Opera House the driver of a police car passing Roberts shouted, \\"black cunt\\" and drove on while other colleagues in the car laughed and Roberts stood embarrassed in front of members of the public. Roberts crossed the road into the police station opposite and reported the incident immediately to the Chief Superintendent who responded, \\"what do you want me to do about it?\\". This response left Roberts feeling he had lost his fight for acceptance, since it was his first complaint and all that had been acknowledged was his vulnerability. Roberts didn't go to the press with his experiences at the time since he thought it wouldn't have encouraged others to join the police, though in an interview in 2020 he said, \\"what I regret most was that I'd like for someone who was about then, to come to me and say, \\"I know what it was like\\", you know, \\"I'm sorry about that\\". That's all. But they're always in denial.\\" He joined 'A' Relief and quickly became a popular member of the team due to his humour and dedication. He was disciplined verbally once for driving with fellow officers around the West End with a toilet roll hanging from the police van radio aerial. As the first black policeman in London, he was the most conspicuous man in the force. His every move whether walking the beat or holding back protesters in Trafalgar Square hit newspaper headlines at home and abroad. He made tabloid cartoons and was even on the cover of Private Eye. In newspapers in America in the Southern States the headlines read 'London gets first negro cop'. During Roberts' service, he policed anti-Vietnam demonstrators paraded outside of the American Embassy. He was withdrawn from his post outside Rhodesia House after suffering abuse from anti-apartheid protesters who were protesting the hanging of three black Rhodesians. In 1969, Roberts was photographed linking arms with his colleagues during protests on the arrival of the South African rugby team at Twickenham. Roberts transferred to CID at West End Central as a Temporary Detective Constable and later became a fully fledged Detective Constable in 1977 where he worked in the drugs squad and was occasionally seconded in undercover policing roles. Roberts was stationed at several police stations across London including Bow Street; Vine Street; West End Central; West Hampstead; Albany Street; Kentish Town; Acton; Ealing; Southall Ruislip; Wembley, Barnet; Borehamwood and Golders Green. On his retirement, a leaving party was held at the banqueting rooms in Finchley. 600 people attended, including then Commissioner Paul Condon and his then-Chief Superintendent, Peter Twist. ==Personal life== Roberts has lived in Harrow with his wife Wendy since 1976. ==Honours and awards== Roberts received police commendations on three occasions, one of which was for his involvement in 1985 when he was part of a squad who arrested five people in six days for a contract killing. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Robert Mark praised Roberts' contribution towards better relations between white and black communities. In 1995, Roberts' was awarded the Queen's Police Medal for distinguished service. On 15 March 1996, Roberts attended Buckingham Palace where he was presented with the medal by Prince Charles. During the presentation, Prince Charles told Roberts that \\"We need more people like you.\\" {  -  45px Queens Police Medal  1996 - 45px Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal  1989 } ==References== Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Metropolitan Police officers Category:Anguillan emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:Recipients of the Queen's Police Medal ","title":"Norwell Roberts"},{"id":"46886493","text":"The Ghana Olympic Committee (GOC), formally known as Gold Coast Olympics Committee was established in 1951 and recognized the following year by International Olympic Committee.

(2009) to help understand the origins of many diseases and the links between them. Hidalgo et al. (2009) defined diseases as specific sets of phenotypes that affect one or several physiological systems, and compiled data on pairwise comorbidity correlations for more than 10,000 diseases reconstructed from over 30 million medical records. Hidalgo et al. (2009) presented their data in the form of a network with diseases as the nodes and comorbidity correlations as the links. Intuitively, the phenotypic disease network (PDN) can be seen as a map of the phenotypic space whose structure can contribute to the understanding of disease progression. ==History== During the last decade, several papers were published that aim at understanding the origins and interrelatedness of diseases using the analytical tools of network science. Interactions between disease-associated genes, proteins, and gene expressions have been explored. However, phenotypic information was essentially overlooked, despite the fact that there exist extensive, high-quality data on it in the form of clinical histories, until the seminal paper of Hidalgo et al. (2009) introducing the human phenotypic disease network. ==Data and MethodologySource data=== Hidalgo et al. (2009) used Medicare hospital claims based on the MedPAR records on hospitalizations for the period 1990-1993. For the 32 million elderly Americans aged 65 or older enrolled in Medicare and alive for the entire study period, there were approximately 32 million inpatient claims, belonging to about 13 million individuals. The dataset consisted of mainly white patients over 65 years old living in an industrialized country which imposed some limitations on the study; for example, many infectious diseases or pregnancy related conditions did not appear in the data at all. ===Comorbidity correlation measures=== Comorbidity measures are used to measure the \\"distance\\" between two diseases. The relative risk (RR) of observing disease i and j affecting the same patient is given by RR_{ij}=\\\\frac{C_{ij}N}{P_iP_j} where C_{ij} denotes the number of patients affected by both diseases, N is the total number of patients in the population, and P_i and P_j are the prevalences of diseases i and j, respectively. The \\\\phi-correlation (Pearson correlation for binary measures) can be expressed as \\\\phi_{ij}=\\\\frac{C_{ij}N-P_iP_j}{\\\\sqrt{P_i P_j(N-P_i)(N-P_j)}}. Both measures have inherent biases: RR overestimates relationships involving rare diseases and underestimates the comorbidity between highly prevalent diseases, while the \\\\phi-correlation is accurate in describing comorbidity between diseases with similar prevalence but underestimates the comorbidity between rare and common diseases. In the PDN, nodes are disease phenotypes and links connect those phenotypes that have significant comorbidity correlation according to the RR and \\\\phi-correlation. Considering the complementary biases of these two measures, Hidalgo et al. (2009) constructed a separate PDN for each. ==Disease network dynamicsDisease progression=== Comparing the average correlation between illnesses diagnosed in the first two visits and those diagnosed later (during the third and fourth visits for patients with a total of four visits) to the average correlation in a randomized control case, inter-visit correlations were found to be significantly larger than those that would occur by chance alone, pointing to the fact that patients develop diseases that are close in the PDN to those they already have. ===Connectedness and mortality=== Hidalgo et al. (2009) also established a connection between that the mortality associated with a given disease and its connectivity in the PDN. Diseases that are preceded by others are usually more connected than those that precede others, and they tend to be more lethal. That is to say, patients that have a disease that is more connected in the network face higher mortality rates that those patients who have less connected conditions. ===Demographic differences=== In the Hidalgo et al. (2009) study, disease progression was found to be different across genders and ethnicities. For example, hypertension, diabetes, and renal disorders tend to be more comorbid in black males, while ischemic heart disease, infarctions, pulmonary complications and hypercholesterolemia are more comorbid in white males. ==See also== *Network science *Human disease network *Network medicine *Biological network *Nicholas A.

It is the seat of the bishops of Mondov√¨. ==History and description== Several buildings were used over the centuries for the cathedral of the diocese. The first was the pieve of San Donato (12th century), which was replaced at the beginning of the 16th century by a new Renaissance church, which was demolished by order of Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, in 1574. The church of San Francesco was then declared the cathedral, to be replaced in its turn by the present one, which was built between 1743 and 1753 to designs by the architect Francesco Gallo, and consecrated ten years later by Bishop Michele Casati. The cathedral is well-supplied with works of art, many of them from its predecessor buildings. Among them are the altar of the Renaissance church (1507), now kept in the chapter room; an ancient bust of Pope Pius V donated by Pope Pius XI in 1872; and various paintings of the 17th and 18th centuries by Piedmontese and Lombard artists. The painted decorations and the stucco work were executed in the mid-19th century. The presbytery and the main altar are decorated with large frescoes: in the apse is the Martyrdom of San Donato by Paolo Emilio Morgari; in the cupola the Glorification of Saint Pius V; in the presbytery the Coronation of the Virgin. The Chapel of Suffrage is a very fine example of the Rococo style of the 18th century, with an alabaster crucifix of the end of that century. ==See also== *Roman Catholic Diocese of Mondov√¨ ==Notes and referencesExternal links== * Website of the Diocese of Mondov√¨: cathedral * Website of the Comune of Mondov√¨: cathedral * Il Proprietario: La cattedrale di Mondov√¨ Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Italy Category:Cathedrals in Piedmont Category:Churches in the province of Cuneo Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1753 ","title":"Mondov√¨ Cathedral"},{"id":"46886648","text":"The Kaiama Declaration was issued by the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) of Nigeria on 11 December 1998 to attribute the political crisis in Nigeria to the struggle for the control of oil mineral resources, while asserting that the degradation of the environment of Ijawland by transnational oil companies and the Nigerian State arise mainly because Ijaw people have been robbed of their natural rights to ownership and control of their land and resources.

In line with these statements, the youths also called for the military to withdraw from the region, and warned oil companies that they would be regarded as a \\"real enemy\\" if they relied on military protections. ==The Kaiama Declaration== THE KAIAMA DECLARATION BY THE IJAW YOUTHS OF THE NIGER DELTA BEING COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT THE END OF THE ALL IJAW YOUTHS CONFERENCE WHICH WAS HELD IN THE TOWN OF KAIAMA THIS 11TH DAY OF DECEMBER 1998. INTRODUCTION We, Ijaw youths drawn from over five hundred communities from over 40 clans that make up the Ijaw nation and representing 25 representative organisations met, today, in Kaiama to deliberate on the best way to ensure the continuous survival of the indigenous peoples of the Ijaw ethnic nationality of the Niger Delta within the Nigerian state. After exhaustive deliberations, the Conference observed: a. That it was through British colonisation that the IJAW NATION was forcibly put under the Nigerian State b. That but for the economic interests of the imperialists, the Ijaw ethnic nationality would have evolved as a distinct and separate sovereign nation, enjoying undiluted political, economic, social, and cultural AUTONOMY. c. That the division of the Southern Protectorate into East and West in 1939 by the British marked the beginning of the balkanisation of a hitherto territorially contiguous and culturally homogeneous Ijaw people into political and administrative units, much to our disadvantage. This trend is continuing in the balkanisation of the Ijaws into six states-Ondo, Edo, Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers and Akwa Ibom States, mostly as minorities who suffer socio-political, economic, cultural and psychological deprivations. d. That the quality of life of Ijaw people is deteriorating as a result of utter neglect, suppression and marginalisation visited on Ijaws by the alliance of the Nigerian state and transnational oil companies . e. That the political crisis in Nigeria is mainly about the struggle for the control of oil mineral resources which account for over 80% of GDP, 95 %of national budget and 90% of foreign exchange earnings. From which, 65%, 75% and 70% respectively are derived from within the Ijaw nation. Despite these huge contributions, our reward from the Nigerian State remains avoidable deaths resulting from ecological devastation and military repression. f. That the unabating damage done to our fragile natural environment and to the health of our people is due in the main to uncontrolled exploration and exploitation of crude oil and natural gas which has led to numerous oil spillages, uncontrolled gas flaring, the opening up of our forests to loggers, indiscriminate canalisation, flooding, land subsidence, coastal erosion, earth tremors etc. Oil and gas are exhaustible resources and the complete lack of concern for ecological rehabilitation, in the light of the Oloibiri experience, is a signal of impending doom for the peoples of Ijawland. g. That the degradation of the environment of Ijawland by transnational oil companies and the Nigerian State arise mainly because Ijaw people have been robbed of their natural rights to ownership and control of their land and resources through the instrumentality of undemocratic Nigerian State legislations such as the Land Use Decree of 1978, the Petroleum Decrees of 1969 and 1991, the Lands (Title Vesting etc.) Decree No. 52 of 1993 (Osborne Land Decree), the National Inland Waterways Authority Decree No. 13 of 1997 etc. h. That the principle of Derivation in Revenue Allocation has been consciously and systematically obliterated by successive regimes of the Nigerian state. We note the drastic reduction of the Derivation Principle from 100% (1953), 50% (1960), 45% (1970), 20% (1975) 2% (1982), 1.5% (1984) to 3% (1992 to date), and a rumored 13% in Abacha's 1995 undemocratic and unimplemented Constitution. i. That the violence in Ijawland and other parts of the Niger Delta area, sometimes manifesting in intra and inter ethnic conflicts are sponsored by the State and transnational oil companies to keep the communities of the Niger Delta area divided, weak and distracted from the causes of their problems. j. That the recent revelations of the looting of national treasury by the Abacha junta is only a reflection of an existing and continuing trend of stealing by public office holders in the Nigerian state. We remember the over 12 billion dollars Gulf war windfall, which was looted by Babangida and his cohorts We note that over 70% of the billions of dollars being looted by military rulers and their civilian collaborators is derived from our ecologically devastated Ijawland. Based on the foregoing, we, the youths of Ijawland, hereby make the following resolutions to be known as the Kaiama Declaration: 1\\\\. All land and natural resources (including mineral resources) within the Ijaw territory belong to Ijaw communities and are the basis of our survival. 2\\\\. We cease to recognise all undemocratic decrees that rob our peoples/communities of the right to ownership and control of our lives and resources, which were enacted without our participation and consent. These include the Land Use Decree and The Petroleum Decree etc. 3\\\\. We demand the immediate withdrawal from Ijawland of all military forces of occupation and repression by the Nigerian State. Any oil company that employs the services of the armed forces of the Nigerian State to \\"protect\\" its operations will be viewed as an enemy of the Ijaw people. Family members of military personnel stationed in Ijawland should appeal to their people to leave the Ijaw area alone. 4.Ijaw youths in all the communities in all Ijaw clans in the Niger Delta will take steps to implement these resolutions beginning from 30 December 1998, as a step towards reclaiming the control of our lives. We, therefore, demand that all oil companies stop all exploration and exploitation activities in the Ijaw area. We are tired of gas flaring; oil spillages, blowouts and being labelled saboteurs and terrorists. It is a case of preparing the noose for our hanging. We reject this labelling. Hence, we advice all oil companies staff and contractors to withdraw from Ijaw territories by 30 December 1998 pending the resolution of the issue of resource ownership and control in the Ijaw area of the Niger Delta 5\\\\. Ijaw youths and Peoples will promote the principle of peaceful coexistence between all Ijaw communities and with our immediate neighbours, despite the provocative and divisive actions of the Nigerian State, transnational oil companies and their contractors. We offer a hand of friendship and comradeship to our neighbors: the Itsekiri, Ilaje, Urhobo,Urhobo people Isoko, Edo, Ibibio, Ogoni, Ekpeye, Ikwerre etc. We affirm our commitment to joint struggle with the other ethnic nationalities in the Niger delta area for self- determination. 6\\\\. We express our solidarity with all peoples organisations and ethnic nationalities in Nigeria and elsewhere who are struggling for self- determination and justice. In particular we note the struggle of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC), the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop), Egi Women's Movement etc. 7\\\\. We extend our hand of solidarity to the Nigerian oil workers (NUPENG and PENGASSAN) and expect that they will see this struggle for freedom as a struggle for humanity 8\\\\. We reject the present transition to civil rule programme of the Abubakar regime, as it is not preceded by restructuring of the Nigerian federation. The way forward is a Sovereign National Conference of equally represented ethnic nationalities to discuss the nature of a democratic federation of Nigerian ethic nationalities. Conference noted the violence and killings that characterized the last local government elections in most parts of the Niger Delta. Conference pointed out that these electoral conflicts are a manifestation of the undemocratic and unjust nature of the military transition programme. Conference affirmed therefore, that the military are incapable of enthroning true democracy in Nigeria. 9 We call on all Ijaws to remain true to their Ijawness and to work for the total liberation of our people. You have no other true home but that which is in Ijawland. 10 We agreed to remain within Nigeria but to demand and work for Self Government and resource control for the Ijaw people. Conference approved that the best way for Nigeria is a federation of ethnic nationalities. The federation should be run on the basis equality and social justice. Finally, Ijaw youths resolve to set up the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) to coordinate the struggle of Ijaw peoples for self-determination and justice. Signed for the entire participants by: Felix Tuodolo and Ogoriba, Timi Kaiser- Wilhelm. ==Diepreye Alamieyeseigha on the Kaiama Declaration== On 16 November 2000, Bayelsa Governor Diepreye Alamieyeseigha supported the declaration and stated that he will \\"convince the governors of the South-South and the Southern governors to adopt the Kaiama declaration on resource control.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== *The Nigerian Civil War 1967-1970 *Itsekiris *Ijaw Youth Council *Ijaws *Itsekiri-Ijaw War in The South-South Zone of Nigeria *MEND *The Warri Crisis: Fueling Violence - Human Rights Watch Report, November 2003 *The Adaka Boro Centre *Ken Saro-Wiwa *\\"Blood Oil\\" by Sebastian Junger in Vanity Fair, February 2007 (accessed 28/1/2007), deals partly with the Ijaw Category:1998 in politics Category:Politics of Nigeria Category:Populated places in Bayelsa State ","title":"Kaiama Declaration"},{"id":"46886649","text":"Monique Williams is the name of: *Monique Williams (athlete) (born 1985), a New Zealand sprinter *Monique Williams (actress) (born 1992), an Australian actress ","title":"Monique Williams"},{"id":"46886668","text":"Brentwood State Park is a state park and athletic field complex located in the hamlet of Brentwood in Suffolk County, New York, United States. ==History== Brentwood State Park occupies land that was once part of the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center.

It was directed by Henri Safran from a script by Patricia Hooker and was shot at the ABC's Gore Hill Studios in Sydney. It was arguably the first depiction of a gay relationship in Australian TV drama. ==Plot== The plot deals with the relationship between Arthur Rimbaud (Alan Bickford) and Paul Verlaine (Alistair Duncan). Rimbaud arrives in Paris age 16 and in three years shocks and revolts all who knows him. His only friend and confidante is Verlaine. ==Cast== *Alan Bickford as Arthur Rimbaud *Alistair Duncan as Paul Verlaine *Marion Johns as Madam Verlaine, Verlaine's mother *Anne Haddy as Mathilde Verlaine *Betty Dyson as Madame Matue de Falureville, Mathilde's mother *Eve Hardwicke as Rimbaud's mother, Mme Rimbaud *Richard Davies as Father Martin *Patricia Hill as Isabelle Rimbaud *Susanne Haworth as Isabelle (child) *Michael Thomas as Frederick Rimbaud *Zennie Angliss as Vitalie Rimbaud *Robyn Richards as Marie *Ronald Morse as Official *Stanislav Polonski as Waiter ==Production== Patricia Hooker says the friendship of the two men always fascinated her (in 1962 she wrote an episode of a radio show, Poets Corner which focused on Rimbaud), but originally felt it would be necessary to study in France to achieve an authentic background. However she then worked on Concord of Sweet Sounds with Henri Safran, a director originally from France, who became interested in her idea of a play about Rimbaud. Hooker said, \\"With his help it was possible to collect the information I needed, much of which had never been translated from the French.\\" Alan Bickford was 19 when cast to play the 16 year old Rimbaud. It was one of 20 TV plays produced by the ABC in 1964 (and one of only three Australian scripts - the others were The Angry General and The Winds of Green Monday). The set was designed by Doug Smith. ==Reception== The television critic for the Sydney Morning Herald thought the play \\"was thoughtfully and capably built on known episodes\\" from the two poets' lives but \\"suffered by its very episodic character, as well as from the impossibility of supplying several essentials to true story' s full realisation.\\" He added \\"if the play was a gallant but incomplete effort, its production by Henri Safran was beautifully assured and sensitive, its camera work expert, while an excellent cast was headed by the impressive performances of Alastair Duncan as Verlaine and Alan Bickford as Rimbaud.\\" The Sunday Sydney Morning Herald called it \\"a first class production... one of the finest efforts to come from the studios at Gore Hill. It was top notch in all departments.\\" The Bulletin said \\"Hooker‚Äôs script was essentially a duologue with vignettes, and, although too episodic and uneven in its construction and development, incorporated the visions and images of the poet into the context of the relationship with considerable success only occasionally did Rimbaud step out of the play and declaim. Henri Safran‚Äôs production had style and atmosphere. He suggested the deliberately underwritten homosexual tensions by inference rather than by presentation, and he evoked the claustrophobic relationship by isolating the two poets in tight two-shots.\\" The Canberra Times said the play \\"in writing, acting, direction, design and technical production would rank well above par for the course in any country in the world. The fact that Australia can produce work of this kind is the strongest argument for the encouragement of our native talent. That it is not produced more often indicates how badly that encouragement, especially financial encouragement is needed.\\" The reviewer added that: > Alistair Duncan's portrayal was brilliant. The opening, highly dramatic > scenes of the play which Duncan shared with the beautiful Anne Haddy, > created such excitement that the viewer readily forgave some later > exaggerations... Miss Hooker's play is terribly weak on dialogue, but has > enough dramatic design to have allowed director Henri Safran's imaginative > cutting, clever atmospheric use of lighting and off beat camera-work to make > this one of the best productions seen from one of our best producers. ==Other productions== The play was performed on ABC radio in 1964.1964 radio production at Ausstage. The radio play was the ABC's official entry into the 1964 Italia Prize Competition. ==Repeats== The play was repeated in Sydney and Melbourne on 24 March 1965. 29 April 1965 (Melbourne, repeat) The play was later translated into Italian and French. It was turned into a stage play which was on at the Traverse Theatre in Edinbrugh.

Ric Hutton's acting was praised, \\"there was great visual and dramatic distinction in John of Gaunt's death scene\\" and \\"Desmonde Downing made a major contribution to the visual competence of the production with the skeletal Gothic arches, wintry trees, and thick-textured draperies of her sets and with costumes of emblazoned richness.\\" ==Legacy== Ric Hutton later appeared before Senator Vincent in Canberra at a Select Committee. Vincent asked Hutton to compare Australian television productions with those from overseas. \\"Did you see the A.B.C. production Richard II?\\" he asked. Hutton replied, \\"I was Richard II.\\" Then he added, \\"Perhaps he should have waited to hear what you were going to say.\\" Senator Vincent said he personally liked the play \\"very much\\", and thought it was one of the best staged by the A.B.C. ==See also== *List of television plays broadcast on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1960s) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1960s Australian television plays Category:1960 television plays Category:Films based on Richard II (play) ","title":"The Life and Death of King Richard II (1960 film)"},{"id":"46886823","text":"Trichaptum imbricatum is a species of fungus in the family Polyporaceae.

In an effort to save Elizabeth, Red blackmails Ressler into giving up the password, and surrenders to Garrick. Elizabeth escapes captivity during the getaway, and utilizing a contact Reddington named prior to her escape, a woman named \\"Mr. Kaplan\\" (Susan Blommaert), Elizabeth learns of an unidentified party providing surveillance on everyone in the task force.

The ICC Sydney, part of Darling Harbour Live, is being developed by a consortium comprising AEG Ogden (now ASM Global) Lend Lease, Capella Capital and Spotless, with AEG Ogden playing the role of venue operator. ==Location== ICC Sydney is located in the Darling Harbour, skirting the centre of the Sydney central business district and just from the Sydney International Airport. ICC Sydney is positioned on the waterfront, near Cockle Bay and Tumbalong Park. ICC Sydney opened adjacent to a new global financial services hub Barangaroo, as well as media, technology and knowledge centres. It features multiple public access points, with the option of visiting the precinct via a choice of walking or transport options including, road, light rail, train and ferry. ==History and structure== ICC Sydney was designed by two architectural firms, Hassell and Populous, in a contemporary modern style. It replaces the former Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre that was demolished in December 2013. Construction began in early 2014; an estimated of concrete will be used to construct the building. ICC Sydney is an 1.5 billion development being delivered through a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with the New South Wales Government and Darling Harbour Live (comprising Lend Lease, Hostplus, Capella Capital, AEG Ogden and Spotless). The development of ICC Sydney is part of a broader 3.4 billion revitalisation of Darling Harbour. Upon completion, ICC Sydney will adjoin a new 590 room luxury hotel tower (under the Sofitel brand), a residential and commercial development (Darling Square), pedestrian boulevard and improved public domain that are all being created as part of the Darling Harbour development. The development will also include a reconfiguration of Tumbalong Park, providing an additional of green space acting as a new adaptable event space. In accordance with the contractual agreement with Darling Harbour Live and the NSW Government, ICC Sydney secured First State Super, an equity partner in the PPP's consortium, as the naming rights sponsor for the venue's 9,000 seat entertainment theatre on 1 July 2019. The 9,000-seat venue would now be known as the \\"First State Super Theatre\\" for the next 10 years. In September 2020, First State Super Theatre became Aware Super Theatre, following the re-brand of naming rights partner First State Super to Aware Super. === Construction milestones === *July 2015, ICC Sydney Hotel construction commenced.

Like cacao, coffee has been introduced to and thrives in Guam. In the early 20th century, coffee was described as one Guam's most common plants, growing about most of the dwelling houses, and nearly every family has its cultivated patch. The climate and soil of the island is well adapted to it, producing the crop from sea level to the hill tops. ==History== Cox (1917) noted that coffee received little care in Guam, and grew in various situations and in almost any soil. Most of the houses of a village were surrounded by coffee bushes, and the fresh seeds sprouted spontaneously beneath the parent plant or if thrown upon soil in a shady place. There were no large plantations on the island, each family planting enough only for its own consumption. The berries were gathered, pulped, and hulled by hand. Coffee grown here is coffea arabica which is locally known as Kafe in Guam, and is of very fine quality, just adequate for local consumption with no surplus for export. Enough coffee is not produced in Guam for exportation; indeed, there is scarcely enough for the use of the local population. ===Production in the early 20th century=== Safford (1905) noted that coffee seeds in Guam were planted at a depth of about in beds. Seeds were planted in sementeras (nurseries) about apart, in rows. The plants, easily transplanted, require minimal watering. The best time for transplanting is at the beginning of the rainy season. The plants are shaded at first by sections of coconut leaves stuck in the ground in a slanting direction. Sometimes, the young plants are shaded by alternating rows of bananas. These are cut down when the coffee plants are well established. Catch crops of taro or maize may also be planted for the first two years. Weeding is accomplished by the fosifio (thrust-hoe). The plants are kept free from shoots or suckers sprouting out from their stems, which are removed when young. Although coffee disease is rare, the berries are sometimes eaten by rats, which infest the island. The berries are gathered as soon as they are ripe. Pulping is done by hand, and the mucilaginous material surrounding the seeds is removed by washing, after which the coffee is spread out to dry in the sun. The coffee is thoroughly dried before removing the hull. The chaff is removed by winnowing. In preparing it, the beans are roasted and ground on a stone metate with a cylindrical mano, like a \\"tapering rolling~pin of stone\\". ==Present prospects== In the 1970s there were only 200 coffee trees planted in Piti village in the Masso region that were growing, but due to a fire hardly any trees survived. In the same area, of the 240 trees planted in 1978, a few trees were reported to be sprouting. Some of these plants were used in a nursery of the Department of Agriculture to plant them in more areas. Tita Taitague, Director of the Department of Agriculture who had visited the nursery in 2012 is hopeful of the survival of this local coffee variety. ==References== * * ==Bibliography== * * Category:Coffee production Category:Economy of Guam ","title":"Coffee production in Guam"},{"id":"46887263","text":"George Bacon Wood (March 13, 1797 ‚Äì March 30, 1879) was an American physician, professor, and writer from Pennsylvania. A native of Greenwich, New Jersey, Wood was educated at the University of Pennsylvania, from which he received his medical degree in 1818. Four years later he became professor of chemistry in the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, and in 1821 took the chair of materia medica in the same institution, which he resigned in 1835 to accept the same branch in the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania. In 1850, having been continuously connected with the latter institution in the position mentioned, he was elected professor of the theory and practice of medicine in the same school, and upon his resigning, in 1860, he was unanimously appointed emeritus professor of the theory and practice of medicine. In 1863 he was made a member of the board of trustees of the university, and in 1865 he instituted and endowed the summer school with an auxiliary faculty, authorized to confer the degree of doctor of philosophy. He was physician to the Pennsylvania Hospital for twenty-four years (1835‚Äì59), and was a member of the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania for about the same period. At the time of his death he was president of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, and president of the American Philosophical Society. He was a member of a number of other societies, and had been president of the American Medical Association. During the last four years he had been an invalid and confined to his house, the last two years being unable to leave his couch. He is buried in the South segment (Section 10, Lot 14 to 17) of Laurel Hill Cemetery, Philadelphia Wood contributed frequently to medical literature, but his reputation as a writer is chiefly based upon his Treatise on Practice, published in 1847, which ran through six editions, the last being in 1867. Previous to this work, however, he had, with the late Dr. Bache, compiled the Dispensatory of the United States, which first appeared in 1833. He also wrote a Treatise on Therapeutics and Pharmacology or Materia Medica (Philadelphia, 1856), and a number of addresses, including a short History of the Pennsylvania Hospital and one of the University of Pennsylvania.

In Montgomeryville, the route turns north to run concurrent with Pennsylvania Route 309 (PA 309) on five-lane Bethlehem Pike past several businesses. US 202 Bus. splits from PA 309 by turning northeast onto two-lane Doylestown Road. The route crosses into Bucks County and becomes Butler Avenue, passing through Chalfont and New Britain and curving east. West of Doylestown, the business route ends at an interchange with PA 611 in Doylestown Township. The road between Montgomeryville and Doylestown was originally designated as US 122 in 1926, with PA 52 running concurrent for a short time in the late 1920s. US 202 replaced the US 122 designation in the 1930s. US 202 was moved to a freeway bypass of Doylestown in the 1970s, heading south from State Street on PA 611 before heading east on its own. In 2012, US 202 was moved to a newly built parkway running between Montgomeryville and Doylestown, leaving the former alignment without a signed route designation. As a result of the realignment of US 202, several businesses along the former alignment saw declines in customers. The businesses lobbied for the former alignment to be designated as US 202 Bus.; the designation was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in 2015. ==Route description== US 202 Bus. northbound past PA 309/PA 463 in Montgomeryville US 202 Bus. begins at an intersection with US 202 in Upper Gwynedd Township, Montgomery County, heading north on Dekalb Pike, a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The road passes between fields to the west and businesses to the east, coming to an intersection with PA 63. Upon crossing PA 63, the route enters Montgomery Township in the North Penn Valley region and continues past commercial development before curving northeast and becoming a four-lane undivided road that passes residential subdivisions. US 202 Bus. passes between the Montgomery Mall to the northwest and businesses to the southeast, reaching a junction with PA 309 (Bethlehem Pike) in the community of Montgomery Square. At this point, US 202 Bus. turns northwest to form a concurrency with PA 309 on four-lane divided Bethlehem Pike, passing between the mall to the west and shopping centers to the east. The two routes heads north past more businesses and become a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane past the North Wales Road intersection. PA 309/US 202 Bus. becomes a four-lane divided highway again and heads into the community of Montgomeryville. Here, the highway comes to the Five Points intersection, where PA 463 crosses and US 202 Bus. splits from PA 309 by heading northeast onto Doylestown Road. The route passes businesses as a two-lane divided road before gaining a center turn lane and running through wooded residential areas, heading to the southeast of a golf course. The road loses the turn lane and continues past homes before heading into business areas and coming to an intersection with County Line Road. US 202 Bus. at its northern terminus at PA 611 in Doylestown Township Upon crossing County Line Road, US 202 Bus. leaves the North Penn Valley region and enters New Britain Township in Bucks County. Here, the route becomes West Butler Avenue, heading past businesses before running through a mix of residential and commercial development. The road crosses into the borough of Chalfont and passes through wooded areas of homes prior to reaching an intersection with PA 152. At this point, PA 152 joins US 202 Bus., with the road crossing the West Branch Neshaminy Creek and heading into a business district. PA 152 splits to the north and US 202 Bus. becomes East Butler Avenue, passing residences before crossing the North Branch Neshaminy Creek in a wooded area. The road passes businesses and intersects Bristol Road, at which point it enters the borough of New Britain and crosses SEPTA's Lansdale/Doylestown Line at-grade. The route follows West Butler Avenue past commercial development before running through wooded residential areas, becoming East Butler Avenue after crossing Tamenend Avenue. US 202 Bus. curves east and runs through more wooded areas of development, crossing Cooks Run and passing to the north of Delaware Valley University. The road enters Doylestown Township and becomes West State Street, curving northeast and widening to a four-lane divided highway. The route comes to an interchange with the PA 611 freeway bypass of the borough of Doylestown, at which point US 202 Bus. ends and West State Street continues into Doylestown as State Route 3002 (SR 3002), an unsigned quadrant route. ==History== When routes were first legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, what is now US 202 Bus. was part of Legislative Route 178, which ran between Norristown and Buckingham. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the stretch of road between Montgomeryville and Doylestown became part of US 122, which was paved. PA 52 was designated concurrent with US 122 in 1928. By 1930, the concurrent PA 52 designation was removed from US 122. In the 1930s, US 122 was replaced with US 202. In addition, the stretch concurrent with US 309 (now PA 309) was widened into a multilane road. In the 1970s, US 202 was rerouted to a freeway bypass of Doylestown instead of passing through the borough on State Street, heading south with PA 611 before heading east on its own. On December 3, 2012, US 202 was realigned onto a newly constructed parkway between Montgomeryville and Doylestown. The US 202 parkway was built in order to reduce congestion on the former alignment between Montgomeryville and Doylestown. The former alignment was designated as SR 2202 in Montgomery County and SR 4202 in Bucks County. As a result of the removal of the US 202 designation from the former alignment, several businesses along the former route saw declines in customers. In 2014, several businesses along the former US 202 pushed for the state to designate the road as US 202 Bus. in order to help them gain customers. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering approved the US 202 Bus. designation on May 13, 2015. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * * == References External links== * 02-2 Business Pennsylvania Montgomeryville-Doylestown 02-2 Business (Montgomeryville-Doylestown) Category:Transportation in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Bucks County, Pennsylvania Business (Montgomeryville-Doylestown, Pennsylvania) ","title":"U.S. Route 202 Business (Montgomeryville‚ÄìDoylestown, Pennsylvania)"},{"id":"46887396","text":"Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre is a meetings, conventions and exhibitions centre located at the junctions of Nicoll Highway, Raffles Boulevard and Temasek Boulevard in Singapore's Central Business District, next to Esplanade MRT station.

The revamp focused on providing flexibility and functionality with the integration of advanced technology. Today, the centre's chefs can serve 10,000 meals daily, and the free high-speed WiFi within the centre allows 6,000 concurrent users at any time. The entrance at Suntec has also become a popular landmark for phototaking by tourists due to the installation of the world's largest HD Video Wall. ==Description of venue== Due to the intention of making its space flexible, the Centre has made its 42,000 m¬≤ of event space customisable for events of varying scales. On Level 3, the space can be configured for group meetings or large exhibitions using the soundproofed operable wall systems. The system allows the space to be split into a maximum of 36 custom-made meeting rooms. Aside from hosting regular consumer exhibitions, the Centre's large multi-purpose exhibition halls on Level 4 can also be converted into settings for conferences, plenary sessions or ballrooms with a programmable LED lighting solution. The column- free exhibition space in the Level 6 auditoriums boasts high ceilings, heavy- duty floor loading capacity and rigging systems, making it an ideal venue for concerts, product launches, sporting events and other large-scale events. Currently, the Level 6 auditorium is used by City Harvest Church (which owns 39.2% of the building) for their services over the weekend, while it remains available for Suntec to market as event space during the week while Faith Community Baptist Church uses the Nicoll Rooms at Level 3 for their weekend English services through a lease. ==Hall capacity== The convention centre's level 4 and 6 have the following hall capacities.

The album was produced by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, arranged by Stanley Johnson and Bobby Martin, and engineered by Joe Tarsia. On its original Neptune Records release in 1970 the LP reached #12 on the Billboard soul charts and #183 on the pop charts. The Bobby Martin penned \\"Let's Fall in Love All Over\\" was released as a single but failed to chart. The album was re-released with new cover art in 1973 on Philadelphia International Records reaching #186 on the pop chart and #43 on the soul charts. Big Break Records remastered the album for its 2012 re- release on CD. ==Release and critical reaction== Billy Paul originally recorded the song \\"Ebony Woman\\" in 1959 and it was released as a single on the New Dawn label. The song was resurrected and re-cut as the title track for an album which Paul and his producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff wanted to make a statement with. Specifically, Paul's debut Feelin' Good at the Cadillac Club was a conventional jazz album with sparse production that failed to make the impact they hoped it would. Paul recalled the shift in direction: \\"We decided to do something with a more up-to-date sound, with more musicians. Something that would venture a bit into R&B; but without me losing my sound. We spent a lot of time workin it out and came up with the album called Ebony Woman, which came out on Neptune.\\" Paul mixed jazz and soul; ballads with mid-tempo and upbeat numbers; and covers with originals‚Äîa formula he would repeat on subsequent albums. The album's modest chart success was buoyed by its considerable appeal in Detroit, home of Motown. Ed Williams, Program Director for WLIB in New York City, wrote the liner notes that appear on the back cover of the album: Author John A. Jackson explained how the album's struggles were necessarily tied to the fortunes, or lack thereof, of Gamble & Huff's independent record label Neptune Records: Specifically, Neptune was distributed by Chess Records and when owner Leonard Chess died, Neptune was forced to close shop. Young women at the Civil Rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, 1963. But Paul continued to record for Gamble & Huff's new label Philadelphia International Records and following the massive success of Me and Mrs. Jones and the 360 Degrees of Billy Paul album, Gamble & Huff decided to reissue Paul's first two albums. When asked in 1973 about a follow- up to 360 Degrees, Paul replied: Allmusic's Ron Wynn called the album \\"good, though uneven\\" giving it two out of five stars. Chris Wells also gave the album two of five stars noting that the title track for the album is \\"by far its best track ‚Äì a gorgeous, superbly sung ballad, a paean to the African- American female in a time of civil rights and social and political consciousness. Unfortunately a lot of the rest isn‚Äôt up to much. Basically, it‚Äôs covers all the way...Paul investing lots of effort to no great purpose. True, Billy‚Äôs own contributions reveal him to be a singer of character and individuality, albeit one in need of some strong material to call his own.\\" On the album's 2012 reissue, Joe Marchese of The Second Disc called it a \\"must- have reissue.... an album that‚Äôs most worthy of reassessment and reissue especially during this, PIR‚Äôs 40th anniversary year.\\" ==Track listing== Side 1 #\\"Ebony Woman\\" - (Morris Bailey) 3:52 #\\"Mrs. Robinson\\" - (Paul Simon) 4:31 #\\"Windmills of Your Mind\\" - (Alan and Marilyn Bergman, Michel Legrand) 8:00 #\\"Everyday People\\" - (Sylvester Stuart) 3:55 Side 2 #\\"Let's Fall in Love All Over\\" - (Robert Martin) 3:51 #\\"Windy\\" - (Ruthann Friedman) 2:50 #\\"Psychedelic Sally\\" - (Horace Silver) 2:58 #\\"Traces\\" - (Buddy Buie, J.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012. ==Squadron history1950s=== Roots PB4Y-2 BuNo 66261 (marked as BuNo 66304) in the collection of the National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola, Florida. Fleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 PrivateersDonald from NAS Port Lyautey and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet Lavochkin La-11 fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of LiepƒÅja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. By 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the P-4M-1 Mercator that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune. Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two Allison J33-A-10A turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major radial's nacelles.East, Don C. In 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its sister unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft. The unit operated all over the European Theater from a variety of bases. Regular deployment sites were Incirlik, Mildehnall, Wiesbaden, Schleswig, and Malta. Establishment VQ-2 was commissioned as Electronic Countermeasures Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spaces and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey. Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men. P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant. P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo. The squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two Westinghouse J34-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \\"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics). The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960. In September 1956, a new and faster carrier-capable A3D-1Q Skywarrior was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \\"The Whale\\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F.FrancillonHeinemannGunston The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four.Winchester 2006, p. 75. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE). The Lebanon Crisis in 1958 on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of Camille Chamoun, the President. VQ-2 operated out of Beirut Airport through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958. Homeport change As a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by Spain and the United States, the US pledged to furnish economic and military aid to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory (Naval Station Rota, Mor√≥n Air Base, Torrej√≥n Air Base, and Zaragoza Air Base). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota. The relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. During this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed) brought an increase in capability to the community. Aircraft/aircrew losses and mishaps Over the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps: # On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to NAS Norfolk, Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373) lost an engine on approach. The aircraft crashed at 22 St. and E. Ocean Ave., Norfolk, killing four crew and injuring three civilians.\\"Four Missing In Air Crash\\", The Anderson Independent, 7 January 1958 Two aircrew were injured and one was uninjured. # On 16 October 1958, returning to Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356) crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed. ===1960s=== Change While keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, VQ-1 was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. The Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star. The \\"Willie Victors,\\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone. On 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a Type/Model/Series (T/M/S). With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M. A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2. In theater operations In response to the Berlin Crisis of 1961, VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis was Cyprus Crisis in 1964 saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the USS Saratoga (CVA-60). Detachments aboard provided support to the Mediterranean deployed carriers. While operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the Six-Day War where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the USS Liberty during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia. Cuban Missile Crisis In October 1962 the Cuban Missile Crisis developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to NAS Key West to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. Vietnam During the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at NAS Cubi Point, Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, VQ-1, established its DET BRAVO flying from Da Nang Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the Ho Chi Minh Trail and Gulf of Tonkin. As combat operations from CTF 77 on Yankee Station into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point. Aircraft/aircrew losses and mishaps Over the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps. # Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to Incirlik AFB. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. All sixteen aircrew were killed. # On 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390) staged at Wiesbaden Air Base, took off from F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base on a training flight. Inflight, the rear cargo door opened while at 18,000 feet. The flight crew declared an emergency and diverted to Munich-Riem Airport. To observers on the ground, WV-2Q seemed explode with the tail separating from the main fuselage over Markt Schwaben, 17 km south of Munich Airport. The main fuselage and tail section crashed several hundred yards apart in fields southwest of the town. The aircraft was totally destroyed killing all twenty-two Navy and four Army aircrew. Debris and documents were scattered on an area over 65 km2. # On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three. # On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458) struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the USS Independence (CVA-62) in the central Mediterranean off Sicily. All six aircrew aboard were lost at sea. # Returning from a mission along the East German/Czech border in the during the \\"Prague Spring\\" of 1968, an EA-3B was entering the landing pattern at Ramstein AFB when it had a slat malfunction pitching nose-up turn. With the plane seeming to enter a stall, the pilot signalled for a crew bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed but at 1200 feet altitude. Again, just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the slat suddenly operated allowing a recovery at Ramstein. Although bailing out at a low altitude, the four back end crew survived. # On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670), flown by the new (by barely beyond a month) squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in Naples, Italy. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff and descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill, cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site. # In the summer of 1968, a rocket attack on Danang damaged the nose and cockpit of EA-3B (BUNO 144848). DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard. ===1970s=== Continued change EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971 In the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \\"homesteading\\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased. The 1970s also saw an increase in the number of women assigned to the squadron. Through the decade, female officers and sailors provided valuable support at the squadron's homeport. As the number of women grew, the command took over an entire floor in one of the barracks on base for its enlisted women. The host nation was also changing. In November 1975, Franco died and Juan Carlos I ascended the throne. Spain began a new era of democracy and engagement with the rest of Western Europe. The EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron. On 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the EP-3E Aries aircraft. These EP-3s were converted from P-3A and P-3B airframes. This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s, the availability of parts, and the lower flight hours on the aircraft. It would take five years until the final EP-3E arrived in Rota. By the end of 1974, enough Aries were in Rota to let VQ-2 to stop operating its EC-121Ms. In May of 1972, VQ-2 also received a TA-3B and a UP-3A to use for crew training and logistics. These aircraft flew regularly from Rota on local flights as well as airlifts and parts runs to various detachments ashore and afloat. Of note, after 1974, the detachment at Incirlik, relocated to Athens. Due to Greece's popularity with British vacationers, the squadron saw an increase in intermarriage between its sailors and British nationals as well as with host nation citizens. Continued crisis In this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's policy of d√©tente. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from the 1969 coup in Libya, the 1970 Jordan Crisis, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the 1974 crisis in Cyprus, and the multiple flare ups in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. Despite d√©tente, the Soviet Union was conducting a program of providing significant amounts of military hardware to its client states of Libya, Syria (which had intervened with troops in Lebanon as the bulk of an Arab Deterrent Force), and Egypt. At the same time, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean. While Egypt left the Soviet fold after the Yom Kippur War, the buildups on the levane and North Africa made the Central and Eastern Mediterranean hot spots for VQ-2's monitoring of Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam. In the Eastern Mediterranean and Levant, Palestinian terrorist attacks into Israel from Lebanon ratcheted up the stress in Arab/Israeli relations. As the attacks continued, the squadron increased its patrols along the Levant. The situation exploded into the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. After the Israeli withdrawal from the Litani River, the defeated PLO was replaced by Hezbollah as Israel's main antagonist in Lebanon. Hezbollah received significant backing from Iran as well as Syria which still had troops in the country. In 1979, the Iranian Revolution saw an increased US presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. The seizing of hostages at the embassy in Tehran further exacerbated tensions leading to VQ-2 manning of Indian Ocean carrier and Diego Garcia detachments alongside VQ-1. This manning would continue until the third phase of the Lebanese Civil War in 1982. Aircraft/aircrew losses and mishaps Although the decade was less lethal than its predecessor, VQ-2 suffered the twelve aircrew fatalities and lost three aircraft in mishaps. # On 26 February 1970, EA-3B (BUNO 144851) was lost while operating from the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt in the Mediterranean. The catapult system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\\" resulting in the Whale ‚Äúdribbling‚Äù off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident. # On 8 March 1974, EA-3B (BUNO 142257) was lost while operating from the USS America in the Mediterranean. A cable parted in the Arresting gear when the tailhook caught the wire. The pilot who had begun retarding the throttles to idle as per standard procedure, slammed them forward managing to regain enough airspeed to get the plane off the angle and ditch it in the water off to the port side. This allowed the plane to avoid being run over by the ship. The Americas plane guard helicopter recovered all the aircrew. The airframe continued to float and was deemed a hazard to navigation forcing the ship to have one of its A-7A' strafe it to sink it. # On 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport- configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863) crashed at Capodichino in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash. Throughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. ===1980s=== USS Saratoga inn 1986. Constant change The 1980s saw VQ-2 continue flying the EP-3E and EA-3B aircraft at a high tempo. The squadron maintained a permanent detachment in Athens, but unlike its sister squadron, VQ-1 who had a permanently assigned Officer-in-Charge (OIC) at its Atsugi detachment, VQ-2 rotated its OIC with the aircrews. Throughout the decade, the squadron regular had detachments at Mildenhall, Schleswig, Keflavik, Machrihanish, and Sigonella. The squadron also manned detachments on all Sixth Fleet carriers until October 1987, when the Navy deemed the A-3 no longer capable of safe, routine carrier operations after multiple mishaps with high loss of life in the active and reserve A-3 community. Women continued to play an ever greater and important role in squadron operations. As the decade progressed, women routinely deployed to land-based detachments. Another milestone came at the end of the decade when the authorization for women to fly in combat support aircraft was extended to the EP-3E. Female pilots, NFOs, and aircrew began arriving and deploying in the Spring of 1989. . Eastern and Central Mediterranean hot spots At the beginning of the decade, the command had detachments covering the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the Indian Ocean, and the Persian Gulf. Over the following years, the squadron would have its most dynamic and productive period during peacetime operations. The Soviet Union's reaction to the start of the Solidarity trade union in Poland created tensions which combined with the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan to effectively end d√©tente. Missions into the Baltic increased as a result. With d√©tente over, VQ-2 saw a buildup in the Soviet Navy's activity level and modernization, all of which kept the squadron's assets stretched thin. Also as result of the end of d√©tente, there was an increase of Soviet and Cuban activity in the Western Hemisphere. Poor relations with the new pro-Soviet Sandinista regime saw detachments run out Panama as well as Key West. The resolution of the Hostage Crisis and the onset of the Iran Iraq War lessened Iranian focus on the US which ended the Diego Garcia detachment, but the command would still have assets in the region when an East Coast carrier relieved a Pacific Fleet carrier the Indian Ocean. The terrorist threat from Iran would continue throughout the region. In June 1982, after repeated terrorist attacks launched from Lebanon, Israel launched another invasion of Lebanon. The Israeli Air Force also launched an air campaign in the Bekaa that gored the Syrian air force and air defence system. With the IDF reaching Beirut, a diplomatic solution ended the conflict by removing the PLO to Tunisia. VQ-2 was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of Libya during Operation El Dorado Canyon, 12‚Äì17 April 1986. Aircraft/aircrew losses and mishaps On 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members. ===1990s=== In the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken Liberia in operation Sharp Edge. RIAT '92. From August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm, Proven Force, and Provide Comfort. On 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year. Starting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations Deny Flight, Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to NATO and United Nations forces in the Former Yugoslavia. As of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two P-3C Orion aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete. In March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from Albania following unrest from a failed pyramid savings scheme during Operation Silver Wake. ===2000s=== VQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005. The relocation of VQ-2's six aircraft and 450 Sailors to the United States was in keeping with the Navy's ongoing transformation of forces in Europe and helped reduce costs and eliminate redundancies throughout its force structure worldwide. The move co- located the squadron with VQ-1, already based at NAS Whidbey Island, and realized efficiency through the consolidation of personnel deployment practices, aircraft maintenance practices, and aircrew training for these unique Navy squadrons. ===2010s=== The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012 ending 57 years of service. The last squadron commander was Commander Mark Stockfish. ==See also== *Andalucia *Cadiz *Naval Station Rota *Puerto de Santa Maria *Rota, Spain *US Sixth Fleet *US Naval Forces Africa *VQ-1 ==NotesReferences== * \\"Accident Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior 142670, 04 Jun 1968,\\" Aviation Safety Net * \\"All A-3 Skywarriors Produced by Douglas,\\" A-3 Skywarrior Association * \\"Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed,\\" Burea of Aircraft Accidents Archive * \\"Four Missing In Air Crash\\", The Anderson Independent, 7 January 1958 * \\"VQ-2 Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO,\\" Global Security * \\"VQ-2 Mishaps,\\" VP Navy * Donald, David and Jon Lake, eds.

In the video game console community, the term is often written as custom firmware or simply CFW, referring to an altered version of the original system software (also known as the official firmware or simply OFW) inside a video game console such as the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS. == Video game consoles == Custom firmware often allow homebrew applications or ROM image backups to run directly within the game console, unlike official firmware, which usually only allow signed or retailed copies of software to run. Because custom firmware is often associated with software piracy, console manufacturers such as Nintendo and Sony have put significant effort into blocking custom firmware and other third party devices and content from their game consoles. === PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita === Custom firmware is commonly seen in the PlayStation Portable handhelds released by Sony. Notable custom firmware include M33 by Dark_AleX as well as those made by others such as the 5.50GEN series, Minimum Edition (ME/LME), and PRO. Custom firmware is also seen in the PlayStation 3 console. Only early \\"Fat\\" and Slim (CECH-20xx until CECH-25xx) model to run custom firmware. Slim (CECH-30xx) and Super Slim model can only run HEN (Homebrew Enabler), which has functionality similar to a custom firmware. The PlayStation Vita, has eCFW meaning custom firmware for PSP running in the PSP emulator of the PS Vita. These eCFWs include ARK, TN-V and more recently, Adrenaline, which includes more features since it was hacked from the native side. In 2016 things changed for the PS Vita scene, as a Team called Molecule released HENkaku which alters the OFW of the PS Vita on firmware 3.60 and by doing so creating a custom firmware on your handheld, opening it up like never before. The team behind the original HENkaku has also released taiHEN. taiHEN is a framework on which the newest version of HENkaku runs. It is a way to load plugins at the system level like you were used to on the PSP allowing you to change/add function to your console. Enso is a bootloader vulnerability of the Vita that make HENkaku permanent and allows to run itself on the boot. So the Vita has a full CFW with HENkaku taiHEN and Enso. People on 3.60 can also update to 3.65 without losing HENkaku Enso. === Nintendo 3DS === The modding scene of the Nintendo 3DS primarily involve custom firmware (software which patches the official firmware \\"on the fly\\"), which requires an exploit to obtain control of the ARM9, the 3DS' security coprocessor, and, secondarily, flash cartridges, which emulate an original game cart (which can be solely used to play untouched game cart ROM backups). The current most widely used CFW is Luma3DS, developed by Aurora Wright and TuxSH, which allows unsigned CIA (CTR Importable Archives) installation, includes open-source rewritten system firmware modules, and exception handling for homebrew software developers. Other past and abandoned CFWs included Gateway (a proprietary CFW locked to a flash cartridge via DRM and the first publicly available one), Pasta, RxTools (the first free and widely used one), Cakes CFW (the first open source CFW, which used a modularized approach for patches and was the inspiration for the following ones), ReiNAND, which Luma3DS was originally based on, and Corbenik; as of now the only custom firmware still currently being developed is Luma3DS (previously known as AuReiNAND). 3DS CFWs used to rely on \\"EmuNAND\\"/\\"RedNAND\\", a feature that boots the system from an unpartitioned space of the SD card containing a copy of the 3DS' NAND memory. These EmuNANDs could protect the 3DS system from bricking, as the usual system NAND was unaffected if the emuNAND is no longer functioned properly or was otherwise unusable. EmuNANDs could also be updated separately from the usual system NAND, allowing users to have the latest system version on the EmuNAND while retaining the vulnerable version on the system NAND; thus making online play and Nintendo eShop access possible on outdated 3DS system versions. EmuNANDs were obsoleted by the release of arm9loaderhax, a boot-time ARM9 exploit that allowed people to safely use SysNAND and update it, as CFWs started patching the OS' update code so that official updates wouldn't remove the exploit. However, this exploit required a downgrade to a very early system version to get the console's unique OTP, necessary for the installation. On May 19, 2017 a new exploit basis called sighax was released, replacing arm9loaderhax and allowing users to get even earlier control of the system, granting code execution in the context of the bootROM and thus a cleaner environment, with no downgrades or OTP required. Boot9Strap, a user-friendly version of sighax, was released. At the same time, another bootROM exploit called ntrboot was announced, which allows people to use a backdoor present in the bootROM to get full system control on any 3DS console regardless of the firmware version (as the bootROM can't be updated), only requiring a modified DS flash cartridge and a magnet. The initial release was on August 12, supporting the AceKard 2i and R4i Gold 3DS RTS cartridges. === Nintendo Switch === Currently, several custom firmwares for the Switch console exist: Atmosph√®re, ReiNX and SX OS. The differences between them are largely inconsequential; Atmosph√®re remains in active development and is free and open-source software. ReiNX bases much of its code off Atmosph√®re but with some modifications to runtime components and a different bootloader, while SX OS is closed source and paid, but largely based on Atmosph√®re code despite assertions to the contrary. Nintendo has made the Switch environment much more secure than previous consoles. Despite this, there exist notable bugs which lead to user exploits. Of these, the NVIDIA Tegra stack bug () is the most well-exploited. It leverages the Recovery Mode (RCM) of the Switch unit in order to push unsigned/unverified payloads, in turn granting the user access to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability has been further leveraged by users within the Switch hacking scene to reverse-engineer the firmware, leading to two other notable exploits: Nereba and Caffeine. While RCM is a hardware exploit, Nereba and Caffeine are software exploits and rely on the console being at or below specific firmware versions in order to make use of the exploits. RCM, being hardware related, merely relies on the console being vulnerable to that particular exploit and does not have a firmware requirement or range. Due to NVIDIA's disclosure of CVE-2018-6242, Nintendo was forced to address the vulnerability, and during late 2018 began manufacturing and distributing units which have been hardware patched and are unable to access the RCM vulnerability. Any unit manufactured during or after this time is likely to be hardware patched, including the Switch Lite and the newer \\"red box\\" Switches, and any unit which is hardware patched and running a relatively recent firmware is unlikely to be able to access custom firmware at this time or in the future due to the unusually secure software environment of the Switch. ==Android== The practice of replacing the system partition of the Android operating system, usually mounted as read-only, with a modified version of Android is called \\"flashing.\\" The procedure is generally not supported by device manufacturers, and requires advanced knowledge of OS mechanics. However, recent years have brought many more manufacturers, such as LG,https://developer.lge.com/resource/mobile/RetrieveBootloader.dev?categoryTypeCode=ANRS Motorola,https://motorola-global- portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-a OnePlus,https://web.archive.org/web/20161231093315/https://oneplus.net/at/support/answer/will- rooting-or-unlocking-the-bootloader-void-my-warranty Google (but not on devices that are locked by certain carriers such as Verizon or AT&T;), and Sonyhttps://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/get-started/unlock- bootloader/ allowing customers to unlock the bootloader, bypassing secure boot, without the need for exploits. The \\"custom ROMs\\" being used may include different features, require less power, or offer other benefits to the user. == Other devices == Various other devices, such as digital cameras, wireless routers and smart TVs, may also run custom firmware.How hackers are outsmarting smart TVs and why it matters to you Examples of such custom firmware include: * Rockbox for portable media players * iPodLinux for iPod portable media players * CHDK and Magic Lantern for Canon digital cameras * Nikon Hacker project for Nikon EXPEED DSLRs * Coreboot and Libreboot for computers * Many third-party firmware projects for wireless routers, including: ** LibreWRT project for Ben Nanonote, Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH and other computers with minimal resources ** OpenWrt, and its derivatives such as DD-WRT ** RouterTech, for ADSL gateway routers based on the Texas Instruments AR7 chipset (with the Pspboot or Adam2 bootloader) * Cable Hack and Sigma for uncapping cable modems, but with dubious legality * Firmware that allows DVD drives to be region-free * SamyGO, modified firmware for Samsung smart TVs == See also == * List of custom Android firmware * List of router firmware projects * Nintendo DS homebrew * PlayStation Portable homebrew *iOS Jailbreaking == References == Category:Homebrew software Category:Video game development ","title":"Custom firmware"},{"id":"46887720","text":"Thoongaa Vanam () is a 2015 Indian action thriller film directed by Rajesh M.

In retribution, Vittal Rao (Prakash Raj), a drug smuggler who had masterminded the scam, kidnaps Diwakar's son Vasu (Aman Abdullah). He is willing to release Vasu if Diwakar can return to him a bag of cocaine that he seized while thwarting the scam. Without any options, Diwakar agrees and proceeds to Vittal's nightclub, where Vasu is held hostage with the bag of cocaine, hiding it in the men's toilet. However, this is noticed by his colleague Mallika (Trisha), who becomes suspicious. Thinking that Diwakar is involved in drug smuggling, she informs her superior Dhiraviyam (Kishore). Both begin to pursue Diwakar, taking away the bag of cocaine from the toilet in the process. When Diwakar realizes that the bag of cocaine has gone missing, he decides to return to Vittal a bag containing packets of maida instead, thinking that he and his cronies, including a gangster named Pedha Babu (Sampath Raj), will not realize the difference. Unfortunately, Vittal and Pedha soon find out that Diwakar had cheated them and decide to kill him. Caught between Vittal's gang on one side and Mallika and Dhiraviyam on the other side, Diwakar confronts Mallika and tells her that contrary to her suspicions, he is working undercover and had planned the entire operation to expose police officers such as Dhiraviyam and even Mani, who are involved in drug smuggling. Then, Diwakar rescues Vasu without Vittal's knowledge, and Vittal is also arrested by Mallika and Dhiraviyam. While taking Vittal to prison, Mallika finds out that she has Mani's mobile phone, and on reading the messages in it, she finds out that Diwakar had been speaking the truth all along, realizing that Dhiraviyam and Mani are involved in drug smuggling and had tried to frame Diwakar. Though Dhiraviyam tries to resist arrest, killing Vittal in the process, he is eventually brought to justice. Three months later, Mallika is now Diwakar's deputy. The movie ends with both of them thwarting the attempted murder of a police officer. ==Cast== * Kamal Haasan as CK Diwakar IRS * Prakash Raj as Vittal Rao * Trisha as Mallika * Kishore as Dhiraviyam * Sampath Raj as Pedha Babu * Yugi Sethu as Mani * Asha Sharath as Dr. Sujatha, Ck Diwakar's wife * Aman Abdullah as Vasu Diwakar * Madhu Shalini as Esther (nurse) * Jagan as Jagan * Uma Riyaz Khan as Maheswari * Guru Somasundaram as Duraipandian * Santhana Bharathi as Thandapani (Tamil version) * * Chaams as Chef * Suka as Mandhiramoorthy * Rajesh Selva as Head Chef ==ProductionPre- production=== Kamal Haasan announced that his next project, a bilingual thriller titled Thoongaa Vanam in Tamil, and it would be directed by his former assistant Rajesh Selva and produced by himself.

Avinash Gopinath of Filmibeat gave 3.5/5 stars and concluded \\"Without any songs and romantic sequences, is not your regular Tamil film. After all, who else other than Kamal Haasan can make a Kollywood flick look truly international?\\" Rating it 3/5 stars, S. Saraswathi of Rediff appreciated the performances of the lead cast as well as the film's technical aspects but criticised the lack of pace in the film's screenplay before concluding \\"the intriguing plot, good performances, Ghibran's innovative background score and camera angles of Sanu Varghese make director Rajesh M.

Sneed House (also, Sneed House and Comal Bluff) is a historic former limestone plantation house in Austin, Texas, commissioned by Judge Sebron Graham Sneed. It was likely designed by architect and general contractor, Abner Hugh Cook, co-owner of the sawmill where Sneed had purchased lumber for the construction of the house. Cook is most notable for designing the Texas Governor's Mansion in Austin. ==History== In 1848, Judge Sebron Graham Sneed and his family moved to Austin from Fayetteville, Arkansas. In 1850, Sneed purchased a 470-acre farm from the Santiago Del Valle Land Grant for $1000. The homestead was built starting in 1852 by Sneed's slaves and was completed by 1857.Sam Ramos, \\"The Plantation at Comal Bluff: Sneed House ruins tell a story beneath and behind modern Austin\\" (May 23, 2014). . The Austin Chronicle The walls of the house were built with limestone that was quarried from the Sneed farm, and brought to the construction site to be finished by hand. Lumber that was used for the floors, roof, and millwork was obtained 30 miles east in Bastrop, Texas. It was likely purchased from the Higgins Mill, a sawmill that had operated out of Lost Pines Forest along Copperas Creek since 1841. It is one of the few surviving pre-Civil War structures in the city. By 1860, the Sneed family owned 21 slaves. During the Civil War, Sebron Sneed's sons enlisted as soldiers with the Confederacy and the house was used as a recruiting station (or Confederate hospital) during the war. By the end of the war, Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves who would have maintained the homestead and farm. Sneed later willed 55 acres of the property and the house at Comal Bluff to his daughter Marinda Bledsoe on July 15, 1871, who then willed the property to her daughter, Rockie Bledsoe by 1916. The family lived on the premises until August 1, 1922, when it was sold with 196.4 acres to Bledsoe's cousin, Calvin L. Hughes for $8000. Hughes then willed the property to his daughter, Virgia Lo Cage, where she lived until her death there sometime in the 1960s. == Architecture == Section drawing of the Sneed House The first floor of the Sneed House consisted of six rooms; front and rear halls, three parlors (south, west, east), and a kitchen. A stairwell led to the upper story from the rear hall. The second floor also had six rooms; front and rear halls, and four bedrooms with access to the attic via a stairwell in the southeast bedroom. The bedrooms, parlors, and kitchen each had fireplaces. Access to the exterior was through doors located at the front and rear halls of the first and second floor. Later photographs show doors at the upper floor, yet no access to a balcony. It can be assumed that there was once a balcony along both sides of the first and second floors (see McKinney Homestead). Each of the rooms of the homestead had two windows, while the first floor front doors had lights on either side and a transom window above. The attic had two windows at each end. Floors of each of the rooms were finished with wide pine planks. Each of the downstairs rooms had exposed ceilings, except for the kitchen which had a beaded ceiling and the south parlor which was plastered. Rooms along the north end and rear hall had unplastered limestone interior walls, while the kitchen and south parlor walls were plastered. The ceilings and walls of all of the upstairs rooms were plastered. Hearths were originally limestone. Those in the east parlors and kitchen were covered with concrete, while the original stone hearth in the west parlor was replaced with brick during renovations after 1900. Another exterior door was added to the east end of the house through the east parlor during this time. Four chimneys graced the exterior of the house. == Conservation status == Current condition of the homestead, June 2015 Efforts to document the site were taken in on November 27, 1936 when photographs were taken, and from August to September 1961 when architectural drawings were made of the homestead. The latter program was financed from the National Park Service's \\"Mission 66\\" Project funds. After the death of Virgia Lo Cage in the 1960s, the homestead fell into a state of disrepair. During the years following, the conditions of the home began to deteriorate. Windows were boarded up, pine millwork and other interior elements were stolen, and the white plaster walls and exterior walls were vandalized with graffiti. The Sneed House burned down in July 1989, and currently sits in ruin where only portions of the stone walls, such as the majority of the west and east exterior walls and sections of some of the interior walls remain standing. It has yet to be registered with the National Register of Historic Places. Local resident Bobby Cervantes has made efforts to save the site from being demolished and redeveloped into an apartment complex by its current owners, Indo Pak Investments LLC. Cervantes was successful in preserving the nearby Sneed family burial plot, known as the Sneed Family Cemetery, where the Judge and wife are resting, as well as Williamson Creek Cemetery where former slaves of the household were also known to have been buried.Michael Barnes, \\"Bobby Cervantes keeps eye on historic Sneed family plot and house\\" (November 17, 2013)..

They first signed to Damaged Goods (the label that released the Manic Street Preachers' first official single). Their debut single was \\"Hunter\\" released on 31 January 1994. Their second, \\"Baby Oil Applicator\\" created more of a buzz and Steve Lamacq made it his single of the week on Radio 1. They signed to Factory Too, the new label of Tony Wilson, after the demise of Factory Records. They recorded their debut album English and French (originally entitled Cause I Rock), produced by Bernard Butler after he left Suede. The record was engineered by Nigel Godrich after working on Radiohead's The Bends. The album was released during the peak of Britpop, which caused inevitable comparisons to other English female- fronted bands of the time such as Sleeper, who were frequently slated by music papers such as NME and Melody Maker. Singles released off the album included \\"Bad Kid\\" and \\"Wasted,\\" which were melodic pop punk anthems; they did well on the UK indie charts, but did not enjoy the mainstream success of other guitar bands of the time. Other singles were \\"Ridiculous Day\\" and \\"Oh my Heartless,\\" which were acoustic-driven and mellower. This was more typical of the album as a whole, though the songs would tend to build towards the end. Rachel Morris was frequently commended for her unconventional singing style. She would often emphasise different parts of lines when they are repeated in the songs. After touring and promoting the album and its singles for eighteen months, the band split in 1998. Rachel Ratajski (Morris) is still involved in music, working on a solo project under the name Rachel Kyriaki. ==Discography== * English and French (1996) ==References== Category:English indie rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 1992 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1998 Category:Musical quartets Category:Factory Records artists ","title":"Hopper (band)"},{"id":"46887789","text":"Croton aromaticus is a species of plant of the genus Croton and the family of Euphorbiaceae, native to in the Indian subcontinent.

She is best known for her work as editor on feature film projects such as Babe: Pig in the City (1998), Happy Feet (2006), and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing. Her body of film work extends across numerous genres, such as documentary features, live-action short films, animated comedies, and action epics. == Career == Margaret Sixel was born in South Africa, and studied film editing at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. In 1989, she earned a Specialist Extension Certificate in Film Editing. In 1984, Sixel began work as an assistant editor and dubber on the Australian television mini-series, The Last Bastion (1984), where she met one of the directors of the picture, and future collaborator, George Miller. In the following five years, Sixel worked as an assistant and assembly editor on various projects such as The Great Gold Swindle (1984), Emoh Ruo (1985), The Blue Lightning (1986), A Case of Honour (1989), and Romero (1989), as well as dialogue editor for John Duigan‚Äôs Flirting (1991). In 1994, Sixel was appointed film editor for Kay Pavlou‚Äôs dramatized Australian documentary, Mary (1994), about Australian saint Mary MacKillop. Three years later, Sixel edited the television documentary 40,000 Years of Dreaming (1997) for director George Miller. During the early 2000s, Sixel edited two short films under the direction of English-born Australian filmmaker Rachel Ward, The Blindman‚Äôs Bluff (2000) and The Big House (2001). Sixel‚Äôs remaining three feature film projects have since all been collaborations between herself and director George Miller, beginning in 1998 with Babe: Pig in the City (co-edited alongside Jay Friedkin), and followed by Happy Feet (co-edited alongside Christian Gazal) in 2006, and Mad Max: Fury Road in 2015. === Creative influence and process === Margaret Sixel has creatively contributed to the production of numerous projects throughout her career, including Babe (1995), in which George Miller credits her for turning the picture around by ‚Äúdeclaring an early cut [of the film] too episodic and lacking in narrative tension, and suggesting the linking devices of chapter headings and singing mice.‚Äù She received a ‚ÄúSpecial Thanks‚Äù credit for the film, as well as a ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù in the credits of Happy Feet Two for contributions to ‚Äúthe story structure.‚Äù In regard to their creative relationship, Sixel has remarked that both Miller and herself collaboratively make up a \\"complete person.\\" She has stated that being his spouse only helps in that they understand each other's sensibilities better, since \\"98 percent of the time [they] agree on [their] choices,\\" which is important, \\"because when you are not in sync, lots of people have opinions in the editing room and you can really go off in the wrong direction.\\"  Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)  In 2012, Sixel began editing Mad Max: Fury Road under the direction of George Miller. When asked why he chose his wife to edit his film, Miller observed that she had never cut an action movie before, and that if it were to be edited by \\"the usual kind of guys, it would look like every other action movie we see.\\" Because the majority of the film revolves around an intense road battle, featuring dozens of vehicular stunts and hundreds of individual extras, the location team would shoot with upwards of 20 cameras on any given set up. As a result, the editorial team on location processed between 10 and 20 hours of footage on a daily basis, which had to be flown back to Sydney, Australia, where Sixel and her editorial team would work on shaping the footage in conjunction with production. By the time principal photography had wrapped, Sixel was given over 470 hours of footage to edit, which took three months to merely view in its entirety. For two years, Sixel worked for roughly 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, for a total of over 6,000 collective hours of editing to create the film's eventual 120 minute running length. The final edit of the film consisted of over 2,700 individual cuts, over twice as many as Miller's previous Mad Max installment, The Road Warrior (1981), which featured only 1,200 cuts in its 90-minute running time. In 2016, Sixel won the Academy Award for Best Editing for her work on editing Mad Max.. By winning this award, she became the first South African born editor to win an Academy Award. She also won the Best Editing award at the 21st Critics' Choice Awards,. the 2016 ACE Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film ‚Äì Dramatic,. and the BAFTA Award for Best Editing..  Editorial team and role of gender  In regard to her role as a woman editor, Sixel has stated that she doesn't consider her gender to be relevant in the editing process. In an interview, she has stated that she works \\"with a lot of guys in the editing room. We don't think about it. I'm really into cutting film, and while George [Miller] likes to think it's a positive, I don't feel very female about it.\\" In regard to her editorial team, Sixel has noted that 25 percent of her staff are women. Additionally, throughout her entire career working with Miller, Jason Ballantine has been her first assistant and additional editor on every feature film since Babe: Pig in the City in 1998. == Personal life == In 1995, Margaret Sixel married director George Miller; they have two sons, and Sixel has a stepdaughter from Miller‚Äôs previous marriage. In 2011, as a response to the tenth anniversary of the Tampa affair in 2001, the Australian Centre for Policy Development published a statement urging Australia‚Äôs political leaders to break the stalemate on refugees and asylum seekers, which was ‚Äústill sadly characterised by human tragedy, political opportunism, policy failure and great cost.‚Äù Both Margaret Sixel and her husband, George Miller, supported and signed the public statement. == Filmography  Editor === {  - !

Duke Professor Emeritus of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at Duke University, from which he retired in 1993 after 25 years chairing the department. In 1981, he founded the American Society for Virology, the first scientific society specifically for virologists, and served a two-year term as its founding president. In the same year, he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. He has been described as \\"one of the earliest molecular virologists\\" and is best known for his research on poxviruses and reoviruses, and for work on interferon proteins. ==Early life and education== Joklik was born in 1926 in Austria, the son of Helene Louise Adele (Giessl) and Karl Friedrich Joklik.https://ethw.org/Oral- History:G._Frank_Joklikhttps://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QP9P-ZV7Y He moved with his family to Sydney, Australia at age 11. He attended the Cranbrook School in Sydney, where he and his brother would later endow a scholarship in honor of their mother. He received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. in biochemistry from Sydney University and received his Ph.D. in 1952 from the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at Oxford University, where he worked on bacteriophage T1 and T2 (viruses that infect E. coli bacteria) under the supervision of Sir Paul Fildes. He spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow in Copenhagen working with Herman Kalckar and Paul Berg. ==Career== Joklik joined the microbiology department headed by Frank Fenner at the then-new Australian National University in Canberra in 1953 and remained there for nine years, working primarily on poxviruses. In 1959-60 he spent a year on sabbatical at the National Institutes of Health working with Harry Eagle, who subsequently relocated to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City and recruited Joklik to join him there in 1962. Joklik's research group there continued to work on poxviruses as well as vaccinia viruses and reoviruses. In 1968 Joklik moved to Duke University to chair the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, which he played a major role in developing from a small faculty of six to a large and nationally ranked department as of his retirement in 1993. Following the announcement of a \\"war on cancer\\" by President Richard Nixon in 1971, Joklik co-founded the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center. Joklik was well known for significant service to the scientific community during his career. In 1981 he was the primary organizer of a movement among American virologists to found a new scientific society, motivated by dissatisfaction with the community's representation in existing societies for general microbiology; he was a co-founder and the founding president of the American Society for Virology, which was organized in 1981 and held its first official meeting in 1982. Joklik served as Editor-in-Chief of Zinsser Microbiology, a standard text in medicine and immunology originated by Hans Zinsser. Joklik was also Editor-in-Chief of the scientific journal Virology for 24 years and of Microbiological Reviews for five years. ===Smallpox eradication=== Joklik's research on vaccinia viruses led to his selection as one of two United States representatives to the World Health Organization's Smallpox Eradication Committee in the 1970s, whose efforts came to a close in 1980 when natural smallpox infections were declared to be eradicated and research stocks retained only by the United States Centers for Disease Control and the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in the then-Soviet Union. Joklik was a highly vocal opponent of efforts in the 1990s to destroy the remaining stocks, delivering talks and writing several papers on the topic. ==Legacy== Joklik received the William G. Anlyan Lifetime Achievement Award from the Duke Medical Alumni Association in 2013. The Duke Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology (a successor to the department Joklik chaired) hosts an annual lectureship in his honor, the Joklik Distinguished Lectureship; the inaugural lecture was delivered in 2010 by fellow poxvirus specialist Bernard Moss. The annual meeting of the American Society for Virology features a Bill Joklik Lecture, among other named lectureships celebrating pioneers in the field. Joklik trained over 100 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows; among his notable trainees are Bernard N. Fields and John Skehel. In retirement, Joklik continued to publish histories and retrospectives describing the history of the mid-20th-century emergence of molecular biology and the development of the modern field of virology. He died on July 7, 2019. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2019 deaths Category:American virologists Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Duke University faculty Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Australian virologists Category:American people of Austrian descent Category:Australian people of Austrian descent ","title":"Wolfgang Joklik"},{"id":"46887929","text":"Misa Urqu (Quechua misa table, urqu mountain, Yachakuqkunapa Simi Qullqa - Qusqu Qullaw.

He was a long-serving mayor and member of the French senate for the Rh√¥ne department. He was married first to C√©cile Pasquier (died ), then to Paule Sassard. == Biography == S√©rusclat was born in Sarras, Ard√®che, where his father had settled to become a teacher, after World War I. His first and middle names are those of his uncles who were killed in the war. His secondary education was at the , whence he went to the Faculty of Pharmacy at Lyon, where he started a deep friendship with Andr√© Boucherle. He was awarded his diploma on 27 March 1947. He worked as a monitor in the Department of Toxicology, and wrote his thesis under the direction of Marc Chambon. He became an assistant in the Lyon police's forensic lab, which had been set up in 1910 by Edmond Locard. He worked there over thirty years, becoming assistant director, and then director. At the end of December 1949. he opened a pharmacy (dispensing chemist) at Saint-Fons, where he trained many other pharmacists. He was an active participant in the central F√©d√©ration des Syndicats Pharmaceutiques de France (FSPF), and in the local Rh√¥ne chapter. He became actively involved in politics. In 1955, he created with Andr√© Boucherle the (\\"Lyon movement for a United States of Europe\\"). He organized meetings and exchanges with other European pharmacists' organizations. Always rather provocative, he took a position for the legalization of cannabis, at a time when its use was negligible compared to that of alcohol or tobacco. However, the toxicity of cannabis, and its causation of accidents, had perhaps been underestimated. S√©rusclat always had a great interest in education and public information. Convinced of the use of information technology in schools, in 2000 he published . He wanted every student to have a computer. usage He was a member of the Soci√©t√© de Pharmacie de Lyon for over fifty years. == Political career == S√©rusclat was a member of the French Parti socialiste, which had a manifesto for pacifism and a pan-European state. He campaigned on many causes throughout his long career, but his main drive was in public health and bioethics. To this end, he was the joint proposer, in the French senate, of the . He also argued for better regulation of sea fishing, for the sustainability of fish stocks. With an innovative spirit, if somewhat lacking in humour, he contributed to the 1981 Pharmacy Green Paper under Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy for the creation of mobile pharmacies to supply rural villages, as some grocers still did at the time. This caused something of a sensation in the pharmacist world. In the same paper, he also proposed to pay pharmacists a consultation fee or prescription charge, as was done in other parts of the health profession. With Claude Huriet seconding, he passed the (\\"Law relating to the protection of those involved in biomedical research\\") on 20 December 1988, which established the French legal framework for clinical trials. == Offices == * Mayor of Saint-Fons, 1967-1995 * Member of the French Senate for Rh√¥ne department - .

The current party Leader has been Goh Meng Seng since its formation in July 2015.Opposition veteran Goh Meng Seng applies to set up political party (19 May 2016) ==History and political development== The party was first formed by veteran politician Goh Meng Seng, on 16 July 2015, just a few months prior to the election held that year. Goh had previously served as a member of the incumbent opposition Workers' Party of Singapore and National Solidarity Party, in the 2006 and 2011, respectively. In the aftermath of the 2011 election, Goh resigned from his Secretary General post as well as his party membership following the party's defeat. The party was perceived as lightweight and opposed to major opposition parties were believed to be reasons for its speedy registration approval being given in two instead of the typical three months set by the Election Department. The party only contested in the Chua Chu Kang Group Representation Constituency, a four- member GRC, which the team consist of Goh, and candidates Lee Tze Shih, Low Wai Choo and former NSP member Syafarin Sarif, faced against the ruling People's Action Party team led by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, Parliamentary Secretary and Mayor Low Yen Ling, Zaqy Mohamad and newcomer Yee Chia Hsing. The PAP team defeated the party with a vote share of 76.83%-23.11%, which was 84,731 and 25,460 votes, respectively. Low was notable for being convicted for public nuisance for her role in a Hong Lim Park protest rally in 2014, while Lee Tze Shih joined Progress Singapore Party in 2019. Goh, despite being a veteran politician who was surprised of the number of voters that voted for them, as he claimed that his party lacked media coverage, he and his team's defeat was one of the worst performing candidates in this election. Goh shortly returned to Hong Kong to reside with his family after the election. In 2018, the party was along with the six other opposition parties (Democratic Progressive Party, National Solidarity Party, Reform Party, Singapore Democratic Party, Singaporeans First and Singapore's Voice Party, a party formed by NSP chief Lim Tean) led by former People's Action Party member and presidential candidate Tan Cheng Bock, on the possibility of forming a coalition for the next election.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/seven- opposition-parties-discuss-forming-a-new-coalition-invite-former-pap-mp-tan- cheng The party participated in the 2020 election, but Goh was the only candidate fielded this election, this time contesting in the MacPherson SMC. On 27 June, Goh confirmed that this was his final election, reiterating his belief that he could contribute more to Parliament as an opposition member if elected, while praising the incumbent Tin Pei Ling for her involvement. Despite the efforts, it was all for naught, as Goh was defeated to Tin by a 71.74%-28.26% vote share. ==Objectives and policies== PPP advocates the Separation of Five Powers (including Social, Culture, Politics, Economics) and a more balanced development of Singapore.PPP's official Facebook site - 18 August 2015 The PPP has adopted and adapted with the Three Principles of the People and its system of having five branches of government espoused by Dr Sun Yat-Sen, founding father of the Republic of China (now administrating Taiwan and surrounding Island) It has modified the concepts of the Five Powers to stay relevant to modern contemporary political and social structures. The emphasis is on the separation of the Five Powers which means the separation of certain institutions from Executive branch's control. The Power of Impeachment (originally under Control Yuan) has been expanded to include various contemporary functional government institutions. Examples: Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, advocacy of Ombudsman Commission, Equal Opportunity Commission, Free Press and Freedom of Expression. The Power of Examination has been adapted and modified to modern concept of Selection for both political leaders as well as civil servants. This involves institutions like Elections Department and Public Service Commission. PPP advocates that the institutions that fall under these two powers, namely Power of Impeachment and Power of Selection, be placed under the supervision of Singapore's Elected President, a separate branch of government. PPP has also called for the introduction of a minimum wage in Singapore.PPP's official Facebook site - 11 August 2015 ==Leadership== PPP's leader is its Secretary-General, Goh Meng Seng.

It was written by series creator Dan Harmon and Chris McKenna, and directed by Rob Schrab. It is the 110th episode overall and was initially released on Yahoo! Screen in the United States on June 2, 2015. In the episode, the group imagines how their next year at Greendale might look. As he hears about his friends' plans, Jeff grows concerned over what will happen to him as everyone else moves away. The episode includes many self-referential pitches for what a \\"season seven\\" of the show would look like. The episode received critical acclaim, with many calling it a sincere and satisfying end to the show's run, and praising the emotional weight along with the conclusion of the story. It has also been ranked among the best episodes of the entire series. ==Plot== As another school year ends, Frankie (Paget Brewster) disbands the \\"Save Greendale Committee\\" for the summer. Elroy (Keith David) abruptly reveals that he was hired by LinkedIn and bids the group farewell. The other group members head to a bar. Britta (Gillian Jacobs) asks Abed (Danny Pudi) what he thinks will happen next year in \\"season seven\\". Abed, Dean Pelton (Jim Rash), and Chang (Ken Jeong) present their season seven \\"pitches\\". During the conversation, Annie (Alison Brie) arrives. She reveals she will be moving to Washington, D.C. for a summer internship with the FBI. This causes Jeff (Joel McHale), who had resisted joining the conversation, to imagine a nightmarish future where he is the only group member left at Greendale, surrounded by other students who will also eventually leave. Jeff, now participating, presents a pitch where Annie returns as an FBI agent. Britta and Frankie also present pitches, which are poorly received, and Abed notes that television must be \\"joyful, effortless, [and] fun.\\" Jeff then presents another pitch where the group members stay at Greendale as faculty. The idea is well- received until Abed reveals that he is leaving to become a production assistant in California. In response, Jeff imagines himself strangling a series of Abed clones. Jeff abruptly leaves and returns to the study room. He imagines a happy married life with Annie only to realize he doesn't know what Annie wants. Annie enters; Jeff confesses he wants to be young again, and Annie urges him to accept that he's older now. He admits that he loves her but acknowledges that he let her go. Annie asks him to kiss her goodbye before she potentially leaves forever. They kiss. The other group members arrive, and everyone silently imagines their own versions of \\"season seven\\". Jeff pictures himself accepting that his friends will eventually leave. He thanks the group for changing his life. Later, Jeff drops Annie and Abed off at the airport, hugging and kissing Annie goodbye and giving Abed two long hugs. Jeff rejoins the others at the bar as the screen fades to black and \\"#andamovie\\" appears on screen. The end tag features a commercial for a fictional Community board game narrated by Dan Harmon. As a family plays the game, the son (Connor Rosen) reveals a script for the commercial itself. The dad (Wayne Federman) explains that this means they will never truly live. The family sits in shocked silence while Harmon delivers a fourth wall-breaking monologue about Community. ==Cultural references== Chang uses Friends, The Simpsons, Seinfeld, and South Park as examples of TV shows that peaked after their sixth season. Jeff and Annie describe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (several movies of which have been directed by Community alumni Anthony and Joe Russo) as \\"boring\\" and \\"flavorless\\". The episode's end-tag references St. Elsewhere's series finale and Chuck Lorre's vanity cards. The song \\"Ends of the Earth\\" by Lord Huron plays during the final moments of the episode as Jeff drops Abed and Annie off at the airport. ==Production== This episode features the first and only use of explicit language on the series, spoken twice by both Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) and Britta Perry (Gillian Jacobs), in reference to the series move to Yahoo! Screen. In an interview with TV Insider, creator Dan Harmon explained how it happened: ==Critical reception== The episode received critical acclaim. Joshua Alston of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A\\" rating, praising that it \\"works so well as a series finale, and makes such a strong case for moving forward with the 'and a movie' portion of Community‚Äôs hashtagged endgame\\". He noted that the pitches worked well at showing off the characters' differences: \\"With each new version, we‚Äôre reminded of how these characters are different, what perspective they bring to the Save Greendale Committee, as well as how they see the group and what they get out of belonging to it.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode a 9 out of 10, praising its character development and likening it to another well-received episode, season 3's \\"Remedial Chaos Theory\\". He noted that despite the closing hashtag, \\"it doesn‚Äôt seem Harmon and McKenna feel Season 7 is in the cards and even the movie could be doubtful\\" but added that \\"if this ends up being the final time we see these characters, it was a really well done farewell, acknowledging the important time they've spent together\\". In TV.com's ranking of every episode of the series, they placed the episode fifth overall, and wrote \\"the Season 6 finale was one of the show's best offerings, and frankly, the only season finale that felt like an appropriate send-off for the characters.\\" A different ranking by Entertainment Weekly of the show's top episodes placed the episode seventh, noting the \\"raw confessional quality\\" of the episode and calling it \\"one of the greatest series finales ever.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * \\"Emotional Consequences of Broadcast Television\\" at Yahoo!

Knight Professor of Law and author, best known for her writings advocating for the use of the Public trust doctrine to compel government action on climate change. Wood originated the approach, called atmospheric trust litigation, \\"to hold governments worldwide accountable for reducing carbon pollution within their jurisdictions, and her research is being used in cases and petitions brought on behalf of children and youth throughout the United States and in other countries.\\" In 2014, after a number of atmospheric trust litigation and petitions were brought by young people worldwide, Forbes contributor James Conca wrote, \\"(i)f the Supreme Court holds the government responsible for at least trying to protect our atmosphere, things could certainly change here in America.\\" == Early life == Wood grew up \\"watching salmon at a place called Wood's Landing, located on the Columbia River in the State of Washington.\\" == Education == Wood graduated from Stanford Law School in 1987. == Career == After graduating from Stanford Law School in 1987, Wood served as a judicial clerk on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. She then practiced in the environmental/natural resources department of Perkins Coie, a Pacific Northwest law firm. === Law professor === Wood is the Philip H. Knight Professor of Law and Faculty Director of the University of Oregon School of Law's Environmental and Natural Resources Law Program. She teaches property law, natural resources law, public trust law, and federal Indian law, and has also taught public lands law, wildlife law, and hazardous waste law. She is the Founding Director of the school's nationally acclaimed Environmental and Natural Resources Law Program and is Faculty Leader of the Program's Conservation Trust Project, Sustainable Land Use Project, Native Environmental Sovereignty Project, and Food Resilience Project. === Author === Wood's book, Nature's Trust: Environmental Law for a New Ecological Age, was published by Cambridge University Press in 2014. An excerpt of the book was spotlighted by Moyers & Company in September 2014. Prior to Nature's Trust, Wood had co- authored a leading textbook on natural resources law (West, 2006), and a textbook on public trust law (Carolina Press, 2013). Wood's work asserting the public trust doctrine's application to the atmosphere has inspired what has been coined atmospheric trust litigation. One non-profit organizing such litigation, Our Children's Trust, has brought a suit on behalf of 21 youth plaintiffs against the US government for its actions contributing to climate change. When the federal judge in that case denied both the federal government and the American Petroleum Institute's motion to dismiss on April 8, 2016, Wood told NPR station KLCC this: \\"Basically, what the court is saying is that the government must come into court and defend against these allegations that the government has taken action to put the youth in extreme danger including actions that literally impair their potential survival.\\" === Lecturer, speaker=== On January 1, 2015, Bill Moyers hosted Wood as his last guest on the last episode of Moyers & Company. === Awards=== In 1994, Wood received the University's Ersted Award for Distinguished Teaching, and in 2002 she received the Orlando Hollis Faculty Teaching Award. On March 7, 2015, Wood was awarded the 2015 David Brower Lifetime Achievement Award. == References External links== Category:Environmental lawyers Category:Living people Category:Stanford Law School alumni Category:University of Oregon School of Law faculty Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:1962 births ","title":"Mary Christina Wood"},{"id":"46888510","text":"Avigail Alfatov (; born 28 February 1996) is an Israeli national fencing champion, soldier, model and beauty pageant titleholder.

The source of the explosion is unknown though believed to have occurred in the station's fuel tanks. One survivor stated that the power had gone out before the explosion, but after the power was restored, they heard a \\"pop\\" and then the fire erupted. About 96 people taking shelter at the station were killed by the fire. Due to the flooding, water had mixed in with the fuel, and when the tanks exploded, the water exacerbated the spread of the fire to nearby buildings, killing additional citizens. The ongoing rainfall and flooding made rescue efforts difficult. So many bodies were taken to the 37 Military Hospital, the largest specialist hospital in Ghana, that the morgue was overwhelmed. ==Reactions== * Ghana's president John Dramani Mahama visited the site, and called for three days of mourning over the losses starting on 8 June 2015. He also authorized a GH‚Çµ 60 million ($14.5 million) recovery fund. President Mahama stated that he would start to push for legislation to prevent building on waterways in order to prevent such accidents from happening again. The incident was a worse disaster for the country than the 2001 Accra Sports Stadium disaster where 127 people were crushed in a stampede during a football match at Accra Sports Stadium. * The Cardinal Secretary of State, Pietro Cardinal Parolin, in the name of Pope Francis, sent a telegram of condolence for the victims of the explosion to the Right Reverend Joseph Osei-Bonsu, President of the Ghana Bishops' Conference: > Deeply saddened to learn of the tragic incident at a petrol station in Accra > in which so many people died or were seriously injured, the Holy Father > sends heartfelt condolences to the relatives of the deceased and injured, to > the authorities and to the entire Nation.

Takatora‚Äôs resolve in seeing this through is put in question after a conversation with Kouta Kazuraba. Meanwhile, Yggdrasill‚Äôs Kurokage Troopers are being assailed by an unknown Armored Rider. The caretaker formerly employed by the Kureshima family, T≈çka Akatsuki, makes an appearance. Being raised by a strict father, Takatora‚Äôs only support during his childhood years was T≈çka. Both are very happy to meet again, but on a depressing note as the Kureshima brothers learn that their father had died. However, the mysterious attacker, using the Ringo Lockseed, leaves Sid injured and Yoko to be on the defensive. The mysterious Rider sets their sights on Mitsuzane Kureshima and Takatora loses his Melon Energy Lockseed as a result. While searching for clues, he uncovers the truth of his father's past and learns that the people at Zawame Child Care Facility were subjugated to lethal experiments to allow passage into Helheim. Among the list of people in the orphanage is T≈çka and Takatora puts one and one together. Confronting T≈çka while using the Watermelon Lockseed given by Ryoma Sengoku, he tells T≈çka that he will continue to do what he believes in, even if he lays down his life for it. He defeats T≈çka after he regains the Melon Energy Lockseed. However, he is unable to kill T≈çka due to their past. T≈çka retreats back to the abandoned orphanage, after being spared by Takatora and don't understand that why a good man like Takatora carries a name of Kureshima. Shortly, T≈çka experiences the side effects of the Ringo Lockseed and learns that Ryoma Sengoku was also raised at the orphanage before being killed by Ryoma, who promptly retakes the Ringo Lockseed. After cleaning the Kureshima residents with Mitsuzane, Takatora start to think about Kouta's word about saving humanity without sacrifices, and perhaps he may use one of Kouta's heroic influence a bit. ===Kamen Rider Baron=== While Kaito Kumon hunted for the Over Lords during his alliance with Ryoma Sengoku, a foreign prince named Shapool visits Zawame as part of an inspection. Shapool finds Kaito to be identical him, having the latter sedated so he can switch places with him. While Kouta and the Beat Riders were flabbergasted in \\"Kaito\\" actually smiling before he takes Mai to Charmant, the real Kaito finds himself taken by a group led by Shapool‚Äôs butler Alfred. Alfred then deduces Kaito's identity, contacting to Oren to take care of him. By the time Kaito finds Shapool, the two are attacked by Alfred who threatens to kill Shapool while transforming into Kamen Rider Tyrant. Kaito protects Shapool and learns of his story, as well as sharing his own story with the prince. After finding out that Alfred has taken Zack, Kaito goes after Alfred. As both were transformed and battled each other as Baron and Tyrant respectively, Tyrant unexpectedly corrupted by the Energy Lockseed possessing Helheim's manipulation and became an Over Lord Inves. Yoko later came in and gives Kaito the Ringo Lockseed she took from Ryoma. Though warned that it could turn him into an Over Lord, Kaito uses the Lockseed to fight back as Baron Ringo Arms and defeats Tyrant with the Cavaliend Rider Kick before destroying the Ringo Lockseed. In the end, Shapool writes a letter to thank Kaito for saving him from Alfred's threats and taking what Kaito has taught him, to believe in friends and to fight for what is right, before he leaves Zawame City for reuniting with his father. Kaito went to his parents' tomb at a cemetery, and later walks out as the flowers were left onto his parents' tomb. However, though he did not become an Overlord at that time, the event is still within Kaito's future. ===Cast=== ;Kamen Rider Zangetsu *: *: *: *Takatora Kureshima (teen): *Mitsuzane Kureshima (child): *T≈çka Akatsuki (teen): *: *: ;Kamen Rider Baron *, : *: *: *: *: *: *: *Kaito's father: *Kaito's mother: *Kaito Kumon (child): ;Both Kamen Rider Zangetsu and Kamen Rider Baron *: *: *: *: *: ===Theme songs=== ;Kamen Rider Zangetsu insert theme *\\"Lights of my wish\\" **Lyrics: Shoko Fujibayashi **Composition: Ryo (of defspiral) **Arrangement: Ryo (of defspiral), Junichi \\"IGAO\\" Igarashi **Artist: Mai Takatsukasa (Yuumi Shida) ;Kamen Rider Baron ending theme *\\"Unperfected world\\" **Lyrics: Shoko Fujibayashi **Composition & Arrangement: Ryo (of defspiral) **Artist: Kaito Kumon (Yutaka Kobayashi) ==Gaim Gaiden: Kamen Rider Duke/Kamen Rider KnuckleKamen Rider Duke=== Set before the events of Kamen Rider √ó Kamen Rider Gaim & Wizard: The Fateful Sengoku Movie Battle, Ryoma Sengoku continues his research of the Sengoku Drivers along with Takatora Kureshima. Takatora thinks that the lives of humanity is their main priority, but Ryoma dislikes his way of thinking of increasing the production of Sengoku Drivers, with cost as the main priority than efficiency. Meanwhile, Sid and Yoko investigate suicide attacks that have been taking place on Yggdrasill Corporation employees. The mastermind of these incidents is the Black Linden cult, led by Ryoma's former colleague Kugai Kudo who was thought to have died in a Sengoku Driver testing accident. Ryoma must figure out a way to stop Kudo once and for all, while still trying to perfect the next generation version of the Sengoku Drivers. He and Takatora battle Kudo as Kamen Rider Duke and Kamen Rider Zangetsu, respectively, who fights them as the evil Kamen Rider Saver, and after beating him, Ryoma later uses his technology to perfect the Genesis Driver and its Sonic Arrow weaponry, which he uses against Kudo's ghost to send him off once and for all. ===Kamen Rider Knuckle=== Set after the events of Kamen Rider √ó Kamen Rider Drive & Gaim: Movie War Full Throttle, it has been one year since Kouta and Mai left the Earth and Kaito died, and peace has returned to Zawame City once more. Zack departs for New York to participate in a dance competition, leaving Peko in charge of Team Baron. However, upon arriving in New York, Peko's sister calls Zack to tell him Peko has been kidnapped by Shura, a member of Team Baron who Kaito kicked out for not following the team's ideals. Zack returns to Zawame to fight Shura, who can transform into Kamen Rider Black Baron, but Zack is given a new Sengoku Driver and set of Lockseeds from Mitsuzane to fight once more as Kamen Rider Knuckle, but this time as the more powerful Jimber Marron Arms. ===Cast=== ;Kamen Rider Duke *Ryoma Sengoku: Tsunenori Aoki *Takatora Kureshima: Yuki Kubota *Yoko Minato: Minami Tsukui *Sid: Kazuki Namioka *: ;Kamen Rider Knuckle *Zack: Gaku Matsuda *Peko: Saku Momose *: *Mitsuzane Kureshima: Mahiro Takasugi *Mai Takatsukasa: Yuumi Shida *Hideyasu Jonouchi: Ryo Matsuda *: *: *: *: *Oren Pierre Alfonzo: Metal Yoshida *Kaito Kumon: Yutaka Kobayashi ;Both Kamen Rider Duke and Kamen Rider Knuckle *: *Sengoku Driver Equipment Voice: Seiji Hiratoko *Genesis Driver Equipment Voice: Shin- ichiro Miki ===Theme song=== ;Kamen Rider Knuckle ending theme *\\"Dance With Me\\" **Lyrics: Shoko Fujibayashi **Composition: Chikara Gonohe **Arrangement: ats- **Artist: Team Baron (Zack, Peco, & Kaito Kumon) (Gaku Matsuda, Saku Momose, & Yutaka Kobayashi) ==ReferencesKamen Rider Gaim Gaiden official Twitter profile Gaim Gaiden Category:Television spin-offs ","title":"Gaim Gaiden"},{"id":"46888694","text":"Albert II (; died about 1125) was a progenitor of the Albertine House of Tyrol.

This event is been celebrated by Sonowal Kacharis every two year in Dibrugarh, Assam. ==Origination== The origination of the Bohua dance is very old. It is known that Lord Shiva or Khring Raja Baithow is the main God of the Sonowal Kacharis. It is mentioned in the Bhagavad and other Puranic texts that Dakshya, the son of Lord Brahma was the king of Tribhuvan. It so happened that his youngest daughter Sati, whom he most dearly lovedfell in love with Lord Shiva when she was a teenager. But King Dakshya didn't want to give his dear daughter's hand to Lord Shiva, who was always nude, had no wealth and whose companions were ghosts and demons. But Lord Brahma ordered Dakshya to marry of his daughter to him and so he obeyed. One day Shiva went to visit Dakshya along with other guests. When Dakshya came to see them everyone except shiva greeted him! Angered by his dishonour, Dakshya promised himself to take revenge upon him. One day Dakshya decided to organise a Mahayajna only to take revenge upon Shiva. He invited Yamraj, all the demi gods and even the kings and queens. Everyone except lord Shiva was invited. When Shiva and Sati came to know about this, she immensely desired to visit her father's Mahayajna. after much reluctance shiva let her go. But when she reached her father's house, Dakshya ridiculed her in front of everyone. Unable to bear this ridicule from her father, Sati left her body on the Mahajagya. When this news reached Kailash, ghosts and demons appeared on the yajna to vandalized it. When lord Shiva arrived, a drop of sweat from his forehead fell on the ground and a warrior named Birbharda was created. This fearless warrior with the order of Shiva beheaded Dakshya! After this incident the wife of king Dakshya came crying to Shiva and begged him to restore her husband's life. The powerful Lord Shiva then put the head of a sacrificed goat in Dakshya's body and lo!. he was alive again! After his resurrection, the king and his queen danced in joy. Everyone praised the mighty Lord Shiva for his divine powers. The Sonowal Kacharis therefore performs the Bohua dance in praise of Lord Shiva. This dance signifies the beginning of a new life, a clean society and the riddance of bad omen. In this way Bohua danced has been performed for many generations.:as:‡¶¨‡¶π‡ßÅ‡ß±‡¶æ ‡¶®‡ßÉ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø ==ReferencesExternal links== * https://www.facebook.com/sonowalkachari009?fref=ts facebook page * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppCazW84S8k youtube * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtV5cre2xBg Category:Dances of Assam Category:Festivals in Assam ","title":"Bohuwa dance"},{"id":"46888752","text":"Inka Wasi (Quechua inka Inca, wasi house, \\"Inca house\\", hispanicized spelling Incahuasi) is a mountain in the Andes of Peru, about high.

He also fought for the Cuban national Lightweight title, but lost. Robinson Garcia was known for his large number of professional fights-he fought 237 times-the quality of opponents he faced and number of countries he visited. Robinson Garcia competed against 42 boxers who were world ranked, 16 world champions, 6 International Boxing Hall of Fame members, in 19 countries and 4 continents. Many of the places he fought at, like France, the United States and Italy, were visited very often by Robinson Garcia. ==Notable professional fights== Angel Robinson Garcia started his professional boxing career on July 23, 1955, beating Roberto Garcia by first-round knockout at Havana. He was undefeated for his first four fights, all wins by knockout. On October 28 of 1955, he faced Reinaldo Marquez at Santa Clara, losing for the first time, on a four- round decision. He avenged that loss with a six-round decision win over Marquez on April 5, 1956, also at Santa Clara. Having amassed a record of 28‚Äì2 with 10 knockouts, Robinson Garcia challenged Isidro Martinez, 19-4-1, for the Latin American Super-Featherweight (Junior-Lightweight) title. Robinson Garcia defeated Martinez after dropping him in round eight, with a ninth-round technical knockout, on February 26, 1958, at Havana. Two weeks after, Robinson Garcia held his first fight abroad, and first in the United States, when he faced Bobby Rogers on March 11 at the Auditorium, Miami Beach, losing that encounter by a ten-round decision. On June 28, 1958, he faced fellow Cuban, world-ranked \\"Puppy\\" Garcia, who was 33-8-4 before their fight, at Havana, losing a 10-round unanimous decision. On January 20, 1959, Robinson Garcia fought Frankie Ryff, again losing by unanimous decision in 10 rounds. On March 14 of that year, he met Doug Vaillant in Havana, losing a ten-round unanimous decision before then taking on Mexico's Alfredo Urbina on May 16, beating the Mexican by a ten-round unanimous decision. He then met Carlos Hernandez, the future Venezuela's first world champion boxer in history, and fought Hernandez to a ten-round draw (tie) August 15, 1959. Robinson Garcia faced Vicente Rivas and Jiro Sawada before 1959 ended, losing to Rivas but beating Sawada, both by ten-round decisions in Venezuela. During 1960, Robinson Garcia squared off with Jose Stable twice, Mantequilla Napoles, Hernandez and Vaillant in rematches. He split his two bouts with Stable, winning a split decision and then losing a unanimous one, lost a ten-round decision to Napoles, drew with Vaillant and lost twice to Hernandez. He also fought six other fights against lesser-known rivals, going 5‚Äì1 with 3 knockout wins on those. Robinson Garcia had a third meeting with Doug Vaillant, this time with the Cuban national title on the line. On February 1, at Havana, they had a close 12 round bout, Vaillant prevailing by a split decision. On March, Robinson Garcia made his first trip as a professional boxer to Mexico, being defeated there on March 25 by Urbina on a rematch by ninth-round technical knockout and then on April 22 by Kid Anahuac by third round disqualification. Robinson Garcia lived in Mexico for one month, before returning to Cuba to face Jose Napoles a second time: on June 3, 1961, he again went ten rounds with the future world Welterweight champion and International Boxing Hall of Fame member, but once again dropped a points decision. One month later, on July 7, Robinson Garcia boxed 16-1-2 Pastor Marrero at Havana and won by decision in ten rounds. Fidel Castro soon abolished professional boxing in Cuba, however, and this would be Robinson Garcia's last presentation as a boxer in his home country. Robinson Garcia flew to Jamaica to fight Bunny Grant at the National Stadium in Kingston, on August 30, losing that fight by a close but unanimous ten-round decision, judges Tony Bridge scoring against him 99‚Äì96, Gilbert Aarons also against him 97-96 and Seaside Johnson deeming him loser by a wider score of 99‚Äì93. Robinson Garcia returned to the winning column six weeks later, defeating Hilton Smith by a 10-round unanimous decision at Miami. He temporarily moved to Miami, being trained by Angelo Dundee at the 5th Street Gym there. He then settled in France, fighting his next seven bouts there, going undefeated during that period, with four knockout wins. On September 11, 1962, Robinson Garcia faced world ranked Valerio Nunez, 36-1 before their bout, at Palazzetto dello Sport, Rome, Italy, and upset Nunez by pulling a seventh-round disqualification win. After 2 more victories and 1 draw, Robinson Garcia faced the well-known French fighter, Jean Josselin, until then undefeated in 17 outings, on December 3, at the Palais des Sports, Paris, France, losing to Josselin by a ten rounds unanimous decision. Robinson Garcia began 1963 by fighting against another world champion and future International Boxing Hall of Fame member, Eddie Perkins, at the Palais de Sports, losing a ten-round unanimous decision. He slowed his schedule somewhat during this year, fighting only 4 more times, during which he went undefeated with 2 wins and two draws, one win by knockout. 1964 was another typical career year for Robinson Garcia, as he fought eight times, including: a fight on March 9 against another world champion and future International Boxing Hall of Famer, Ismael Laguna, where he actually dropped Laguna in the first round before losing on points in ten rounds at Paris; an April 13 upset of 16-1 Rey Adigun, beaten by a fifth-round technical knockout; and a June 5 upset of Rafiu King, who was beaten by ten rounds decision at the Ivory Coast. In 1965, Robinson Garcia returned to the ring 13 times, going 9‚Äì4 with 2 knockouts against the likes of Joe Tetteh, beaten by a ten-round decision at Tunis, Tunisia January 30, and Olli Maki, against whom he lost by ten-round decision in Tampere, Finland, on February 21. 1965 also saw Robinson Garcia re-settle, moving to Spain, where he held his next 11 bouts after the Maki fight. Robinson Garcia had an active 1966, with 20 fights that year, winning 12, losing 3 and drawing 5, with 6 knockouts. On February 22, he met Maurice Cullen at the Royal Albert Hall, London, England, losing by ten-round decision. On April 10, he knocked out Kid Tano, 45-5-6, in six rounds at the Canary Islands and then, only 11 days later, he held Italy's Carmelo Bossi, a future world champion, to a ten- round draw at Barcelona. 1967 saw an April 28 fight against Bruno Arcari at Genoa, Italy, which Robinson Garcia lost by ten-round decision; a rematch with Bossi on July 14 in Rome that resulted in Bossi defeating Robinson Garcia by fifth-round knockout; a rematch with Eddie Perkins in Milan on December 5 that was won by Perkins by ten-round decision; and seven more bouts in which Robinson Garcia won 5, lost 2 and scored 4 knockout wins. In 1968, Robinson Garcia fought 9 times, going 5-2-2 during the year with 3 knockouts. Among those he met on the ring that year were LC Morgan twice (March 22, ten-round draw in Rome; April 19, ninth-round knockout win in Rome), Paul Armstead three times (May 10, ten-round decision loss at Toscana; June 21, ten-round decision win at Milan; July 28, ten-round draw at San Remo) and International Boxing Hall of Fame member, future undisputed world Lightweight Champion Ken Buchanan, who beat Robinson Garcia by a ten-round decision on October 23 at London. Robinson Garcia had a layoff of eight months between the Buchanan contest and his next one, on June 1969. The second half of that year, however, saw him fight 12 times, including a September 10 loss by ten-round decision to future WBC world Lightweight-and Spain's second-Champion Pedro Carrasco at the Basque Country and a December 30 defeat at the hands of 19-2-4 Chris Fernandez by ten-round decision also. Robinson Garcia contested 17 bouts in 1970. These included an August 21 match with Jos√© Dur√°n, won by Dur√°n by ten rounds decision at Madrid and a November 20 bout with French Roger Menetrey which Menetrey won by ten-round decision at Geneva. Apart from those two fights, Robinson Garcia won 10 and lost 5 in 1970, with 1 knockout win. Between November and December 1970 alone, Robinson Garcia had 6 bouts. Robinson Garcia went 5-6-4 in 15 bouts during 1971, with 2 knockout wins. The fights he held in 1971 included rematch wins over Joe Tetteh (by ten-round decision, February 11) and Bunny Grant (ten-round decision on April 5). Also in 1971 was a May 21 ten-round draw against former Spain and European Boxing Union Lightweight and future WBC world Junior Welterweight Champion Miguel Velazquez, who was 46-1-2 before this bout; a rematch loss to Chris Fernandez on July 2, by ten-round decision; and an October 1 loss to Robert Gallois, 45-5-1, by ten-round decision at Marseilles. Perhaps the most notable of Robinson Garcia's fights was on January 15, 1972, when he faced a then 26‚Äì0, future four division world champion and International Boxing Hall of Fame member Roberto Dur√°n at the Gimnasio Nuevo Panama-now Gimnasio Roberto Dur√°n-at Panama City. Robinson Garcia gave Dur√°n a relatively close fight but still lost by unanimous ten- round decision with scores of 99‚Äì93, 98-94 and 98‚Äì96, all in favor of the Panamanian. Robinson Garcia went 1-4 the rest of that year, facing, among others, Esteban De Jesus in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to whom he dropped a ten- round decision on July 8. He split eight bouts in 1973, going 4-4 during that span, with 2 knockouts. On March 29, he boxed the future ranked challenger, Puerto Rican Sandy Torres at Tampa, Florida, and lost a ten-round decision. On July 17, he boxed future WBC world Junior Welterweight Champion Saoul Mamby at the Miami Beach auditorium and lost a ten-round decision as well. During the first half of 1974, Robinson Garcia contested in ten fights, going 6‚Äì4 with 3 knockout wins during this span. He faced, among others, Mexican Marcos Geraldo (who'd later last ten rounds against Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvelous Marvin Hagler) on January 23 at the Silver Slipper Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, upsetting Geraldo by a fourth-round knockout win; then-undefeated Sugar Ray Seales on February 13 also at the Silver Slipper Hotel, losing by ten-round decision; Puerto Rican Josue Marquez (who had recently fought Antonio Cervantes for his world Junior Welterweight title) only five days after the Seales fight, losing by ten-round decision at San Juan; future Alexis Arguello world Junior Lightweight title challenger Arturo Leon, whom Robinson Garcia defeated by six-round decision at the Caesars' Tahoe in Stateline, Nevada, on April 18; Eddie Perkins again only nine days after the win against Leon-a ten- round unanimous decision loss at Tucson, Arizona; and future Angel Espada world Welterweight title challenger Johnny Gant, who obtained a ten-round decision win over Robinson Garcia on July 18 at Baltimore, Maryland. Robinson Garcia had five extra fights apart from these in 1974, going 5‚Äì0 with 3 knockouts against lesser opposition, to finish 1974 winning 11 of 15 bouts held that year. 1975 was a relatively inactive year for Robinson Garcia as he only fought five times. Nevertheless, among those five bouts was one against future Leonard world title challenger Larry Bonds, who outpointed Robinson Garcia over ten rounds at Las Vegas on February 26, future three time world champion and International Boxing Hall of Fame member, the then-only 16 years old Wilfred Benitez, who beat Robinson Garcia by ten-round decision on June 9 at the Ramon Loubriel Stadium in Bayamon, Puerto Rico-(sometimes incorrectly said to be in San Juan); and Adriano Marrero, a Dominican who would later challenge Antonio Cervantes unsuccessfully for Cervantes' WBA world Junior Welterweight title and who beat Robinson Garcia by a 10-round decision on August 5. Of Robinson Garcia's seven 1976 bouts, six were held in the United States and one in Canada. He went 1-5-1 during that span, losing to former undisputed world Welterweight Champion Billy Backus by a ten-round unanimous decision on April 3 at Utica, New York; to Rafael Rodriguez on points in 10 on May 5 at Minneapolis, Minnesota; to former and future WBA world Welterweight title challenger Clyde Gray by ten round unanimous decision on September 2 at Halifax, Nova Scotia; and to Willie \\"The Worm\\" Monroe by a seventh-round technical knockout December 3 at Rochester, New York. He beat 24-10 Perry Abner by an upset ninth-round technical knockout on July 28 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1977, Robinson Garcia fought only 3 times, losing twice and winning once. 1978 proved to be Robinson Garcia's last year as an active professional boxer. He lost twice that year, including his last bout, on February 25, to contender Paul Payen, 17-1 coming in, on a ten-round decision at Hainaut, Belgium. In 237 bouts, Robinson Garcia had a win-loss-draw record of 135 wins, 82 losses and 20 draws, his 53 knockout wins making him a member of the exclusive club of boxers with 50 or more knockout wins in professional boxing. Of his 82 defeats, only 3 were by way of knockout or technical knockout. The latter fact might have, ironically, contributed to his later, boxing related diseases as he took punches from some of boxing's best fighters of his era for prolonged periods of time. == Life away from boxing == According to Ferdie Pacheco, Robinson Garcia once told him that he spent 6 months in an Italian jail for beating up a woman. Cuban boxing expert Enrique Encinosa said that Robinson Garcia returned to Paris, living as a homeless man there before Fidel Castro allowed him to return to Cuba and spend his last days at the Caribbean country. Also according to Encinosa, Robinson Garcia was once married in Paris. == See also == *Peter Buckley *Buck Smith ==References== Category:1937 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Cuban male boxers Category:Super-featherweight boxers Category:Lightweight boxers Category:Welterweight boxers Category:People from Havana Category:Sportspeople from Miami Category:People from Paris Category:Homeless people ","title":"Angel Robinson Garcia"},{"id":"46888814","text":"The Muskogee Oilers were a professional, minor league baseball team that played in the Western League in 1933.

Metro‚Äôs repertoire is a mix of traditional music fused with rock and pop as well as covers of popular songs worldwide. In an a cappella fashion, Metro uses their voices to imitate percussion, trumpets, guitars and miscellaneous sound effects as well full melodies with harmony. Metro is best remembered for their music video covering \\"Boundless Ocean, Vast Skies\\" (Êµ∑ÈóäÂ§©Á©∫), a song made famous by Hong Kong rock group Beyond, and their cover of Joey Yung's \\"My Pride\\" (ÊàëÁöÑÈ©ïÂÇ≤). The group has since received over 12 million views worldwide on video sharing websites like YouTube and Youku. Since that time, Metro has released two albums, Music for a Metropolis and No Borders, an all Chinese album, and has received acclaim throughout Greater China. ==HistoryCelebrity Cruises (1998-2002)=== The group was originally formed in 1998 by Eric Monson. Eric was asked to form an a cappella quartet by a Nashville-based talent agency to provide entertainment for a six-month contract aboard Celebrity Cruises cruiseships. Eric contacted Sean Oliver, Michael Lance and Chris Riggins to form the original ensemble. The group‚Äôs first name was Four Score and their initial repertoire was mostly Barbershop and Doo-wop music. Their first contract was aboard Celebrity Cruises Mercury. After finishing the Mercury contract, Metro signed an additional contract aboard Celebrity Cruises Century for its inaugural European cruise. In 2000, the group was asked to be a part of the opening crew for the inaugural voyage of Celebrity Cruises Millennium. It was on board the Millennium where the group would find a distinct sound, adopting more of a pop rock genre, and rename themselves Metro Vocal Group. Shortly thereafter, Metro Vocal Group was hired as part of the opening crew for the Celebrity Cruises Summit's inaugural voyage. ===Disney (2002-2007)=== In 2002, after a successful four-year contract with Celebrity Cruises, Metro Vocal Group was hired to perform at Tokyo Disney Resort in Maihama, Japan. While in Tokyo, they performed as the Dockside Porters at the American Waterfront of Tokyo Disney Sea and performed mostly barbershop arrangements. After three years in Tokyo, Metro was asked to open the new Hong Kong Disneyland in 2005. Continuing with a Barbershop sound, Metro entertained as the Dapper Dans on Main Street, USA. ===Hong Kong (2007-present)=== Pingtung, Taiwan, 2015.

Left to right: Joost Prinsen, Wieteke van Dort, Aart Staartjes. De Stratemakeropzeeshow (\\"The bricklayer at sea show\\") was a Dutch television program for children that ran from 1972 to 1974 and was aired by the VARA broadcasting organization. ==Description== The main actors were Joost Prinsen, Aart Staartjes, and Wieteke van Dort. The \\"taboo-breaking\\" show was controversial because it tackled what were then considered unseemly topics; the \\"Poop and Pee Minuet\\" was criticized in the tabloid De Telegraaf. It was directed by Staartjes and Frans Boelen, with music by Harry Bannink. Important lyrical contributions were by Willem Wilmink; other lyricists were Karel Eykman (writing as Hendrik Blaak) and Hans Dorrestijn. The show aired at a time when Dutch children's television was changing: the previous generation had watched Annie M. G. Schmidt's shows, but the writers of De Stratemakeropzeeshow dealt much more openly with children's problems, in a way deemed more relevant to children than previous television shows. Fifty-five episodes were aired, from 3 October 1972 to 26 December 1974. The show possibly ended because of complaints by parents. In 2009, it made the \\"Canon of Dutch Children's Television\\". ==Cast and characters== Joost Prinsen's main character was Erik Engerd (free translation \\"Eerie Eric\\"), an alter ego that still stuck to the actor for years after. Eric always tried to scare others, but scared no one but himself. Wieteke van Dort's Deftige Dame (\\"Proper Lady\\") farted continually; this show and others made van Dort the \\"uncrowned queen of Dutch children's television\\". Her character \\"Tante Lien\\", which later got her own show, was introduced in De Stratemakeropzeeshow. Aart Staartjes played the title character \\"Stratemaker op zee\\" (\\"Street paver at sea\\"), abbreviated \\"Straat\\". His character represented the naive and uninhibited child who commented on the way adults lived their lives. ==Other collaborators== *Harry Bannink wrote music for the show, including the \\"Poop and Pee Minuet\\" *Willem Wilmink wrote lyrics, including the \\"Poop and Pee Minuet\\" *Peter Nieuwerf played guitar ==Songs== Some of the songs from the show have become classics. A number of them were performed in 2006 and 2007 by Michiel Flamman and others. ===Notable songs=== *\\"Poep en piesmenuet\\" (\\"Poop and Pee Minuet\\") *\\"Je bent een liegbeest, een jokkenbrok\\" (\\"You're a liar\\") *\\"Jongen, eet nou door\\" (\\"Son, please finish your dinner\\") ==References== Category:Dutch children's television series Category:Dutch music television series Category:1972 Dutch television series debuts Category:1974 Dutch television series endings Category:1970s Dutch television series ","title":"De Stratemakeropzeeshow"},{"id":"46888893","text":"George Watson (16 March 1922 ‚Äì 20 September 1978) was a former Australian rules footballer who played with Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:1922 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Fitzroy Football Club players Category:Oakleigh Football Club players ","title":"George Watson (Australian rules footballer)"},{"id":"46888903","text":"Leon Gemmell (12 March 1921 ‚Äì 29 December 1992) was a former Australian rules footballer who played with Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:1921 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Fitzroy Football Club players ","title":"Leon Gemmell"},{"id":"46888914","text":"Bruce Bridges (7 August 1917 ‚Äì 26 October 1999) was a former Australian rules footballer who played with Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:1917 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from Western Australia Category:Fitzroy Football Club players Category:West Perth Football Club players ","title":"Bruce Bridges"},{"id":"46888926","text":"The 2012 All-SEC football team consists of American football players selected to the All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) chosen by various selectors for the 2012 Southeastern Conference football season.

However, when he arrives, he finds that the room was far from what he was expecting, as the home is actually a bunker, but he chooses to stay despite this. Soon after, his bizarre landlords (Oona von Maydell and David Scheller) begin to insist that he tutor their son Klaus (Daniel Fripan), who they believe will become President of the United States, despite being born in Germany. Stranger still is their insistence that an alien lives within the mother's leg and that Klaus is only 8 years old, despite looking far older. ==Cast== * Pit Bukowski as Student * Daniel Fripan as Klaus * Oona von Maydell as Mother * David Scheller as Father == Reception == Critical reception has been positive and Collider felt that the movie was \\"A unique piece of work, Der Bunker is twisted yet engaging, abstract and parabolic, funny yet flippant.\\" The Hollywood Reporter praised the film, writing \\"Though the story‚Äôs anything but realistic, this doesn‚Äôt mean that it has nothing to say; Chryssos‚Äôs well-paced screenplay suggests something, for example, about the dangers of burdening a child with unrealistic expectations, such as the parents‚Äô insistence on Klaus's preparation for his future in the White House (the fact he's a German citizen is the least of this kid's problems, as Klaus can't even remember the capitals of Belgium and France).\\" Exberliner also praised the film, calling it \\"Funny, horrifying, theatrical, abstract, allegorical, and mysterious.\\" ===Awards=== *Next Wave Award for Best Film at Fantastic Fest (2015, won) *Prix du Jury at the Mauvais Genre Film Festival (2015, won) *Prix du Jury de la Critique at the Mauvais Genre Film Festival (2015, won) *Jury Award for Best Actor - International Film at the Fantaspoa International Fantastic Film Festival (2015, won - Daniel Fripan) *Honorable Mention at Lund International Fantastic Film Festival (2015, won) *Best Director at Ithaca International Fantastic Film Festival (2015, won) *Best Film at La Mano Festival (2016, won) ==References External links== * * Category:2015 films Category:German films Category:German comedy horror films Category:German drama films ","title":"Der Bunker"},{"id":"46889118","text":"Franck Pavloff is a French psychologist, novelist, and poet born in N√Æmes in France in 1940.

Devarajan. (4 July 2000). A children's magazine puts up a fight for survival The Hindu Business Line. Retrieved 27 July 2016. The magazine is published by Eklavya, a not for profit organisation which was established in 1982 to conduct research and evolve curriculum for school education in India. The motivating force to launch Chakmak was to provide children studying in middle schools with supplementary reading material in science so that their school learning could be suitably reinforced. Chakmak was refurbished into a new coloured format in November 2007 by children's illustrator Atanu Roy. It continues with many columns by eminent writers, scientists and painters like Jayant Narlikar, Gulzar, Nida Fazli, Ashok Vajpai, Dilip Chinchalkar, Asgar Wajahat Shah, Abid Surti and many more, as well as budding authors. October 2011 issue of Chakmak was its 300th issue - a landmark effort initiated by a non-profit organisation in India. The impact of Chakmak can be seen in the form of thousands of stories, poems, and illustrations. ==Objective== Chakmak had a wider objective from the time of its launch ‚Äì to reach out into the Hindi speaking belt of central and north India as a definitive children's magazine, biased heavily towards science, that could spur the creativity and curiosity of children entering the teenage years, encourage and inculcate in them a reading habit and make learning and the acquisition of knowledge a process of fun and enjoyment. Science and ‚Äòscientific thinking‚Äô was the edifice around which the content was structured. So there were articles on science and on the history of science, all seeking to change children's perception of science as a subject. In addition, many experiments that children could perform at home with available materials gleaned from their surroundings were also published in the hope of encouraging them to take up experiment-based learning. In the same vein, there were puzzles and brain teasers and many do-it-yourself columns for making toys and gadgets, origami and art, again based on home-made dyes and materials. It was felt that such content would awaken the creativity and problem solving abilities of children. Children were also encouraged to send in their poems, writings and drawings and several pages were devoted to publishing their contributions, again to encourage creativity in writing and art and to give them a sense of ownership and closeness with the magazine. ==Region of impact== Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra, Delhi Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan. ==Other impact== NCERT and Delhi SCERT reproduced a lot of material from Chakmak in school text books Pitara, Spectrum, Navduniya, Dainik Hindustan, Indradhanush regularly carry material from Chakmak. Encourages children's original writing and illustration. Four books published from children's contribution and sold over 2, 50,000 copies. In recognition of its contribution to popularising science among children, Chakmak won an award from the National Council for Science and Technology Communication in the mid-'80s. ==Reader‚Äôs profile== Children seven to 15 years old, School Teachers, Educators, NGOs, B.Ed., B.

Law returned to Kilmarnock and began a successful career accepting private portrait commissions. Law married Elizabeth Wilson in 1912, and the couple moved to Glasgow, where Law continued with his commissioned work.

The Frankish Empire rose to the main successor of Roman imperial power in Western Europe, and as a result, the Franks ultimately gave their name to both the kingdom of France, and to Franconia, one of the stem duchies of the Holy Roman Empire. ==Etymology== It was traditionally assumed that the word Frank comes from the Germanic word for \\"javelin\\" (such as in Old English franca or Old Norse frakka, Latinized francisca \\"throwing axe\\"),Robert K. Barnhart, ed. Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology (Bronx, NY: H. W. Wilson, 1988), 406. analogous to the name of the Saxons, which appears to derive from Proto-Germanic *sahsa- 'knife, dagger, short sword'.Online Etymology Dictionary entries for \\"frank\\" Words in other Germanic languages meaning \\"bold\\" or \\"fierce\\" (Middle Dutch vrac, Old English fr«£c and Old Norwegian frakkr), may also be significant. Eumenius addressed the Franks in the matter of the execution of Frankish prisoners in the circus at Trier by Constantine I in 306 and certain other measures:Panegyric on Constantine, xi.. Ubi nunc est illa ferocia? Ubi semper infida mobilitas? (\\"Where now is that famed ferocity of yours, that ever untrustworthy fickleness?\\"). Feroces was used often to describe the Franks.. Contemporary definitions of Frankish ethnicity vary both by period and point of view. In a tradition going back to the 7th-century Chronicle of Fredegar, the name of the Franks is taken from Francio, one of the Germanic kings of Sicambri, c. 61 BCE, whose dominion extended all along those lands immediately joining the west-bank of the Rhine River, as far as Strasbourg and Belgium.David Solomon Ganz, Tzemach David, part 2, Warsaw 1859, p. 9b (Hebrew); Polish name of book: Cemach Dawid; cf. J.M. Wallace-Hadrill, Fredegar and the History of France, University of Manchester, n.d. pp. 536‚Äì538 This nation is also explicitly mentioned by Julius Caesar in his Notebooks on the Gallic War (Commentarii de Bello Gallico). Writing in 2009, Professor Christopher Wickham pointed out that \\"the word 'Frankish' quickly ceased to have an exclusive ethnic connotation. North of the Loire everyone seems to have been considered a Frank by the mid-seventh century at the latest; Romani were essentially the inhabitants of Aquitaine after that\\". On the other hand, a formulary written by Marculf about AD 700 described a continuation of national identities within a mixed population when it stated that \\"all the peoples who dwell [in the official's province], Franks, Romans, Burgundians, and those of other nations, live ... according to their law and their custom.\\". ==Adjective frank \\"free\\"== The Middle English adjective frank \\"free, liberal, generous\\" was adopted in c. 1300 from Old French franc \\"free (not servile)\\", from Medieval Latin francus \\"free, at liberty\\", as a noun \\"a freeman, a Frank\\".See e.g. ; . The generalised meaning of \\"freeman\\" and adjectival \\"free\\" developed because under Frankish rule in Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation. The Gallo-Roman population held a lower rank in Frankish society. Salic law was the Germanic law codified in the early 6th century to apply to Franks within the Frankish Empire. The legal system in Francia tried every man according to the law of his own race, the Gallo-Roman subject population fell under separate laws, and yet separate laws concerned the interaction between Franks (freemen) and Gallo-Roman subjects. The most notable of these are the Lex Romana Visigothorum or Breviary of Alaric (506), the Lex Romana Curiensis and the Lex Romana Burgundionum. This led to obvious complications, as expressed by Agobard of Lyons, who was pleading for a unified legal system in the Frankish Empire, \\"Of five men sitting or walking together none will have the same law as his fellow.\\" The Modern French adjective franc (feminine franche, adverb franchement) still means \\"free, tax- exempt\\" as well as \\"frank, outspoken\\". It is seen in the name of Franche- Comt√©, the area of the Free County of Burgundy (982-1678), so named because its sovereign had the unusual title of \\"free count\\" (, or '). Franklin (fraunclein) was the Anglo-Norman term for a free landowner not of noble birth, giving rise to the given name Franklin and eventually the surname. ==Francia (France)== The name of France directly continues Latin Francia, originally applied to the entire Frankish Empire. Under the reign of the Franks' Kings Clovis I, Charles Martel, Pepin the Short, and Charlemagne, the country was known as Kingdom of Franks or Francia. At the Treaty of Verdun in 843, the Frankish Empire was divided in three parts : West Francia (Francia Occidentalis), Middle Francia and East Francia (Francia Orientalis). The rulers of Francia Orientalis, who soon claimed the imperial title and wanted to reunify the Frankish Empire, dropped the name Francia Orientalis and called their realm the Holy Roman Empire (see History of Germany). The kings of Francia Occidentalis successfully opposed this claim and managed to preserve Francia Occidentalis as an independent kingdom, distinct from the Holy Roman Empire. The Battle of Bouvines in 1214 definitively marked the end of the efforts by the Holy Roman Empire to reunify the old Frankish Empire by conquering France. Since the name Francia Orientalis had disappeared, there arose the habit to refer to Francia Occidentalis as Francia only, from which the word France is derived. The French state has been in continuous existence since 843 (except for a brief interruption in 885-887), with an unbroken line of heads of states since the first king of Francia Occidentalis (Charles the Bald) to the current president of the French Republic. Noticeably, in German, France is still called Frankreich, which literally means \\"Reich (realm) of the Franks\\". In order to distinguish it from the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, France is called Frankreich, while the Frankish Empire is called Frankenreich. In most of the Germanic languages, France is known as the historical \\"Land of the Franks\\", for example Frankreich (Reich of the Franks) in German, Frankrijk (Rijk of the Franks) in Dutch, Frankrike (Rike of the Franks) in Swedish and Norwegian, and Frankrig in Danish. In a more restricted meaning, \\"France\\" refers specifically to the province of √éle-de-France (with Paris at its centre), which historically was the heart of the royal demesne. This meaning is found in some geographic names, such as French Brie (Brie fran√ßaise) and French Vexin (Vexin fran√ßais). French Brie, the area where the famous Brie cheese is produced, is the part of Brie that was annexed to the royal demesne, as opposed to Champagne Brie (Brie champenoise) which was annexed by Champagne. Likewise, French Vexin was the part of Vexin inside √éle-de-France, as opposed to Norman Vexin (Vexin normand) which was inside Normandy. This meaning is also found in the name of the French language (langue fran√ßaise), whose literal meaning is \\"language of √éle-de-France\\". It is not until the 19th and 20th centuries that the language of √éle-de-France indeed became the language of the whole country France. In modern French, the French language is called le fran√ßais, while the old language of √éle-de-France is called by the name applied to it according to a 19th-century theory on the origin of the French language - le francien. ==Franconia== Franconia became the Latin name of East Francia, derived from the German name Franken \\"realm of the Franks\\",in origin simply the dative plural of the name of the Franks, following a German model of naming territories also applied to the other stem duchies: Bavaria (Bayern), Thuringia (Th√ºringen), Saxony (Sachsen), Swabia (Schwaben); see also name of Sweden. Franconia was introduced as a synonym of Francia orientalis by the 12th century (Annalista Saxo),K.H. Ludwig in Kasten (ed.), Festschrift H√§germann, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2006, p. 246. and came to be used of the Duchy of Franconia as it stood during the 9th and 10th centuries, divided Franconia during the later medieval period, and the Franconian Circle of the early modern period. ==Franconian vs. Frankish== The division made between Franconia and Francia for German and French territories of the former Frankish Empire leads to terminological difficulties in English. English has the two adjectives Franconian and Frankish translating what in Dutch and German is expressed by a single adjective (frankisch and fr√§nkisch, respectively). Franconian translates German fr√§nkisch when referring to the Franconia within the Holy Roman Empire from the 10th century onward, while Frankish tends to refer to the period of the unified Frankish realm, during the 5th to 9th centuries. But there are exceptions, most notably in the context of linguistics, where the term Franconian languages translates German fr√§nkische Sprachen, French Langues franciques. This group of dialects has a complicated history due to the geographical spread of the High German consonant shift as it developed during the medieval period. Dutch remained unaffected by the consonant shift compare the name \\"Dutch\\", which until the 18th century was used of German in general; see \\"The language of the Germans is High Dutch, of which there are many dialects, so different, that the people of one province scarce understand those of another.\\" while Central and Rhenish and High Franconian form a dialect continuum within High German. Since these dialects are all derived from the early medieval language of the Franks, linguistic terminology in English varies between the names \\"Frankish\\" and \\"Franconian\\", the Germanic language of Merowingian Francia being variously known as \\"Old Frankish\\", \\"Old Franconian\\" or simply \\"Frankish\\". ===Old Franconian=== The German term altfr√§nkisch as it was introduced in the mid 19th century did not refer to the early medieval period, but was used as a nostalgic term for \\"old- timey\\" Franconia (compare Old English vs. Olde England). This was rendered into English as \\"Old Franconian\\", with 19th-century sources talking about Old Franconian towns, songs, people, etc. But the same term altfr√§nkisch came to be used of the Frankish language of the Merovingian period. Gustave Solling's Diutiska (1863) used the adjective \\"Franconian\\" in reference to the Merowingian period, and \\"Old Franconian\\" for the language of the Pledge of Charles the Bald. In 1890 Ernest Adams defined \\"Old Franconian\\" as an Old High German dialect spoken on the middle and upper Rhine; i.e., it went beyond the limits of Franconia to comprise also the dialect continuum of the Rhineland. In 1862 Max M√ºller pointed out that Jacob Grimm had applied the concept of \\"German\\" grammar to ten languages, which \\"all appear to have once been one and the same.\\" One of these was the \\"Netherland Language, which appears to have been produced by the combined action of the older Franconian and Saxon, and stands therefore in close relation to the Low German and the Friesian. Its descendants now are the Flemish in Belgium and Dutch in Holland.\\" M√ºller, after describing Grimm's innovation of the old, middle and new phases of High German, contradicts himself by reiterating that Franconian was a dialect of the upper Rhine. In this review Vaughan and Allon are paraphrasing from Max M√ºller's Science of Language lecture series, German language, later translated and published in English. ===Low Franconian vs. Dutch=== The overlapping concepts of \\"Franconian\\" and the division of German into High German and Low German dialects by the 1880s gave rise to the term \\"Low Franconian\\" for the \\"Franconian\\" dialects that did not take part in the High German consonant shift. Strong and Meyer (1886) defined Low Franconian as the language \\"spoken on the lower Rhine.\\" Their presentation included an Upper, Middle and Lower Franconian, essentially the modern scheme. According to Strong and Meyer, \\"Franconian ceases to be applied to this language; it is then called Netherlandish (Dutch)‚Ä¶.\\" Only the English ever applied Franconian anywhere; moreover, Netherlandish had been in use since the 17th century, after which Dutch was an entirely English word. The error had been corrected by the time of Wright's Old High German Primer two years later, in 1888. Wright identifies Old Low Franconian with Old Dutch, both terms used only in English. Van Vliet and his 17th century contemporaries inherited the name and the concept \\"Teutonic\\". Teutones and Teutoni are names from Late Latin referring to the West Germanic speaking populations, originally derived from the earlier name of a tribe specifically called Teutons. The word Teutonicus had thus been used since the Middle Ages as an alternative to Theodiscus (the Germanic word from which Dutch and Deutsch evolved). Between \\"Old Dutch\\" (meaning the earliest Dutch language) and \\"Old Teutonic\\", Van Vliet inserted \\"Frankish\\", the language of the Old Franks. He was unintentionally ambiguous about who these \\"Old Franks\\" were linguistically. At one point in his writing they were referred to as \\"Old High German\\" speakers, at another, \\"Old Dutch\\" speakers, and at another \\"Old French\\" speakers. Moreover, he hypothesized at one point that Frankish was a reflection of Gothic. The language of the literary fragments available to him was not clearly identified. Van Vliet was searching for a group he thought of as the \\"Old Franks\\", which to him included everyone from Mainz to the mouth of the Rhine. By the end of the 17th century the concept of Old Frankish, the ancestor language of Dutch, German, and the Frankish words in Old French had been firmly established. After the death of Junius, a contemporary of Van Vliet, Johann Georg Graevius said of him in 1694 that he collected fragments of vetere Francica, \\"Old Frankish,\\" ad illustrandam linguam patriam, \\"for the elucidation of the mother tongue.\\" The concept of the Dutch vetere Francica, a language spoken by the Franks mentioned in Gregory of Tours and of the Carolingian Dynasty, which at one end of its spectrum became Old Dutch, and at the other, Old High German, threw a shadow into neighboring England, even though the word \\"Franconian\\", covering the same material, was already firmly in use there. The shadow remains. The term \\"Old Frankish\\" in English is vague and analogous, referring either to language or to other aspects of culture. In the most general sense, \\"old\\" means \\"not the present\\", and \\"Frankish\\" means anything claimed to be related to the Franks from any time period. The term \\"Old Frankish\\" has been used of manners, architecture, style, custom, government, writing and other aspects of culture, with little consistency. In a recent history of the Germanic people, Ozment used it to mean the Carolingian and all preceding governments and states calling themselves Franks through the death of the last admittedly Frankish king, Conrad I of Germany, in 919, and his replacement by a Saxon. This \\"Old Frankish\\" period, then, beginning in the Proto-Germanic period and lasting until the 10th century, is meant to include Old High German, Old Dutch and the language that split to form Low German and High German. A second term in use by Van Vliet was oud Duijts, \\"Old Dutch\\", where Duijts meant \\"the entire Continental Germanic continuum\\". The terms Nederlandsch and Nederduijts were coming into use for contemporary Dutch. Van Vliet used the oud Duijts ambiguously to mean sometimes Francks, sometimes Old Dutch, and sometimes Middle Dutch, perhaps because the terms were not yet firm in his mind.. Duijts had been in general use until about 1580 to refer to the Dutch language, but subsequently was replaced by Nederduytsch. English linguists lost no time in bringing Van Vliet's oud Duijts into English as \\"Old Dutch\\". The linguistic noun \\"Old Dutch\\", however, competed with the adjective \\"Old Dutch\\", meaning an earlier writing in the same Dutch, such as an old Dutch rhyme, or an old Dutch proverb. For example, Brandt's \\"old Dutch proverb\\", in the English of his translator, John Childe, mentioned in 1721: Eendracht maekt macht, en twist verquist, \\"Unity gives strength, and Discord weakness,\\" means contemporary Dutch and not Old Dutch. On the frontispiece, Childe refers to the language in which the book was written as \\"the original Low Dutch\\". Linguistic \\"Old Dutch\\" had already become \\"Low Dutch\\", the contemporary language, and \\"High Dutch\\", or High German. On the other hand, \\"Old Dutch\\" was a popular English adjective used in the 18th century with reference to people, places and things. ==See also== * Name of the Goths ==References== Franks Category:Ethnonyms Category:Franks ","title":"Name of the Franks"},{"id":"46889488","text":"Positive John Thomas sign displayed by a patient who sustained a pertrochanteric fracture on the left. The John Thomas signNote: \\"John Thomas\\" is an English language euphemism for \\"penis\\"., also known as the Throckmorton sign, The Throckmorton sign is reportedly named for American neurologist Tom Bentley Throckmorton (1885-1961). is a slang or joke term used in the field of radiology. It refers to the position of a penis as it relates to pathology on an X-ray of a pelvis. When the penis (visible on the X-ray as a shadow) points towards the same side as a unilateral medical condition such as a broken bone, this is considered a \\"positive John Thomas sign\\", and if the shadow points to the other side, it is a \\"negative John Thomas sign.\\" Studies have shown that the \\"sign\\" is no better than chance at identifying the location of a hip fracture. In those cases where the John Thomas sign is positive, it has been proposed that a person with a displaced hip fracture may try to lie on the injured side to immobilize the fracture and reduce pain; the penis then inclines toward the downward (injured) side. Andy Murray, British professional tennis player, released a picture of his pelvic X-ray following his hip resurfacing surgery on January 29, 2019 clearly demonstrating an example of a negative John Thomas or Throckmorton sign where his penis pointed away from the site of injury.

Correll, Hannes Bok, Guy Anderson, Hilda Grossman, Malcolm Roberts, Mark Tobey, Andrew Chinn, Jacob Elshin, Fay Chong, Julius Twohy, Z. Vanessa Helder, Joseph Solman, James FitzGerald, Kenneth Downer, and Ruth Egri) and oversaw the creation of the popular Spokane Art Center. His tenure was not without controversy. Artists and financial backers of the program questioned his management style and artistic credentials, while political concerns threatened the existence of the FAP (which became, in 1939, the Washington Arts Project). Inverarity, however, managed to retain the directorship until the program was ended by wartime priorities early in 1942.Mahoney, Eleanor: The Spokane Arts Center: Bringing Art to the People; The Great Depression in Washington State website; http://depts.washington.edu/depress/spokane_art_center.shtml retvd 6 5 2015 With American involvement in the Second World War, Inverarity served as the U.S. Navy's Chief of Design for Camouflage (1941-1943), and later as an official Navy war artist (1943-1945) Following the war, Inverarity completed his formal education. He earned Bachelor's degrees in art and anthropology from the University of Washington in 1946, and then studied with Hilaire Hiler at Fremont College in Los Angeles, receiving a Master's degree in fine arts in 1947 and a Ph.D. in 1948. This period also saw the publication of several books he had authored, including Masks and Marionettes of the Northwest Coast Indians (1940), Moveable Masks and Figures of the North Pacific Coast Indians (1941), Northwest Coast Indian Art (1946), and The Art of the Northwest Coast Indians (1950). Although Inverarity ceased exhibiting his work in 1941, he continued creating art, including illustrations for his and other books, and continued with his longtime interest in photography. Among his best-known works are his portraits of artist friends such as Glenn Wessels, Dorothea Tanning, Max Ernst, Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, and Stanton Macdonald-Wright.Smithsonian Archives of American Art; 29 images by R.B. Inverarity. http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/collection/robert- bruce-inverarity-papers-6796 retvd 6 7 15 Aurora Sky, Robert Bruce Inverarity, pastel, 1931. Combining his interests in art and anthropology, Inverarity became the founding director of the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1949. During his five years as director, the museum participated in a pilot study for an innovative system of coding visual files. Inverarity also remained active with the American Anthropological Association and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and wrote several articles for anthropological journals. When Inverarity was fired by the Museum of International Folk Art in 1954, most of the staff resigned in protest, triggering an investigation by the American Association of Museums. He went on to serve as director of the Adirondack Museum in Blue Mountain Lake, New York from 1954 to 1965. After a period working as an illustrator and designer for the University of California Press, he returned to the East Coast in 1969 to serve as director of the Philadelphia Maritime Museum. ==Later years== Inverarity retired in 1976 and moved to La Jolla, California. He sold his unique and extensive collection of Northern Coastal Native art and artifacts to the British Museum for what he described as \\"a tidy sum\\". He died in La Jolla on August 6, 1999.

In 1926 he began playing for Sale in the Gippsland Football League, after the Toongabbie club became defunct. Late in the 1927 season, Johnson was involved in controversy when prior to Sale's semi-final against Stratford it was revealed that he had made an appearance with another team during the season without a clearance, which prompted Sale to withdraw him from their team to avoid losing the game on protest. During an October meeting of Gippsland Football League delegates, Johnson admitted to playing, under an assumed name, with a club called the Stuart Mill, which was held in a competition outside the radius of the league. He was disqualified for the entire 1928 season. Johnson, a follower, joined Hawthorn from Sale in the 1932 VFL season. His early appearances for Hawthorn showed promise and he didn't miss selection for the first 12 rounds. Johnson ended up playing 14 games in what would be his only season of VFL football. He returned to Sale in 1933. Following the war, in which he served overseas, Johnson continued to live in Sale and made a living as a telephone linesman, for the Postmaster-General's Department. Johnson was one of three linesmen who died near Drouin on 6 October 1948, when the line they were taking down came into contact with a 2,200 volt high tension wire. He was killed instantly from the electric shock. ==ReferencesCategory:1907 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Hawthorn Football Club players Category:Sale Football Club players Category:Australian military personnel of World War II Category:Accidental deaths by electrocution Category:Accidental deaths in Victoria (Australia) Category:1948 deaths ","title":"Harvey Johnson (Australian footballer)"},{"id":"46889623","text":"The 2010 All-SEC football team consists of American football players selected to the All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) chosen by the Associated Press (AP) and the conference coaches for the 2010 Southeastern Conference football season.

Between 1982 and 1983, he lived for three months in Nicaragua and brought to completion one of the first examples of what would have been then defined graphic journalism: a live reportage that portrays through drawings accompanied by captions, the plight of the country at the time of the guerrillas unleashed by the counterrevolutionaries. He went later in the former Yugoslavia, \\"In the war, under the bombs as an idiot\\", he says in an interview with the newspaper La Repubblica: \\"Usually journalists, in places of war, work from the hotels collecting agencies.

Vittorio Sgarbi, in Art Exhibitions in the 54th Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Antiga Editions, 2011 \\"There are two things that Riccardo Mannelli‚Äôs paintings communicate: the first is that the story of the adventures and misadventures of the soul is surely written in the body, the second is that the body brings us into the undifferentiated disturbing scenario, from which men are emancipated to inaugurate their own story, but from which they must be accompanied if they do not want to extinguish. Keepers of this ambivalence are the artists who are able to draw on original chaos\\".

The third match of the series at the Adelaide Oval was the first ever day-night Test. Michael Hussey captained the Prime Minister's XI side for the tour match, and in preparation for the day-night Test, a pink ball was used in this game. Australia won the series 2‚Äì0, with victories in Brisbane and Adelaide, with the second Test in Perth being drawn. Following the conclusion of the Adelaide Test, New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum said that day-night Test cricket is \\"here to stay\\" and that \\"it's a great concept\\". The Australian captain Steve Smith also had praise for the day-night Test saying that \\"the whole Test match was a great innovation, it was a great spectacle\\". Media reaction to the first day-night Test was also positive, with many news outlets praising the innovation. However, following the match the majority of players who took part in the game said that there needs considerable work on floodlit Test cricket. Twenty of the twenty-two players who responded supported the concept of day-night Test cricket but work on the pink ball needed further refinement. ==Squads== {  style=\\"text-align:center; margin:0 auto\\" - !style=\\"width:50%\\" !style=\\"width:50%\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top\\"  * Brendon McCullum (c) * Ross Taylor (vc) * ~~Corey Anderson~~ * Trent Boult * Doug Bracewell * Mark Craig * Martin Guptill * Matt Henry * Tom Latham * ~~James Neesham~~ * Luke Ronchi (wk) * Hamish Rutherford * Tim Southee * BJ Watling (wk) * Kane Williamson * Mitchell Santner * Neil Wagner * Mitchell McClenaghan  * Steve Smith (c) * David Warner (vc) * Joe Burns * Josh Hazlewood * Mitchell Johnson (ret) * ~~Usman Khawaja~~ * Nathan Lyon * Mitchell Marsh * Peter Nevill (wk) * Peter Siddle * ~~Mitchell Starc~~ * Adam Voges * Shaun Marsh * Stephen O'Keefe * James Pattinson } All-rounder Corey Anderson was ruled out of New Zealand's Test series in Australia because of an ongoing back problem.

Stephen O'Keefe was released the day of the Test after the pitch condition was inspected. Mitchell Starc suffered a stress fracture to his right foot during the first day of the Adelaide Test and was ruled out of bowling for the rest of the match. ==Tour matchesPrime Minister's XI v New Zealanders=Cricket Australia XI v New Zealanders=First-class match: Cricket Australia XI v New Zealanders=== The match was abandoned after the Cricket Australia XI's declaration shortly before lunch on Day 2 due to an unsafe pitch. The New Zealanders had become concerned about the state of the pitch after some dangerously high bouncing deliveries late on Day 1; the match continued on the morning of Day 2 with the New Zealanders bowling only its spinners, the Cricket Australia XI declared immediately after Ryan Carters' dismissal, and the match was not resumed. ===Western Australia XI v New Zealanders=Test series (Trans-Tasman Trophy)1st Test=== The first Test of the series resulted in a dominant Australian victory. After winning the toss, Australia on back of centuries from David Warner and Usman Khawaja and half centuries from Joe Burns and Adam Voges declared their innings at 4/556. New Zealand in reply had a steady start before a middle- order collapse left them struggling at the end of day 2. However, Kane Williamson's 140 meant that Australia didn't enforce the follow-on. However, Warner's second century and Burns maiden ton resulted in New Zealand being set a target of 504 runs. Another middle-order collapse meant that despite rain interruptions on day 3 and day 4 Australia comfortably won the Test by 208 runs. ===2nd Test=3rd Test=ReferencesExternal links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Category:2015 in Australian cricket Category:2015 in New Zealand cricket Category:International cricket competitions in 2015‚Äì16 Category:New Zealand cricket tours of Australia Category:2015‚Äì16 Australian cricket season ","title":"New Zealand cricket team in Australia in 2015‚Äì16"},{"id":"46889780","text":"Syed Safawi, ex MD and former Group CEO of VLCC Syed Safawi was the Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of VLCC.

He and his co-authors have verified the conjecture for various cases, most notably flat manifolds,. nonpositively curved manifolds.. In his thesis, Farrell solved the problem of determining when a manifold (of dimension greater than 5) can fiber over a circle.. In 1977, he introduced Tate‚ÄìFarrell cohomology,. which is a generalization to infinite groups of the Tate cohomology theory for finite groups. In 1993, he and his co-author Lowell E.

The film makers explore how, in their view, the US establishment promotes a culture of fear in order to secure increased military expenses, year after year. The film claims the US government and the military-industrial complex, together with the US media developed a powerful propaganda machinery (inspired in good part from Nazi propaganda) in order to scare and convince the public that US invasions like those in Dominican Republic (1965), Grenada (1983), US support for brutal mass-killings, terror campaigns like those in Guatemala (1954), Indonesia (1965), El Salvador (1979), US-designed assassination plots like those in Nicaragua (1981) and in huge parts of Latin America (Operation Condor) and support for overthrowing democratically elected governments like those in Brazil (1964) and Chile (1973) were needed in order to prevent the spread of communism, using mainly the domino theory. The movie also points at the help provided by the Western countries to fascist regimes in order to counter movements supporting workers rights (socialism, communism, anarchy). The fascism is presented as an instrument in the hands of the plutocracy for oppressing and enslaving the working class. The meaning of the movie's title, \\"The power principle\\" is revealed as the Mafia principle, which is \\"not allowing disobedience\\" - in this case not allowing the countries in the developing world to have governments that try to improve the life of the many. The movie traces the roots of the US establishment (both Republican and Democrat parties) mindset into the doctrine of Edward Bernays, pioneer in the field of public relations and propaganda, who believed the democracy is hard to handle and people are just too stupid to govern themselves in democracy, so there is a need of an elite, public guardians who manage the society and there is a need of public relation practitioners who would be professionals in working for the government for managing, manipulating the public and engineering consent.

After playing four years at Quinnipiac University, he made his NHL debut during the 2016‚Äì17 season. ==Playing careerJuniors=== Prior to turning professional, Peca played for the Pembroke Lumber Kings in the Central Canada Hockey League. In the offseason before the 2011‚Äì12 season, he was claimed off waivers by the Kitchener Rangers but never played for them due to his commitment to Quinnipiac University. ===Quinnipiac University=== Peca attended Quinnipiac University for four years, where he played four seasons with the Quinnipiac Bobcats men's ice hockey team which competes in NCAA's Division I in the ECAC Hockey conference. He was recognized for his outstanding play with the Bobcats when he was named as a freshman to the 2011‚Äì12 ECAC Hockey All-Rookie Team, and in his final season was named to the 2014‚Äì15 All-ECAC Hockey First Team and team co-captain. ===Professional=== After graduation, Peca signed an amateur try out with the Tampa Bay Lightning's American Hockey League affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch before signing a two year entry level contract with the Lightning on April 1, 2015. On December 27, 2016, the Tampa Bay Lightning announced that Peca would be called up to the NHL roster. On December 28, Peca made his NHL debut in a 4‚Äì3 Lightning overtime win over the visiting Montreal Canadiens. On December 31, Peca recorded his first career NHL point, which was an assist on a goal by Alex Killorn. On January 3, 2017, Peca scored his first NHL goal against Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets, making him the first Quinnipiac Bobcat to score a goal in the NHL. On July 5, 2017, Peca signed a one-year, two-way contract extension with the Lightning. On January 4, 2018, Peca was named to the 2018 AHL All-Star game. As a free agent, Peca signed a two-year, $2.6 million contract with the Montreal Canadiens on July 1, 2018. During the following 2018‚Äì19 season, on 8 November 2018, Peca scored his first goal for Montreal in a 5‚Äì6 overtime defeat against the Buffalo Sabres. In the final year of his contract with the Canadiens in the 2019‚Äì20 season, Peca was unable to keep his role in the NHL through training camp and was placed on waivers before he was assigned to AHL affiliate, the Laval Rocket. He appeared in 5 scoreless games on recall with Montreal through the season, before he was dealt at the NHL trade deadline to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Aaron Luchuk and a 2020 draft pick on February 24, 2020. ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - e0e0e0;\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" fff;\\" ! rowspan=\\"99\\" fff;\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" fff;\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - e0e0e0;\\" !

It is the southernmost city of Northeast China and China's northernmost warm water port, at the tip of the Liaodong Peninsula. Today, it is becoming a financial, shipping and logistics center for Northeast Asia. Dalian has comprehensive network of roads, railways and a major airport. == Road Network  Expressways === Four expressways link Dalian to its neighbor cities and areas, they are: * Shenda Expressway (G15) * Hegang‚ÄìDalian Expressway (G11) * Tuyang ExpresswayÂúüÁæäÈ´òÈÄüÂÖ¨Ë∑ØÁôæÂ∫¶ÁôæÁßë * Dayaowan ExpresswayÂ§ßÁ™ëÊπæÈ´òÈÄüÂÖ¨Ë∑Ø === China National Highways === There are two China National Highways starts/ends at Dalian. * China National Highway 201 (Hegang-Mudan River- L√ºshun) * China National Highway 202 (Heihe-Shenyang-L√ºshun) == Urban Public Transportation  Dalian Metro === The Dalian Metro or Dalian Rapid Transit is an elevated rapid transit system in the city of Dalian, China[3] (as of 2014, Dalian does not have a fully underground subway system). The metro opened on 1 May 2003. The system currently in operation consists of 3 lines: Line 3, Line 7, and Line 8. === Dalian Subway === The conception of building Dalian's Subway dates back to 1980s. In 1987, the plan was officially submitted for approval but failed. It was not until 2002 that its first line, line 3 was completed and operated. Currently, there are two lines - line 3 and 7 are in service. Another two, line 1 and 2 are under construction and predicted to be opened by July 2014. In addition, line 6, 8 and 10 are also under construction. In future, the city will all together have 12 subway lines.Get Around Dalian by Bus, Trams, Light Rail and Taxi === Trams in Dalian === Trams in Dalian have been operating continuously since 1909 making them one of the oldest tram systems still in use in China. There were once eleven routes in operation in Dalian in the Northeast China. Only two routes remain in use today. Notably, all of the staff on Dalian's tram system are female, i.e. ‚Äì driver, conductor, points man ‚Äî even the depot manager. The tram system was the only rail network in the city, until Dalian Metro opened more than a decade ago; the Metro has a large ridership. === Public Bus === The public bus transport in Dalian is highly developed. Over 150 routes enable budget visitors to get around the city easily. The buses' operating times vary, starting between 4:30am and 6:30am and finishing between 8pm and midnight. Make sure of the operating hours when taking a bus. Most buses have no conductors and so one or two Yuan in change will be needed before getting aboard. There are many one-way streets in the city, so do not always take it for granted that the return will drop people on the same street. People in the city are very kind to foreigners, so ask locals for help. There are three well-preserved old tram routes from colonial times in the city. Luckily they still serve as an important means of transport. The antique red trolleys of 201, 202 and 203 cruise the downtown and southwestern areas in the city. Buses with the initial number 6 are suburban commuters. The flexible mini-buses usually cruise the lanes and corners of the city, and can be flagged one down at anywhere. The ticket price is two yuan. == Taxis == The city area of Dalian is not very large and a taxi would be a good choice for travelers who want to quickly see the city. The rates start from eight yuan for the first three kilometers (1.86 miles) with 1.8 yuan per additional kilometer (0.62 miles). Rates for the night service from 22:00 - 05:00 (next day) are 30% higher, starting at 10.4 yuan for the first three kilometers (1.86 miles) and 2.34 yuan for each additional kilometer. == Intercity Transportation  Air === Dalian has an international airport called Zhoushuizi International Airport. It is located in Ganjingzi District, about 10 km (6 mi) northwest of the city center. In 2014 the airport handled 17,203,640 passengers, making it the busiest airport in Northeast China and the 16th busiest nationwide. The airport is the hub for Dalian Airlines and a focus city for China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines. === Port === Dalian is a very busy port with ships traveling between Dalian and Yantai, Weihai, Penglai, Qinhuang islands, port of Tianjin, and Changhai County. High-speed tourist ships between Dalian and Yantai, Qinhuang islands and Changhai County have been added. There are also passenger ships that travel between Dalian port and Incheon, South Korea. === Trains === Dalian railway is connected with the railway network of Northeast China and North China. Everyday more than 50 trains leave Dalian for Beijing, Shenyang, Harbin and many other cities. The Liaosheng Evening Paper Express and the Golden Beach Express travels between Dalian and Shengyang. There are also air-conditioned express trains that travel between Dalian and Beijing, Changchun, and Harbin. Dalian railway station, the terminal of Hada railway, is situated in Qingniwa Bridge of downtown Dalian. The station offers ticket delivery service. Dalian has now two main train stations, they are Dalian Railway Station and Dalian North Railway Station. == References == Category:Liaoning ","title":"Dalian transport network"},{"id":"46890326","text":"Roland Fargo \\"Rolly\\" Crump (born February 27, 1930) is an American animator and designer noted particularly for his work as a Disney Imagineer. == Biography == Crump was born in Alhambra, California, and joined Walt Disney Studios in 1952.

He is the founding pastor of the Biblical Church, which now has twenty three branch churches. ==Early life== Reiji Oyama was born to Toji and Ikuko Oyama in Kanda, Tokyo. He had an older brother, Jyoji and a younger sister, Miyako. During World War II, at the age of 17, Oyama served as a cadet in the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. After World War II was over, he went to Waseda University in Tokyo. At the age of 19, he met Jesus and was dramatically changed at a \\"GI Gospel Hour\\" meeting in 1946. Then one morning the Lord spoke to him and called him into the ministry, telling him to serve Him as a pastor. In his last year at Waseda University, he started to attend Tokyo Theological Seminary and graduated in 1953. ==MinistryDuring College and Seminary=== Soon after Oyama was saved, he began to share the gospel with his classmates and later founded the KGK, the \\"Christian Student Association,\\" as a ministry to college students on campus. The KGK is now a nationwide Christian organization in Japan and a member association of IFES (International Fellowship of Evangelical Students). In 1949, with his five friends, he held a three-day evangelical meeting for students in an auditorium at Waseda University. Fifty to one hundred students were saved each day, and it turned into a three-day revival for college students. ===Church Planting and Pastorate=== On March 15, 1953, Oyama stood on a street near Takadanobaba Station in Tokyo and started to preach the gospel to people. As people came to the Lord, he planted Tkadanobaba Church (later renamed The Biblical Church Tkadanobaba). In the following year, the first baptism service was held, and seven newly saved believers were baptized. In 1966, Oyama planted another church in Kumegawa, Tokyo. New believers were added every year, and as of 2015, the Biblical Church has 23 branch churches. ===Oversea Ministries=== Serving as the senior pastor at Takadanobaba Church, Oyama began to have a heart for other nations. In 1956, Oyama together with others who had a burden for oversea ministries got together from all over the country, and they decided their first oversea missionary work would be to go to these other Asian countries, who were attacked by Japan during World War II, and apologize and make reparations for the destruction and for any atrocities that occurred. He visited North Korea, South Korea, Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries and apologized for what Japan had done during World War II. ==Other MinistriesRadio Evangelism=== From 1962 - 1966, Oyama shared the gospel on a radio station called Nippon Broadcasting System, Incorporated („Éã„ÉÉ„Éù„É≥ÊîæÈÄÅ). It was a midnight program and was the top-rated radio program of the time. ===Seminary=== In 1969, he founded a seminary, Tokyo Graduate School of Theology. ===Unity of Churches=== Seeing the importance of the unity among local churches, from the 90\`s Oyama began a mediating ministry between denominations and local churches. He saw the conflicts among the body of Christ is one of the biggest hindrances to yet-seen revivals. In 1998, during a nationwide meeting (Tokyo Revival Mission), serving as the executive chairman, he encouraged Charismatic churches and Non-Charismatic churches to reconcile to each other. ===Writings=== During the past sixty years, he has written over 160 books. In 1960, he translated the Japanese version of the Epistle to Philemon and, in 1983, he also translated the Bible into modern Japanese and published the Modern Japanese Bible. ==Other highlights== *He took part in the translating work of the Bible into New Japanese Bible by translating Exodus and Joshua (1970). *Director, the Japan Evangelical Theological Society (1970-1972). *Executive Chairman Japan Protestant Conference (1973-1983). *Vice Executive Chairman of the Billy Graham Crusade held in Tokyo Dome baseball stadium (1980). *Director, Japan Evangelical Association (1985-1990). ==References== Category:Living people Category:1927 births ","title":"Reiji Oyama (pastor)"},{"id":"46890445","text":"Vladimir Saviƒáeviƒá may refer to: *Vladimir Saviƒáeviƒá (Serbian footballer) (born 1986), Serbian association football player *Vladimir Saviƒáeviƒá (Montenegrin footballer) (born 1989), Montenegrin association football player, the son of Dejan Saviƒáeviƒá ","title":"Vladimir Saviƒáeviƒá"},{"id":"46890449","text":"Eduard Vieta Pascual is a Spanish psychiatrist and a leading scientific authority on the neurobiology and treatment of bipolar disorder. == Education == Eduard Vieta was born in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain).

G. \\"Dattatray Gundo\\" Kulkarni (1921‚Äì1992), known as Dizi, was an Indian painter, cartoonist and sculptor. Considered \\"one of the most interesting Modernist artists in India\\", he remained independent throughout his career apart from brief affiliations with the Progressive Artists‚Äô Group and the Bombay Group. As a student at the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art and in the early years of his career, D. G. worked as a part-time illustrator and cartoonist to support his passion for painting. It was at this time that he acquired the sobriquet Dizi. \\"I stand in the centre of life and surrender without losing myself.\\" - Dizi Dizi's versatility as an artist is reflected in the three distinct media he explored - drawings, paintings and sculpture. His work reflects an honesty of expression rather than a desire for external approval. His closest friends and contemporaries in the art world, V. S. Gaitonde and S. B. Palsikar, shared this philosophy that their artistic integrity must never be compromised. Dizi received the Lalit Kala Akademi Award in 1967 and the Maharashtra Gaurav Puraskar in 1990. ==Style== Nina Rege, Assistant Director, Nehru Centre Art Gallery, states: \\"Dizi was not only a master painter, but also a master sculptor, caricaturist and a poet. Generally, an artist becomes famous because of his style. But when his style and his personality mirror each other, he is a different artist altogether, Dizi was one such artist. He was different. A contemporary of the Progressive group of artists. Yet he was a rebel with his own independent style.\\" Jehangir Sabavala reminisced: \\"It wasn‚Äôt as an illustrator or as a cartoonist that he ever came into his own. Unquestionably, his inclination was towards a more serious aspect of art, which, obviously in his case, first led him to painting. In his earlier days, the palette was bright, more colourful, gayer, lighter, which he eschewed as he grew into a more mature man and painter. He left it behind in favour of a more sombre representation where, I think, the lighter, more lyrical colour was put aside and he went into deeper and more restricted tones. Also, mass, form and volume became very important to him. He simplified the paintings and they became, in a way, monumental. The legacy left behind is of one who worked seriously and for the purpose of the work itself and did not worry whether he should sell or be famous or these other tawdry aspects of the profession.\\" Artist Prabhakar Kolte observes: \\"You cannot read his paintings as you would a contemporary artist‚Äôs. You have to make a concerted effort to read them by forgetting your own language and script since you have to understand the graphic mood of his lines which were not meant to be tools of expression but ends in themselves.\\" Professor V. M. Sholapurkar, Founder Dean of CAVA (Chamarajendra Academy Of Visual Arts) comments: \\"Viewing Dizi‚Äôs paintings bestows an illuminating glimpse of the world he chose to inhabit. His work may not be acceptable to all but it is an authentic documentation of what the art world considers a vigorous, sensitive, independent and iconoclastic mind. If one were to see Dizi‚Äôs works, untitled and unsigned, it would be difficult to tell that they were all by the same artist. His ceaseless quest for new forms and style; constant experimentation; lack of stereotypes; perfection in drawing and composition and an instinctive understanding of colours stamp him as an enduring and fascinating master artist.\\" Art historian and former Honorary Director of the National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai, Dr. Saryu Doshi concludes: \\"The life and works of Dizi provide insightful glimpses into the art scene of his times and serve as a valuable documentation of uncharted areas in Mumbai‚Äôs art history.\\" ==Early life== Dizi was born in Shedbal village, Karnataka in 1921 to a family of impoverished landowners. He was a lonely child who exhibited a raw intensity and eagerness to learn and create. A teacher in the village school recognized his potential and invited him to share his library. Words and images became poems in the child's mind and the pen that inked the poems gradually began to transform words into lines drawn from his visual memory that were his to move and compose at will. ==CareerMumbai, 1939-1971=== A Cartoonist‚Äôs Wit, An Artist‚Äôs Sensitivity Dizi came to Mumbai in 1939 and began his studies in drawing and painting at the Sir J. J. School of Art. As he absorbed the cadence of life in the city, he was engulfed by the surging tide of nationalism and participated in the Quit India movement in 1942. His patriotic fervour earned him a prison sentence, serious injuries and a lifelong limp. On his release, he returned to his studies and completed his diploma. Poverty did not concern him; his wealth was in the hours spent painting and with kindred spirits K. H. Ara, V. S. Gaitonde, M. F. Husain, S. B. Palsikar, S. H. Raza and F. N. Souza. \\"During this unsettled and self-supporting student‚Äôs life, I let myself flow with the country‚Äôs social and political current. I came across men, and political apes alike, who drove me to find my own values. These encounters made me realize that creativity, expressed through art, is more dynamic and satisfying than any social, political or individual existence. Life is exciting, exhilarating, intoxicating, but with its full measure of pain.\\" - Dizi In 1951, Dizi married Alaka. An artist herself - a sitarist - she understood with sensitivity that the man and the artist in Dizi were two distinct, yet inseparable entities. Together, Alaka and Dizi traveled through the villages and towns of India, studying ancient cave and temple sculptures and contemplating the folklore of generations. The landscapes Dizi traversed and the traditions he encountered were his inspiration. His sketchbook was an extension of himself and the impressions he drew were extensions of his imagination, stroked with confidence and conviction. \\"My journey is a kaleidoscope of verdant foliage, sunbaked earth tones, the crimson, saffron and indigo swirl of turban, loincloth and sari. The rippling contours and primal energy of horses and cattle - fleeting, yet powerful impressions, a subconscious harvest.\\" - Dizi His work affirms the freedom of expression that was his birthright; his drawings and cartoons mirror the moments and experiences he made his own. The Labyrinth Of Colours While cartoons provided income and sustenance, Dizi yearned to transcend pure drawing and explore the realm of colour. His early paintings of faces and figures were experiments in proportion, characterized by a strong cursive line and spontaneous brushwork. Portrayed in ochre, green and rust, enlivened by white and a generous measure of red they feature almond-shaped eyes below a straight brow, elongated fingers and feet. Richard R. Brettell's essay on ‚ÄòRest‚Äô (1945) in the Robert Lehman Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, states: \\"Although the picture is firmly rooted in the tradition of Indian painting in the vibrancy of its palette and the exaggeration of the eyes of the figures as repositories of special significance, elements of the composition also reflect DIZI‚Äôs professional training as a modern artist in what was then the leading professional art school in India‚Äôs largest city. The fluid lines, interpenetrating forms, and studied informality of the image suggest that he was familiar with the work of such Western Modernists as Picasso, Matisse and Dufy.\\" The primitive yielded to the sentimental and refined. ‚ÄòSitar Player‚Äô, a portrait of Alaka reflects the miniature tradition as does another work titled ‚ÄòPrayer‚Äô. These paintings are composed with delicate precision in the Indian decorative style. They represent Dizi's investigation into the relationship between color and line, giving him an intuitive feeling for space and form and an instinctive sense of the use and application of appropriate colour pigments. The momentum of executing these newly discovered concepts was broken by an acute shortage of funds. Despite this bitter reality, Dizi could neither bring himself to succumb to a complacent, static aesthetic for the sake of patronage nor surrender the free- flowing stream of creative growth that was his sole possession. In these desperate times, Emily Meeker, an American art enthusiast residing in Mumbai, introduced Dizi's work to Mumbai's expatriate community and asked if he would consent to teach her and a group of her friends to paint. An art class was organized at the Meeker residence, offering Dizi a measure of economic respite. Experiment To Conviction \\"I don‚Äôt follow any school... consciously reject mannerisms, and I take almost all the pictorial values from Indian masters and Western artists.\\" - Dizi, 1959 Dizi belonged to a new generation of artists who sought to express themselves in a modern initiative that knew no inhibitions. They broke free of the traditions imposed by academicism and innovated while continuing to respect the aesthetic grace of Indian art forms and the richness of myth. C√©zanne, Dubuffet, Kandinsky, Klee, Matisse, Picabia and Picasso inspired their quest for a contemporary approach to visual interpretation and expression. The solitude Dizi had deliberately imposed on himself since childhood had nurtured an understanding of the human predicament. His source of inspiration was his inner universe, the mind space between the curtain and backdrop of life's theatre. \\"Emotions are transitory. I try to capture the sensation of an ecstatic moment on the canvas I am working on but this is a futile exercise. The dark landscapes of my childhood impose themselves on my palette and I paint grotesque, disproportionate figures on multi-dimensional planes, abstract reflections of a troubled past. I pause, lay down my brush and write to expel the turmoil that prevents me from painting what I had intended to. It takes a concerted effort and Alaka‚Äôs unstinting support to bring myself back to brighter hues and a serenity of spirit that prompts me to create a series of translucent watercolors. Even as I work on these, my mind is journeying beyond.\\" - Dizi Symbolism and Significance When Alaka and Dizi married, they decided they would not have a child as their lives were too unconventional to accept this responsibility. Perhaps it was this that prompted Dizi to muse: \\"I find myself exploring adolescence, sensuality, womanhood, the concept of mother and child, of burgeoning life. I paint symbols of fertility with a need that borders on desperation. It is almost as though I anticipate and experience fatherhood through the layers of pigment that bring the images born of primeval desire in my mind to life.\\" In this quest for perpetuity, he found himself reaching out to the familiar reassurance of myth and philosophy and painted a series projecting the origins of life and symbols of the mystic Indian inheritance. The cartoonist in Dizi enabled him to infuse dramatic and literary content into his paintings. The Clown Series, exhibited in 1963, envisioned a world of fantasy and caprice in which myth and illusion are interspersed with harsh, inescapable reality. The theme of these paintings mutates subtly and imperceptibly between the whimsical antics of the circus ring and the mysterious and magical impact of symbols. Embarking on this creative adventure, Dizi painted in tumultuous colours. \\"The clowns parade on the screen of my mind. Their spontaneous, merry capers momentarily dispel the barren emptiness of disappointment and the anguish of experience. Masked and garbed in blithe dots, lines and patches they simulate the pattern and parody of human existence.\\" - Dizi Art critic Dr. Charles Louis Fabri's review of the exhibition stated: \\"D. G. Kulkarni‚Äôs talent is too obvious to be missed. He is interesting, original... a fine draughtsman who refuses to give up representation for abstraction. The clown is shown in many shapes and his motley dress forms the justification for the many colours.\\" Influenced by Paul Klee's work and thoughts on art, an element of surreal fantasy and a focus on the concept of metamorphosis evolved in Dizi's work in the wake of the clown theme. \\"Klee‚Äôs words resonate as my brush caresses canvas. I mix and manipulate paint to lure powerful images from invisible realms of mystic introspection. Pigments are intensified and muted to evoke emotions from subliminal depths, illustrate evolution, expose nature‚Äôs stark reality and uninhibitedly bare its lyrical and gruesome aspects in a spectrum of vivid, glowing colors. I feel I have transcended the barriers of attitude and approach in this work that is symbolic evidence of my inner growth.\\" - Dizi Man and Woman - The Eternal Theme The vibrant energy invoked by this progression led Dizi to explore the enigmatic relationship between man and woman; the aspects of sexuality, love, tenderness, violence, ambiguity, celebration and spirituality that are the core of this equation. These works are painted with passionate brushstrokes, tempered by the palette knife, the colours applied with a wantonly urgent abandon, generating solid, dynamic figures bound by a quantum of emotional tension that is palpable and compelling. Life urged Dizi to reinvent himself, to equate joyous triumphs and despairing frustrations, to define uncharted paths of visual exploration and discovery while adhering stubbornly and determinedly to his beliefs and convictions. ===Belagavi, Karnataka 1971-1977=== Philosopher and Individualist In 1971, Dizi and Alaka returned to their roots in rural Karnataka, moving from Mumbai to live on a farm in the Belagavi district. Here, Dizi rediscovered nature and the palette of his youth, but the man he had become chose to strip away the bright, vibrant colors that had appealed to him until now. His brush mixed deeper and more restricted tones and his compositions became more complex. The Dizi of this period was a different person. As the monsoon rain washed away the parched red dust, obscuring the brown, green and blue of earth, tree and sky, he chose to see only the various shades of grey engendered by cloud shadows. In 1974, deliberately avoiding even a vestige of colour, he created the Grey Series, restricting himself to painting pure form in grey, white and black. Professor V. M. Sholapurkar comments: \\"Dizi let his imagination wander at will in a monochromatic world of plants, insects, birds and nascent beings in which subconscious imagery emerged from conscious observation. He painted phallic symbols, eggs and embryos with a bold confidence. These sombre paintings exhibit a sophisticated, restrained elegance. Bird Whistle features delicately stroked diagonals balanced by an aerodynamic horizontal; assorted symbols cluster amid dark masses in Dampness and Abode of Butterflies depicts the fragility of life struggling with the elements.\\" In this undulating terrain of natural forms and shapes, Dizi felt the need to leave behind the colour pigments he had ground, mixed and applied to paper and canvas and to experience the character of stone by sculpting it into the archetypal images he visualized emerging from the landscape before him. Sculpture offered him a means of penetrating life's core to produce simple yet powerful forms and his creative energy began to transform ethereal line into substantive sculpture as he probed stone with his chisel, urging and cajoling it to yield its secrets. \\"It is the three- dimensional effect of the sculpture and the raw feel of the medium that is thrilling. The colour in paintings is illusory. In sculpture there is more reality. Above all, I love the challenge in the toughness, the roughness, the pure texture of stone.\\" - Dizi Professor V. M. Sholapurkar writes: \\"We do not know what primordial instincts brought Dizi finally to stone for the culmination of his vision... his superb linear drawings contain subconscious suggestions of the voluptuousness of form that could only find fulfilment in stone of varied hues and tactile possibilities.\\" Noted art critic Dnyaneshwar Nadkarni remarked: \\"Translating his ideas into stone the artist gives them an inevitability of form and substance. Dizi‚Äôs carving technique has many definitions and expertise. The contours, the placement of motifs, the total shape - everything is so appropriate... the general sweep of the bigger works... the blending of grace and weight.\\" ===Mumbai, 1977-1992=== An Artist‚Äôs Legacy \\"We have all chosen a journey that, while fraught with uncertainty, gives our creative nature the courage to endure in the promise of inner fulfilment.\\" - Dizi Line and form continued to fascinate Dizi as he strove for deeper levels of interpretation. He reflected on mass, form and volume, the interpenetration of lines and shapes. Colors awakened in his mind, urging rediscovery after his pilgrimage in grey and his palette began to respond to their insistent call. The later compositions he painted were more thoughtful and assured. Forms and colors adjust themselves in these works, emerging, overlapping, disappearing. Dizi's journey as an artist began with the inexpressible thrill of discovering the magical intrigue of line as pen and ink brought it indelibly alive. As he turned seventy, the artist in him reverted to the cartoonist in a moment of nostalgia creating the Sentimental Portraits of his friends and fellow artists. The portraits depict Husain striding barefoot on a city road with his canvases; Souza painting buxom nudes; Hebbar sketching to capture an instant of inspiration; Gaitonde seated, lost in contemplative reflection; Palsikar, garbed in sacred thread and red silk dhoti, engaging in ritual and Ara posing with a child. Art critic Niyatee Shinde observed: \\"As is typical of his nature, his modesty and witty temperament, he has on display portraits of his contemporaries like F. N. Souza, Gaitonde etc. What one finds more than amusing is the dexterity with which he has captured the subtle distinctions that ideally characterize these fellow-painters. These unpretentious images from his witty world open up a playful world that also interestingly revives the nostalgic. Simple fluid lines and an equally unencumbered palette make for pleasing visuals.\\", Artist Suhas Bahulkar recounts: \\"He struggled throughout his life to live as an artist. As his life progressed, the fragile yet resolute finesse of his initial line drawings was translated into powerful colour schemes on canvas. These, in time, were to be replaced by the stones he would carve into equally massive forms chiselled to perfection with intricate, decorative lines to make his artistry come full circle.\\" Dizi always remained true to the values he had imposed on himself and expressed his true self when he painted. His creativity was never restrained or curbed by external incentives. \\"I know the ropes but never handled them, never wanted to. I found the strings but never pulled them. It is mechanical. But I found the line, the thrilling line and I followed the adventure. I found myself and my peace. In the melody of lines I swim. To the rhythm of line I dance the cosmic dance.\\" - Dizi Dizi died in Mumbai on 16 November 1992. ==Awards== 1956 Bombay State Award, Mumbai 1967 Lalit Kala Akademi Award, New Delhi 1972 Maharashtra State Award, Mumbai 1990 Maharashtra Gaurav Puraskar, Mumbai ==Selected Solo and Group Exhibitions== 1946 Group Exhibition, Bombay Art Society, Mumbai 1948 Solo Exhibition, Mumbai 1950 Solo Exhibition, Mumbai 1958 Group Exhibition, Bombay Art Society, Mumbai 1959 Solo Exhibition, Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai 1961 Solo Exhibition, Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai 1963 Solo Exhibition, Clown Series, Roopa Art Gallery, Mumbai 1964 AIFACS, New Delhi 1965 Taj Art Gallery, Mumbai 1966 Academy of Fine Arts, Kolkata 1976 Solo Exhibition, Grey Series, Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai 1978 Solo Exhibition, Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai 1981 Solo Exhibition, Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai 1983 Solo Exhibition, Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai 1985 Solo Exhibition, Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai 1987 Solo Exhibition, Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai 1991 Solo Exhibition, Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai ==Retrospective Exhibitions== 1993 Memorial Exhibition, Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai 2000 Millennium Show ‚ÄòA Century of Art from Maharashtra‚Äô, Nehru Centre, Mumbai 2001 Nehru Centre Pays Tribute to D.

The elections were held simultaneously with local elections all throughout Spain, as well as the 1987 European Parliament election. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) remained the largest party overall, as well as in most regional parliaments. However, it suffered from a drop in popular support which saw it losing many of the absolute majorities it had obtained four years previously. As a result, several centre-right coalitions and alliances were able to oust the Socialists from government in four out of the twelve regional administrations it had held previous to the election. The main national opposition party, the People's Alliance (AP), having suffered from an internal crisis and the breakup of the People's Coalition in 1986, also lost support compared to the previous election. Its former allies, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the Liberal Party (PL), stood separately in the regional elections but remained unable to capitalize on AP's losses. Benefitting from the two main parties's fall was former Spanish Prime Minister Adolfo Su√°rez's Democratic and Social Centre (CDS), which became decisive for government formation in many regional assemblies. United Left (IU), a coalition made up by the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and other minor left-wing groups, remained stagnant at the PCE's 1983 results. ==Election date== Determination of election day varied depending on the autonomous community, with each one having competency to establish its own regulations. Typically, thirteen out of the seventeen autonomous communities‚Äîall but Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia‚Äîhad their elections fixed to be held within sixty days from the day of expiry of the regional assemblies, together with nationwide local elections. ==Regional governments== The following table lists party control in autonomous communities.

As of 2015, the state has not passed renewable portfolio standard legislation and there were no commercial-scale wind turbines. Kentucky may benefit from the development of wind power in Tennessee, an adjoining state with which it is collaborating, and from efforts by the Tennessee Valley Authority to both develop and import wind-generated electricity into the region. ==Kentucky New Energy Ventures== Established in 2008, the Kentucky New Energy Ventures, was a state program to incentivize the development and commercialization of alternative fuel and renewable energy products, processes, and services. The program concluded in 2017 and has not been renewed by State. The funds could be used to stimulate private investment in Kentucky-based technology companies with high growth potential. KNEV made seed capital grants of $30,000 and investments ranging from $250,000 to $750,000+.http://migration.kentucky.gov/newsroom/governor/20080312energy.htmhttp://startups.kstc.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/06/KNEV-Guidelines.pdf ==Mason County== In 2012 Mason County passed an ordinance which would prohibit the construction of large- scale wind farms. except in previously-designated industrial zones, but would permit mid to small scale turbines for use at a principal site, but not for sending the energy across electric transmission lines. Efforts by Duke Energy and NextEra Energy to develop a wind farm at Mays Lick were discontinued. ==Tennessee Valley Authority== The Tennessee Valley Authority service area covers most of Tennessee (TN), portions of Alabama (AL), Mississippi (MI), and Kentucky (KY), and small sections of Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. As of 2013, the agency, in addition to the Buffalo Mountain Windfarm (TN) had purchased agreements from power generated from wind farms outside its service area: *2012 - Enel Green Power, LLC - 201MW - Caney River Wind Farm, Elk County, Kansas. *2012- Invenergy - 200MW - Bishop Hill Wind Energy Center, Henry County, Illinois *2012- Invenergy - 200MW - California Ridge Wind Energy Center in Champaign County, Illinois *2012- NextEra Energy Resources - 150MW - White Oak Energy Center, McLean County, Illinois *2012- NextEra Energy Resources- 165MW - Cimarron Wind farm, Gray County, Kansas A 2010 agreement with Iberdrola Renewables provides a potential 300MW future supply from Streator-Cayuga Ridge Wind Farm, Livingston County, Illinois Clean Line Energy LLC is proposing 700-mile power transmission line to bring wind energy from Oklahoma and to the Tennessee Valley. The TVA would import 1,750 megawatts, about half of the power that could be transmitted.

It's a non-government school and is not connected to Mandaue City College located at Mandaue City Cultural and Sports Complex. Despite a number of controversies surrounding its legitimacy and regulation, as well as the denial of recognition from the Commission on Higher Education, MCC under Paulus Ca√±ete still continues to operate. ==Disputes and controversies== Mandaue City College located in Barangay Basak is the Old MCC originally established in Barangay Tipolo duly created through an Ordinance No. 10-2005-324A co-authored by then Councilor Jonas C.

Its president is Dr. Paulus Mariae L. Ca√±ete. However, on four orders by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), then Mandaue City Mayor Jonas Cortes said the legitimate city college is the new Mandaue City College (MCC) established in 2007 through Dr. Susana Cabahug at the Mandaue City Cultural Sports Complex and not the old one in Tipolo, which is still operated by Dr. Ca√±ete. The orders, all dated Sept. 14, 2010, specified the city college‚Äôs location and that CHED no longer recognizes the old city college. Ca√±ete, on the other hand, said the City Government should have file a petition in court nullifying City Ordinance 419 if it is to remove the legitimacy of the Old MCC. He further claimed that the ordinance, passed in 2007, is the legal basis for the Old MCC‚Äôs operations. In May 2008, police arrested the Old MCC president Dr. Ca√±ete and five companions in front of the church steps in Barangay Basak, Mandaue. Ca√±ete was charged with illegal possession of a .38-caliber revolver as he allegedly was about to hand over the firearm to a man the school official hired to steal documents from (new) Mandaue City College (MCC).
