It followed a proposal made to the Swedish authorities by McKinsey & Co and based on better practices from the US banking crises of the 1980s (e.g., Savings & Loan, Resolution Trust Company and Mellon Bank). Many of the debts were owed by real-estate companies and it became a goal for Securum to stabilize the property market. The company was established when Anne Wibble was Finance Minister and Per Westerberg was Minister for Business and Industry in the Government of Carl Bildt. The company took over a quarter of the bank's credit portfolio, comprising 3000 credits with 1274 companies (of which 790 were listed companies, the biggest of which was Nobel Industries to the value of 24 billion Swedish kronor). Securum had a share capital of 24 billion kronor from the Swedish state as well as 27 billion in credits. That would be enough to get through the crisis during a period of 10 to 15 years. Securum's design was quite particular and followed proven success factors for a \\"bad bank\\": speed and independence to isolate the problem exposures, while simultaneously protecting capital and liquidity of the surviving \\"good bank\\" and its operations. In addition, The company management were given free hands. A large number of the credits were unwound by the summer of 1994. Five flotations were executed: Nobelpharma – today Nobel Biocare – Servisair and three property companies: Castellum AB, Norrporten as well as Pandox. By the summer of 1997, Securum itself could be wound down. == See also == *Bad bank *Swedish banking rescue == References == * Clas Bergström, Peter Englund, Per Thorell, Securum.

The main ranch house was moved from Growler Mine to Bates Well in 1942, re-used in traditional frontier and Gray family practice. Probably originating as a miners' cabin, the northern portion was presumably added after its relocation at Bates Well. The original well may have been dug by W.B. Bates about 1870, with a later well dug by Reuben Daniels circa 1913. An arrastra, a simple ore-milling operation, existed in the early 20th century. The property was developed by Robert Louis Gray's son, Henry from 1935 on. Henry lived there until his death in 1976. The Bates Well property represents a very complete and intact example of the frontier ranching pattern in Arizona typical of the Sonoran Desert during the first third of the twentieth century.

However, Lada Togliatti and Dinamo Makhachkala were denied licences for the First Division and thus also relegated. This, alongside the bankruptcy of Angusht Nazran, pushed Metallurg up alongside other second-place finishers SKA Rostov-na-Donu and Mordovia Saransk. In 2012/13 season, playing as FC Metallurg-Kuzbass Novokuznetsk in the second level (Russian National Football League), it dropped out of the competition due to financial difficulties. It won its zone in the Amateur Football League in the 2013/14 season and advanced to the third-tier Russian Professional Football League for the 2014/15 season. It also was renamed back to FC Metallurg for that season. Before the 2015/16 season it was renamed once more, to FC Novokuznetsk. During the winter break of the 2015/16 season, it dropped out of the PFL and moved to the amateur competitions due to lack of financing. ==League results== ImageSize = width:600 height:60 PlotArea = left:10 right:10 bottom:30 top:10 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1991 till:01/07/2013 ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:1992 Colors = id:bl1 value:rgb(0.5,0.8,0.5) id:bl2 value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.3) id:rs value:rgb(0.8,0.6,0.6) id:rn value:rgb(0.9,0.1,0.1) PlotData= bar:Position width:15 color:white align:center from:01/07/1991 till:01/07/1992 shift:(0,-4) text:9 from:01/07/1992 till:01/07/1993 shift:(0,-4) text:11 from:01/07/1993 till:01/07/1994 shift:(0,-4) text:7 from:01/07/1994 till:01/07/1995 shift:(0,-4) text:4 from:01/07/1995 till:01/07/1996 shift:(0,-4) text:4 from:01/07/1996 till:01/07/1997 shift:(0,-4) text:13 from:01/07/1997 till:01/07/1998 shift:(0,-4) text:1 from:01/07/1998 till:01/07/1999 shift:(0,-4) text:1 from:01/07/1999 till:01/07/2000 shift:(0,-4) text:1 from:01/07/2000 till:01/07/2001 shift:(0,-4) text:2 from:01/07/2001 till:01/07/2002 shift:(0,-4) text:1 from:01/07/2002 till:01/07/2003 shift:(0,-4) text:13 from:01/07/2003 till:01/07/2004 shift:(0,-4) text:16 from:01/07/2004 till:01/07/2005 shift:(0,-4) text:18 from:01/07/2005 till:01/07/2006 shift:(0,-4) text:2 from:01/07/2006 till:01/07/2007 shift:(0,-4) text:16 from:01/07/2007 till:01/07/2008 shift:(0,-4) text:16 from:01/07/2008 till:01/07/2009 shift:(0,-4) text:4 from:01/07/2009 till:01/07/2010 shift:(0,-4) text:6 from:01/07/2010 till:01/07/2012 shift:(0,-4) text:1 from:01/07/2012 till:01/07/2013 shift:(0,-4) text:15 from:01/07/1991 till:01/07/1993 color:bl2 shift:(0,13) text: \\"D1(zone East)\\" from:01/07/1993 till:01/07/2002 color:rs shift:(0,13) text: \\"D2(zone East)\\" from:01/07/2002 till:01/07/2005 color:bl2 shift:(0,13) text: \\"D1\\" from:01/07/2005 till:01/07/2006 color:rs shift:(0,13) text: \\"D2\\" from:01/07/2006 till:01/07/2008 color:bl2 shift:(0,13) text: \\"D1\\" from:01/07/2008 till:01/07/2012 color:rs shift:(0,13) text: \\"D2\\" from:01/07/2012 till:01/07/2013 color:bl2 shift:(0,13) text: \\"D1\\" ==Team colours== MKN's home kit features green shirts, white shorts and green socks. ==External links== * Official site ==References== Novokuznetsk Category:Sport in Novokuznetsk Category:Association football clubs established in 1946 Category:1946 establishments in Russia ","title":"FC Novokuznetsk"},{"id":"20409856","text":"Zhirkov (, from жир meaning fat) is a Russian masculine surname, its feminine counterpart is Zhirkova.

The mortar was produced from 1939 until the end of 1941. == Description == The weapon is a dual-purpose device in that it can also be used as a spade. When a leg is removed from the handle, the spade part of the weapon locks into position as a base plate for the mortar. The weapon was apparently intended to serve as a fire support weapon for every infantryman as it was designed to be operated by one man. There was no aiming device and the soldier simply pointed the mortar at its target. The soldier carried 15 rounds of ammunition on a fabric belt for the mortar. The German Army designated the weapon the 3.7 cm Spatengranatwerfer 161(r), although the true Soviet designation was simply \\"37mm mortar\\" (). It is likely that the weapon was an attempt to boost the firepower of Soviet rifle units. Although a rifle grenade-launcher (which the Red Army also had) can fire shells of similar weight, they are slower to load and cannot serve as rifles while firing grenades. The spade mortar was used during the Winter War with Finland, where the weapon was found ineffective in the heavy snow. Initially used on the Eastern Front in World War II, the spade mortar fell into disuse after 1942. During the Iran–Iraq War, the Iranian Army developed a similar device, the 37mm marsh mortar, for use on marshy ground, as 37mm was the maximum shell size for which recoil did not drive the mortar into the soft ground.

It promotes equality of opportunity for all, giving every individual the chance to achieve their potential, free from prejudice and discrimination. UK legislation requires public authorities to promote equality in everything that they do, also making sure that other organisations meet their legal duties to promote equality while also doing so themselves. In the UK under the Equality Act 2010 there are certain legal requirements under existing legislation to promote equality in the areas of nine protected characteristics. These are often collectively referred to as the general duties to promote equality. As the independent advocate for equality and human rights in Britain, a Commission of Equality and Human Rights (EHRC) exists that aims to reduce inequality, eliminate discrimination, strengthen good relations between people and promote and protect human rights. EHRC has a duty to challenge prejudice and disadvantage and promote the importance of human rights, enforcing equality laws on age, disability, gender, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief and sexual orientation and encourage compliance with the Human Rights Act. ==Requirements and duties== The requirements to eliminate unlawful sex discrimination and harassment also include discrimination and harassment on the basis of gender reassignment. It follows that: ==Equality and discrimination== ;Age It is unlawful for age to be the cause of less favourable treatment in a workplace or in vocational training, unless there is an objective justification for doing so. Where this is referred to, it refers to a person belonging to a particular age (e.g. 32 year olds) or range of ages (e.g. 18 - 30 year olds). ;Disability If one has a physical or mental impairment, that person has specific rights that protect them against discrimination. Employers and service providers are obliged to make relevant adjustments. Under certain circumstances this protection also extends to their carers A person has a disability if s/he has a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on that person's ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. ;Gender reassignment The process of transitioning from one gender to another. ;Marriage and civil partnership Marriage is defined as a 'union between a man and a woman'. Same-sex couples can have their relationships legally recognised as 'civil partnerships'. Civil partners must be treated the same as married couples on a wide range of legal matters. ;Pregnancy and maternity Pregnancy is the condition of being pregnant or expecting a baby. Maternity refers to the period after the birth, and is linked to maternity leave in the employment context. In the non-work context, protection against maternity discrimination is for 26 weeks after giving birth, and this includes treating a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. ;Race Refers to the protected characteristic of Race. It refers to a group of people defined by their race, colour, and nationality (including citizenship) ethnic or national origins. Wherever one was born, wherever their parents came from, whatever the colour of their skin, they have a right to be treated fairly and be protected against racial discrimination and prejudice.'' ;Religion and belief Religion has the meaning usually given to it but belief includes religious and philosophical beliefs including lack of belief (e.g. Atheism). Generally, a belief should affect your life choices or the way you live for it to be included in the definition. Religion or belief should not interfere with anybody’s right to be treated fairly at work, at school, in shops or while accessing public services such as health care and housing. ;Sex Whether a person's sexual attraction is towards their own sex, the opposite sex or to both sexes. Whether one is straight, gay, lesbian or bisexual should not put them at a disadvantage. The law protects the citizen against discrimination in the workplace, including harassment, on grounds of sexual orientation. You can see a more in-depth definition of these protected characteristics on the Office of Public Sector Information website. ==See also== *British labour law *Gender equality *Gender inequality *Disability *Equal pay for women *Mental Health *Human Rights *Antiracism *Antisemitism *Political correctness *Multiculturalism ==References== *Acts of the UK Parliament (with explanatory notes) – website includes the following viewable documents: **Equality Act 2010 **Equality Act 2006 **Equal Pay Act 1970 **Sex Discrimination Act 1975 **Race Relations Act 1976 and Amendment 2000 **The Race Relations Act 1976 (Amendment) Regulations 2003 **Disability Discrimination Act 1995 **Employment Act 2002 **Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 **Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 **Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003 *Race Relations Act 1976 (c. 74) (UK Statute Law Database, Ministry of Justice, 1976) *Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 (Office of Public Sector Information, 30 November 2000) *Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, the Equality Framework Directive 2000 (text in all EU languages) *New European Framework Equal Treatment Directive examined (2001) ==External links== *Equality and Human Rights Commission - The EHRC brings together the work of the three provision Commissions, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE), Disability Rights Commission (DRC) and Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) *Health Information Plus Website - Quality assured health information for patients, carers and the public with evaluated information sources including: NHS Scotland, BBC Health, and published healthcare research. *The Picker Institute Europe - undertakes a combination of research, development and policy activity within the healthcare sector. *Stonewall - campaigns on behalf of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender community in the UK.

He also got his habilitation degree in Münster and gained a professorship for inorganic chemistry in 1958. In 1965, Hoppe accepted an offer for the chair of inorganic and analytic chemistry at the Justus-Liebig- University of Gießen, which he kept until his retirement in 1991. ==Scientific researchIn Münster=== Hoppe became famous through his synthesis of the stable noble gas compound XeF2 (xenon difluoride), reported in November 1962. His work followed the previous synthesis of by xenon hexafluoroplatinate by Neil Bartlett, in an experiment run on March 23, 1962 and reported in June of that year.http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&node;_id=925&content;_id=CTP_004436&use;_sec=true&sec;_url_var=region1&__uuid=27dbf5b2-88d3-48f2-8e72-59f4e851b568 Until then, everyone had assumed that compounds of such kind would not exist, the reason being, first, unsuccessful experiments attempting to synthesize such noble gas compounds and, second, the concept of the \\"closed octet of electrons\\", according to which noble gases would not participate in chemical reactions. Through the properties of the interhalogen compounds it had become obvious that noble gas fluorides were the only accessible ones. Since 1949/50, a research group in Münster had carried out in-depth discussions on the possibility of the formation and the properties of xenon fluorides. This research group was convinced, already in 1951, that XeF4 and XeF2 should be thermodynamically stable against the decomposition into the elements. For a long time it was planned to occasionally perform synthetic experiments targeted at the xenon fluorides. Technical and conceptional difficulties, however, interfered in Münster. On the one hand, xenon was not accessible in sufficient purity; on the other hand, the researchers believed that only pressure syntheses would be successful, for which steel bottles with compressed F2 were needed. Since 1961, those F2-pressure cylinders had been promised by American friends but the transfer could not take place until 1963 because the valves of non-standard U.S. pressure cylinders were not allowed in Germany and vice versa. Nevertheless, Hoppe’s research group was able to generate XeF2 in the form of transparent crystals in early 1962. To do so, they let electric sparks impact on xenon-fluorine mixtures. Neil Bartlett tried a similar experiment for the first time in the USA on August 2, 1962. After a few days, he gained xenon tetrafluoride, XeF4. ===In Gießen=== In Gießen, Hoppe continued his extensive research in the field of solid state chemistry with a focus on the synthesis and characterization of oxo- and fluorometalates of the alkali metals. During his research he published over 650 articles in international and national peer-review journals. In addition, he had been the scientific editor for the German Journal of Inorganic and General Chemistry (Zeitschrift für Anorganische und Allgemeine Chemie). ==Teachings== As a professor, Prof. Hoppe taught many young students the fundamentals of chemistry and other more specific topics. In addition, 114 doctoral candidates earned their Ph.D. with Hoppe as their supervisor. ==Other activities== Hoppe was a great pet lover and was known to be a supporter of zoological gardens.

For Oasis, bearing witness is a decisive notion in interfaith dialogue when understood as an adequate means to access the truth. Oasis is based in Venice and was presented to UNESCO in Paris (2005) and the United Nations (2007).

He made a name for himself at Leixões before transferring to Porto in 2009, being a backup during his spell. After one season in Romania with CFR Cluj he joined Sevilla in January 2013, going on appear in 89 competitive matches and win two Europa League trophies. Beto earned 16 caps for Portugal, being part of the squads in three World Cups and Euro 2012. ==Club careerSporting and Leixões=== Braga in 2012 Beto was born in Loures, Grande Lisboa. After unsuccessfully developing in local Sporting CP's youth system, he played one season on loan to neighbours Casa Pia AC, being released in June 2004. After one year each with G.D. Chaves and F.C. Marco, both in the second division, Beto joined Leixões S.C. for the 2006–07 campaign, helping the Matosinhos club return to the Primeira Liga and only missing a combined seven matches in his three seasons. ===Porto=== In March 2009, before 2008–09 ended, Beto agreed to a move to FC Porto, in a four-year deal worth €750.000 effective as of June. During his two-season spell he acted almost exclusively as backup to Brazilian Helton, being mostly restricted to Taça de Portugal appearances; on 22 May 2011, with the score at 2–2, he stopped a penalty kick in the domestic cup final, with his team eventually winning 6–2 in the Portuguese capital. ===Braga and Sevilla=== For 2011–12, Beto was loaned to Romanian side CFR Cluj, only missing seven Liga I games during the season for the eventual champions. Released by Porto he returned to his country in the following summer, signing for two years with S.C. Braga; however, late into the following transfer window, he moved to Sevilla FC as the Spaniards were looking to strengthen the position following the departure of Diego López to Real Madrid – the loan was arranged until June, with the possibility of a permanent transfer afterwards. Profiting from injury to Andrés Palop, Beto made his debut with the Andalusians one day after arriving, starting in a 1–2 away loss against Atlético Madrid in the first leg of the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, with his team playing the last eight minutes with only nine players. His first La Liga match came on 3 February 2013, in a 2–1 home win over Rayo Vallecano. Beto being consoled by Lionel Messi after the UEFA Super Cup loss to Barcelona Beto was subsequently signed on a permanent basis, being first choice for head coach Unai Emery. He contributed with 43 appearances all competitions comprised in the 2013–14 campaign, including ten in the team's victorious run in the UEFA Europa League, where he saved two penalties from Óscar Cardozo and Rodrigo in the final's shootout against S.L. Benfica. Beto spent several months of 2014–15 on the sidelines, due to injury: first, a shoulder dislocation after a collision with Real Madrid's Karim Benzema, followed by an ailment to his left leg. After finishing the season as backup to Sergio Rico, he was reinstated by Emery for the 2015 UEFA Super Cup, performing well overall but conceding five goals in the 4–5 loss to FC Barcelona. Following the emergence of David Soria also from the club's youth system, Beto was demoted to third-choice. ===Return to Sporting=== On 6 August 2016, free agent Beto signed a two-year contract with former team Sporting. He made his debut in competitive games for his first club on 13 October 2016, at the age of 34 years and five months, keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 away win against F.C. Famalicão in the Portuguese Cup; he dedicated the performance to his late father. ===Göztepe=== On 29 July 2017, shortly after having expressed a desire to leave Sporting in order to have a better chance of 2018 FIFA World Cup selection, Beto joined Göztepe S.K. from Turkey for an undisclosed fee. After 95 official games, he left at the end of his contract in August 2020. ===Return to Leixões=== Beto returned to Leixões on 21 September 2020. ==International career== Beto made his debut for Portugal on 10 June 2009, in a 0–0 friendly match in Estonia.

At the end of the 1960s, Staccioli decided to dedicate himself to sculpture. His idea is to meet people where they live which leads him to create sculptures for urban places. His sculptures are “marks”, traces of a passage; he wants to affect the people who are usually found in a place and prompt them to experience that place in a different way. His sculptures always have a strong relationship with the place where he works. Since the beginning of the 1970s, he has chosen urban environment and, with sculpture, tries to give answers to social questions. His linguistic choice is characterized by the coherence, the essential shapes and by the perfect adherence to the setting where he realize his “sculpture- intervention”. He proceeds in a very rigorous way, studying the history and characteristics of the places where he is called to work. With his sculptures he marks the place, transforming the usual perception of the people who come across them. ==Permanently displayed works== Among his permanent installations: Villa Celle in Santomato of Pistoia (1982); Olympic Park in Seoul (1988); Djerassi Foundation in Woodside (1987–1991); Museum of Contemporary Art of Seul Kwachon (1990); Museum of Contemporary Art of San Diego (1996); Ordino d’Arcalis in Andorra (1991); Munich (1996); Parc Tournay- Solvay in Brussels (1996); Villa Glori in Roma (1997); Schuman roundabout in Brussels (1998); Lapiz building in La Jolla (2003); Chiaopanshan International Sculpture Park in Taiwan (2003); University of Puerto Rico Arecibo (2004); Carrazeda de Ansiães in Portugal (2008); Centre Val St Quentin in Voisins-le- Bretonneux (2008). ==Death== Staccioli died of pneumonia on January 1, 2018.

He commanded a brigade and then a division in the Army of the Tennessee in several campaigns in the Western Theater of operations. He led the first Union troops that entered the enemy- held Fort Donelson in 1862, paving the way for the fort's subsequent surrender to Ulysses S. Grant and opening the Cumberland River as an avenue of invasion of the South.Warner, p 513. ==Early life and career== James M. Tuttle was born near Summerfield, Ohio, in rural Noble County (then Monroe County) to James and Esther (Crow) Tuttle. When he was ten years old, Tuttle's family moved to Indiana, where his father, a Maine-born farmer who kept migrating westward, finally settled in Fayette County.Howe, p. 356. Young Tuttle was educated in the common schools of Ohio and Indiana. In the spring of 1846 the 23-year-old Tuttle moved to Farmington, Iowa, where he engaged both in agricultural and mercantile pursuits. He briefly returned to Fayette County, Indiana, in the fall of 1847, where he married Elizabeth Conner on September 22. They established a household in Farmington. However, Elizabeth Tuttle died on their fourth wedding anniversary. On August 17, 1853, Tuttle married Ohio-born Laura M. Meek in Farmington; they would have five children together.Portrait and Biographical Album, Polk County, Iowa, 1890 , pp. 194-95. Retrieved 2008-11-26. Tuttle entered local politics as a Democrat, and was elected in 1855 as the sheriff of Van Buren County, serving two years. In the autumn of 1857, he was elected as the County Treasurer and Recorder, serving a pair of 2-year terms. ==Civil War service== Following the outbreak of the war in April 1861, Tuttle raised a company of volunteers and was elected as its captain. He and his men traveled to Keokuk, where they were assigned to the 2nd Iowa Infantry, the first three-years regiment organized in Iowa. The regiment soon elected Tuttle as its lieutenant colonel, and the regiment was mustered formally into Federal service on May 27. The 2nd Iowa was assigned to duty under General Grant, who promoted Tuttle to colonel on September 6 of that year. At the February 1862 Battle of Fort Donelson in Tennessee, he led his regiment in a successful charge into the Confederate earthworks. Tuttle's men planted the first Union flag inside Fort Donelson. Despite a minor wound, Tuttle stayed in command throughout the assault. At the Battle of Shiloh in April, Tuttle commanded a brigade in Maj. Gen. W. H. L. Wallace's division, composed of the 2nd, 7th, 8th, 12th and 14th Iowa Infantry, as well as an artillery battery. After Wallace was mortally wounded and the other ranking officers also fell, Tuttle temporarily assumed command of the division and led the 2nd Division troops in fighting around the \\"Hornet's Nest,\\" where he barely escaped capture. In recognition for his gallantry in action at Fort Donelson and Shiloh, he was promoted to brigadier general on June 9, 1862. BG Thomas A. Davies took command of the division during the Siege of Corinth, and Tuttle returned to brigade command. During the fall and winter of 1862, General Tuttle commanded the Union garrison at the vital supply town of Cairo, Illinois. In the spring of 1863, he was assigned leadership of a division in Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's XV Corps. On May 6, 1863, rowdies from Tuttle's division, headed toward Vicksburg, burned most of the mansions which fronted the oxbow lake, Lake St. Joseph near Newellton in Tensas Parish, Louisiana, including the most stately of the antebellum mansions in the area, Franklin Plantation, owned by the physician Allen T. Bowie.Franklin Plantation, historical marker, Newellton, Louisiana Tuttle went on to participate that summer in the Vicksburg Campaign and thereafter the capture of Jackson, Mississippi, where he again distinguished himself in action and parlayed his growing name recognition into a run for Governor of Iowa as a Democrat. However, in the autumn elections, Tuttle was soundly defeated by Republican William M. Stone, another veteran of Shiloh.Hubbell, p. 542. In 1864, while commanding the forces around Natchez, Mississippi, Tuttle ordered the Roman Catholic Bishop of Natchez, William Henry Elder, to have certain prayers for the President of the United States recited publicly in the churches of his diocese. Elder refused, and petitioned President Abraham Lincoln for relief from the order. Through the efforts of U.S. Senator Francis Kernan, Elder was granted the freedom to practice his religion without obeying Tuttle's directive.Character Glimpses of Most Reverend William Henry Elder, D.D., New York and Cincinnati: Frederick Pustet & Company, 1911. In September 1864, Tuttle resigned his commission and returned to civilian life in Iowa. ==Postbellum career== After the war, Tuttle settled in Des Moines, Iowa, where he was engaged in various mining and manufacturing interests, including partnerships in mines in Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. Among his many business interestes was Tuttle Brothers, a pork packing operation he owned with his brother Martin. In 1866 he was the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Congress, but was beaten by former general Grenville M. Dodge in the general election. In 1871 he was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives and served one term. He served as the state commander of the Grand Army of the Republic for the Department of Iowa. In 1883, Tuttle switched political parties and was easily elected to another term in the Iowa Legislature as a Republican. Three years later, he was named as the president of the board of directors for the Iowa Soldiers Home. ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Union) ==NotesReferences== * Eicher, John H., and Eicher, David J., Civil War High Commands, Palo Alto, California: Stanford University Press, 2001, . * Heidler, David S., and Heidler, Jeanne T., eds., Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History, W.

She, along with her husband, Arthur Anning, had moved to Australia in 1964, which devastated Ray to a great extent. On the day that they moved, Ray Davies broke down on the beach after a gig. \\"I started screaming. A part of my family had left, possibly forever. ... I collapsed in a heap on the sandy beach and wept like a pathetic child\\", Davies said of the incident. Dave Davies added, \\"All of a sudden, the fact that they were really leaving finally hit Ray. He ran to the sea screaming and crying.\\" Rosy and Arthur's departure later inspired the premise for The Kinks' 1969 concept album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). ==Release and reception== \\"Rosy Won't You Please Come Home\\" appeared as the second track on the album Face to Face in October 1966.

In older times it was the intermediate point in the railroad tracks of the Old Patagonian Express between the towns of Ingeniero Jacobacci and Esquel. == Location == The town is located south of the 42 parallel (inter-province border between the provinces of Río Negro and Chubut), at AMSL. Ex-Provincial route 40 runs through it on a north–south direction, which connects to the city of Esquel south. Other connecting routes to El Maitén are National Route 243 towards El Bolsón and Bariloche in Río Negro Province, and Provincial routes RP 4 and RP 71, connecting to Cushamen and Epuyén respectively. El Maitén lies south of Ñorquincó, east of El Bolsón, and northwest of Cushamen, and northeast of Epuyén. == Geography and climate == The town of El Maitén lies on the right margin of the Chubut River. The river's valley is of Glacial origin, and in this region it runs in a North-South direction on the first highlands of the Andes on the West, and the ancient formations of the Patagonia to the East. The topography is mountainous, but of lower elevations, always under . This geographic region is a clear example of the transition between the humid wooded Andes areas to the West, and the classic more arid steppes of central Patagonia. Typical native trees of the area are the Austrocedrus chilensis, Coihue (Nothofagus dombeyi), Ñire (Nothofagus antarctica), and over 2,000 meters AMSL the Lenga (Nothofagus pumilio). The climate is semi-steppe, with humid winters with occasional strong snows and an annual precipitation between, . == History and economy == What started as a rural community was influenced greatly by the arrival of the General Roca railroad to the area in 1939, on a branch that continued to Esquel. This branch was completed and opened in 1945, and El Maitén was selected as the site of its maintenance sheds and locomotive warehouse. This changed the town towards a railroad-based economy until the 1970s, when the Argentine railroad industry started a steady decline. ==See also== *Old Patagonian Express ==References External links == *El Maitén website *Old Patagonian Express website Category:Populated places in Chubut Province ","title":"El Maitén"},{"id":"20410615","text":"Wyoming Highway 256 (WYO 256) is a state road in Evansville, Wyoming, just east of Casper known as Cole Creek Road. ==Route description== Wyoming Highway 256 begins its south end at an intersection with US 20/US 26/US 87 (Glenrock Highway) and the northern terminus of WY 253 in Evansville.

It is part of The Collegiate Reformed Protestant Dutch Church in the City of New York, the oldest Protestant church with a continuing organization in America. The Collegiate Church of New York is dually affiliated with the United Church of Christ (UCC) and the Reformed Church in America (RCA). The West End Collegiate Church is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. ==History== West End Collegiate was built as part of the rapid development of the Upper West Side in the late nineteenth century—from country estates to an urban neighborhood of town houses and, later, apartment buildings. On October 16, 1890, the Consistory of the Collegiate Church instructed the \\"Committee on a new church site west of Central Park\\" to price several plots of land of a minimum size of seven lots. The Committee purchased four lots on Eleventh Avenue (Manhattan)West End Avenue and three lots on 77th Street for $89,000. A building committee was formed and construction began in 1891. The building stood complete in the fall of 1892 and dedicated on November 20, 1892. On November 19, 1892, The Reverend Henry Evertson Cobb of West Troy, New York was called to become the first minister of the Church. During World War II the church was a center for the Dutch refugee and relief effort; Princess Juliana of the Netherlands visited twice during the war. The church buildings were designated a New York City Landmark in 1967 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. ==Architecture== The Vleeshal at the Grote Markt in Haarlem Architect Robert W. Gibson designed the church in Dutch Colonial style, following the design of the 1606 Vleeshal in Haarlem, the Netherlands. This building has the picturesque qualities of the Gothic, highly valued in the late nineteenth century and deemed especially appropriate to church architecture. Authenticity is enhanced by the choice of long, thin, brown bricks laid in Roman pattern, and by the generous use of quoins and blockings of buff terra cotta. The architect further enhanced the antique effect by inserting several handsome, terra cotta panels carved with the coats-of-arms of the church and of past benefactors. The large, octagonal pulpit is carved from oak. Its panels show the coat-of-arms of the Dutch Reformed Church and the great seal of the Church. The pulpit chairs are carved of oak in Old Dutch style. The stained glass windows were donated and created over the course of several decades; three are by Tiffany Studios and one, the east transept window titled The morning cometh and the shadows flee away, was designed by Clara Miller Burd. In the early 2000s, all the stained glass windows of the church were removed, repaired and reinstalled.

According to the owner and president of DMG, David Murcia Guzman, this business is supported by the constant flow of money for selling new prepaid cards, and also by the profitability of the subsidiaries companies. ==History== This controversial company is rooted in southern Colombia Department of Putumayo, where David Murcia implanted the basis of his business taking advantage of people's poverty as the population of this department used to get income by the production of cocaine, and other drugs supported by the Colombian guerrilla FARC and the AUC. Once former president Álvaro Uribe started a Coca eradication plan in 2002, the population saw in the Murcia's business (in 2003) a way to get easy money and support their families. The success in Putumayo lead Murcia to spread his business first in the Southwest of Colombia and then in the central zone of the country where the Colombian capital Bogotá is located. Murcia moved his company headquarters to Bogotá in a mall named Outlet, located on Autopista Norte and 198th Street on the north of the city, where hundreds of people used to go to acquire the prepaid cards and buy goods with the cards. David Murcia decided to back his company with a bunch of small companies, so he called his company D.M.G. Grupo Holding S.A, instead of the original DMG S.A.Revista Semana Articles, as 26 November 2008, ¿Fórmula mágica? It is estimated that David Murcia and his bunch of new companies caught about One Billion Dollars, most of them lost in the Caribbean tax havens. David Murcia used the revenue to expand his business to Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama where his businesses were also disbanded by the local authorities. In Panama where Murcia used to live in 2008, it was reported that he lived a life of luxury and excesses, owning many luxury cars and yachts. The scheme was based upon a Ponzi Pyramid; and it is alleged that drug money laundering was also involved. In March 2009, Murcia made declarations through an interview made by a journalist from La Prensa (Panamanian newspaper of most circulation) about his \\"investments\\" (donations) to Democratic Revolutionary Party candidates Balbina Herrera and Roberto Velasquez (candidates for president and mayor of Panama, respectively) for their campaigns. He mentions in the interview that he gave the candidates $6 million ($3M each) in exchange for his protection by Panamanian authorities. For the Panamanian public the allegation of Murcia's bribes to politicians and government officials generated a great scandal and, even though corruption is perceived as common in Panamanian politics, investigations are being made to verify the facts mentioned by Murcia.Interview with La Prensa ‘Escoltas del Gobierno me acompañaron’ ==See also== *Ponzi scheme *Confidence trick *Pyramid scheme ==References * DMG TV History Category:Retail companies of Colombia Category:Pyramid and Ponzi schemes ","title":"D.M.G.

It is located on the Wilton site in Redcar and Cleveland, south of the town of Middlesbrough in North East England. The station has provided for the site since opening in 1952, when it was operated by ICI. The station is currently owned and operated by SembCorp Industries. It comprises a variety of generating sets, with units of different ages and various fuels. The station is currently mainly coal and oil fired, but also has a CCGT unit. Wilton 10 was opened at the station in 2007, the UK's first ever large scale biomass only power station. The power station's total generating capacity across all of its units is 227 megawatts. There are plans to build another plant, Wilton 11, a waste to energy plant. ==History== Wilton Power Station has been generating electricity and providing steam to the plants on the Wilton International complex since March 1952. A secondary turbine commissioned at the station in November 1951 is still operating there today. For a long time the station was operated by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), but they sold the station to American company Enron in November 1998. In early 2002 Enron went bankrupt, and the station was sold to SembCorp. The station has been approved as a \\"Good quality\\" combined heat and power plant under the CHPQA registration scheme. This means that despite burning fossil fuels like coal and oil, the station is exempt from the Climate Change Levy, a tax which otherwise would have been put on the fuels supplied to the station and the electricity generated by it. ==Specification== Wilton Power Station is a 197 megawatt (MW) fossil fuel power station, which is currently in constant operation. Over the years, nine boilers have been in operation at the station. In the 1970s the station had a generating capacity of 300 MW and produced 1,200 tonnes of steam per hour. In this period the station was burning waste from the chemical site, byproducts such as: liquid petroleum gas, tars, waste lubricating oils, emulsion residues, waste from aromatic and olefin plants and hydrogen gas from the nylon plant. There are currently three generating sets in operation at the station, two of which are fired by coal, the other of which is a gas turbine fuelled by natural gas. Each of the two coal-fired generating sets are powered by a high pressure boiler, which are each capable of producing a continuous maximum rate of 280 tonnes per hour of steam, at 1,700 psig. Each boiler is then connected to a 33 MW turbine generator. Intermediate pressure steam is then either diverted and fed to other plants in the complex, or sent to three secondary generating sets. After the secondary generating sets, low pressure steam can then be distributed to plants in the complex. Boiler Number 6, one of the coal boilers, was mothballed in 1997, however in 2001 it was refurbished and restored to operation. In 2002, one of the secondary turbines was replaced by a newer unit. In the same year, an automation project involving the boilers, turbines and ancillary equipment was completed. ==Operations== Coal is brought to the power station by rail to the Wilton rail delivery terminal and unloaded at the station using a merry-go- round system. The coal is provided by a small number of opencast mines in Northumberland. Electricity is generated for the major plants on the Wilton complex at 11 kilovolts (kV) and distributed throughout the complex using one of the largest privately owned distribution systems in the world. This system is connected to the National Grid so that surplus electricity can be distributed using four National Grid owned transformers at 66 kV and 275 kV. On top of this, the station produces around 4,000,000 tonnes of steam per year for the plants on the complex. In late 2003, plans to install a 40 MW gas turbine at the station were finally fulfilled, after they were put off because of then owner Enron's bankruptcy. The gas turbine installation was completed in 2004, and it replaced an oil-fired boiler at the station, resulting in reduced emissions from the station. However, the station has retained the flexibility to fire oil as a backup to coal and gas. In October 2003, SembCorp applied to the Environment Agency for permission to burn 110,000 tonnes of cow fat (tallow) from the carcasses of animals slaughtered during the BSE Crisis of 1996. The tallow bought was a large portion of the 200,000 tonne stockpile stored on farms in Merseyside and near London. The tallow was brought to the station by road tanker from Merseyside. At the power station it was stored in a tanker, awaiting burning. Following consultation and a 10,000 tonne trial burn between March and May 2004, permission for the burning of the tallow was granted in August 2004. Following a £55 million boiler overhaul in 2005, the station began co-firing biomass. ==Wilton 10== SembCorp announced plans to build the UK's first wood-only burning power station in March 2005. The Wilton 10 Power Station (so called because it was the tenth boiler constructed at the Wilton Power Station) cost £30 million to construct and was built alongside the other Wilton Power Station units. It began generating electricity in September 2007, but was officially opened on 12 November 2007 by Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks. 400 people were employed in the station's construction and there are 15 permanent jobs at the station. The station burns 300,000 tonnes of a combination of sustainable wood, sawmill waste and otherwise unusable wood offcuts a year to produce 30 megawatts (MW) of electricity, as well as 10 MW of thermal energy in the form of steam, which is piped for use in the rest of the Wilton complex. It operates separately from the fossil fuel power station. 80,000 tonnes of waste wood is supplied to the station each year from neighbouring company UK Wood Recycling. ==Wilton 11== On 9 August 2010, Sembcorp announced they were teaming up with SUEZ UK to build a £200 million waste to energy plant alongside the current plants, known as Wilton 11\\\\. The plant would treat up to 400,000 tonnes of waste a year to generate 35 MW of electricity. Between 150 and 200 jobs were created in construction, and around 50 permanent jobs created when the plant was completed. There is a possibility that the plant could be supplied with waste using the site's already existing rail link. The plant began operation in late May 2016 and burns the compacted domestic waste of Merseyside brought by rail from Knowsley, near Liverpool. Branch Line News No 1271, Branch Line Society, 17 December 2016 The plant generates enough power for 63,000 homes. ==References Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1953 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2007 Category:Power stations in North East England Category:Buildings and structures in North Yorkshire Category:Natural gas-fired power stations in England Category:Cogeneration power stations in England ","title":"Wilton power stations"},{"id":"20410894","text":"but- is a chemical prefix.

According to The Silmarillion, the Valar and Maiar—with the aid of the Vala Tulkas, who entered the Creation last—succeeded in exiling Morgoth into the Void, though his maleficent influence remained ingrained in the fabric of the world. Like the Valar, the Maiar included both good and evil characters. Among the good were the Istari or Wizards, sent to Middle-earth. Among the evil were the Balrogs or fire- demons, who were some of the Dark Lord Sauron's most powerful servants. ==Reception== Critics have noted the similarity of the Valar to the Æsir, the strong and combative Norse gods of Asgard. Painting by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, 1817 ===Norse Æsir=== Critics have noted that the Valar resemble the Æsir, the gods of Asgard. Thor, for example, physically the strongest of the gods, can be seen both in Oromë, who fights the monsters of Melkor, and in Tulkas, the strongest of the Valar. Manwë, the head of the Valar, has some similarities to Odin, the \\"Allfather\\", while the wizard Gandalf, one of the Maiar, resembles Odin the wanderer. ===Christian angels=== The Valar have been likened to angels, intermediaries between the creator and the created world. Painting by Lorenzo Lippi, c. 1645 The theologian Ralph C. Wood describes the Valar and Maiar as being what Christians \\"would call angels\\", intermediaries between the creator, named as Eru Ilúvatar in the Silmarillion, and the created cosmos. Like angels, they have free will and can therefore rebel against him. Grant C. Sterling, writing in Mythlore, states that the Maiar resemble the Valar in being unable to die, but differ in being able to choose to incarnate fully in forms such as men's bodies. This means that, like Gandalf and the Balrogs, they can be killed. He notes that Sauron's inability ever to take bodily form again after his defeat could be the result of having given his power to the One Ring, but that the fate of killed Maiar remains unclear. Jonathan Evans, writing in the J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia, calls the Maiar semidivine spirits, and notes that each one is linked with one of the Valar. He states that they have \\"perpetual importance in the cosmic order\\", noting the statement in the Silmarillion that their joy \\"is as an air that they breathe in all their days, whose thought flows in a tide untroubled from the heights to the deeps.\\"Silmarillion, \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\", 10. \\"Of the Sindar\\" Evans notes, too, that Arien and Tilion are central in Tolkien's myth of the Sun and Moon. ==In culture== In astronomy, the Kuiper belt object 385446 Manwë is named for the king of the Valar. ==ReferencesPrimary=== ::This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings. ===Secondary=Sources== * Category:Middle-earth deities and spirits Category:Fictional angels Category:The Silmarillion ","title":"Ainur (Middle-earth)"},{"id":"20411096","text":"Diego Torresean Nunes (born November 30, 1982) is a Brazilian mixed martial artist.

She is a tall, masculine looking witch featured in comics/cartoons as a nemesis to the character Popeye. The Sea Hag was created by Elzie Crisler Segar in 1929 as part of the Thimble Theatre comic strip. ==Character history== The Sea Hag is one of the central enemies of Popeye the Sailor. She is the last witch on earth, and a pirate who sails the Seven Seas in her ship \\"The Black Barnacle.\\" She has a headquarters on Plunder Island, where she keeps a pride of lions that she uses to dispatch her enemies.E. C. Segar, Plunder Island. King Features Syndicate, 3 December 1933 to 7 August 1934. She also has a deep knowledge of magic artifacts, and has used many of them to great effect over the years. She is able to practice Voodoo magic and powerful enough to capture the equally magical Eugene the Jeep (though in the 1961 cartoon, \\"Myskery Melody,\\" she declares her magic is powerless against him, and is subsequently shown running as Eugene attacks her with magical electricity from his tail), and on one occasion Santa Claus. She can even alter her appearance to that of her alter ego, \\"Rose of the Sea.\\" The Sea Hag has a pet vulture named Bernard as her familiar. Bernard is abnormally strong and can easily carry a human in flight.Bud Sagendorf, \\"Dumb Vulture\\", in Popeye the Sailor:Sea Stories. Gold Key Comics, October 1962. The Sea Hag also commands an army of Goons. The most famous of the Goons is Alice the Goon. Because she is a woman, Popeye cannot physically attack her. His honor says that he would never hit a woman, even someone as evil as the Sea Hag. In such cases, it is Olive Oyl herself who steps in and does physical damage to her. One notable exception to this is in the 1960s cartoon, \\"Old Salt Tale\\" where Popeye grabs her whip and uses it to fling her into the sea. Upon meeting Popeye, she falls madly in love with him. Discovering that Popeye already has a girlfriend named Olive Oyl she tries her best to be rid of Olive and win Popeye over to her favor. Popeye makes it clear to her though that under no circumstances would he be interested in a relationship with her. Enraged, on one occasion she gave Popeye's archenemy Brutus a potion to become young and handsome as a means to win Olive Oyl's heart. Later after thinking that the Sea Hag had died, Popeye had this to say once he discovered that she wasn't: \\"I yam glad she ain't dead even if she is a exter bad woman. If they wasn't no bad women, maybe we wouldn't appreciate the good ones. Anyway, she yam what she yam!\\" Despite this, the Sea Hag has tried to kill Popeye on occasion when upset that Popeye remains uninterested in her romantically. Some 1960's comics had the Sea Hag being the mother of Bluto, although this relationship wasn't mentioned in subsequent stories. ==Other media== * In the 1960s, the Sea Hag made her television debut in Popeye the Sailor. She was voiced by actress Mae Questel who also provided the voice for Olive Oyl & Swee'Pea. * In 1978, the Sea Hag appeared in The All-New Popeye Hour animated series. She was voiced by actress Marilyn Schreffler, who also provided the voice of Olive Oyl. * She appears in the first episode of Popeye and Son, where she comes to collect a driftwood mermaid that fell off her ship. Bluto had taken it, and used it as a key decoration for his yacht party. The Sea Hag tries to sink the boat with numerous guests on board to reclaim it. Popeye's son Junior, after eating spinach, boards the ship and throws the hag her mermaid back. * In the 1982 Nintendo arcade game Popeye, the Sea Hag appears on higher stages to throw bottles at Popeye, and her vulture Bernard attacks Popeye during the third stage. * The doom/sludge band Burning Witch has a song called \\"Seahag\\" on their 1998 album Crippled Lucifer. * In 2004, actress Kathy Bates performed the voice of the Sea Hag/Siren for the 3-D CGI animated feature Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy, where she acts as the main antagonist. The storyline follows Popeye's journey to find his long lost father Poopdeck Pappy in time for the holidays. As he sails the treacherous Seas of Mystery, he encounters the villainous Sea Hag who is smitten by the hulking seaman and vows to stop at nothing until she steals him away. ==References== Category:Animated series villains Category:Comic strip villains Category:Comics characters introduced in 1929 Category:Comics characters who use magic Category:Female characters in animation Category:Female characters in comics Category:Fictional female pirates Category:Fictional witches Category:Popeye characters ","title":"Sea Hag"},{"id":"20411199","text":"John Marius Trana (22 June 1898 - 29 August 1976) was a Norwegian trade unionist and politician for the Labour Party.

Formed in 1972 (the same year as the football team), the \\"MRD's\\" perform at pre-game, halftime and post-game at all home football games, and travel with the team occasionally to perform at away and post-season games. In 1994, the MRD's were the recipients of the Sudler Trophy, the highest honor available for a college marching band. The MRD's are nicknamed \\"Virginia's Finest\\", they have performed at venues such as the inaugurations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, the NFC title game between Washington and Dallas in 1983, Bands of America Grand National Championships in 1988 and 1991. The band has made four appearances in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, first in 2001, again in 2008 and 2013, and most recently in 2018. In the past decade, the band has taken trips to Europe during the school's winter break, featuring Athens, Dublin, Monocco, London, and Rome. In the most recent trip to Europe, the MRD's participated in the 2015 Italian New Year's Day Parade in the Vatican. The Marching Royal Dukes memorize two shows every year. Each show usually consists of at least three songs. Their music consistently spans across a variety of genres, from jazz and funk to musicals and movie themes. The second piece of each show always features the Dukettes, the university's award-winning dance team. Marching band is offered as a two- credit applied music class at JMU. As a result, the Marching Royal Dukes continuously can retain a large roster and attract membership from students of almost every other field of study. MRD tryouts are open to all JMU students. In addition to performances at JMU's football games, the Marching Royal Dukes record a new CD every year with selected songs from their show music. During the winter, the MRD's also participate in the annual Harrisonburg Holiday Parade. The MRDs warm up at Eagle Hall before a game. Throughout the year, the Marching Royal Dukes provide support and training to local high school band programs. Every summer, JMU is the host of an annual band camp which welcomes students from across the state to attend and train with JMU staff.

The Pep Band is open to all members of the marching band, and has twice been named \\"Best Pep Band in the East\\" by Eastern Basketball Magazine. In recent seasons the Pep Band debuted an arrangement of Start Wearing Purple, a song by the gypsy punk band Gogol Bordello, at basketball games and both the 2013 CAA and NCAA Tournaments. The song has since taken off around campus to the extent that it is now on JMU Athletics billboards, theme music for videos, and starting in the 2013 Football Season, the Marching Royal Dukes will present it as a part of their pre-game show.

With a combined apparent visual magnitude of 3.07, it is the second brightest star (or star system) in the constellation. Judging by the parallax results, it is located at a distance of roughly from the Earth. This is a binary star system with a period of about 194 years at an orbital eccentricity of 0.6. As of 2007, the two stars had an angular separation of 1.206 arcseconds at a position angle of 35°. The components are main sequence stars of similar size and appearance. The primary component, β Muscae A, has an apparent magnitude of 3.51, a stellar classification of B2 V, and about 7.35 times the Sun's mass. The secondary component, β Muscae B, has an apparent magnitude of 4.01, a stellar classification of B3 V, and is about 6.40 times the mass of the Sun. This is a confirmed member of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, which is a group of stars with similar ages, locations, and trajectories through space, implying that they formed together in the same molecular cloud. Beta Muscae is considered a runaway star system as it has a high peculiar velocity of relative to the normal galactic rotation. Runaway stars can be produced through several means, such as through an encounter with another binary star system. Binary systems form a relatively small fraction of the total population of runaway stars. ==References * Musca, Delta Category:Musca (constellation) Category:B-type main-sequence stars Category:Binary stars Category:Lower Centaurus Crux 062322 110879 4844 Category:Durchmusterung objects ","title":"Beta Muscae"},{"id":"20411269","text":" The Flanders Loyalty is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tanker, currently owned by BW Gas of Oslo, Norway and named BW Liberty. ==Ship history== The ship was built by Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Co, Ltd, Korea for Exmar Shipmanagement of Antwerp, Belgium.

The team was a member of the major-league American Football League and participated in the league's 1936 and 1937 seasons. ==History== When plans for the league were announced on November 12, 1935, fifteen cities bid for charter franchises for the new league. On April 11, 1936, Pittsburgh and seven other cities were awarded franchises. The Americans were organized by Dick Guy, a sports editor and business manager for the then-Pittsburgh Pirates of the National Football League. Rudy Comstock who played for five teams in the NFL, was then named the team's coach. The Amerks played all of their home games at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field. The team was to have played at Duquesne University; however, the deal to lease the school's facilities fell through. The Amerks were able to purchase a lighting system from a circus. The Amerks' first-ever league game was played on October 4, 1936 against the Syracuse Braves at MacArthur Stadium. Pittsburgh rallied to win the game 27-16. The team's first season resulted in a winning record and a fourth-place finish for the Americans with a record of 3-2-1. The Americans were also not without stars: they signed former Pittsburgh Pirates' Ben Smith and Loran Ribble. However, the team's performance on the field didn't mirror that of ticket sales and attendance. The Americans finished last in the league for attendance, averaging only 2500 spectators in attendance for home games at Forbes Field. However, the team drew large crowds on the road against the New York Yankees, Rochester Tigers and Boston Shamrocks. While the Americans survived their first season, the team was folded after the third game of the 1937 season. The team played its first game at Forbes Field against the Los Angeles Bulldogs, which resulted in a 21-0 Bulldogs win. Jess Quatse, a former stand-out for the Pitt Panthers, served as the team's coach. The rest of the league would cease operations at the end of season. ==See also== *1936 Pittsburgh Americans season *1937 Pittsburgh Americans season ==References== Americans Category:Defunct American football teams in Pennsylvania Category:American football teams in Pittsburgh Category:American football teams established in 1936 Category:American football teams disestablished in 1937 Category:1936 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:1937 disestablishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Pittsburgh Americans"},{"id":"20411355","text":"The Mountaineer Marching Band, known as The Pride of West Virginia, is the marching band of West Virginia University located in Morgantown, West Virginia. The band was awarded the prestigious Sudler Trophy by the John Philip Sousa Foundation in 1997.John Philip Sousa Foundation ==History== Walter Mestrezat led West Virginia University's marching band for 37 years as its founding director. The band was formed in 1901 as an all-male ROTC Band with only eight members. The founding director, Walter Mestrezat, was a band leader during the Spanish–American War who led the First West Virginia Regiment in Cuba. The band's membership was exclusive to male ROTC members from its founding until 1925, when eleven non-ROTC males were allowed to join the band with limited benefits. Citing the favorable bias toward military band members the eleven formed a \\"rebel\\" band. To gain recognition as an official student organization, the group formed WVU's initial Omicron Chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi. Through the efforts of WVU president Frank Trotter, the rebel and ROTC bands were successfully merged into the University Marching Band. WVU's Military Department soon reached an agreement with the School of Music, allowing the band to be recognized as an official WVU music organization. Mestrezat increased the band's membership to approximately 70 members during his 37-year reign as the founding director. He retired in 1938, when Bernard McGregor became the band's second director. The 1950s and 1960s began a new era in the marching band's history where it flourished largely under the direction of Larry Intravaia and Budd Udell. WVU's fight songs, \\"Fight Mountaineers\\" and \\"Hail West Virginia\\" were arranged for the band by Budd Udell during this era. They are the same arrangements the band plays today. The new songs and performances garnered the group significantly more attention than it had received in the past. 1971 began the 34-year era of Don Wilcox, who served as Director of Bands from 1971 to 2005 and Director of the Marching Band from 1971 to 1997. During Wilcox's inaugural year the band was still limited to all-male membership and consisted of 88 members. The following year Wilcox endorsed women to become official members, marking the first time in the band's history (other than the World War II era) that woman were allowed to join the band. The 1970s saw one of the greatest periods of growth for the program through the efforts of its leadership and the band's association with the Mountaineer football team. As the football team became more renowned, the band garnered more exposure as well. The band performed at NFL games and two Peach Bowls in Atlanta. During the 1975 Peach Bowl, an announcer coined the phrase \\"The Pride of West Virginia\\", a term that would eventually become the band's official nickname. After Don Wilcox's retirement in 2005, John Hendricks became WVU's Director of Bands and Jay Drury, then assistant director, was named the 11th director of the WVU Marching Band. In 2008 the band grew to over 390 members, becoming the largest WVU Marching Band since 1986, when the band fielded 400. In 2017, Scott Tobias was announced to be the 12th director of the WVU Marching band, while holding the position of Director of Bands. In 2018 Stephen Lytle was named the Associate Director of Bands at WVU which made him the 13th director of The Pride of West Virginia. On May 28, 2020, Dr. Cheldon Williams was announced as Dr. Lytle's replacement as Associate Director of Bands and, accordingly, Director of the WVU Marching Band. ==Traditions== During its traditional pre-game performance, the WVU drumline enters Mountaineer Field through the home-side tunnel and performs the \\"Tunnel\\" and \\"Boogie\\" cadences. When complete, the remaining band members emerge from the south end-zone tunnels to a spirited, 220-beats per minute run-on cadence. The band forms several iconic images during its pre-game show including the Flying WV, the initials WVU, expanding circles, and an outline of the state of West Virginia. The band plays several university songs and favorites including \\"Country Roads\\", \\"Hail, West Virginia\\", \\"Simple Gifts\\" (from Appalachian Spring), \\"Fight, Mountaineers\\", \\"Mountain Dew\\", and the \\"West Virginia University Alma Mater\\". ===Formation of the State=== The band forms the outline of the state of West Virginia during the pregame show of all home Mountaineer football games. The outline moves down the field during the playing of \\"Hail West Virginia\\", and the shape inverts to face the student side of the stadium when the crowd begins the \\"Let's Go...Mounaineers\\" chant. West Virginia is one of only two U.S. states with two panhandles, the other is Alaska. West Virginia features an irregular oval body formed mostly by the Ohio River and a straight northern border formed by the Mason-Dixon line. The unique shape creates a complex formation on the football field. Adding to the difficulty of the performance is the inversion of the formation, the motion of the band members around the border of the state, and the movement of the outline across the field. ===Simple Gifts=== While the song was originally performed by the band during the 1973 halftime show, Aaron Copland's Simple Gifts has become a pregame tradition. Soon after its debut as a pregame selection, then band director Don Wilcox decided to exclude the song from the show for one year. However, the high demand for Simple Gifts to be reinstated caused Wilcox to add the performance into the very next pregame show. The highlight of the performance begins when the band gathers in a circular formation in the center of the field. After a drum roll the colorguard thrust gold and blue flags into the air, raising and lowering them for emphasis, as the outer circle kneels, creating a two tiers of instruments for maximum sound during the fanfare of the arrangement. The formation then expands in concentric circles as the band begins the reprise. {   -  alt=Simple Gifts..  alt=Initials.  alt=State outline..  alt=Football team.. - Circles formed during \\"Simple Gifts\\". WVU initials formed during pregame. State outline during \\"Hail, West Virginia\\". Football team enters the field. } ==Composition== Any student at West Virginia University is eligible for membership pending an audition. The band currently has 350 members. ===Direction=== Dr. Cheldon Williams is currently the director of the Mountaineer Marching Band and holds the position of Associate Director of Bands. He also directs the Symphonic Band and other athletic pep bands, while Director of Bands Dr. Scott Tobias serves as the conductor of the WVU Wind Symphony. \\"Scott Tobias joins WVU as Director of Bands\\" Don Wilcox, who served as Director of Bands for 34 years at WVU, a tenure that included 28 years as director of the marching band, currently holds the title of Director of Bands Emeritus.WVU College of Creative Arts ==Performances== The Pride of West Virginia at the 2006 Nokia Sugar Bowl The band performs at every home football game and makes several local and national appearances throughout the year. When traveling the band requires nine charter buses, or equivalently two charter planes, to accommodate the band membership, faculty, and equipment needed for performances. \\"The Pride Travel Fund\\" was created before the 2008 season to help offset these costs. In the past decade alone the band has traveled to the states of Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and the District of Columbia. The band is sometimes referred to as an ambassador of the state of West Virginia, often being selected to represent the state at political events. The band was invited to the Inaugural Parades of Richard Nixon in 1969 and Ronald Reagan in 1985. In the fall of 2005 the band celebrated Constitution Day with a performance on the National Mall that was attended by Robert C. Byrd, one of West Virginia's two representatives in the US Senate. In 2008 the band performed at the inauguration of West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin in Charleston. The band has performed at many bowl games due to its close association to the Mountaineer football team. The band performed at WVU's first BCS Bowl Game, the 2006 Nokia Sugar Bowl, in Atlanta, Georgia. Significant national television coverage was provided for the band's pregame and halftime performances during the 2008 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona. The Pride also performed at the 2012 Discover Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida as the Mountaineers blew out the Clemson Tigers 70-33. The band has recently traveled to Atlanta, Georgia for the 2014 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game as the Mountaineers played against the University of Alabama. In November 2016, the band went to New York City for the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. ==Accolades== In 1997, the WVU band was awarded the Sudler Trophy by the John Philip Sousa Foundation. ==External links== * The Pride of West Virginia Official Site * WVU Band Photos Official Site * WVU Band on Facebook Official Site ==References== Category:Big 12 Conference marching bands Category:West Virginia University Category:Musical groups from West Virginia Category:Musical groups established in 1901 Category:1901 establishments in West Virginia ","title":"The Pride of West Virginia"},{"id":"20411372","text":"Cynthia \\"Cindy\\" Adams (née Sugar; later Heller; born April 24, 1930) is an American gossip columnist and writer. She is the widow of comedian/humorist Joey Adams. ==Early life and education== Born an only child in New York City, Adams was one year old when her parents divorced. Her mother, Jessica Sugar, worked as an executive secretary for the New York City Water Department and was a single parent until her remarriage to insurance agent Harry Heller. Adams grew up in Washington Heights, Manhattan and Jamaica Estates, Queens. She attended Andrew Jackson High School without graduating. ==Marriage to Joey Adams== Adams began to work as a photographer's model in Manhattan, and met her future husband, Joey Adams, a year later, when they appeared on the same radio show. They married on Valentine's Day 1952, and had no children. Joey died in 1999, following a long illness. ==Writing career== Since 1979, Adams has written a gossip column for the New York Post, a New York City newspaper. She also contributed to Sunday Today in New York, a now-defunct newscast on WNBC television and had previously contributed twice a week on WNBC's Live at Five newscast, until it took on a new format on March 12, 2007. Adams also wrote for local papers, including, eventually, the New York Post at the same time as her husband, who wrote a newspaper column for the Long Island Press on Long Island and later the New York Post. In 1965, she co-wrote an English- language autobiography of Indonesia's President Sukarno, about whom she wrote another book two years later. In 1975, Adams published a biography of Jolie Gabor, the mother of the Gabor sisters. Among those whom she interviewed in 1970 was Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran. Adams later became friendly with Imelda Marcos, the controversial widow of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. Adams became a syndicated newspaper columnist in 1981. Additionally, she was an original contributor to the syndicated, tabloid television A Current Affair and has appeared often on Good Morning America, a morning news-and-talk show on the ABC television network. In 1990, Adams served as a panelist on To Tell the Truth, an NBC television network game show. ==Animal activism== After her husband died in 1999, Adams developed a love for dogs. Jazzy, her Yorkshire Terrier, trailed her in public and became a minor celebrity himself. Adams and Jazzy would often dine together at New York City's finest restaurants, including Le Cirque. Adams dresses her dogs in expensive designer clothes and jewelry. She wrote a memoir about Jazzy, The Gift of Jazzy, and launched the Jazzy line of merchandise. One weekend, Adams put Jazzy in a kennel in upstate New York when she left the city. By the time she returned Jazzy had died. She had a necropsy performed, which showed E. coli bacteria in the dog's system. In an article published in The New York Times, Adams was quoted as saying, \\"Now this is a dog that I hand-fed. I would lie on my stomach in the kitchen and hand-feed him kosher chicken. We would go to Le Cirque and eat off of Limoges porcelain. Where would he get E. coli?\\" She became a vocal advocate for strengthening regulations of boarding kennels. In 2004, she garnered the support of television journalist Barbara Walters, socialite Ivana Trump, attorney Barry Slotnick, writer Tama Janowitz, and New York City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, to pass the Boarding Kennel and Regulation Act, also known as \\"Jazzy's Law\\". According to Adams, \\"To prevent others from suffering my Jazzy['s] pain, this local 'Boarding Kennel and Regulation Act' will: license kennels, monitor them regularly, fine those in violation, require records and rules, demand boarded pets prove vaccination and immunization against contagious doggy diseases.\\" \\"Kennel and Regulation Act\\". bernadette-peters.com. Despite the increasingly strict New York City health code, which only permits service animals in restaurants, Adams continues to bring her dogs to New York City restaurants. ==Personal life== Adams lives and works from a nine-room penthouse apartment with a veranda on Park Avenue in Manhattan, that she and her husband purchased from the estate of billionaire heiress Doris Duke in 1997. Because of the apartment's connection with Duke, Adams hosted the wrap party for the television biographical film Bernard and Doris (2008), about Duke's later years and Duke's relationship with her butler. ===Illness in 2010=== Adams ceased writing her regular New York Post column in May 2010 without notice, and there was no news beyond brief mentions that she was \\"unwell\\". In late June, Liz Smith, another gossip columnist (whose column used to be carried by the Post), reported in her online column that Adams was ill with a stomach malady. A Christian Scientist, Adams had avoided medical help until forced by friends Barbara Walters and television judge Judith Sheindlin to obtain it; Sheindlin became Adams' healthcare proxy as Adams has no immediate family. The diagnosis was said to be an almost-burst appendix. Smith reported on June 29, 2010 that \\"she [Adams] is now on the mend\\". From July 2010 through September 20, 2010, the New York Post noted that Adams will be \\"returning soon\\". She returned with a column detailing her illness on September 20, 2010. She wrote that she had had a ruptured appendix and anemia. ==Bibliography== * Sukarno; Adams, Cindy Heller (1965). Sukarno An Autobiography. Bobbs-Merrill.

He took secondary education, and was hired in the Norwegian State Railways in 1914. After some time he was promoted to railway station manager. He was the chairman of his local trade union from 1920 to 1928, and vice chairman of the national Norwegian Union of Railway Workers, affiliated with the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO), from 1928 to 1930. The union had witnessed turbulent times in the 1920s, with inner strife between communists and social democrats. Buland had been an elected politician for the Labour Party, serving in Trondheim city council from 1925 to 1930. In 1930 he became chairman of the Union of Railway Workers, and succeeded in his task to reinforce the union. He had four children. ==World War II== At the time of the German invasion of Norway in 1940, Buland was still chairman of the Union of Railway Workers. Retrieved on 26 November 2008.

On 18 June 1941, Terboven summoned the protesters to a meeting in the Parliament Building of Norway. Six of the protesters who showed up were arrested on the spot, among them Buland. He was incarcerated for a short period, at Møllergata 19 from June to July 1941. In September 1941, Buland was arrested for the second time.

A member of Merseyside Police Authority, Councillor Steve Foulkes, said the appointment had caused outrage among the families of the victims of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, because Bettison had been involved in the investigation, which had been controversial.\\"Pressure grows on Merseyside police chief\\", BBC News, 9 November 1998.

Securzine (February 2007). He attempted to secure a package to receive both a retirement pension from Merseyside and a salary from the new post; he threatened legal action but the claim was settled out of court.Police chief in legal battle to take pension on top of pay The Times, 21 December 2007 Shortly after taking office as Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, Sir Norman ordered a review of shifts worked by officers claiming they did not provide the best service to the public as they included four rest days when officers were not at work. A new shift pattern consisting of two distinct patterns referred to as VSA 1 and VSA 2 (variable shift arrangement) was produced and commenced in March 2008. Response officers worked VSA 1 and neighbourhood policing teams worked VSA 2. The VSA 2 still included four rest days for officers. Officers posted to Communications Division were allowed to continue working the more popular previous shift pattern, FSDR (Force Standard Duty Rosta) as Communications Division had been able to successfully argue that VSA was not fit for purpose for their requirements. The VSA 1 proved deeply unpopular with many officers claiming that they were more tired than they had been working the previous shift pattern. A report leaked from the Police Federation to local media suggested that there had been an increase of 16,000 hours of sickness between April and August 2008, a 3.4% increase on the previous year. After pressure by the police federation a further review was taken and VSA 1 was re-designed and commenced in April 2009. Many officers remain unconvinced as to the need to deviate from the FSDR shift pattern which had allowed West Yorkshire Police to achieve 'very significant performance gains' and be regarded as one of the most improved forces.\\"Police Force Assessments West Yorkshire 2004/2005\\", Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, 2004–2005.\\"Police Force Assessments West Yorkshire 2005/2006\\", Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, 2005–2006. ===Media statements=== In October 2008, Bettison was touted as a possible replacement for Sir Ian Blair as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, but ruled himself out of consideration citing the politicisation of the role and the way Blair was removed. He warned of \\"dangerous consequences\\" if the independence of chief constables were lost, saying \\"I am not prepared to set aside my professional judgement and integrity, forged over 36 years, in order to meet short-term political expediency\\" and warning of \\"the ambition which seems to be shared by all three major political parties at the moment... to make the police service more accountable to elected representatives. What that means is bringing the police service under greater political control.\\"\\"Police Chief Rules Out Met Role\\", BBC, 3 October 2008. On 12 April 2010 Bettison wrote an article in The Times saying \\"I'm not worth £213,000\\"; his annual cost to the tax payer when pensions and benefits are considered. He criticized the notion, in the National Health Service and other government bureaus, that public sector organisations had to offer wages for senior managers comparable to those for private industry, or that businesspeople should be brought in to conduct strategic reviews of public agencies. Instead, he wrote, \\"People join, and remain in, the public sector because of a sense of vocation — to make a difference to society or to the quality of people’s lives. The best leaders are those who can secure long-term public value and a vision for their staff. Not some mercenary performance manager peddling a short-term fix.\\" Thus he suggested freezing public sector pay, without exceptions, beginning with the highest wage earners, which he felt in combination with a 50p in the pound increase in taxes for higher earners and the removal of all tax allowances would sustain public services. In an article for the Yorkshire Post, Bettison wrote that over-zealous health and safety officials were making the jobs of his front line officers increasingly more demanding, branding them \\"the health and safety Taliban\\". He described feeling that he was \\"pushing the boundaries\\" by commending a police officer who jumped into a canal to save a suicidal man, due to the officer's personal risk, and that in another case police and ambulance crews failed to save two shooting victims after being delayed 20 minutes, because it is \\"genuinely easier, in that kind of environment, to do nothing. We are not trained, equipped, practised or informed sufficiently for this or that particular scenario.\\" He also described the conviction of Metropolitan Police for the death of Jean Charles de Menezes as \\"A triumph for health and safety, a lucrative new territory for lawyers, a disaster for common sense.\\" ==Role in Hillsborough disasterMatch attendance=== On 15 April 1989, as an off-duty police Chief Inspector/private citizen Bettison, attended the semi-final FA Cup football match tie between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield. At 15:06 the Hillsborough disaster unfolded, which resulted in 96 Liverpool fans being fatally crushed (although two of them died at later dates), and remains the deadliest stadium-related disaster in British history and one of the world's worst ever football disasters. Bettison subsequently left his seat and joined in the South Yorkshire Police efforts to control the unfolding disaster. He claims to have attended a number of casualties, and set up a rendezvous centre for relatives at a local boys' club. ===South Yorkshire Police review/liaison=== After the disaster and in the period leading up to the Taylor Report, Bettison was seconded to an internal review group within South Yorkshire Police team who were tasked with liaising with regards issues associated with Hillsborough. Later described as a \\"black propaganda\\" unit, the media output included a 30 minute film narrated by Bettison that was shown to MP's during a visit by SYP to Westminster, which verbally reiterated the claims of drunk, violent and ticketless fans breaking down the dilapidated turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end. During a prior meeting to brief Michael Shersby MP and show him the film, it was also claimed that the South Yorkshire Police had deliberately left the rescue operation to the fans so that the fans \\"would not take out their frustration on the police\\".Page 8  Home Office . Hillsborough.independent.gov.uk. Retrieved on 16 April 2013. Bettison has consistently described his role in Hillsborough as 'peripheral', which has been disputed. He has been asked to explain how exactly his role was peripheral, what exactly his role was, who he was answerable to, and what he did for the two-year period.Shennan, Paddy.

As a result of his role within the unit, the Hillsborough Families Support Group later led protests on Merseyside when Bettison was proposed as the Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, objections which were over ruled by the police authority. ===Contribution hearings=== On 12 July 1990, Bettison prepared and submitted a document for the Hillsborough contribution hearings, the civil court case through which the police sought to recover damages from other parties with liability such as the football club and stadium engineers. In this document, Bettison wrote: \\"The fullest information on the closure of the central tunnel at the 1988 Semi-Final ... it was an informal initiative at junior level not reported to command level\\" This conclusion was also drawn by the Coroner who directed the inquest jury that the senior officers had not been aware of diversions from the tunnel by police officers in 1988.Page 10  Home Office . Hillsborough.independent.gov.uk. Retrieved on 16 April 2013. Internal documents later released by South Yorkshire Police to the Hillsborough Independent Panel included the minutes of a meeting held on 17 April 1989 with senior members of South Yorkshire Police. It is not clear whether Bettison was in attendance. In the meeting, the then Chief Constable is documented to have stated: \\"You were well aware that there were contingencies to deal with the filled stand. i.e the shutting off of the tunnel.\\" ===Hillsborough Independent Panel report=== On 12 September 2012 Bettison's role in the Hillsborough disaster was revealed by the Hillsborough Independent Panel report. Families of the victims demanded Bettison's resignation. In response to the report, Bettison released a statement saying that his role was never to \\"besmirch\\" the fans, but said that Liverpool fans' behaviour that day made policing the event \\"harder than it needed to be.\\"West Yorkshire police chief to retire after Hillsborough controversy  UK news. The Guardian. Retrieved on 16 April 2013. His comments sparked fury, and led to calls for him to resign. The IPCC later criticised Bettison's statement saying that it was \\"insensitive and inappropriate to make reference to fan behaviour at all, bearing in mind that publication of the report represented a vindication for the fans that their behaviour was not a factor,\\" and that his \\"unwise\\" comments \\"flew in the face of the report's definitive findings\\".IPCC Document \\"Decision in response to Hillsborough Referrals. ipcc.gov.uk (October 2012). Trevor Hicks, chair of the families support group, said; \\"Sir Norman Bettison, currently chief constable of West Yorkshire police and a former chief constable of Merseyside, should quit. As a South Yorkshire chief inspector and later superintendent, he was a member of the internal review group or liaison unit on Hillsborough and, as such, the families say he had a key role in presenting the police in the best light and blaming the fans for the disaster. Labour MP Maria Eagle told parliament: the \\"liaison unit orchestrated what can only be described as a black propaganda campaign.\\" Hicks, who lost his two teenage daughters in the disaster, said: \\"If he is anything of a man, he will stand down and scurry up a drainpipe somewhere.\\" On 13 September 2012 former Home Secretary Jack Straw said in a radio interview that Bettison was \\"bound to be considering his position\\". He added that in his experience Bettison was a fine police officer . Later that same day, Bettison was referred to the West Yorkshire Police Authority, over his role and post- disaster conduct at the Hillsborough disaster. He was quoted as saying \\"I really welcome the disclosure of all facts that can be known about the Hillsborough tragedy because I have absolutely nothing to hide.\\" On 14 September, Bettison issued an apology for his statement issued on 13 September \\"for any upset caused by a statement he issued about his role in the Hillsborough tragedy.\\" Bettison said he had not intended to suggest Liverpool fans had hindered police during the disaster, that Liverpool fans were \\"in no way to blame\\", and that he was sorry if he had \\"caused any further upset\\". On 28 June 2017, he was charged with offences related to alleged lies in the aftermath. The case was dropped on 21 August 2018. ==Resignation== At the start of October 2012 he announced that he was to retire in March 2013, ending 38 years of service to the police. On 23 October 2012, Bettison resigned with immediate effect as Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, after Maria Eagle MP on the floor of the House and thus protected by Parliamentary privilege, accused him of boasting about the Hillsborough cover-up operation involving concocting a story that all the Liverpool fans were drunk and that police were afraid that they were going to break down the gates and so decided to open them. Bettison denied the claim, and more general allegations about his conduct, saying \\"there is nothing I'm ashamed of\\". Merseyside Police Authority confirmed that he would receive an £83,000 pension, unless convicted of a criminal offence in relation to Hillsborough. Hillsborough families called for the payments to be frozen during the IPCC investigation. ==Gross misconduct charge== Following a Freedom of Information request, the minutes of West Yorkshire Police Authority were released and they revealed that Bettison resigned after learning that \\"he faced possible dismissal over a last minute discussion with a police authority executive in which he allegedly sought to influence talks about his role in the Hillsborough scandal.\\"Sir Norman Bettison resigned after learning he faced possible dismissal over his role in the Hillsborough scandal – Home News – UK.

Bettison is also to be investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over allegations that he was involved in the theft of a substantial quantity of precious metal on 11 August 1987. == Alleged misconduct in Stephen Lawrence enquiry == On 3 July 2013 Bettison was referred to the IPCC by West Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Mark Burns-Williamson in relation to alleged misconduct during the Macpherson Inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, a black South London teenager who had been fatally stabbed in a racist attack 20 years earlier. Three documents were found, about which Burns-Williamson said: :\\"These documents raise significant concerns over the role of Sir Norman Bettison at the time he was Assistant Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police in 1998 in commissioning a report to be prepared in the respect of a key witness appearing before the Macpherson Inquiry. This may suggest an attempt to intervene in the course of a public inquiry and influence the manner in which the testimony of a witness, who was due to present evidence before it, was received. I have today referred this to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.\\" ==Honours== Bettison was made an Honorary Fellow of Liverpool John Moores University in 2004.Liverpool Echo, May 2004. In the Millennium New Year's Honours list, he was awarded the Queen's Police Medal, and was knighted in 2006. Liverpool John Moores University came under pressure to rescind Bettison's fellowship, following the publication of the report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel. The University responded that the requests were being treated with the 'utmost seriousness' but that it would be 'prejudicial' to IPCC investigation to make a decision before the outcome of that investigation was known.

His father, Charles Constantine, was the superintendent of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police; his mother was Henrietta Anne Constantine. He was educated at Upper Canada College, in Toronto, Ontario (1896–1902). He studied at the Royal Military College of Canada (or RMC), with the student number 621 in Kingston, Ontario 1902-1905. He was an outstanding athlete and CSM. He played Rugby for two of the leading British teams, Blackheath F.C. and Harlequin F.C.. Whilst based in Quebec City in 1906 and 1907 he played senior hockey with the Quebec Hockey Club. He was successful, and was their leading scorers with 15 goals in 7 games. He was the XI Commandant, RMC. ==Career== Often referred to as a soldier's soldier, Constantine spent his life in the army from the time he joined the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (or RCHA) in 1905, until he retired in 1943. He entered the Permanent Force in 1905. By the time that the First World War broke out, he had become a captain. He was appointed brigade major shortly after proceeding oversees with the First Division. He was promoted to Lieutenant-colonel just before the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 and placed in command of the Fifth Canadian Field Brigade. He rose to the command of an Artillery Brigade, winning the Distinguished Service Order, or DSO, and bar and the Legion of Honour. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath, or CB. After the war he held many important military posts, including O.C. of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery. Following the First World War, he taught at the RMC then went to staff college in England. He was appointed the 11th Commandant at the RMC (1925–30). During this period he consolidated the work of restoring it after the damages caused by the war. In 1925, Constantine was informed that the Department of Militia intended to expand the RMC over the next ten years so that it could handle three hundred cadets, a seven-month physical training course for officers and other ranks, equitation courses and special courses for the military training of officers of the Royal Canadian Navy, the Active Militia and the Royal Canadian Air Force. Summer training and accommodation was provided at the RMC for cadets who were candidates for the Permanent Force, the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force. To accommodate the growth of the college, a new mechanical engineering shop was built and equipped to release the space under Currie Hall for a drafting room. Although he also recommended plans for the construction of dormitory, mess and recreation facilities, the accommodation problem was not immediately resolved. The universities and professional societies, such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario continued to recognize RMC courses and several members of the academic staff took measures to improve their academic qualifications. Although the Advisory Board recommended that RMC offer a bachelor of military science degree or that civilian universities give a special bachelor of military science degree to RMC graduates who completed their degrees in civilian universities, the proposal was coldly received by the Deputy Minister and Chief of the General Staff. Although some ex-cadets recommended the addition of more humanities and cultural courses, specialization was eliminated. All cadets took the same subjects with a heavy emphasis on mathematics, with the exception of third year specialization in chemical engineering 1924-29. During the 20s, between one quarter and a half of each RMC class went into regular military service in Canada or in Britain, particularly into the Canadian technical corps, the signals and the engineers. The Constantine Arena was named in Major-General Constantine's honour, who in addition to his distinguished service career was an outstanding sportsman, hockey player and coach at the RMC. The arena was built in 1960 during a period of rapid expansion of the RMC. After leaving RMC, he served as district officer commanding at Saint John, New Brunswick (1930). In 1934, he became adjutant-general in Ottawa, Ontario. In 1938, he was the commanding officer of Kingston Ontario, Canada's largest military district. With the advent of war in 1939, he was sent to Halifax, Nova Scotia He died in Kingston, Ontario, the day before his 71st birthday. ==Family== His wife, Marie, served as the Provincial Commissioner with the Girl Guides of Canada from 1937-40. They had three children, all girls.https://www.canadianobituaries.com/kingston/89044-evelyn-constantine- march-19-2018.html ==Honour== Royal Military College of Canada Constantine Arena The Constantine arena at the Royal Military College of Canada was named in honour of Charles Francis Constantine in 1960. ===Books=== *4237 Dr. Adrian Preston & Peter Dennis (Edited) \\"Swords and Covenants\\" Rowman And Littlefield, London.

Clan membership may even be counted on the mother line. This custom is not found with their other neighbors or in other tribes of Nigeria. The Longuda language is a branch of Adamawa. == History and geography == The Longuda rulers default to the Kanuri style. The seat of the traditional ruler is in Guyuk, Adamawa State. According to oral tradition, the Longuda parted from the Kanuri in Borno State. == Cuisine == Guinea Corn (Sorghum bicolor) Traditionally, the staple crop of the Longuda is Guinea Corn (Sorghum bicolor). This used to be grounded on stone hand mill and cooked into a thick paste, \\"tuwo\\", then eaten with vegetable soup. Today, however, rice, maize, and millet form part of the staple of the Longuda. Guinea Corn still remains the dominant crop grown by the Longuda. == Marriage == The Longuda are primarily polygamous. The different dialects of the Longuda people perform marriage rites differently. Traditionally, a young man courting a woman invited his friends on the night he wished to take her as his bride, without her prior knowledge. The man and his friends would abduct the woman to his cottage, often a forceful act. Once the woman spent a night in his cottage, his family and hers considered them married. The bride price was usually paid afterwards. This abduction, which usually took place in the night, was not without resistance. The other young men in the woman's neighborhood would attempt to come to her rescue, and a free-for-all fight would ensue. The intending groom and his company usually had to win the duel in order to take the bride-to-be. However, in recent times, the influence of Christianity and cultural assimilation of neighboring societies have altered this practice. A watered-down version of this is still widely used. In this case, a man asks a woman for her consent, the woman agrees, and on an arranged night, the groom's friends and bride's friends secretly picks her and her clothing up from her parents' house, goes over to spend the night in the groom's uncle's house, leaving behind a token at the position where they used to sit during courtship and that seals the union. Taking her clothes along with her is her indication to everyone that she has agreed to marry the man. == Publications == Newman, Bonnie. 1976. \\"Deep and surface structure of the Longuda clause.\\" Newman, Bonnie. 1978. \\"The Longuda verb.\\" Newman, John F. 1978. \\"Participant orientation in Longuda folk tales.\\" Newman, John F. and Bonnie Newman. 1974. \\"Longuda.\\" Newman, John F. and Bonnie Newman. 1977.

The board reported to Obama and his economic team on possible ways to improve the nation's economy. Obama announced this new board on November 26, 2008, and also announced that it would be chaired by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker with campaign economic adviser Austan Goolsbee as staff director and chief economist. The council met a total of four times, with its final meeting on January 17, 2012. In 2013, the authorization for the council was not renewed, causing the council to be permanently shut down. ==Overview== The board followed the model of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), which President Dwight Eisenhower established in 1956. Like the PFIAB, the advisory board was meant to pierce what Obama called the \\"insularity\\" of Washington decision-making processes. In announcing the board, Obama commented that \\"The walls of the echo chamber can sometimes keep out fresh voices and new ways of thinking – and those who serve in Washington don't always have a ground-level sense of which programs and policies are working.\\" The PERAB was intended to provide that ground-level sense, and Obama said that this mission was reflected in the board's diverse membership. Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate in economics and a noted progressive columnist, has argued that, given the centrist makeup of Obama's economic inner circle, the new board could be used to \\"give progressive economists a voice.\\" He mentioned James K. Galbraith, Larry Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute, Dean Baker, and Jared Bernstein as progressive economists who might be suitable for the board. Bernstein, however, was subsequently named to a full-time administration position as chief economist and economic policy adviser to Vice President Joe Biden.Vice President-Elect Biden Announces Chief Economist According to an Obama transition press release, \\"The Board will be established initially for a two-year term, after which the President will make a determination on whether to continue its existence based on its continued necessity.\\" Austan Goolsbee, the board's Chief Economist, made an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on August 19, 2009.Gooslbee Daily Show Interview According to a March 25, 2009 press briefing by OMB Director Peter Orszag, the administration charged PERAB with proposing approaches to three budget related tasks: simplifying taxation, closing tax loopholes and reducing tax evasion, and reducing corporate welfare.Transcript from Conference Call with Peter Orszag March 25, 2009. Accessed March 25, 2009. The board was renewed after its charter expired on February 6, 2011, with a new focus on economic competitiveness, with its name changing from The President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board to the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. Volcker was replaced as head of the board by General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt – Volcker is not a part of the reconstituted board and was not consulted about its new makeup. In August 2011, Jeffrey Immelt announced that General Electric would create 11,000 onshore IT jobs. ==Council recommendations== The Council released an interim report with a series of recommendations in October 2011. The report included five major initiatives to increase employment while improving competitiveness: # Measures to accelerate investment into job-rich projects in infrastructure and energy development; # A comprehensive drive to ignite entrepreneurship and accelerate the number and scale of young, small businesses and high-growth firms that produce an outsized share of America's new jobs; # A national investment initiative to boost jobs-creating inward investment in the United States, both from global firms headquartered elsewhere and from multinational corporations headquartered here; # Ideas to simplify regulatory review and streamline project approvals to accelerate jobs and growth; and, # Steps to ensure America has the talent in place to fill existing job openings as well as to boost future job creation.President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness- Interim Report-October 2011 ==Criticism== Volcker was said to be disappointed in how the board was used as a public relations tool by the White House, saying that live broadcast of its meetings made honest discussion difficult. According to former U.S. Treasury deputy assistant secretary Joseph Engelhard, \\"They pretty much used him to look tough on regulation, and now they're done with him, they're saying goodbye.\\" ==Members== The President and Mr. Volcker announced the board's membership on February 6, 2009.Press Release,\\" Whitehouse.gov, 6 February 2009 Members included: * Jeff Immelt, council chair and General Electric CEO * Ursula Burns, chairwoman and CEO of Xerox * Steve Case, chairman and CEO of Revolution LLC and chairman of the Case Foundation * Christopher Che, president and CEO, Hooven-Dayton Corporation * Kenneth Chenault, chairman and CEO of American Express * John Doerr, partner at Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers * Roger W.

The show was a production of Jack Webb's Mark VII Limited for Universal Television and marked the first show created by Stephen J. Cannell, who later became known for creating and/or producing his own programs, including NBC's The A-Team. Jack Webb directed the pilot, which aired March 24, 1973. ==Overview== The show's title had a double meaning: it was at once the first name of the lead character, Chase Reddick (Mitchell Ryan), the leader of a special team of the Los Angeles Police Department that specialized in solving unusually difficult or violent cases, and indicative of the show's emphasis on the determined pursuit and undercover surveillance of hardened criminals. The unit, headquartered in an old firehouse, relied mainly on alternate/undercover means of transportation such as helicopters, motorcycles, custom vans, taxis, four-wheel-drive vehicles, sports and muscle cars, work trucks (vehicles from the Public Works Department, the telephone company, tow trucks and/or the Postal Service and civilian delivery services) and high-speed driving to apprehend its suspects. For the first fourteen episodes, Reddick, an LAPD captain, was accompanied by K-9 Sergeant Sam MacCray (Wayne Maunder) and three young officers: Steve Baker (Michael Richardson), Norm Hamilton (Reid Smith), and Fred Sing (Brian Fong). In January 1974, Webb and Universal dropped all the regulars except Ryan and Maunder in favor of a new group of officers: Frank Dawson (Albert Reed), Ed Rice (Gary Crosby, who frequently appeared on the other Mark VII shows), and Tom Wilson (Craig Gardner). Never seen, but \\"appearing\\" in every episode was actual LAPD dispatcher Shaaron Claridge, who had worked on Dragnet and Adam-12; according to the pilot script, she was assigned especially to Chase. NBC first scheduled the show on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. Eastern, opposite CBS' hit series Maude and Hawaii Five-O. At about the same time as the casting change, the network moved Chase to Wednesday nights at 8 p.m. against the Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. Despite the declining appeal and ratings of the latter (and the couple's forthcoming divorce), Chase did no better there and ended after a one-season run. Cannell would re-use the format of a team of specialists in The A-Team, co-created with Frank Lupo a decade later. Robert A. Cinader, who also supervised Mark VII's Adam-12 and Emergency!, was executive producer of Chase. ==Cast== * Mitchell Ryan . . . Capt. Chase Reddick * Craig Gardner . . . Tom Wilson * Brian Fong . . .

Bruce Welch set about finding new songs for Cliff and was to produce the album which would mark his comeback. The lead single on the album was \\"Miss You Nights\\". Although it was released in November 1975, it did not make the UK charts until early 1976, eventually peaking at No.15. The follow-up, \\"Devil Woman\\" showed a new harder-edged side to Richard's music and became one of his biggest worldwide hits, peaking at No.9 in the UK and becoming his first ever top 10 hit in the US.Cliff Richard songs - \\"Devil Woman\\" Third single, \\"I Can't Ask for Anymore Than You\\" backed with album track \\"Junior Cowboy\\" completed the hat-trick of UK top 20 entries, while the album itself reached No.5 and remained in the charts for 21 weeks - his most successful album for over a decade.

The term corporal punishment derives from the Latin word for \\"the body\\", corpus. In schools it often involves striking the student directly across the buttocks or palms of their handsSee e.g. Student/Parent Information Guide and Code of Conduct 2008-2009 , Alexander City Schools, Alabama, USA, p.44. with a tool such as a rattan cane, wooden paddle, slipper, leather strap or wooden yardstick. Less commonly, it could also include spanking or smacking the student with the open hand, especially at the kindergarten, primary school, or other more junior levels. Much of the traditional culture that surrounds corporal punishment in school, at any rate in the English-speaking world, derives largely from British practice in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly as regards the caning of teenage boys.United Kingdom: Corporal punishment in schools at World Corporal Punishment Research. There is a vast amount of literature on this, in both popular and serious culture.Quigly, Isabel (1984). The Heirs of Tom Brown: The English School Story. Oxford University Press. Chandos, John (1984). Boys Together: English Public Schools 1800-1864. London: Hutchinson, esp. chapter 11. In the English-speaking world, the use of corporal punishment in schools has historically been justified by the common-law doctrine in loco parentis, whereby teachers are considered authority figures granted the same rights as parents to discipline and punish children in their care if they do not adhere to the set rules. A similar justification exists in Chinese-speaking countries. It lets school officials stand in for parents as comparable authority figures. The doctrine has its origins in an English common-law precedent of 1770. Advocates of school corporal punishment argue that it provides an immediate response to indiscipline so that the student is quickly back in the classroom learning, unlike suspension from school. Opponents, including a number of medical and psychological societies, along with human- rights groups, argue that physical punishment is ineffective in the long term, interferes with learning, leads to antisocial behavior as well as causing low self-esteem and other forms of mental distress, disproportionately affects students of color, and is a form of violence that breaches the rights of children. Poland was the first nation to outlaw corporal punishment in schools in 1783. School corporal punishment is no longer legal in any European country. By 2016, an estimated 128 countries had prohibited corporal punishment in schools, including all of Europe, and most of South America and East Asia. Approximately 69 countries still allow for corporal punishment in schools, including parts of the United States, some Australian states, and a number of countries in Africa and Asia. ==Definitions== Medieval schoolboy birched on the bare buttocks Corporal punishment in the context of schools in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has been variously defined as: causing deliberate pain to a child in response to the child's undesired behavior and/or language, \\"purposeful infliction of bodily pain or discomfort by an official in the educational system upon a student as a penalty for unacceptable behavior\\", and \\"intentional application of physical pain as a means of changing behavior\\" (not the occasional use of physical restraint to protect student or others from immediate harm). ==Prevalence== Corporal punishment used to be prevalent in schools in many parts of the world, but in recent decades it has been outlawed in 128 countries including all of Europe, most of South America, as well as in Canada, Japan, South Africa, New Zealand and several other countries. It remains commonplace in a number of countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East (see list of countries, below). While most U.S. states have outlawed corporal punishment in state schools, it continues to be allowed mainly in the Southern and Western United States.\\"Spanking Lives On In Rural Florida Schools\\" (15 March 2012).

The Independent (London). 1839 caricature by George Cruikshank of a school flogging In most of continental Europe, school corporal punishment has been banned for several decades or longer, depending on the country (see the list of countries below). From the 1917 Russian revolution onwards, corporal punishment was outlawed in the Soviet Union, because it was deemed contrary to communist ideology.Teitelbaum, Salomon M. \\"Parental Authority in the Soviet Union\\", in American Slavic and East European Review, Vol. 4, No. 3/4 (December 1945), pp. 54-69. Communists in other countries such as Britain took the lead in campaigning against school corporal punishment, which they viewed as a symptom of the decadence of capitalist education systems.Linehan, Thomas P. (2007). Communism in Britain, 1920-39: From the cradle to the grave, Manchester University Press. pp. 32 ff. In the 1960s, Soviet visitors to western schools expressed shock at the canings there. Other communist regimes followed suit: for instance, corporal punishment was \\"unknown\\" by students in North Korea in 2007.\\"North Korean Defectors Face Huge Challenges\\". Radio Free Asia. 21 March 2007. In mainland China, corporal punishment in schools was outlawed in 1986,\\"Country report for China\\". Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children. although the practice remains common, especially in rural areas.Paul Wiseman, \\"Chinese schools try to unlearn brutality\\", USA Today, Washington D.C., 9 May 2000. Many schools in Singapore and Malaysia use caning (for boys) as a routine official punishment for misconduct, as also some African countries. In some Middle Eastern countries whipping is used. (See list of countries, below.) In many countries like Thailand where the corporal punishment of students is technically illegal, it remains widespread and accepted in practice (for booth boys and girls). ==Effects on students== According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, there are three broad rationales for the use of corporal punishment in schools: beliefs, based in traditional religion, that adults have a right, if not a duty, to physically punish misbehaving children; a disciplinary philosophy that corporal punishment builds character, being necessary for the development of a child's conscience and their respect for adult authority figures; and beliefs concerning the needs and rights of teachers, specifically that corporal punishment is essential for maintaining order and control in the classroom. School teachers and policymakers often rely on personal anecdotes to argue that school corporal punishment improves students' behavior and achievements. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence showing that corporal punishment leads to better control in the classrooms. In particular, evidence does not suggest that it enhances moral character development, increases students' respect for teachers or other authority figures, or offers greater security for teachers. A number of medical, pediatric or psychological societies have issued statements opposing all forms of corporal punishment in schools, citing such outcomes as poorer academic achievements, increases in antisocial behaviours, injuries to students, and an unwelcoming learning environment. They include the American Medical Association,\\"H-515.995 Corporal Punishment in Schools\\". American Medical Association. the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the Society for Adolescent Medicine, the American Psychological Association,\\"Corporal Punishment\\". Council Policy Manual. American Psychological Association. 1975. the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Canadian Paediatric Society and the Australian Psychological Society, as well as the United States' National Association of Secondary School Principals. According to the AAP, research shows that corporal punishment is less effective than other methods of behaviour management in schools, and \\"praise, discussions regarding values, and positive role models do more to develop character, respect, and values than does corporal punishment\\". They say that evidence links corporal punishment of students to a number of adverse outcomes, including: \\"increased aggressive and destructive behaviour, increased disruptive classroom behaviour, vandalism, poor school achievement, poor attention span, increased drop-out rate, school avoidance and school phobia, low self-esteem, anxiety, somatic complaints, depression, suicide and retaliation against teachers\\". The AAP recommends a number of alternatives to corporal punishment including various nonviolent behaviour-management strategies, modifications to the school environment, and increased support for teachers. ===Injuries to students=== An estimated 1 to 2 percent of physically punished students in the United States are seriously injured, to the point of needing medical attention. According to the AAP and the Society for Adolescent Medicine, these injuries have included bruises, abrasions, broken bones, whiplash injury, muscle damage, brain injury, and even death. Other reported injuries to students include \\"sciatic nerve damage\\" \\"extensive hematomas\\", and \\"life- threatening fat hemorrhage\\". ===Promotion of violence=== The AAP cautions that there is a risk of corporal punishment in schools fostering the impression among students that violence is an appropriate means for managing others' behaviour. According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \\"Corporal punishment signals to the child that a way to settle interpersonal conflicts is to use physical force and inflict pain\\". And according to the Society for Adolescent Medicine, \\"The use of corporal punishment in schools promotes a very precarious message: that violence is an acceptable phenomenon in our society. It sanctions the notion that it is meritorious to be violent toward our children, thereby devaluing them in society's eyes. It encourages children to resort to violence because they see their authority figures or substitute parents doing it [...] Violence is not acceptable and we must not support it by sanctioning its use by such authority figures as school officials\\". ==Alternatives== The Society for Adolescent Medicine recommends developing \\"a milieu of effective communication, in which the teacher displays an attitude of respect for the students\\", as well as instruction that is stimulating and appropriate to student's abilities, various nonviolent behaviour modification techniques, and involving students and parents in making decisions about school matters such as rules and educational goals. They suggest that student self-governance can be an effective alternative for managing disruptive classroom behaviour, while stressing the importance of adequate training and support for teachers. The AAP remarks that there has been \\"no reported increase in disciplinary problems in schools following the elimination of corporal punishment\\" according to evidence. ==Student rights== A number of international human-rights organizations including the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have stated that physical punishment of any kind is a violation of children's human rights. According to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, \\"Children do not lose their human rights by virtue of passing through the school gates [...] the use of corporal punishment does not respect the inherent dignity of the child nor the strict limits on school discipline\\".Committee on the Rights of the Child (2001). General Comment No. 1, The Aims of Education. U.N. Doc. CRC/GC/2001/1. The Committee interprets Article 19 of the Convention on the rights of the child, which obliges member states to \\"take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse […] while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child\\", to imply a prohibition on all forms of corporal punishment. Other international human- rights bodies supporting prohibition of corporal punishment of children in all settings, including schools, include the European Committee of Social Rights and the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. In addition, the obligation of member states to prohibit corporal punishment in schools and elsewhere was affirmed in the 2009 Cairo Declaration on the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Islamic Jurisprudence. ==By country== According to the Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children, all forms of corporal punishment in schools are outlawed in 128 countries as of 2016. (46 of these countries also prohibited corporal punishment of children in the home as of May 2015). ===Argentina=== Banned in 1813, corporal punishment was re-legalised in 1815 and physical punishments lasted legally till 1884, when its usage was banned except with a court order. Punishments include hitting with rebenques, slappings in the face.\\"Diálogo, premios y penitencias: cómo poner límites sin violencia\\". El Clarín (Buenos Aires). 17 December 2005. \\"En Argentina, del golpe a la convivencia\\". El Clarín (Buenos Aires). 10 February 1999. Corporal punishment of children is prohibited everywhere (schools, home, etc.) since 2016.\\"Country report for Argentina\\". Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children. ===Australia=== In Australia, caning used to be common in schools for both boys and girls. Laws on corporal punishment in schools are determined at individual state or territory level. Legislation also varies among states and territories with regard to corporal punishment meted out to children in other care settings. According to the Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children, \\"Prohibition is still to be achieved in the home in all states/territories and in alternative care settings, day care, schools and penal institutions in some states/territories\\". {  - !

Save the Children. 2 July 2014. ===Myanmar=== Caning is commonly used by teachers as a punishment in schools. The cane is applied on the students' buttocks, calves or palms of the hands in front of the class. Sit- ups with ears pulled and arms crossed, kneeling, and standing on the bench in the classroom are other forms of corporal punishments used in schools. Common reasons for punishment include talking in class, not finishing homework, mistakes made with classwork, fighting and truancy. ===Canada=== In many parts of Canada, 'the strap' had not been used in public schools since the 1970s or even earlier: thus, it has been claimed that it had not been used in Quebec since the 1960s,\\"Spanking still legal in Canada\\". Montreal Gazette. 23 February 2005. and in Toronto it was banned in 1971.\\"Toronto abolishes the strap\\". Globe and Mail (Toronto). 23 July 1971. However, some schools in Alberta had been using the strap up until the ban in 2004.\\"Peace Wapiti scraps strap\\". Daily Herald-Tribune (Grande Prairie, Alberta). 19 November 2004. In public schools, the usual implement was a rubber/canvas/leather strap applied to the hands or sometimes, legs,Moyers school supplies catalogue, 1971. while private schools sometimes used a paddle or cane administered to the student's posterior.FitzGerald, James (1994).Old Boys: The Powerful Legacy of Upper Canada College. Toronto: Macfarlane Walter & Ross. Byfield, Ted (21 October 1996). \\"Do our new-found ideas on children maybe explain the fact we can't control them?\\". Alberta Report (Edmonton). This was used on boys and girls alike. In 2004 (Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada), the Supreme Court of Canada outlawed corporal punishment in all schools, public or private.\\"Supreme Court takes strap out of teachers' hands\\". Edmonton Journal (Alberta). 1 February 2004. The practice itself had largely been abandoned in the 1970s when parents placed greater scrutiny on the treatment of children at school. The subject received extensive media coverage, and corporal punishment became obsolete as the practice was widely seen as degrading and inhumane. Despite the fact that the tradition had been forgone for nearly 30 years, legislation banning the practice entirely by law was not implemented until 2004. Some Canadian provinces banned corporal punishment in public schools prior to the national ban in 2004. They are, in chronological order by year of provincial ban: *British Columbia - 1973 *Nova Scotia - 1989 *New Brunswick - 1990 *Yukon - 1990 *Prince Edward Island - 1993 *Northwest Territories - 1995 *Nunavut - 1995* (banned while Nunavut was still part of Northwest Territories. Remained banned in Nunavut when it became a separate Territory in 1999.) *Newfoundland and Labrador - 1997 *Quebec - 1998 ===China=== Corporal punishment in China was officially banned after the communist revolution in 1949. The Compulsory Education Law of 1986 states: \\"It shall be forbidden to inflict physical punishment on students\\". In practice, beatings by schoolteachers are common, especially in rural areas.\\"New measures taken in schools to improve teacher-student relations\\", People's Daily, Beijing, 31 July 2005. === Colombia === Colombian private and public schools were banned from using \\"penalties involving physical or psychological abuse\\" through the Children and Adolescents Code 2006, though it is not clear whether this also applies to indigenous communities. ===Costa Rica=== All corporal punishment, both in school and in the home, has been banned since 2008. ===Czech Republic=== Corporal punishment is outlawed under Article 31 of the Education Act.Czech Republic State Report , GITEACPOC, June 2011. ===Denmark=== Corporal punishment was prohibited in the public schools in Copenhagen Municipality in 1951 and by law in all schools of Denmark on 14 June 1967.Danish School History 1814-2014, Danmarkshistorien.dk, 2014.Danish School History, Den Store Danske Encyklopædi.Illegal corporal punishment, Folkeskolen, 3 October 2002. ===Egypt=== A 1998 study found that random physical punishment (not proper formal corporal punishment) was being used extensively by teachers in Egypt to punish behavior they regarded as unacceptable. Around 80% of the boys and 60% of the girls were punished by teachers using their hands, sticks, straps, shoes, punches, and kicks as most common methods of administration. The most common reported injuries were bumps and contusions. ===Finland=== Corporal punishment in public schools was banned in 1914, but remained de facto commonplace until 1984, when a law banning all corporal punishment of minors, whether in schools or in the home, was introduced. ===France=== Caning was not unknown for French students in the 19th century, but they were described as \\"extremely sensitive\\" to corporal punishment and tended to make a \\"fuss\\" about its imposition. The systematic use of corporal punishment has been absent from French schools since the 19th century.\\"The punishments in French schools are impositions and confinements.\\"-- Matthew Arnold (1861) cited in Robert McCole Wilson, A Study of Attitudes Towards Corporal Punishment as an Educational Procedure From the Earliest Times to the Present, Nijmegen University, 1999, 4.3. There is no explicit legal ban on it,France State Report , GITEACPOC. but in 2008 a teacher was fined €500 for what some people describe as slapping a student.\\"Teacher Fined, Praised for Slap\\", Time (New York), 14 August 2008.Desnos, Marie (13 August 2008). \\"Une gifle à 500 euros\\".

It was not completely abolished everywhere until 1983.\\"It's 40 years since corporal punishment got a general boot\\", translated from Saarbrücker Zeitung, 19 June 1987. Since 1993, use of corporal punishment by a teacher has been a criminal offence. In that year a sentence by the Federal Court of Justice of Germany (Bundesgerichtshof, case number NStZ 1993.591) was published which overruled the previous powers enshrined in unofficial customary law (Gewohnheitsrecht) and upheld by some regional appeal courts (Oberlandesgericht, Superior State Court) even in the 1970s. They assumed a right of chastisement was a defense of justification against the accusation of \\"causing bodily harm\\" per Paragraph (=Section) 223 Strafgesetzbuch (Federal Penal Code). ===Greece=== Corporal punishment in Greek primary schools was banned in 1998, and in secondary schools in 2005.Greece State Report , GITEACPOC, November 2006. ===India=== Corporal punishment is still used on both male and female students in most Indian schools. The Delhi High Court banned its use in Delhi schools in 2000. 17 out of 29 states claim to apply the ban, though enforcement is lax.Nilanjana Bhowmick (2 May 2009). \\"Why India's Teachers Do Not Spare the Rod\\".

In late 1987, about 60% of junior high school teachers felt it was necessary, with 7% believing it was necessary in all conditions, 59% believing it should be applied sometimes and 32% disapproving of it in all circumstances; while at elementary (primary) schools, 2% supported it unconditionally, 47% felt it was necessary and 49% disapproved.\\"Many Japanese Teachers Favor Corporal Punishment\\", Nichi Bei Times, San Francisco, 21 November 1987. As recent as December 2012, a high school student committed suicide after having been constantly beaten by his basketball coach. An education ministry survey found that more than 10,000 students received illegal corporal punishment from more than 5,000 teachers across Japan in 2012 fiscal year alone. ===Luxembourg=== Corporal punishment in schools was banned in 1845 and became a criminal offence in 1974 (Aggravated Assault on Minors under Authority).Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children, Report of corporal punishment of children in Luxembourg 2013Legilux, Législation sur les mesures de discipline dans les écoles 2015The welt left on a Malaysian schoolgirl's palm after a stroke of the cane ===Malaysia=== Caning, usually carried out on the palm or clothed bottom, is a common form of discipline in Malaysian schools. Although illegal, in practice, the caning of girls is still rather common. Students (both male and female) can even be caned in front of the class/school for minor mistakes like lateness, poor grades, being unable to answer questions correctly or forgetting to bring a textbook. In November 2007, in response to a perceived increase in indiscipline among female students, the National Seminar on Education Regulations (Student Discipline) passed a resolution recommending allowing the caning of female students at school. ===Nepal=== All corporal punishment, both in school and in the home, has been banned since 2018. ===Netherlands=== Caning and other forms of corporal punishment in schools was abolished in 1920.Netherlands State Report , GITEACPOC. ===New Zealand=== In New Zealand schools, corporal punishment was used commonly on both girls and boys. This was abolished in practice in 1987. However, teachers in New Zealand schools had the right to use what the law called reasonable force to discipline students, mainly with a strap, cane or ruler, on the bottom or the hand. Boys were more likely to be hit than girls. This wasn't criminalised until 23 July 1990, when Section 139A of the Education Act 1989 was inserted by the Education Amendment Act 1990. Section 139A prohibits anyone employed by a school or early childhood education (ECE) provider, or anyone supervising or controlling students on the school's behalf, from using force by way of correction or punishment towards any student at or in relation to the school or the student under their supervision or control. Teachers who administer corporal punishment can be found guilty of physical assault, resulting in termination and cancellation of teacher registration, and possibly criminal charges, with a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment. As enacted, the law had a loophole: parents, provided they were not school staff, could still discipline their children on school grounds. In early 2007, a southern Auckland Christian school was found to be using this loophole to discipline students by corporal punishment, by making the student's parents administer the punishment. This loophole was closed in May 2007 by the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007, which enacted a blanket ban on parents administering corporal punishment to their children. ===Norway=== Corporal punishment in Norwegian schools was strongly restricted in 1889, and was prohibited outright in 1936. ===Pakistan=== School corporal punishment in Pakistan is not very common in modern educational institutions although it is still used in schools across the rural parts of the country as a means of enforcing student discipline. The method has been criticised by some children's rights activists who claim that many cases of corporal punishment in schools have resulted in physical and mental abuse of schoolchildren. According to one report, corporal punishment is a key reason for school dropouts and subsequently, street children, in Pakistan; as many as 35,000 high school pupils are said to drop out of the education system each year because they have been punished or abused in school. ===Philippines=== Corporal punishment is prohibited in private and public schools.Philippines State Report , GITEACPOC. ===Poland=== In 1783, Poland became the first country in the world to prohibit corporal punishment. Peter Newell assumes that perhaps the most influential writer on the subject was the English philosopher John Locke, whose Some Thoughts Concerning Education explicitly criticised the central role of corporal punishment in education. Locke's work was highly influential, and may have helped influence Polish legislators to ban corporal punishment from Poland's schools in 1783. Today, the ban of corporal punishment in all forms, whether in schools or in the home, is vested in the Constitution of Poland.Newell, Peter (ed.). A Last Resort? Corporal Punishment in Schools, Penguin, London, 1972, p. 9. Article 40th of the Constitution of Poland, 1997, ===Russia=== Corporal punishment was banned in Soviet (and hence, Russian) schools in 1917. In addition, the Article 336 (since 2006) of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation states that any teacher who has used corporal punishment on a pupil shall be dismissed. ===Serbia=== Corporal punishment was first explicitly prohibited in schools in article 67 of the Law on Public Schools 1929, passed in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, of which Serbia was then a part. Other now independent countries which belonged to Yugoslavia then and to which the 1929 Law applied are: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Slovenia. In Serbia, corporal punishment in schools is now unlawful under the Law on Secondary Schools 1992, the Law on Elementary Schools 1992 and the Law on the Foundations of Education and Upbringing 2003/2009.Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children, Country Report for Serbia, updated February 2018, http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/progress/country- reports/serbia.html ===Singapore=== Corporal punishment is legal in Singapore schools (for male students only, it is illegal to inflict it on female students) and fully encouraged by the government in order to maintain strict discipline. Only a light rattan cane may be used. This must be administered in a formal ceremony by the school management after due deliberation, not by classroom teachers. Most secondary schools (whether independent, autonomous or government-controlled), and also some primary schools, use caning to deal with misconduct by boys.Singapore school handbooks on line at World Corporal Punishment Research. At the secondary level, the rattan strokes are nearly always delivered to the student's clothed buttocks. The Ministry of Education has stipulated a maximum of six strokes per occasion. In some cases the punishment is carried out in front of the rest of the school instead of in private. ===South Africa=== The use of corporal punishment in schools was prohibited by the South African Schools Act, 1996. According to section 10 of the act: In the case of Christian Education South Africa v Minister of Education the Constitutional Court rejected a claim that the constitutional right to religious freedom entitles private Christian schools to impose corporal punishment. ===South Korea=== Liberal regions in South Korea have completely banned all forms of caning beginning with Gyeonggi Province in 2010, followed by Seoul Metropolitan City, Gangwon Province, Gwangju Metropolitan City and North Jeolla Province in 2011. Other more conservative regions are governed by a national law enacted in 2011 which states that while caning is generally forbidden, it can be used indirectly to maintain school discipline.진보교육감들 “학생 간접체벌 불허”, 《한겨레》, 2011.3.23 However, caning is still known to be practised indiscriminately on both boys and girls.학교 체벌 일상화,hankukilbosouth korea,2014.06.27 Anecdotal evidence suggests that the caning of girls is not particularly unusual, and that they might be as likely to be caned as boys. Mass punishments in front of the class are common, and the large number of corporal punishment scenes in films suggest that caning is an accepted cultural norm in education. ===Spain=== Corporal punishment in Spanish schools was banned in 1985.Spain State Report , GITEACPOC. ===Sweden=== Corporal punishment at school has been prohibited in folkskolestadgan (the elementary school ordinance) since 1 January 1958. Its use by ordinary teachers in grammar schools had been outlawed in 1928. All forms of corporal punishment of children have been outlawed in Sweden since 1966. ===Taiwan=== In 2006 Taiwan made corporal punishment in the school system illegal.\\"Taiwan corporal punishment banned\\", BBC News On Line, London, 29 December 2006. ===Tanzania=== In Tanzania corporal punishment in schools is widely practised and has led to lasting damage, including the death of a punished pupil. The Education Act of 2002 authorizes the minister in charge of education to issue regulations concerning corporal punishment. The Education (Corporal Punishment) Regulation G.N. 294 of 2002 gives the authority to order corporal punishment to the headmaster of a school, who can delegate to any teacher on a case-by-case basis. The number of strikes must not be more than 4 for each occurrence. The school should have a register where date, reason, name of pupil and of administering teacher, together with the number of strikes, is to be recorded.Ijue sheria ya viboko vya wanafunzi, Mwananchi newspaper 2 September 2018 ===Thailand=== Corporal punishment in schools is officially illegal under the Ministry of Education Regulation on Student Punishment (2005) and the National Committee on Child Protection Regulation on Working Procedures of Child Protection Officers Involved in Promoting Behaviour of Students (2005), pursuant to article 65 of the Child Protection Act.\\"Legality of corporal punishment in Thailand\\" , End Corporal Punishment, February 2009. The proverb \\"If you love your cow, tie it up; if you love your child, beat him.\\" is still considered \\"wisdom\\" and is held by many Thai parents and teachers. Corporal punishment (especially caning) on students of both genders remains common and accepted in practice. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the caning of girls is not particularly unusual, and that they are just as likely to be caned as boys. ===Uganda=== In Uganda, it is common practice for teachers to attempt to control large, overcrowded classes by corporal punishment. There is some movement of changing negative disciplining methods to positive ones (non-corporal), such as teaching students how to improve when they perform badly vía verbal positive reinforcement. \\"End pupils'fear of teachers' canes (2018)\\" in D+C Vol. 45 05-06/2018. ===Ukraine=== Corporal punishment was banned in Soviet (and hence, Ukrainian) schools in 1917. In Ukraine, \\"physical or mental violence\\" against children is forbidden by the Constitution (Art.52.2) and the Law on Education (Art.51.1, since 1991) which states that students and other learners have the right “to the protection from any form of exploitation, physical and psychological violence, actions of pedagogical and other employees who violate the rights or humiliate their honour and dignity”.Ukraine. DETAILED COUNTRY REPORT . Last updated: February 2011. Standard instructions for teachers provided by the Ministry of Science and Education state that a teacher who has used corporal punishment to a pupil (even once), shall be dismissed. ===United Arab Emirates=== A federal law was implemented in 1998 which banned school corporal punishment. The law applied to all schools, both public and private.http://www.khda.gov.ae/pages/en/commonQuestionssch.aspx Any teacher who engages in the practice would not only lose their job and teaching license, but will also face criminal prosecution for engaging in violence against minors and will also face child abuse charges. ===United Kingdom=== Excerpt from a caning record of a British school (1970) In state-run schools, and in private schools where at least part of the funding came from government, corporal punishment was outlawed by the British Parliament in 1986, following a 1982 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that such punishment could not be administered without parental consent, and that a child's \\"right to education\\" could not be infringed by suspending children who, with parental approval, refused to submit to corporal punishment. In other private schools, it was banned in 1998 (England and Wales), 2000 (Scotland) and 2003 (Northern Ireland). In 19th-century France, caning was dubbed \\"The English Vice\\", probably because of its widespread use in British schools. The regular depiction of caning in British novels about school life from the 19th century onwards, as well as movies such as If...., which includes a dramatic scene of boys caned by prefects, contributed to the French perception of caning as being central to the British educational system. The implement used in many state and private schools in England and Wales was often a rattan cane, struck either across the student's hands, legs, or the clothed buttocks. It had been very regularly used on both boys and girls in certain schools for centuries prior to the ban. Sometimes, a long ruler was used on the bare legs or hands instead of a cane. Striking the buttocks (or sometimes hands) with a rubber-soled gym shoe, or plimsoll shoe (called slippering), was also widely used in many schools. In Scotland, a leather strap, the tawse (sometimes called a belt), administered to the palms of the hands, was universal in state schools,\\"Rise and fall of the belt\\", Sunday Standard, Glasgow, 28 February 1982. but some private schools used the cane.Ahmed, Kamal (27 April 2003). \\"He could talk his way out of things\\". The Observer (London). This was wielded in primary as well as secondary schools for both trivial and serious offences, and girls got belted as well as boys. Nearly 6 in 10 girls were strapped in school. In a few English cities, a strap was used instead of the cane.Guide to LEAs' Corporal Punishment Regulations in England and Wales, Society of Teachers Opposed to Physical Punishment, Croydon, 1979. Schools had to keep a record of punishments inflicted,Department of Education, Administrative Memorandum 531, 1956 and there are occasional press reports of examples of these \\"punishment books\\" having survived. A headmaster's caning of a 13-year-old schoolboy at an English grammar school in 1987—five strokes for poor exam results—left \\"severe bruising\\", and, according to the family doctor, five separate weals. The headmaster who gave the punishment was cleared of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, with the judge commenting \\"If you get a beating you must expect it to be with force.\\" Prior to the ban in private schools in England, the slippering of a student at an independent boarding school was challenged in 1993 before the European Court of Human Rights. The Court ruled 5–4 in that case that the punishment was not severe enough to infringe the student's \\"freedom from degrading punishment\\" under article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The dissenting judges argued that the ritualised nature of the punishment, given after several days and without parental consent, should qualify it as \\"degrading punishment\\". R (Williamson) v Secretary of State for Education and Employment (2005) was an unsuccessful challenge to the prohibition of corporal punishment contained in the Education Act 1996, by several headmasters of private Christian schools who argued that it was a breach of their religious freedom. In response to a 2008 poll of 6,162 UK teachers by the Times Educational Supplement, 22% of secondary school teachers and 16% of primary school teachers supported \\"the right to use corporal punishment in extreme cases\\". The National Union of Teachers said that it \\"could not support the views expressed by those in favour of hitting children\\".\\"A 'fifth of teachers back caning'\\". BBC News Online. 3 October 2008.Bloom, Adi (10 October 2008). \\"Survey whips up debate on caning\\", Times Educational Supplement (London). ===United States=== There is no federal law addressing corporal punishment in public or private schools. In 1977, the Supreme Court ruling in Ingraham v. Wright held that the Eighth Amendment clause prohibiting \\"cruel and unusual punishments\\" did not apply to school students, and that teachers could punish children without parental permission. As of 2019, 32 states and the District of Columbia have banned corporal punishment in public schools, though in some of these there is no explicit prohibition. Corporal punishment is also unlawful in private schools in Iowa and New Jersey. In 18 U.S. states, corporal punishment is lawful in both public and private schools.\\"Country report for USA\\" (November 2015). 'Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children. It is still common in some schools in the South, and more than 167,000 students were paddled in the 2011–2012 school year in American public schools. Students can be physically punished from kindergarten to the end of high school, meaning that even legal adults who have reached the age of majority are sometimes spanked by school officials. American legal scholars have argued that school paddling is unconstitutional and can cause lasting physical, emotional, and cognitive harm.See, e.g., Deana A. Pollard, Banning Corporal Punishment: A Constitutional Analysis, 52 Am. U. L. Rev. 447 (2002); Deana A. Pollard, Banning Child Corporal Punishment, 77 Tul. L.

Initially created for ex-service men, women and families after World War I, it continues to provide accommodation for 189 residents. The bowling green, Westfield Memorial Village ==History== After the Great War, a national debate was ignited concerning how disabled servicemen from the Great War would support themselves and their families if they could not return to their former trade because of their disabilities. Local newspapers also promoted the idea that 'the nation owes a debt it should be eager to discharge as far as that is possible'. It was from a strong backing of public support, including financial help and assistance in erecting the Westfield village, that a Committee for the promotion of a memorial village upon the Westfield site was appointed at Lancaster Town Hall in 1918, using the ideas of Thomas Mawson. In 1919 the Westfield Committee obtained charity status for the project, and published a brochure advertising their intentions, appealing for funds and organising an inaugural ceremony. The brochure explained the benefits and aims of the Westfield scheme, which were to erect a memorial, build cottages for the married disabled ex-servicemen, found a hostel for the unmarried men, and provide workshops and social amenities. It also claimed the village would not just meet difficulties of 'social reconstruction – the problem of the hour' but also provide a model of town planning on a small scale for the imitation of other towns. The local connection of the village is reflected in the proposed allocation system – Disabled veterans of the Kings Own Royal Regiment would have first refusal, followed by those of Lancaster District, with all overtones of charity to be strictly avoided . Herbert Storey believed that this memorial village should stand as a tribute to the gallantry and devotion of the men of this regiment and of Lancaster men and women of other branches and services. Within three weeks of the Armistice, 11 November 1918, Ashton Hall hosted a crowded meeting to decide how Lancaster should commemorate those who served in the Great War. Its concluding resolutions were that a permanent memorial should be established in Lancaster to those who had fallen. The Westfield War memorial village grand opening was 27 November 1924, with the war memorial statue being unveiled two years later; 4 August 1926. It commemorated all those who gave their lives or limbs for their country in the Great War, in particular the men of Lancaster, who served in the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster). Thomas Mawson, a renowned Landscape Architect born in Scorton, near Lancaster, derived the idea of memorial villages to commemorate the fallen in war from an article he read by William Hill, and expanded on this basic principle to include not just housing for the disabled ex-servicemen returning from the war, but also to give them employment in specially built workshops. This was a key addition, due to it being likely in a number of cases that the injuries sustained from war would hinder the ex-servicemen returning to their old occupations, and in some cases make it impossible. ===Criticisms of the idea=== Two key criticisms had arisen from the idea of a village for returning servicemen. The first was that 'inevitably a time would come when there would be no disabled people to live in the village, which may then become derelict'. The other was that the disabled ex-servicemen would not want to be segregated, nor wish to be placed in surroundings which would remind them daily of the Great War. This criticism in particular was taken up by the Ministry of Pensions, who had been unenthusiastic about Mawson's idea from its beginning. However, after overwhelming support and offers of assistance, the Westfield Committee was set up, and it soon became clear these two criticisms were not going to stand in the way of the erection of the village. This committee was made up of members such as the Mayor and Mayoress, councillors, Lords and Ladies, prominent local businessmen, members of the armed forces, reverends and doctors. This strong committee guaranteed the success of the scheme in Lancaster because they were able and willing to give financial support to the scheme. The Westfield Committee was also able to gain the support of such women as Mrs Lyell who had the time to dedicate to fundraising for the village. Mrs Lyell organised fundraising events such as what became known as 'The Lyell Golden Ballot', that raised over £20,000 for the village, which funded the erection of 31 cottages, including Lyell Terrace. The bodies that did prove hindrances to the Westfield Committee were the government, the Ministry of Labour and Trade Unions. The government's refusal of finance for the erection of the village, which was one of Thomas Mawson's 'must haves' was the main issue for the Westfield memorial village to go ahead. However, funding by donation proved to be enough to combat this problem. The Ministry of Labour began in the mid-1920s to restrict the output of the workshops to the promotion of building related skills, as opposed to making such things as watches, pipes and umbrellas which had been progressing steadily. Then, when hostility from local businesses and Trade Unions hit the workshops, they eventually had to be closed down. Local newspapers were constantly in support of the Westfield village; regularly publishing articles promoting the idea, such as one in the Lancashire Daily Post in November 1918 entitled \\"The Nation owes a debt it should be eager to discharge as far as that is possible\\". ===World War II=== War memorial The Second World War had an effect on the Westfield Village, as interest was once again renewed in it, and also a few extra tenants were placed on waiting list from that war. ==Statue memorial== The statue memorial in the centre of the village illustrates one soldier giving water to a wounded comrade, illustrating Lancaster's recognition of the efforts and sacrifices made by the men of Lancaster serving in the King's Own Royal Regiment. The sculpture is by the local artist and teacher Jennie Delahunt and was unveiled in 1926. ==Today== The Westfield war memorial village still exists today, with a waiting list of people wishing to move into the houses in the village; the war memorial statue still stands prominently in the centre of the village. Funding for the erection and maintenance of the village stems completely from donations made by the public. The village was leased in 1987 to a housing association for finance to modernise the houses. Priority is still given to those families of war victims. Each house in the village has today a plaque outside the front door with information regarding a particular battle or an individual who fought in the war, or a group of fundraisers who paid for the house to be built; in particular the first house built bears the name of Herbert Storey, who gave the Westfield land so that the project could go ahead. The greenery that is present all throughout the village, including the trees which line the streets, each of the gardens owned by their respective houses, and the bowling green signifies healing and rehabilitation, to which it was hoped would aid the recovery of the ex- servicemen living there, as planned by Thomas Mawson. Finally, facilities such as the bowling green and the social club were established as a sign of the effort made to help reconstruct the lives of the ex-servicemen, and also as a gesture of thanks from the people of Lancaster. ==SourcesBooks=== *Mawson, Thomas Hayton, An Imperial Obligation: Industrial Villages for Partially Disabled Soldiers & Sailors (London, Grant Richards Ltd, 1917) *Mawson, Thomas Hayton, The Life and Work of a Landscape Architect – An Autobiography of T.H.

The Bay Area Reporter noted that \\"over more than 30 years, he played a pivotal role in San Francisco's LGBT history.\\" He grew up in Sacramento, and graduated with a B.A. in education from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1971. ==LGBT activism== Wilson founded or co-founded many organizations, including the Gay Teachers Coalition; the Butterfly Brigade, which became the Castro Street Safety Patrol; San Francisco Gay Democratic Club, which became the Harvey Milk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Democratic Club; the Tenderloin AIDS Network, which became Tenderloin AIDS Resource Center; the PWA Coalition; Mobilization Against AIDS; a film festival that grew into the Frameline Film Festival; the AIDS Candlelight Vigil, which became the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial; the Committee to Monitor Poppers and ACT UP/Golden Gate, which became Survive AIDS. == Political and artistic career == With Tom Ammiano and Ron Lanza, Wilson co-founded the Gay Teachers Coalition in 1975 and lobbied against discrimination for gay teachers in the San Francisco schools. A leader in the 1977 anti-Briggs Initiative (No on 6) campaign, Wilson worked extensively with gay issues in the San Francisco Unified School District. He served on the Gay Youth Advocacy Council which founded Lavender Youth Recreation and Information Center (LYRIC). He also served on the San Francisco Human Rights Commission's Youth and Education Committee and also launched with Ammiano a gay speakers bureau to educate San Francisco high school and middle school students about gay and lesbian issues. In 1976 he helped found the Butterfly Brigade, Castro Street Safety Patrol, and Carry a Whistle Defense Campaign. Wilson was a founder of the Harvey Milk Gay Democratic Club. In 1978, he started a business partnership with fellow activist Ron Lanza, which led to leasing four Tenderloin hotels. He operated the Ambassador Hotel in San Francisco's Tenderloin through 1996 and it became a model of harm reduction services housing PWAs. In 1982, Lanza and Wilson created the Valencia Rose Cafe, an influential gay cabaret and performance venue, which featured musicians and comedians such as Marga Gomez, Whoopi Goldberg, Lea DeLaria, and Ammiano. With Glenda Hope and Dennis Conkin he founded Tenderloin AIDS Network that led to the Tenderloin AIDS Resource Center (TARC). Wilson managed the TARC drop-in center, providing support to the homeless and PWAs. He was diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma in 1987. He continued his activism in AIDS and participated in many demonstrations. In 1981 he founded the Committee to Monitor Poppers to educate the gay community about the supposed hazards of using poppers. Wilson co-authored a book with John Lauritsen entitled Death Rush: Poppers and AIDS (New York: Pagan Press, 1986), in which they conjectured a connection between poppers and AIDS, especially Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer. In 1999, Wilson was an instigator of efforts to gather signatures to qualify Ammiano as a write-in candidate for the 1999 San Francisco mayoral election. Ammiano got enough votes in the general election to force incumbent mayor Willie Brown into a runoff.

It was also used as a theatre due to its appropriate structure. The Odeon buildings had four construction periods: from the 2nd century AD (during the reign of Hadrian) when it was initially built to the 4th century AD when it was abandoned. The existence of such a building in ancient Plovdiv is a sign for the importance of Philippopolis as a cultural and political center. == Location == The Odeon of Philippopolis was discovered near General Gurko street in the northeastern corner of the Roman forum in Plovdiv. The natural connection between the odeon and the forum was destroyed during the construction of Maria Luiza blvd. and the tunnel under the main pedestrian street of Plovdiv. == The Odeon == Forum Plan of the Odeon The Odeon was a rectangular building which comprise typical elements for roofed theatres like skene, orchestra and cavea. The skene is narrow and its length spreads through the entire width of the cavea. The proskenion (the podium in front of the skene) was 1,5m higher than the level of the orchestra. The skene was two stories high built in Corinthian order system of Roman type which was typical for the period. Typically for a theatre buildings, vertical grooves were found in the skene's wall which indicate that a structure for raising and lowering a curtain probably existed. The height of the construction that bears the cavea was considerable. The Odeon The orchestra had a horseshoe shape which was typical for Roman provinces. In the last construction period of the Odeon, however, size of the orchestra was reduced and its shape became semicircular. The floor was made of large marble slabs surrounded by marble orthostates near the cavea. A wall around the Eastern end of the orchestra supported the lowest part the cavea. The cavea surrounds the Eastern side of orchestra and had between 300-350 spectator seats www.oldplovdiv.com www.plovdivbg.info arranged in step-like shape for better visibility. A vaulted structure with numerous vaulted spaces in truncated cone shape supported the cavea. A similar structure was used for the construction of the spectator area of the Colosseum in Rome. The cavea is separated from the skene via parodoi. == Conservation and restoration == The Odeon of Philippopolis was discovered in 1988 by the archeologist Z. Dimitrov and Maya Martinova. In 1995 the ancient monument was listed as a cultural value of national significance. Conservation works were carried out in 2002 with the financial support from the Leventis foundation.

This day is observed each year on November 15. It was started in 1981 by PEN International's Writers in Prison Committee. In addition to increasing the public's awareness of persecuted writers in general, PEN uses the Day of the Imprisoned Writer to direct attention to several specific persecuted or imprisoned writers and their individual circumstances. Each of the selected writers is from a different part of the world, and each case represents circumstances of repression that occur when governments or other entities in power feel threatened by what writers have written. On this day, the general public is encouraged to take action—in the form of donations and letters of appeal—on behalf of the selected writers. The day also serves to commemorate all of the writers killed since the previous year's Day of the Imprisoned Writer. Between November 15, 2007 and November 15, 2008, at least 39 writers from around the world were killed in circumstances that appeared to be related to their professions. == Highlighted writers from past observances== 2013 * Kunchok Tsephel Gopey Tsang; internet writer and website editor, China - Tibet * Dina Meza; human rights defender and journalist, Honduras * Zahra Rahnavard; author and political activist, Iran * Rodney Sieh; newspaper founder, publisher and editor-in-chief, Liberia * Fazıl Say; writer, composer and musician, Turkey 2012 * Muharrem Erbey; human rights lawyer and writer, Turkey * Shiva Nazar Ahari; journalist, activist and blogger; Iran * Ericson Acosta, poet, songwriter and activist, Philippines * Eskinder Nega; journalist and blogger, Ethiopia * Regina Martínez; journalist, Mexico 2011 * Abduljalil al- Singace; blogger and human rights defender, Bahrain * Reeyot Alemu; opposition journalist, Ethiopia * Nedim Sener and Ahmet Şık; writers in prison, Turkey * Susana Chavez Castillo; poet and human rights defender, Mexico * Tashi Rabten (pen-name Te’urang); dissident writer, Tibet 2010 * Robert Mintya; newspaper editor, Cameroon * Hossein Derakhshan; blogger, Iran * Bladimir Antuna (full name José Bladimir Antuna García); crime reporter, Mexico * Tal Al-Mallouhi; blogger and poet, Syria * Dilmurod Saidov; journalist, Uzbekistan 2009 * Lapiro De Mbanga; singer-songwriter, Cameroon * Liu Xiaobo; dissident writer, China * Maziar Bahari; journalist, editor, playwright and film-maker, Iran * Miguel Ángel Gutiérrez Ávila; anthropologist, author and activist, Mexico * Natalia Estemirova; journalist and human rights defender, Russia 2008 * Eynullah Fatullayev; journalist, Azerbaijan * Melissa Rocío Patiño Hinostroza; student and poet, Peru * Mohammad Sadiq Kaboudvand; journalist, Iran * Tsering Woeser; writer and poet, China * Writers, Cast and Crew of The Crocodile of Zambezi; Zimbabwe 2007 * Normando Hernanez Gonzalez; journalist, Cuba * Jamshid Karimov; journalist, Ouzbekistan * Fatou Jaw Manneh; journalist, Gambia * Yaghoub Yadali; novelist, Iran * Zargana Maung Thura; poet and comedian, Burma 2006 * Hrant Dink; newspaper editor, Turkey * Wesenseged Gebrekidan; journalist, Ethiopia * Lydia Cacho; writer, Mexico * Yang Xiaoqing; internet journalist, China 2005 * Orhan Pamuk; writer, Turkey * Shi Tao; poet and activist, China * Dr. Roya Toloui; writer and women’s rights activist, Iran * Paul Kamara; journalist, Sierra Leone * Victor Rolando Arroyo; journalist, Cuba 2004 * Amir-Abbas Fakhravar; writer, Iran * Rakhim Esenov; writer, Turkmenistan * Guy-André Kieffer; journalist, Ivory Coast * Roberto Javier Mora García, Francisco Ortiz Franco, and Francisco Arratia Saldierna; journalists, murdered in Mexico ==See also== *Reporters Without Borders == References  External links == * International PEN * PEN American Center * PEN Canada * English PEN * http://www.humanrights- geneva.info/World-Day-of-the-imprisoned-writer,2451 * http://www.echoworld.com/B07/B0711/B0711_PEN1.htm Category:Civil awareness days Category:November observances Category:International observances ","title":"Day of the Imprisoned Writer"},{"id":"20412019","text":"Ilse (Intrator) Stanley (née Ilse Davidsohn), ( – ), was a German Jewish woman who, with the collusion of a handful of people ranging from Nazi members of the Gestapo to other Jewish civilians, secured the release of 412 Jewish prisoners from Nazi concentration camps between 1936 and 1938.Auschwitz: Geschichte, Rezeption und Wirkung (Jahrbuch 1996 zur Geschichte und Wirkung des Holocaust), Fritz Bauer Institut, Frankfurt/Main u.a. Campus-Verlag, 1996 (, ) (410 pages) mentions Ilse Intrator Stanley on pp. 384 and 401Reference to Ilse's \\"This Is Your Life\\" program. This episode can be watched at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYQTBwgGgdw . During that time she also helped countless others leave the country while it was still possible for German Jews to do so legally. This story was sketched publicly in 1955 on Ralph Edwards's television program, This Is Your Life, and is told in vivid detail in Stanley's autobiographical book, The Unforgotten, which was published in the United States in 1957. ==Early life== Ilse was born in 1906 in the small mining town of Gleiwitz, Germany. The family moved to Berlin when her father, Magnus Davidsohn, was named as the main cantorAlthough several bibliographic mentions of Ilse's book, The Unforgotten, say she was the daughter of a rabbi, that is erroneous: Magnus was actually a cantor, per Belsize Square Synagogue and The Fasanenstrasse Synagogue  The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot. at the new Fasanenstraße Synagogue being built in the Charlottenburg section of Berlin. The first time she entered the still- unfinished building, Ilse fell deeply in love with this synagogue (which she called \\"my House\\") and her life became thoroughly entwined with this synagogue. As a child of six she had the honor of presenting flowers to the German Emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm, when he came to dedicate the new temple, which opened on August 26, 1912. Ilse graduated from the Auguste-Victoria-Schule (in Charlottenburg) at the age of fifteen. After graduation she continued to study theatre history and theatre science at the Theatre Science Institute and at the Berlin University, while working part-time as a bookkeeper and office manager. Later she studied acting and directing at the Max Reinhardt's Deutsches Theater (Berlin) and elsewhere. Using the stage name \\"Ilse Davis\\",Unforgotten, p.70 her primary interest was in acting on the stage, although she also played bit parts in several films, including Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Her interest and ambition broadened to include directing and producing, and in 1929, just after turning twentythree, she opened her own theatre organization. In this endeavor she handled everything from theatre production, promotion and publicity, to public relations; she also ran an Academy where entrants were taught acting, directing, and production.Much of the information in this paragraph comes from a résumé that Ilse prepared about 1953. Unpublished. Her acting career ended abruptly in 1933, however, as increasing pressure was put on the Jews by Hitler and his Third Reich and she was no longer able to rent theatres and concert halls. For the next three years, until 1936, she gave recital tours, speaking to her fellow Jews \\"wherever I was permitted to speak.\\"Unforgotten, p. 62 ==Concentration camps== Unable to work at what she loved, and having no hope for matters to improve in the foreseeable future, Ilse became quite discouraged. In 1936, an unexpected set of circumstances led to her making a trip to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, posing as a social worker and under an assumed name. With falsified release papers, she secured the liberation of her cousin's husband. : The story of how Ilse accomplished this is interesting enough to tell in full: : In 1936, a cousin of Ilse's came to Berlin to consult a lawyer about getting her husband released from a concentration camp. The cousin had not yet realized the seriousness of Germany's situation, in which law and order was simply not operating. In the ensuing conversation, both women became distraught. After much soul-searching and a visit to her beloved Synagogue, Ilse reached a life-changing decision. Pitting her faith in the \\"goodness even in people who have been taught nothing but evil\\" p.68 against the odds of failure, she took her cousin to the Gestapo headquarters to look for help. : As they walked the halls with appropriately downcast eyes, they were stopped by an officer who took Ilse aside. As he questioned her closely about \\"Davis\\" and then \\"Ilse\\", she recognized \\"Fritz\\" (whose real name was Hans)—a theatre policeman from her acting days, for whose younger sister she had arranged a gala weekend in Berlin in honor of the girl's 16th birthday. : The two met later in a café, and Fritz explained to Ilse a plan he had devised. In the guise of a social worker and using the alias \\"Feldern\\", Ilse would hand-carry the release papers to the concentration camp and pick up the prisoner. Going in person had the essential element of surprise, which greatly increased the likelihood that the camp would actually release the prisoner, who might otherwise be quietly killed instead of released, particularly if he was in \\"unpresentable\\" condition. : The rules were stringent: a trusted Gentile chauffeur would drive Ilse to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp where her cousin's husband was held. She would enter alone, present the papers, and wait for the prisoner to be brought to her. If questioned about the papers, she would give the name of a (cooperating) high-placed Nazi lawyer, but say no more. No one must know when or where she was going, but a trusted, distant acquaintance—not a family member—would know when she was leaving and when to expect her return. If she did not return by the specified time, he was to call Fritz. No written record of any of her doings, or her information, could be kept longer than a day. Above all, under no circumstances must she ever show even the slightest reaction to any sight that might greet her on these trips. : She went, and she brought the prisoner home. Having succeeded with this ruse on her first attempt, she continued rescue work for two more years. In order to have a cover-up office from which to do her work, and to provide a legitimate front for getting people out of Germany, she took a volunteer position with the vice-president of the Jewish Community, whom she calls \\"Mr. Gross\\" in her book.Unforgotten, p. 82 She worked in the Passports Office, on \\"the most hopeless\\" cases. In addition to working out passport issues for people and enabling many Jews to leave the country, she continued her trips to the camps, ultimately securing the release of 412 people before the devastating events of Kristallnacht (November 9, 1938). ==Kristallnacht and after: late 1938 and 1939== After Kristallnacht, when more than 200 synagogues all over Germany—including Ilse's beloved \\"House\\"—were torched and destroyed, the situation worsened dramatically. By 1939 the Jewish population of Berlin, which had numbered 160,000 in 1933, had dwindled to 75,000. Trips to the camps were out of the question, but Ilse continued helping Jews leave the country legally. She kept in contact with \\"Fritz\\", and when the Gestapo began interviewing people planning to leave Germany in order to try to prevent them from leaving, he found a way to warn her. Finally, very reluctantly, Ilse realized that she, along with her family, needed to leave Germany. They left separately: first her father, in March 1939, then her husband, then Ilse and her son Manfred. Five days before Ilse's planned departure, her mother was summoned to the Gestapo on Alexanderplatz. Ilse went in her stead. (Once again, her acting past unexpectedly surfaced: the younger of the two interrogators recognized her.) After her mother's situation was clarified, Ilse made a near-fatal mistake: she mentioned her own impending departure. Questioning ensued, and, having nothing to lose, Ilse spoke quietly and openly. She spoke of living in fear since Kristallnacht, and of the need to live without such fear. Then she talked about presenting flowers to the Emperor at the age of six, about Kaiser Wilhelm's abdication and flight from Germany on November 9, 1918, and about Kristallnacht, which happened exactly twenty years after the Emperor's flight (November 9, 1938). One of her two interrogators broke down sobbing.This story is told in detail in The Unforgotten, pp. 149–161. She was allowed to leave the office, and three days later, she and Manfred left for England. After a brief stop there, they sailed from Southampton on the SS Deutschland on August 4, 1939, arriving in the U.S. on August 11. ==Life in the United States== In her later years she moved to Boston, and then to New Hampshire, where she worked as an auctioneer.informal (and incomplete) story of her New Hampshire years She died in Boston in 1970 and is buried in Gilford, New Hampshire in the Smith Meeting House cemetery.www.findagrave.com Information on burial ==Recognition== Ilse's work extracting prisoners from the concentration camps has not received much public recognition. A notable exception to this is the 1955 episode of the American television program This is Your Life, featuring Ilse and in particular her rescue work. On that program she was reunited with her father, Magnus Davidsohn, who had been living in England since he left Germany in 1939. ==Writings by Ilse Stanley== * See a particularly nice Amazon customer review. * :: Reprinted in November/December 1992 issue, vol. 264:6. * * ==References and notesFurther reading== * Weimar Republic (historical background on Germany between 1916 and 1933) * * Shandler, Jeffrey: While America Watches: Television and the Holocaust in the United States, from 1945 to the Present.

Oral and written descriptions of Muhammad are readily accepted by all traditions of Islam, but there is disagreement about visual depictions. The Quran does not explicitly forbid images of Muhammad, but there are a few hadith (supplemental teachings) that have explicitly prohibited Muslims from creating visual depictions of figures.What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam, John L. Esposito - 2011 p. 14; for hadith see Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith: 7.834, 7.838, 7.840, 7.844, 7.846. It is agreed on all sides that there is no authentic visual tradition (pictures created during Muhammad's lifetime) as to the appearance of Muhammad, although there are early legends of portraits of him, and written physical descriptions whose authenticity is often accepted. The question of whether images in Islamic art, including those depicting Muhammad, can be considered as religious art remains a matter of contention among scholars.Gruber (2010), p. 27. They appear in illustrated books that are normally works of history or poetry, including those with religious subjects; the Quran is never illustrated: \\"context and intent are essential to understanding Islamic pictorial art. The Muslim artists creating images of Muhammad, and the public who beheld them, understood that the images were not objects of worship. Nor were the objects so decorated used as part of religious worship\\".Cosman, Pelner and Jones, Linda Gale. Handbook to life in the medieval world, p. 623, Infobase Publishing, , However, scholars concede that such images have \\"a spiritual element\\", and were also sometimes used in informal religious devotions celebrating the day of the Mi'raj.Gruber (2010), p.27 (quote) and 43. Many visual depictions only show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame; other images, notably from before about 1500, show his face.Gruber (2005), pp. 239, 247–253. With the notable exception of modern-day Iran, depictions of Muhammad were rare, never numerous in any community or era throughout Islamic history, and appeared almost exclusively in the private medium of Persian and other miniature book illustration.Devotion in pictures: Muslim popular iconography – Introduction to the exhibition, University of Bergen. The key medium of public religious art in Islam was and is calligraphy. In Ottoman Turkey the hilya developed as a decorated visual arrangement of texts about Muhammad that was displayed as a portrait might be. Visual images of Muhammad in the non-Islamic West have always been infrequent. In the Middle Ages they were mostly hostile, and most often appear in illustrations of Dante's poetry. In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, Muhammad was sometimes depicted, typically in a more neutral or heroic light; the depictions began to encounter protests from Muslims. In the age of the Internet, a handful of caricature depictions printed in the European press have caused global protests and controversy and been associated with violence. ==Background== In Islam, although nothing in the Quran explicitly bans images, some supplemental hadith explicitly ban the drawing of images of any living creature; other hadith tolerate images, but never encourage them. Hence, most Muslims avoid visual depictions of Muhammad or any other prophet such as Moses or Abraham. Most Sunni Muslims believe that visual depictions of all the prophets of Islam should be prohibited and are particularly averse to visual representations of Muhammad.Devotion in pictures: Muslim popular iconography – The prophet Muhammad, University of Bergen The key concern is that the use of images can encourage idolatry. In Shia Islam, however, images of Muhammad are quite common nowadays, even though Shia scholars historically were against such depictions.Thomas Walker Arnold says \\"It was not merely Sunni schools of law but Shia jurists also who fulminated against this figured art. Because the Persians are Shiites, many Europeans writers have assumed that the Shia sect had not the same objection to representing living being as the rival set of the Sunni; but such an opinion ignores the fact that Shiisum did not become the state church in Persia until the rise of the Safivid dynasty at the beginning of the 16th century.\\" Still, many Muslims who take a stricter view of the supplemental traditions will sometimes challenge any depiction of Muhammad, including those created and published by non-Muslims. Many major religions have experienced times during their history when images of their religious figures were forbidden. In Judaism, one of the Ten Commandments states \\"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image\\", while in the Christian New Testament all covetousness (greed) is defined as idolatry. In Byzantine Christianity during the periods of Iconoclasm in the 8th century, and again during the 9th century, visual representations of sacred figures were forbidden, and only the Cross could be depicted in churches. The visual representation of Jesus and other religious figures remains a concern in parts of stricter Protestant Christianity. ==Portraiture of Muhammad in Islamic literature== A number of hadith and other writings of the early Islamic period include stories in which portraits of Muhammad appear. Abu Hanifa Dinawari, Ibn al-Faqih, Ibn Wahshiyya and Abu Nu\`aym tell versions of a story in which the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius is visited by two Meccans. He shows them a cabinet, handed down to him from Alexander the Great and originally created by God for Adam, each of whose drawers contains a portrait of a prophet. They are astonished to see a portrait of Muhammad in the final drawer. Sadid al-Din al-Kazaruni tells a similar story in which the Meccans are visiting the king of China. Kisa'i tells that God did indeed give portraits of the prophets to Adam. Ibn Wahshiyya and Abu Nu'ayn tell a second story in which a Meccan merchant visiting Syria is invited to a Christian monastery where a number of sculptures and paintings depict prophets and saints. There he sees the images of Muhammad and Abu Bakr, as yet unidentified by the Christians. In an 11th- century story, Muhammad is said so have sat for a portrait by an artist retained by Sassanid king Kavadh II. The king liked the portrait so much that he placed it on his pillow. Later, Al-Maqrizi tells a story in which Muqawqis, ruler of Egypt, meets with Muhammad's envoy. He asks the envoy to describe Muhammad and checks the description against a portrait of an unknown prophet which he has on a piece of cloth. The description matches the portrait. In a 17th-century Chinese story, the king of China asks to see Muhammad, but Muhammad instead sends his portrait. The king is so enamoured of the portrait that he is converted to Islam, at which point the portrait, having done its job, disappears. ==Depiction by MuslimsVerbal descriptions=== Hilye by Hâfiz Osman (1642–1698) In one of the earliest sources, Ibn Sa'd's Kitab al- Tabaqat al-Kabir, there are numerous verbal descriptions of Muhammad. One description sourced to Ali ibn Abi Talib is as follows: : The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, is neither too short nor too tall. His hair are neither curly nor straight, but a mixture of the two. He is a man of black hair and large skull. His complexion has a tinge of redness. His shoulder bones are broad and his palms and feet are fleshy. He has long al-masrubah which means hair growing from neck to navel. He is of long eye-lashes, close eyebrows, smooth and shining fore-head and long space between two shoulders. When he walks he walks inclining as if coming down from a height. [...] I never saw a man like him before him or after him.Ibn Sa'd – Kitabh al-Tabaqat al-Kabir, as translated by S. Moinul and H.K. Ghazanfar, Kitab Bhavan, New Delhi, n.d. From the Ottoman period onwards such texts have been presented on calligraphic hilya panels (Turkish: hilye, pl. hilyeler), commonly surrounded by an elaborate frame of illuminated decoration and either included in books or, more often, muraqqas or albums, or sometimes placed in wooden frames so that they can hang on a wall.Gruber (2005), p.231-232 The elaborated form of the calligraphic tradition was founded in the 17th century by the Ottoman calligrapher Hâfiz Osman. While containing a concrete and artistically appealing description of Muhammad's appearance, they complied with the strictures against figurative depictions of Muhammad, leaving his appearance to the viewer's imagination. Several parts of the complex design were named after parts of the body, from the head downwards, indicating the explicit intention of the hilya as a substitute for a figurative depiction. The Ottoman hilye format customarily starts with a basmala, shown on top, and is separated in the middle by : \\"And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds\\". Four compartments set around the central one often contain the names of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali, each followed by \\"radhi Allahu anhu\\" (\\"may God be pleased with him\\").

Such inscriptions are normally in Arabic, and may rearrange or repeat forms, or add a blessing or honorific, or for example the word \\"messenger\\" or a contraction of it. The range of ways of representing Muhammad's name is considerable, including ambigrams; he is also frequently symbolised by a rose. The more elaborate versions relate to other Islamic traditions of special forms of calligraphy such as those writing the names of God, and the secular tughra or elaborate monogram of Ottoman rulers.

Persian miniature Throughout Islamic history, depictions of Muhammad in Islamic art were rare. Even so, there exists a \\"notable corpus of images of Muhammad produced, mostly in the form of manuscript illustrations, in various regions of the Islamic world from the thirteenth century through modern times\\".Gruber (2005), p. 240-241 Depictions of Muhammad date back to the start of the tradition of Persian miniatures as illustrations in books. The illustrated book from the Persianate world (Warka and Gulshah, Topkapi Palace Library H. 841, attributed to Konya 1200–1250) contains the two earliest known Islamic depictions of Muhammad.Grabar, p. 19; Gruber (2005), p. 235 (from where the date range), Blair, Sheila S., The Development of the Illustrated Book in Iran, Muqarnas, Vol. 10, Essays in Honor of Oleg Grabar (1993), p. 266, BRILL, JSTOR says \\"c. 1250\\" This book dates to before or just around the time of the Mongol invasion of Anatolia in the 1240s, and before the campaigns against Persia and Iraq of the 1250s, which destroyed great numbers of books in libraries. Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, generally human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands (such as in literature, science, and history); as early as the 8th century, such art flourished during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 749 - 1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia). Christiane Gruber traces a development from \\"veristic\\" images showing the whole body and face, in the 13th to 15th centuries, to more \\"abstract\\" representations in the 16th to 19th centuries, the latter including the representation of Muhammad by a special type of calligraphic representation, with the older types also remaining in use.Gruber (2005), 229, and throughout An intermediate type, first found from about 1400, is the \\"inscribed portrait\\" where the face of Muhammad is blank, with \\"Ya Muhammad\\" (\\"O Muhammad\\") or a similar phrase written in the space instead; these may be related to Sufi thought. In some cases the inscription appears to have been an underpainting that would later be covered by a face or veil, so a pious act by the painter, for his eyes alone, but in others it was intended to be seen. According to Gruber, a good number of these paintings later underwent iconoclastic mutilations, in which the facial features of Muhammad were scratched or smeared, as Muslim views on the acceptability of veristic images changed.Gruber (2005), 229 A number of extant Persian manuscripts representing Muhammad date from the Ilkhanid period under the new Mongol rulers, including a Marzubannama dating to 1299. The Ilkhanid MS Arab 161 of 1307/8 contains 25 illustrations found in an illustrated version of Al-Biruni's The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries, of which five include depictions Muhammad, including the two concluding images, the largest and most accomplished in the manuscript, which emphasize the relation of Muhammad and \`Ali according to Shi\`ite doctrine.Gruber (2010), pp.27-28 According to Christiane Gruber, other works use images to promote Sunni Islam, such as a set of Mi'raj illustrations (MS H 2154) in the early 14th century,Gruber (2010), quote p. 43; generally pp.29-45 although other historians have dated the same illustrations to the Jalayrid period of Shia rulers. Muhammad, shown with a veiled face and halo, at Mount Hira (16th-century Ottoman illustration of the Siyer-i Nebi) Depictions of Muhammad are also found in Persian manuscripts in the following Timurid and Safavid dynasties, and Turkish Ottoman art in the 14th to 17th centuries, and beyond. Perhaps the most elaborate cycle of illustrations of Muhammad's life is the copy, completed in 1595, of the 14th-century biography Siyer-i Nebi commissioned by the Ottoman sultan Murat III for his son, the future Mehmed III, containing over 800 illustrations. Probably the commonest narrative scene represented is the Mi'raj; according to Gruber, \\"There exist countless single-page paintings of the meʿrāj included in the beginnings of Persian and Turkish romances and epic stories produced from the beginning of the 15th century to the 20th century\\".Gruber (Iranica) These images were also used in celebrations of the anniversary of the Mi'raj on 27 Rajab, when the accounts were recited aloud to male groups: \\"Didactic and engaging, oral stories of the ascension seem to have had the religious goal of inducing attitudes of praise among their audiences\\". Such practices are most easily documented in the 18th and 19th centuries, but manuscripts from much earlier appear to have fulfilled the same function.Gruber (2010), p.43 Otherwise a large number of different scenes may be represented at times, from Muhammad's birth to the end of his life, and his existence in Paradise.The birth is rare, but appears in an early manuscript in Edinburgh  Halo  In the earliest depictions Muhammad may be shown with or without a halo, the earliest halos being round in the style of Christian art,Arnold, 95 but before long a flaming halo or aureole in the Buddhist or Chinese tradition becomes more common than the circular form found in the West, when a halo is used. A halo or flame may surround only his head, but often his whole body, and in some images the body itself cannot be seen for the halo. This \\"luminous\\" form of representation avoided the issues caused by \\"veristic\\" images, and could be taken to convey qualities of Muhammad's person described in texts.Gruber, 230, 236 If the body is visible, the face may be covered with a veil (see gallery for examples of both types). This form of representation, which began at the start of the Safavid period in Persia,Brend, Barbara. Islamic Art, p. 161, British Museum Press. was done out of reverence and respect. Other prophets of Islam, and Muhammad's wives and relations, may be treated in similar ways if they also appear. T. W. Arnold (1864–1930), an early historian of Islamic art, stated that \\"Islam has never welcomed painting as a handmaid of religion as both Buddhism and Christianity have done. Mosques have never been decorated with religious pictures, nor has a pictorial art been employed for the instruction of the heathen or for the edification of the faithful.\\" Comparing Islam to Christianity, he also writes: \\"Accordingly, there has never been any historical tradition in the religious painting of Islam – no artistic development in the representation of accepted types – no schools of painters of religious subjects; least of all has there been any guidance on the part of leaders of religious thought corresponding to that of ecclesiastical authorities in the Christian Church.\\" Images of Muhammad remain controversial to the present day, and are not considered acceptable in many countries in the Middle East. For example, in 1963 an account by a Turkish author of a Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca was banned in Pakistan because it contained reproductions of miniatures showing Muhammad unveiled.Schimmel, Annemarie, Deciphering the signs of God: a phenomenological approach to Islam, p.45, n. 86, SUNY Press, 1994, , File:Siyer-i Nebi 223b.jpgBirth of Muhammad, from Siyer-i Nebi (1595), an Ottoman manuscript, probably by Nakkaş Osman.

The Iranian Shi'ism seems more tolerant on this point than Sunnite orthodoxy. In Iran, depictions have considerable acceptance to the present day, and may be found in the modern forms of the poster and postcard.Gruber (2010), p.253, illustrates a postcard bought in 2001. Since the late 1990s, experts in Islamic iconography discovered images, printed on paper in Iran, portraying Mohammed as a teenager wearing a turban. There are several variants, all show the same juvenile face, identified by an inscription such as \\"Muhammad, the Messenger of God\\", or a more detailed legend referring to an episode in the life of Muhammad and the supposed origin of the image. Some Iranian versions of these posters attributed the original depiction to a Bahira, a Christian monk who met the young Muhammad in Syria. By crediting the image to a Christian and predating it to the time before Muhammad became a prophet, the manufacturers of the image exonerate themselves from any wrongdoing. The motif was taken from a photograph of a young Tunisian taken by the Germans Rudolf Franz Lehnert and Ernst Heinrich Landrock in 1905 or 1906, which had been printed in high editions on picture post cards till 1921.Pierre Centlivres, Micheline Centlivres-Demont: Une étrange rencontre. La photographie orientaliste de Lehnert et Landrock et l'image iranienne du prophète Mahomet, Études photographiques Nr. 17, November 2005 (in French) This depiction has been popular in Iran as a form of curiosity. In Tehran, a mural depicting the prophet – his face veiled – riding Buraq was installed at a public road intersection in 2008, the only mural of its kind in a Muslim-majority country.Christiane Gruber: Images of the Prophet In and Out of Modernity: The Curious Case of a 2008 Mural in Tehran, in See also and . ===Cinema=== Very few films have been made about Muhammad. The 1976 film The Message, also known as Mohammad, Messenger of God, focused on other persons and never directly showed Muhammad or most members of his family. A devotional cartoon called Muhammad: The Last Prophet was released in 2004. An Iranian film directed by Majid Majidi was released in 2015 named Muhammad. It is the first part of the trilogy film series on Muhammad by Majid Majidi. While Sunni Muslims have always explicitly prohibited the depiction of Muhammad on film, contemporary Shi'a scholars have taken a more relaxed attitude, stating that it is permissible to depict Muhammad, even in television or movies, if done with respect. ==Depiction by non-Muslims== Western representations of Muhammad were very rare until the explosion of images following the invention of the printing press; he is shown in a few medieval images, normally in an unflattering manner, often influenced by his brief mention in Dante's Divine Comedy. Muhammad sometimes figures in Western depictions of groups of influential people in world history. Such depictions tend to be favourable or neutral in intent; one example can be found at the United States Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. Created in 1935, the frieze includes major historical lawgivers, and places Muhammad alongside Hammurabi, Moses, Confucius, and others. In 1997, a controversy erupted surrounding the frieze, and tourist materials have since been edited to describe the depiction as \\"a well-intentioned attempt by the sculptor to honor Muhammad\\" that \\"bears no resemblance to Muhammad.\\" In 1955, a statue of Muhammad was removed from a courthouse in New York City after the ambassadors of Indonesia, Pakistan, and Egypt requested its removal. The extremely rare representations of Muhammad in monumental sculpture are especially likely to be offensive to Muslims, as the statue is the classic form for idols, and a fear of any hint of idolatry is the basis of Islamic prohibitions. Islamic art has almost always avoided large sculptures of any subject, especially free-standing ones; only a few animals are known, mostly fountain-heads, like those in the Lion Court of the Alhambra; the Pisa Griffin is perhaps the largest. In 1997, the Council on American–Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy group in the United States, wrote to United States Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist requesting that the sculpted representation of Muhammad on the north frieze inside the Supreme Court building be removed or sanded down. The court rejected CAIR's request.MSN : \\"How the “Ban” on Images of Muhammad Came to Be\\" by Jackie Bischof January 19, 2015. There have also been numerous book illustrations showing Muhammad. Dante, in The Divine Comedy: Inferno, placed Muhammad in Hell, with his entrails hanging out (Canto 28): :No barrel, not even one where the hoops and staves go every which way, was ever split open like one frayed Sinner I saw, ripped from chin to where we fart below. :His guts hung between his legs and displayed His vital organs, including that wretched sack Which converts to shit whatever gets conveyed down the gullet. :As I stared at him he looked back And with his hands pulled his chest open, Saying, \\"See how I split open the crack in myself! See how twisted and broken Mohammed is! Before me walks Ali, his face Cleft from chin to crown, grief–stricken.\\" This scene was sometimes shown in illustrations of the Divina Commedia before modern times. Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century fresco Last Judgement by Giovanni da Modena and drawing on Dante, in the Church of San Petronio, Bologna, Italy. and artwork by Salvador Dalí, Auguste Rodin, William Blake, and Gustave Doré.

Die Berufung Mohammeds durch den Engel Gabriel by Theodor Hosemann, 1847, published by Spiegel in 1999 In a story on morals at the end of the millennium in December 1999, the German news magazine Der Spiegel printed on the same page pictures of “moral apostles” Muhammad, Jesus, Confucius, and Immanuel Kant. In the subsequent weeks, the magazine received protests, petitions and threats against publishing the picture of Muhammad. The Turkish TV-station Show TV broadcast the telephone number of an editor who then received daily calls.Terror am Telefon, Spiegel, February 7, 2000 Nadeem Elyas, leader of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany said that the picture should not be printed again in order to avoid hurting the feelings of Muslims intentionally. Elyas recommended to whiten the face of Muhammad instead.Carolin Emcke: Fanatiker sind leicht verführbar, Interview with Nadeem Elyas, February 7, 2000 In June 2001, the Spiegel with consideration of Islamic laws published a picture of Muhammed with a whitened face on its title page.6\\\\. Februar 2006 Betr.: Titel, Spiegel, 6 February 6, 2006 The same picture of Muhammad by Hosemann had been published by the magazine once before in 1998 in a special edition on Islam, but then without evoking similar protests.Spiegel Special 1, 1998, page 76 In 2002, Italian police reported that they had disrupted a terrorist plot to destroy a church in Bologna, which contains a 15th-century fresco depicting an image of Muhammad (see above). Examples of depictions of Muhammad being altered include a 1940 mural at the University of Utah having the name of Muhammad removed from beneath the painting in 2000 at the request of Muslim students. ===Cartoons=== Controversial cartoons of Muhammad, first published in Jyllands-Posten in September 2005. In 1990, a Muhammad caricature was published in Indonesian magazine, Senang, which followed by an instant closure of the magazine. In 2005, Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published a set of editorial cartoons, many of which depicted Muhammad. In late 2005 and early 2006, Danish Muslim organizations ignited a controversy through public protests and by spreading knowledge of the publication of the cartoons. According to John Woods, Islamic history professor at the University of Chicago, it was not simply the depiction of Muhammad that was offensive, but the implication that Muhammad was somehow a supporter of terrorism. In Sweden, an online caricature competition was announced in support of Jyllands- Posten, but Foreign Affairs Minister Laila Freivalds and the Swedish Security Service pressured the internet service provider to shut the page down. In 2006, when her involvement was revealed to the public, she had to resign. On 12 February 2008 the Danish police arrested three men alleged to be involved in a plot to assassinate Kurt Westergaard, one of the cartoonists.Staff. Danish cartoons 'plotters' held BBC, 12 February 2008 Muhammad appeared in the 2001 South Park episode \\"Super Best Friends\\". The image was later removed from the 2006 episode \\"Cartoon Wars\\" and the 2010 episodes \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" due to controversies regarding Muhammad cartoons in European newspapers. In 2006, the controversial American animated television comedy program South Park, which had previously depicted Muhammad as a superhero character in the July 4, 2001 episode \\"Super Best Friends\\" and has depicted Muhammad in the opening sequence since that episode, attempted to satirize the Danish newspaper incident. In the episode, \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\", they intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to Peter Griffin, a character from the Fox animated series Family Guy. However, Comedy Central, who airs South Park, rejected the scene, citing concerns of violent protests in the Islamic world. The creators of South Park reacted by instead satirizing Comedy Central's double standard for broadcast acceptability by including a segment of \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\" in which American president George W. Bush and Jesus defecate on the flag of the United States. The Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy began in July 2007 with a series of drawings by Swedish artist Lars Vilks which depicted Muhammad as a roundabout dog. Several art galleries in Sweden declined to show the drawings, citing security concerns and fear of violence. The controversy gained international attention after the Örebro-based regional newspaper Nerikes Allehanda published one of the drawings on August 18 to illustrate an editorial on self-censorship and freedom of religion. English translation: While several other leading Swedish newspapers had published the drawings already, this particular publication led to protests from Muslims in Sweden as well as official condemnations from several foreign governments including Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt and Jordan, as well as by the inter-governmental Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC). The controversy occurred about one and a half years after the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark in early 2006. Another controversy emerged in September 2007 when Bangladeshi cartoonist Arifur Rahman was detained on suspicion of showing disrespect to Muhammad. The interim government confiscated copies of the Bengali-language Prothom Alo in which the drawings appeared. The cartoon consisted of a boy holding a cat conversing with an elderly man. The man asks the boy his name, and he replies \\"Babu\\". The older man chides him for not mentioning the name of Muhammad before his name. He then points to the cat and asks the boy what it is called, and the boy replies \\"Muhammad the cat\\". The cartoon caused a firestorm in Bangladesh, with militant Islamists demanding that Rahman be executed for blasphemy. A group of people torched copies of the paper and several Islamic groups protested, saying the drawings ridiculed Mohammad and his companions. They demanded \\"exemplary punishment\\" for the paper's editor and the cartoonist. Bangladesh does not have a blasphemy law, although one had been demanded by the same extremist Islamic groups. === Charlie Hebdo === On November 2, 2010, the office of the French satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo at Paris was attacked with a firebomb and its website hacked, after it had announced plans to publish a special edition with Muhammad as its “chief editor”, and the title page with a cartoon of Muhammad had been pre-issued on social media. In September 2012, the newspaper published a series of satirical cartoons of Muhammad, some of which feature nude caricatures of him. In January 2013, Charlie Hebdo announced that they would make a comic book on the life of Muhammad. In March 2013, Al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen, commonly known as Al- Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), released a hit list in an edition of their English-language magazine Inspire. The list included Stéphane Charbonnier, Lars Vilks, three Jyllands-Posten employees involved in the Muhammad cartoon controversy, Molly Norris from the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day and others whom AQAP accused of insulting Islam. On January 7, 2015, the office was attacked again with 12 shot dead, including Stéphane Charbonnier, and 11 injured. ===Wikipedia article=== In 2008, several Muslims protested against the inclusion of Muhammad's depictions in the English Wikipedia's Muhammad article. The petition was opposed to a depiction of Muhammad prohibiting Nasīʾ. The petition opposed a reproduction of a 17th-century Ottoman copy of a 14th-century Ilkhanate manuscript image (MS Arabe 1489) depicting Muhammad as he prohibited Nasīʾ.MS Arabe 1489. The image used by Wikipedia is hosted on Wikimedia Commons (upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Maome.jpg). The reproduction originates from the website of the Bibliothèque nationale de France Jeremy Henzell-Thomas of The American Muslim deplored the petition as one of \\"these mechanical knee-jerk reactions [which] are gifts to those who seek every opportunity to decry Islam and ridicule Muslims and can only exacerbate a situation in which Muslims and the Western media seem to be locked in an ever- descending spiral of ignorance and mutual loathing.\\"Wikipedia and Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad: The Latest Inane Distraction, 10 February 2008 Wikipedia considered but rejected a compromise that would allow visitors to choose whether to view the page with images. The Wikipedia community has not acted upon the petition.Wikipedia defies 180,000 demands to remove images of the Prophet The Guardian, 17 February 2008 The site's answers to frequently asked questions about these images state that Wikipedia does not censor itself for the benefit of any one group.Wikipedia Refuses To Delete Picture Of Muhammad Information Week, 7 February 2008. ===Metropolitan Museum of Art=== The Metropolitan Museum of Art in January 2010 confirmed to the New York Post that it had quietly removed all historic paintings which contained depictions of Muhammad from public exhibition. The Museum quoted objections on the part of conservative Muslims which were \\"under review.\\" The museum's action was criticized as excessive political correctness, as were other decisions taken close to the same time, including the renaming of the \\"Primitive Art Galleries\\" to the \\"Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas\\" and the projected \\"Islamic Galleries\\" to \\"Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia and Later South Asia\\".'Jihad' jitters at Met – Mohammed art gone by Isabel Vincent, 10 January 2010. ===Everybody Draw Mohammed Day=== Everybody Draw Mohammed Day was a protest against those who threatened violence against artists who drew representations of Muhammad. It began as a protest against the action of Comedy Central in forbidding the broadcast of the South Park episode \\"201\\" in response to death threats against some of those responsible for the segment. Observance of the day began with a drawing posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010, accompanied by text suggesting that \\"everybody\\" create a drawing representing Muhammad, on May 20, 2010, as a protest against efforts to limit freedom of speech. ===Muhammad Art Exhibit & Contest=== A May 3, 2015, event held in Garland, Texas, held by American activists Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, was the scene of a shooting by two individuals who were later themselves shot and killed outside the event. Police officers assisting in security at the event returned fire and killed the two gunmen. The event offered a $10,000 prize and was said to be in response to the January 2015 attacks on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo. One of the gunmen was identified as a former terror suspect, known to the FBI. ==See also== *Qadam Rasul *The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie *2006 Idomeneo controversy General: *Censorship in Islamic societies *Criticism of Muhammad ==NotesReferences== * * *Grabar, Oleg, The Story of Portraits of the Prophet Muhammad, in Studia Islamica, 2004, p. 19 onwards. *\\"Gruber (2005)\\", Gruber, Christiane, Representations of the Prophet Muhammad in Islamic painting, in Gulru Necipoglu, Karen Leal eds., Muqarnas, Volume 26, 2009, BRILL, , 9789004175891, google books *\\"Gruber (2010)\\", Gruber, Christiane J., The Prophet's ascension: cross-cultural encounters with the Islamic mi'rāj tales, Christiane J.

These states are thought to enhance the chemistry of metal ions in biological catalysis. An example of an entatic state is the copper center in plastocyanin, a redox enzyme. In this protein, the copper shuttles between oxidized and reduced states, Cu2+ and Cu+, respectively. Each oxidation state prefers a distinct coordination geometry: whereas copper(II) is normally square planar and prefers hard bases such as oxygen and nitrogen ligands, copper(I) is normally tetrahedral and binds preferentially to soft bases such as sulphur ligands. Because the electron transfer rate depends on the reorganization energy, the ideal rate would be obtained for Cu centers having a geometry intermediate between the requirements of each oxidation state. In fact, the Cu site is neither planar nor tetrahedral it is considered a distorted tetrahedral, with two nitrogen ligands from histidine residues and two sulphur ligands from methionine and cysteine residues, and can therefore be considered an entatic state. Under the entatic state hypothesis, the distortion results from strain caused by binding to ligands with relative orientation that is pre-arranged by the protein. Some theoretical calculations show that a model system can have a geometry similar to that observed in the protein without any strain; these results, however, remain controversial. ==References== Category:Biochemistry ","title":"Entatic state"},{"id":"20412154","text":"Grivel Srl is a company that produces tools and equipment for alpinism, climbing and outdoor activities.

The Dominican police then arrest Cournot because Hendrix and the “Dragoon”” have both disappeared, leaving several corpses on the shore. When Mrs Osborne flies in and corroborates his story, he is freed. She wants to find her stolen vessel and Cournot suggests a seaplane pilot in Kingston, Jamaica, who flies the two in search of where the “Dragoon” was last reported. They find it aground, close to an exposed sandbank. On going aboard, Cournot and Mrs Osborne are taken captive by a vicious gun runner called Morrison who with his gang is already holding Hendrix and has overloaded the “Dragoon” with weapons and ammunition for delivery to Central America. Morrison makes Cournot do the exhausting work of ferrying the heavy cases one by one to the sandbank, aiming to refloat the vessel and then reload it. Disputes among the crooks lead to Morrison being left alone on the sandbank with all the hardware while Cournot, Mrs Osborne and a wounded Hendrix are on the boat. Morrison keeps the “Dragoon” under constant rifle fire, hoping to hit the humans and disable the craft. He succeeds in holing the petrol tank, flooding the vessel with fuel which could go up at any moment. While Cournot is trying to pump it out by hand, Morrison swims aboard and in a final confrontation is killed. A rising tide floats the “Dragoon” so, hoisting the sails, Cournot sets course for Panama, a place where no questions will be asked. ==Cast== *Lino Ventura ... Jacques Cournot *Sylva Koscina ...

NFL teams chose 84 players from 224 available during the three-round selection meeting. Many of the big name USFL players were ineligible for the draft because their rights were already owned by NFL clubs. Still 3 of the first 4 players selected would become NFL Hall Of Famers. These players signed with the USFL before the NFL could draft them.

The program, subsequently named the \\"World Water Monitoring Challenge\\" and \\"EarthEcho Water Challenge,\\" aims to build public awareness and involvement in protecting water resources around the world by empowering citizens to carry out basic monitoring of their local water bodies. Roberta (Robbi) Savage, ACWF's President and CEO created WWMD, and Edward Moyer was the first WWMD Coordinator. A simple test kit enables everyone, children and adults, to sample local water bodies for a set of water quality parameters including temperature, acidity (pH), clarity (turbidity) and dissolved oxygen (DO). Information on purchasing low-cost test kits is available from the current sponsoring organization, EarthEcho International, and the results of monitoring events are then shared with participating communities around the globe on the sponsor's website. World Water Monitoring Day was originally celebrated annually on September 18. This date was initially chosen to be a month later (October 18) to recognize the anniversary of the US Clean Water Act, which was enacted by Congress in 1972 to restore and protect the country’s water resources. In 2007, the date was changed to facilitate participation in parts of the world where temperatures reach freezing conditions at that time. In 2006, ACWF transferred the coordination of the event to the Water Environment Federation (WEF) and the International Water Association (IWA). The collective goal was to expand participation to one million people in 100 countries by 2012. In January 2015 the management of World Water Monitoring Day was transferred to EarthEcho International. 2008 saw students from IndonesiaStudents take part in water monitoring, The Jakarta Post, November, 2008 to ArkansasEnvironmental concerns make water protection necessary, The Cabin.net, November, 2008 taking part in water sampling to bring attention to the importance of water quality.

After fighting for the losing side in the Peninsular War, he was forced to flee to Spain. Van Halen became a military adventurer throughout Europe and went on an 18-month tenure as a colonel in the Russian Caucasus Dragoon Regiment until his removal by Tsar Alexander I of Russia. == Early career == Van Halen was born in Isla de León, Cádiz, into a family of sailing merchants who had settled there. In 1803, he left Cádiz as a Spanish Navy cadet on the frigate Anfitrite headed for La Habana, Cuba and Veracruz, Mexico. In 1808, Juan began his service for the French King of Spain, Joseph Bonaparte, later assisting him during his refuge in France in 1813. In 1814, Van Halen defected to the opposing army. By forging the signature of Marshal Louis-Gabriel Suchet, French commanders were advised to surrender various fortresses because the documents claimed that the war was over. Fooled by the trick, the 1,900 strong French garrisons of Lleida, Mequinenza and Monzón marched out and laid down their arms in surrender. However, Louis Benoît Robert, the commander at Tortosa, was not fooled by the forged documents and continued his engagement. When Captain Van Halen returned to Spain in 1815, he was investigated for his involvement in the Spanish War of Independence, first in Murcia, then in Madrid. As a result of his connections with a Masonic Lodge in Granada, he was imprisoned on March 21, 1817. Van Halen also had ties to General José María de Torrijos y Uriarte, who was later executed by a firing squad. ==Adventurer== Having escaped from imprisonment, Van Halen traveled to Saint Petersburg, Russia, in the beginning of 1819. He met with various Russian dignitaries including Prince Pyotr Mikhailovich Volkonsky, close advisor to Tsar Alexander I and chief of the general staff from 1815 to 1823. Volkonsky resigned in 1824 after a conflict with War Minister Count Alexey Arakcheyev. Van Halen visited the Tsar's assistant, Prince Dmitriy Vladimirovich Golitsyn, who had fought bravely during the Napoleonic Wars and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, governing Moscow for 25 years. Van Halen also visited the famous Spanish engineer Augustíne de Betancourt, then director, and one of the founders, of the First Engineering Academy School of Russia. Supported by Betancourt, who was trusted by other Russian military leaders, Van Halen was appointed colonel of the Caucasus Dragoon Regiment in Tbilisi, Georgia. He served under General Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov and Armenian prince Valerian Madatov, and participated in the conquest of Josereck on 21 June 1820 against the troops of Surghai Khan (later replaced by Ashan Khan) in the Kazikoumik region of Daghestan. For this he received the medal of the Russian Order of St. George. In 1854, Van Halen donated the Tartar Yatagan long knife he had taken on 12 June 1820 to the Naval Museum of Madrid. Armenian prince Valerian Madatov (Russian: Валериан Григорьевич Мадатов, 1782–1829), under whom Juan Van Halen served as a Russian Army colonel in 1818. Van Halen's liberal convictions prompted the tsar, who was informed by Russian secret police, to remove Van Halen from the Caucasus in December 1820 and put him on the Austrian frontier. In 1821, he returned to Spain in the middle of the Trienio Liberal until the revolution was crushed by a European Kingdom Absolutist coalition that included Russia. He then stayed in Matanzas, Cuba for three years while also doing business in New York and Philadelphia. In 1830, Van Halen went to fight against the Netherlands to participate in the creation of the new kingdom of Belgium in the Belgian Revolution. In 1831, as a \\"Condottiere\\" in the 15th- century Italian style, he formed a military brigade of Belgian subjects to defend Portuguese Liberals from the prosecutions of the absolutist King Miguel I of Portugal. This was funded by Cadiz businessman, banker, and politician Juan Álvarez Mendizabal. Before and after the war against the Netherlands, Van Halen took part in the First Carlist War in Catalonia under generals José María Torrijos, Francisco Milans del Bosch and Francisco Espoz y Mina. Van Halen returned to Spain in February 1833 after the death of King Fernando VII, but he would travel and make brief stays in Belgium and England from 1835 to 1838. Since he was very close to General Baldomero Espartero, Van Halen joined him in exile in England when Espartero fell from grace in 1843. He returned to Madrid in 1854 and received the Great Cross of King Carlos III on November 30 of that year. Van Halen first married Maria del Carmen Quiroga y Hermida in 1821. She died on 14 February 1859. After her death, Van Halen married Clotilde Butler y Abrines, the daughter of a Spanish Navy frigate captain, who died after 1854.

Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1989 Prior to that, Bell had been one of Hutchins' chief defenders in several struggles with state legislators concerning academic freedom in the 1930s and 1940s. According to Milton Mayer, Bell was perhaps Hutchins' closest friend during his years at the University of Chicago.Milton Mayer, Robert Maynard Hutchins A Memoir, University of California Press, 1993. According to Mayer, \\"If Wilder was the closest friend of his youth, Laird Bell of Chicago was perhaps the closest friend of his middle life—and his lawyer, and, as chairman of the Chicago board of trustees, his boss. Bell was not only a member of the city's leading law firm, he was a formidable figure in the corporate world (for example, chairman of the board of Weyerhaeuser Lumber Company and, for example, an overseer of Harvard). He was also, in 1940 and 1941, the head of the Chicago chapter of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies—the city's foremost interventionist, as Hutchins was its foremost noninterventionist. A decade after this confrontation, Board Chairman Bell announced the anonymous endowment of the Robert Maynard Hutchins Distinguished Service Professorship at the university; a decade later Robert Maynard Hutchins, called back to the university to preside over the dedication of the Laird Bell Quadrangle, revealed that the anonymous donor of the Hutchins professorship had been Laird Bell.\\" In addition to his legal and philanthropic work, Bell was a senior executive and board member of the Weyerhauser Timber company, where his father, F.S. Bell, served as Chairman of the Board and President of the related Laird Norton Company. Bell was active in advising and advocating on behalf of Phil Weyerhauser during the firm's corporate changes during the Depression.Phil Weyerhaeuser, Lumberman By Charles E.

Bell visited Nazi Germany frequently in the period before World War II, representing US bondholders who had lost more than $1 billion through \\"reappraisals\\" by the Reichsbank under the leadership of Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht. Bell's co-counsel in the representation was John Foster Dulles of the New York firm Sullivan & Cromwell.Hersh, Burton, The Old Boys, New York: Charles Scribners Sons, 1992, p. 46 In 1940-1941, Bell was head of the Chicago chapter of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies. Bell received a KBE knighthood for his war-time activities on behalf of British War Relief. Following the war, he then played an active part, for a private citizen, in creating the New Europe. Bell returned to Germany as a legal adviser to Brigadier General William H. Draper. Jr., Head of the Economics Division, in General Lucius Clay's U.S. Military Government in Germany OMGUS. Draper's group brokered US interests in post-war German corporations. In 1945 and 1946, Bell \\"stalked the corridors of Foggy Bottom\\" in a \\"one-man crusade against 1067\\" a US rule that proposed a \\"barbarous\\" dismantling of Germany. As president of the Alumni Association of Harvard University in June 1947 Laird Bell organized the commencement speeches where Secretary of State George Marshall launched the European Recovery Plan.

Among his responsibilities was the selection of Commencement speakers. Bell had assigned one of the afternoon's two principal speeches to his friend Ernest Colwell, president of the University of Chicago. At the urging of President Conant, who wanted a military figure, Bell had somewhat reluctantly turned to General Omar Bradley, administrator of veterans' affairs, as his second major speaker. With Commencement only a week away, the State Department advised Bell that Secretary Marshall would be willing to make a brief address at Harvard, though he did not wish to be the main speaker. \\"Thus I wound up with two generals instead of none,\\" Bell said later. \\"I did not realize how historic the occasion would be.\\" \\" In the spring of 1949, Bell joined Columbia President Dwight Eisenhower and a group of other notables, chaired by Allen Dulles, in The National Committee for Free Europe, Inc, a private organization which gave aid to intellectuals and political refugees in newly communist European countries.

A Co-Web enabled situational application exploits direct high-definition video mixed with web based telepresence to further increase conversational productivity. The objective of the Cooperative Web is to enrich collaborative web meetings with a browser metaphor that supports simultaneous interactions between meeting participants. == Overview == A convergence is occurring between various technologies associated with the notion of live web meetings. The phrase Web conferencing has been used to describe group discussions over the internet. These discussions are often implemented using Synchronous conferencing protocols and are commonly used for webinars, where one meeting participant lectures to other participants while presenting some information that is rendered to all participants by a common client application (web or fat client). The term telepresence refers to a set of technologies which allow a person to feel as if they were present, to give the appearance that they were present, or to have an effect, at a location other than their true location. Telepresence requires that the senses of the user, or users, are provided with such stimuli as to give the feeling of being in that other location. Additionally, users may be given the ability to affect the remote location. As the analysts at IDC describe, the goal is to create a sensory experience that communicates the full range of human interactions in a live meeting. While many telepresence solutions have focused on the ambiance aspects of remote meeting environments and while most web conferencing solutions have focused on the integration of webinar and telephony features into collaboration software offerings/services, little has been done to simulate or reflect the asynchronous or simultaneous aspects of live meetings over the internet. Ideally what is required is a set of technologies that enrich communications with sensory elements that provide a just-like-being-there experience for live meetings. The sensory experience should include a range of sight, sound, and touch interactions. However, the current state of web conferencing and telepresence solutions focus mainly on the sight and sound aspects of a meeting and fall short on the interaction capabilities of participants. Moreover, web conferencing and telepresence solutions are typically not vendor neutral and tend to be pricey. Users have the ability to incorporate webinar capabilities into an immersive or adaptive telepresence solution to extend meeting attendance. Yet this injection of telepresence Lite capabilities all along the telepresence solution spectrum still does not address support for simultaneous interactions with the material being presented in a meeting. Orthogonal to this convergence in the technologies that support live web meetings, the web browser platform has evolved to a point whereby the mediation of user interactions amongst meeting attendees is possible. The common browser has raised the bar of expectation by users. Regardless of your browser of choice, your ability to access web applications simply and efficiently has become the norm. The overall browser experience has improved due in part by the broad adoption of web standards by browser providers and by the sheer economics and reach of the web browser platform. Essentially, the browser has evolved into the ubiquitous application container for the web. == Solution concepts == People meet, gather, huddle for business and personal endeavors. The majority of the discussions associated with these conferencing activities tend to be associated with decisions. Typically, the decision making process incorporates the analysis of one or more visualizations of data. The Cooperative Web pertains to a set of technologies and associated architectures that promise to empower decision agility with respect to information available for evaluation via web-based applications. While cooperative web solutions can incorporate digital components (audio, video) to replicate the face-face meeting experience with the human sensory elements of sight and sound, the interactive sensory element is a differentiating factor. A core value proposition of this technology is that it provides all meeting participants with the ability to manipulate data and drive web centric applications that are used in the decision making process. In consideration to IDC's call for the ability to develop a low-cost plug-and-play telepresence solution that can be easily adopted by medium-sized companies to extend the reach and promise of telepresence, the Cooperative Web offers solution vendors and composite web application developers the ability to develop standards based web applications that can be used in collaborative communication-oriented meetings. == Sample solution scenarios characteristics == * Webinar whereby Audio, Video and Co-Web enabled applications are combined * Traditional teleconference or phone conversations aided by a Co-Web enabled application (this would be useful when broadband limitations exists or when video cameras are not present) * Ad hoc just-in-time web conference * Video conferencing meeting whereby a remote mobile attendee is required == Solution scenarios == * TeleMedicine: Remote health care or diagnosis * E-Learning or Distance Learning * Call Center Support * Financial Analyst Briefing == Conceptual architecture == The maturity of service-oriented-architectures has fueled an ecosystem of ajax-based gadgets (widgets) that encapsulate content services. These gadgets, standalone fragments of a web page, make up the information rich web palette that can be assembled, wired and shared in composite web applications. Assume that the gadgets used in a given web page all publish the events associated with user-interactions to a predefined mediation server whereby all participants in a managed web meeting were notified of the interactions, then each instance of the gadgets in the web page (running in each meeting participants browser) would receive these remote interaction events as if they were locally triggered. The result would be that each meeting participant would broadcast his/her web page interactions and also subscribe to the results associated with interactions of other meeting participants. == Comparison with telepresence == The following attributes most common associated with Telepresence solutions are * Quality of Image * True Eye Contact * Life Size Image * Proximity of image * Sound quality * Full complement of content presentation capabilities The reality is that many of top selling solutions focus more on the features associated with sight and sound and complementary ambiance aspects like high-end furniture. However, few focus on extending the telepresence experience with interactive presentation capabilities. Cooperative web enabled applications are complementary to the spectrum of telepresence solutions as they extend the scope of the browser- based platform to allow all meeting participants to share browser applications in a live online meeting. As described by Gartner, the spectrum of Telepresence solutions can range from Lite to Adaptive to Immersive. Cooperative Web enabled applications can be leveraged along all points on the solution spectrum to help enrich the just-like-being-there aspects of the telepresence experience. Typically, sophisticated technologies are required for a user to be given a convincing telepresence experience. However, one of the benefits of cooperative web solutions is the ubiquity of the technology dependencies. The cost of entry for adoption has been reduced to a common browser, a few JavaScript libraries and some browser plug-ins. The net result is that the cooperative web not only extends the reach of telepresence solutions, this technology also improves the overall experience of remote communications. However, in its raw state, a co-web enabled application does not require a telepresence environment nor a hosted web conferencing solution. The minimum requirement is a mediation server and a co-web enabled application. == See also == * Open Cooperative Web Framework, a Dojo Foundation Project * Mashups * Synchronous conferencing * Open Mashup Alliance == References == * \\"Gartner MarketScope for Video Telepresence Solutions (G00156551)\\", Costello, Morrison, 2008. * \\"IDC Worldwide Telepresence 2008-2012 Forecast and Analysis\\", Freedman, Doyle, 2008. * An Architecture of Participation, O'Reilly, 2008. * Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations, Shirky, 2008. * \\"IDC: What You Need to Know about Telepresence and HD Videoconferencing\\", Germanow, October 2007.

Mamá Teresa is still quite well known today in Cuba, and has been recorded by many other groups: :Mamá Teresa se va... :Mamá Teresa se va... :Porque no quiere bailar la rumba :Con Juan que tiene la pata gamba ::(Mama Teresa's leaving... ::Mama Teresa's leaving... ::'Coz she don't wanna dance rumba ::With Juan an' his lame foot) Theatre and theatrical music were hugely important in Cuba in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. The zarzuelas (light one-act operettas) and bufos (ribald satirical comedy) both included songs with content about contemporary political and social events. They played a part in the creole movement for the emancipation of slaves and the independence of Cuba. They played a part in criticising governments, lampooning public figures and poking fun at the behaviour of men and women.Leal, Rine 1986. Teatro del siglo XIX. La Habana.Leal, Rine 1982.

It premiered on Fuji Television on April 20, 2000, and aired its final episode on January 2, 2013. The show was hosted by television personality throughout its entire run. The main goal of the game is to win ¥10,000,000 by answering fifteen multiple- choice questions correctly. There are three lifelines - , (a phone call to four supporters who are in one place), and . Whenever a contestant answers the fifth question correct, he is guaranteed ¥100,000. When a contestant answers the tenth question correct, he is guaranteed ¥1,000,000.

The show was broadcast twice, with the first episode raising the grand prize to ¥20 million. The series also added four new rules: * There were only 10 questions, as opposed to the normal 15. * Questions 1-5 had 4 choices, and 6-10 had 2 choices, meaning contestants could not use 50:50 after the 5th question. * Contestants could not walk away on the 9th or 10th questions. * There were no guaranteed sums. ===Clock format=== In 2009, the series became the first international version of Millionaire to adopt the clock format from the US version of the show. Contestants now have time limits for each question: 30 seconds each for questions 1–9, 1 minute each for questions 10–12, and 3 minutes each for questions 13–15. Usage of lifelines temporarily pauses the clock. However, unlike the US version, the remaining time after giving an answer for that question is void. Contestants who exceed the time limit on a given question without giving a \\"final answer\\" are forced to walk away with whatever winnings they have at that point. ==Payout Structure== Answering a question correctly is worth a specific cash prize at each level.

He was born in Dordrecht in 1663. On 26 October 1671 he left for the Indies, where his father had been appointed as Underbuyer (onderkoopman) in the Dutch East India Company (VOC). He then quickly went through posts in the lower levels of that organisation in Dutch Suratte. There, in 1676, he was made Provisional Assistant (provisioneel assistent), and in 1681 he became assistent. He became Bookkeeper (boekhouder) in 1683, and, in 1685, onderkoopman (Underbuyer/Undermerchant). Ten years later, in 1695, he was promoted to Buyer/Merchant (koopman). The next year he had to move to Batavia, to take up the post of Second Senior Buyer (tweede opperkoopman) in the Company's headquarters there. Two years later, in 1698, he was promoted to First Senior Buyer (eerste opperkoopman). He became Secretary (secretaris) to the High Government of the Indies in 1700 and, in 1702, Vice-President of the Council of Justice. He was made a Counsellor- extraordinary (Raad extraordinair) of the Dutch Council of the Indies in 1704. He was then appointed President of the College van Schepenen in 1705. Five years later, he was made full Counsellor of the Indies and in 1722 he became Director-General. On 16 October 1724 he was nominated Governor-General, taking over from Hendrick Zwaardecroon on 8 July 1725. Characteristic of his time in office was his opposition Zwaardecroon's encouragement of silk cultivation. Coffee production in the De Preanger region (Parahyangan uplands to the south of Batavia) went enormously well and de Haan felt that this would lead to a decline in coffee prices in Europe, so he lowered the prices paid to the coffee farmers. Their response was to chop down some of the coffee plantations. This was not what was intended, and De Haan forbade it. Meanwhile, there was further heavy damage to the production of coffee. Coffee from Java went mainly to Europe. They never managed to get into the Asian market. Coffee from Mocha took off there, as did the Arabic coffee of the English. No action was taken against this. The English also began to play a more important role in the cotton and tea trade. De Haan died, after lying ill for three days, on 1 June 1729. He was buried in Batavia and was followed as Governor-General by Diederik Durven. ==NotesReferences== * Site in Dutch on the Dutch East India Company (VOC) * Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch-Indië, Part H-M * Putten, L.P. van, 2002.

(\\"urban air makes you free\\"), or Stadtluft macht frei nach Jahr und Tag (\\"city air makes you free after a year and a day\\"), is a German saying describing a principle of law in the Middle Ages. The period of a year and a day was a conventional period widely employed in Europe to represent a significant amount of time. From the 11th century onwards, liberated serfs and other members of the Third Estate founded settlements alongside the old Roman or Germanic ones. It was customary law that a city resident was free after one year and one day. After this he could no longer be reclaimed by his employer and thus became bound to the city. Serfs could flee the feudal lands and gain freedom in this way, making cities a territory outside the feudal system to a certain extent. This created the conditions for the revolts such as the Münster Rebellion. With the Statutum in favorem principum (\\"Statute in Favor of the Princes\\"), this regulation of customary law was officially abolished for the Holy Roman Empire in 1231/32. According to the statute, cities under royal jurisdiction were forbidden to protect serfs originally owned by the regional princes or their vassals. The statute is an example of power devolving from Imperial authority to that of territorial magnates during the drawn-out contest between the Hohenstaufen emperors and the Papacy. The medieval concept of liberty was largely confined to traditional collective rights and privileges based in custom and precedent and often expressed in territorial liberties such as, to take English examples, the Liberties of the Tower of London or the Liberties of the Savoy. Historically, the development of individualism is a product of the ideology of liberalism, whose emphasis on modern individual liberties and freedom emerged in opposition to authoritarian oppression, in England culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and in France surfacing during the French Revolution. ==See also== *\\"The air of England is too pure for a slave to breathe\\" *Landflucht ==NotesReferences== *Heinrich Mitteis (1952): \\"Über den Rechtsgrund des Satzes »\\" City air makes free \\", in: Festschrift Edmund E.

These items may act on their own or be the tools of the character possessing them. Magic items have been prevalent in the game in every edition and setting, from the original edition in 1974 until the modern fifth edition. In addition to jewels and gold coins, they form part of the treasure that the players often seek in a dungeon. Magic items are generally found in treasure hoards, or recovered from fallen opponents; sometimes, a powerful or important magic item is the object of a quest. == Development 1st edition AD&D;=== In the first edition, all artifacts are classed as miscellaneous magic items, even ones that are weapons, armor, or rings. Each artifact has a certain number of Minor, Major, and Prime Powers, and of Minor, Major, and Side Effects which trigger when the item is acquired, or its Major and Prime Powers are used. The powers and effects are selected by the DM from a set of lists, so that players cannot predict the artifact's powers.\\"This prevents players from gaining any knowledge of these items, even if they happen to own or read a copy of this volume, and it also makes each artifact and relic distinct from campaign to campaign.\\" from Dungeon Master's Guide (first edition) === 2nd edition === In 1994, Encyclopedia Magica Volume One, the first of a four-volume set, was published. The series lists all of the magical items published in two decades of TSR products from \\"the original Dungeons & Dragons woodgrain and white box set and the first issue of The Strategic Review right up to the last product published in December of 1993\\". The books total more than 1500 pages across the four volumes and each volume contains over 1000 magic items. There was \\"no attempt to correct rule imbalances, edit entries, or even match game mechanics to one particular edition of the game\\". === 3rd edition === The 3.5 edition book Magic Item Compendium (2007) was a capstone book that reprinted, updated, organized, and regularized \\"numerous 3e magic items\\". Andy Collins, the lead designer on the project, \\"started this process by identifying the 'big six' magic items that took up the majority of characters' item slots: magic weapons; magic armor & shields; rings of protection; cloaks of resistance; amulets of natural armor; and ability-score boosters\\". Collins \\"identified the reasons that these [magic] items were particularly well-loved: they were cost effective, they could be improved, there was nothing else as good in their slots, they were simple, they didn't take time to activate [and] they provided effects that were required for characters to stay competitive\\". With this in mind, the designers then pulled items from all the 3rd and 3.5 edition books and \\"after looking through about 2000 magic items, they looted the best 1000 or so\\". The Magic Item Compendium also showed some early hallmarks of 4th edition design: items were marked levels and some items appeared at multiple strengths. It also introduced the idea of item sets, where items of a set would improve as more were collected, which would then reappear in the 4th edition book Adventurer's Vault 2 (2009). ===4th edition=== Ritual scrolls are single use consumable items, each of which contains a specific ritual (4th edition's equivalent of non-combat spells), halves the time required to perform that ritual and allows it to be performed without a ritual book. After it has been expended, a ritual scroll crumbles to dust. Unlike the scrolls of previous editions, 4th edition's scrolls are not classified as magical items.http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ex/20080528a === 5th edition === The 5th edition Dungeon Master's Guide introduced the concept of Item Rarity, in which magic items are given a rating between Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, and Legendary to denote the frequency in which this item is expected to be found within the game.Crawford, Jeremy and Mike Mearls. Dungeon Master's Guide. Wizards of the Coast. 2014. . Pp, 135-141. The only Common magic item to appear in the Dungeon Master's Guide is the Potion of Healing, with an additional list of Common items appearing in the supplementary book Xanathar's Guide to Everything.Crawford, Jeremy and Mike Mearls. Xanathar's Guide to Everything. Wizards of the Coast. 2017. . Pp 136-140. Artifacts act as a 6th Rarity category for items, such as the Hand of Vecna or the Wand of Orcus, in which there is only one of this item in existence.Crawford, Jeremy and Mike Mearls. Dungeon Master's Guide. Wizards of the Coast. 2014. . Pp. 219-227. The categories of magic items in 5th edition is Armour, Potions, Rings, Rods, Scrolls, Staffs, Wands, Weapons, and Wondrous Items (Which acts as a miscellaneous category). Some items require attunement to be used, limiting the number of items a character can benefit from at once to 3 attunable items. ==Notable magic items== ;Bag of Holding :This fictional bag is capable of containing objects larger than its own size. It appears to be a common cloth sack of about in size and opens into a nondimensional space or a pocket dimension, making the space larger inside than it is outside. This iconic item in the game is coveted by players because it mitigates encumbrance (the game mechanic for the carrying capacity of a player character). Since its introduction, it and concepts like it have appeared in other media.Anderson, T., & Galley, S. (1985). The history of Zork. The New Zork Times, 4(1-3). A number of academics have noted that the bag of holding also has symbolic meaning and uses. Benjamin Woo uses the Bag of Holding as a way of understanding white privilege: \\"Like the Bag of Holding--a kind of magical 'knapsack' in Dungeons & Dragons and other fantasy games--white privilege is much bigger than it appears from the outside.\\" Levi Keach uses knowledge about the catastrophic interaction of a bag of holding with a portable hole in the game to distinguish a sub-population from the general public. ;Bag of Tricks :By reaching into this remarkable bag, the bearer can pull out one of the small fuzzy items inside which then turn into some type of animal, depending on luck anything from a weasel to a rhinoceros. ;Portable hole :In the game, a portable hole is a circle of cloth made from phase spider webs, strands of ether and beams of starlight. When deployed, it creates an extradimensional space six feet in diameter by ten feet deep. Folding the cloth causes the entrance to this space to disappear, but items placed inside the hole remain there. Sufficient air is contained in the hole to support life for up to ten minutes. If put inside a bag of holding, both items are destroyed by a dimensional rupture. ==Major artifacts== Artifacts in the game are unique magic items with great power. Major artifacts include the ones in the following table. They are generally unique and exist for a specific purpose. Less powerful or potent artifacts, or ones that are not unique, are generally called minor artifacts. { class=\\"sortable \\" !style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Artifact !style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Campaign/Source !style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Reference books -  Acorn of Wo Mai  Forgotten Realms: The Horde  Book of Artifacts (1993), Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994) -  Al- Azid's Ghostly Palace  Al-Qadim: Secrets of the Lamp  Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994) -  All-Knowing Eye of Yasmin Sira  Al-Qadim  Book of Artifacts (1993), Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 2 (1995) -  Andrathath's Mask  Forgotten Realms  City of Splendors, Waterdeep (2005 or 2006) -  Ankh of Life  Forgotten Realms: FR10 Old Empires  Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994) -  The Apparatus  Ravenloft: I10 The House on Gryphon Hill  Book of Artifacts (1993), Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994) -  Apparatus of Dreadful Construction   Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994) -  Arm of Doom   Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994) -  Armet by Wayland  D&D; Master Set  Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 2 (1995, under \\"Helmet\\") -  Artifurnace  Spelljammer box set  Book of Artifacts (1993), Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1995, under \\"Helm\\") -  Axe of the Dwarvish Lords  Greyhawk: Eldritch Wizardry  Dungeon Master's Guide (1979), Book of Artifacts (1993), Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994), Axe of the Dwarvish Lords (module, 1999) -  Axe of the Emperors  Dragon Lance: DLR2 Taladas - The Minotaurs  Book of Artifacts (1993), Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994) -  Baba Yaga's Hut  Eldritch Wizardry  Dungeon Master's Guide (1979), Book of Artifacts (1993), Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 2 (1995) -  Beacon of Light  Forgotten Realms  Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (1996) -  Blackjammer's Cutlass Dragon Magazine #159  Book of Artifacts (1993), Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 4 (1995, under \\"Sword\\") -  Blackrazor  Greyhawk: White Plume Mountain  Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 4 (1995, under \\"Sword\\") -  Blood of Lathander  Forgotten Realms: Volo's Guide to the Dalelands  Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (1996) -  Blue Staff  Dragon Lance: Leaves from the Inn of the Last Home  -  Book of Amon  Hollow World: HWR2 Kingdom of Nithia  Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994) -  Book of Vile Darkness Greyhawk (Supplement)Dungeon Master's Guide (1979 [1e], 1989 [2e], 1995 [2e Revised], 2003 [3.5e], 2014 [5e]), Book of Vile Darkness (2011) -  Book of Zargos  Hollow World: HWR3 The Milenian Empire  Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 4 (1995, under \\"Spellbook\\") -  Book With No End  Dungeon Magazine #3  Book of Artifacts (1993), Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 3 (1995, under \\"Spellbook\\") -  Bringer of Doom  Monstrous Compendium: MC8 Outer Planes Appendix  Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994, under \\"Box\\") -  Calvan's Bell  Forgotten Realms: LC4 Port of Ravens Bluff  Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 2 (1995, under \\"Percussion Instrument\\") -  Carven Oak  Mystara: GAZ7 The Minrothad Guilds  Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994) -  Chariot of Re  Forgotten Realms: FR10 Old Empires  Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994) -  Chessmen of Ultham- Urre  Forgotten Realms  Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (1996) -  Claw of Mighty Simurgh  D&D; Master Set  Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 1 (1994) -  Codex of the Infinite Planes  Greyhawk: Eldritch Wizardry  Dungeon Master's Guide (1979), Book of Artifacts (1993), Encyclopedia Magica Vol. 2 (1995, under \\"Libram\\")Henson, Dale, and Doug Stewart, eds.

A left hand and left eye which are able to grant whoever replaces their existing hand and eye with them unusual powers. * Ioun stones (pronounced EYE-oon) are based on similar artifacts from Jack Vance's Dying Earth series.\\"The idea and name for the ioun stone originally appeared in a series of books written by Jack Vance. Collectively, these works are referred to as the Dying Earth novels. They include: The Dying Earth, Eyes of the Overworld, Cugel’s Saga, and Rhialto the Marvelous.\\" (Hargenrader 1991, \\"Bazaar\\", p 90) When functioning, they float in a circular pattern around their bearer's head, and grant various benefits based on their color and shape Two stones of the same type will repel each other, and when drained of power, a stone becomes a dull grey, but still possesses the characteristic floating. While useless to a mage, burned out stones can still yield a single psionic power point to a psionic character in 3rd and 3.5 editions. In the original Jack Vance stories Ioun stones are highly prized by arch-magicians, and are acquired from a race known as the archveults, who mine them from remnants of dead stars (in his book Rhialto the Marvellous). In 2E Dungeons & Dragons it had been conjectured in Dragon magazine that Ioun stones instead come from the Positive Material Plane. Dragon #174 featured an article that included many dozens of new types of ioun stone, as well as an article about an elemental lord who hoards ioun stones on his home plane of radiance.Hargenrader, Matthew P. \\"The Dragon's Bestiary\\" Dragon #174. (TSR, 1991). Under 3.0/3.5 editions of the rules they are instead manufactured by spellcasters in the same manner as other magical items. * The Vorpal Sword is taken from Lewis Carrol's poem \\"Jabberwocky\\". In Dungeons & Dragons, the sword has specific properties relating to beheading, which is the method the blade in the poem uses to slay the titular monster. === Folklore and mythology === * The Carpet of Flying is based upon Magic Carpets, which originate in Persian myths and were popularized in media through 1001 Arabian Nights and other adaptations. * Winged Boots bear a similarity to the Winged Sandals worn by Hermes in Greek Mythology. * The Broom of Flying is based upon Wiccan Rituals and artwork depicting Witches soaring through the air while riding Broomsticks. * The Mirror of Life Trapping, a mirror which can steal and trap the souls of living persons, evokes the superstitions of several cultures surrounding mirror's ability to steal souls. During the Jewish mourning process of Shiva, mirrors in a house are to be covered in order to prevent the soul of the deceased from being trapped within them. * The Flametongue, a sword with a blade engulfed in flame, is similar to other flaming swords appearing in mythology. Some examples of these are Dyrnwyn of Welsh Medieval tradition, and in some writings the Sword of Surtr is described as being flaming. ==References== ","title":"Magic item (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)"},{"id":"20413067","text":"The Benson–Hammond House is a historic house located on Poplar Avenue in Linthicum Heights, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. == Description and history == It is a -story, six-by-two-bay brick farmhouse constructed in the Greek Revival style in several stages at various times between about 1820 and 1870.

These actions have cost many subsequent restorations dearly.Mark-Paul Meyer, Paul Read (eds.) (2000), Restoration of Motion Picture Film, Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann, p. 275 & 287 However, there are a number of different methods for restoring early coloured films today, each of which nonetheless comes with its own inherent strengths and weaknesses. The most obvious, in a way the most straightforward (though it still requires a great deal of skill and accuracy in order to be done successfully), and still the most common method today is that of copying the original coloured print ‘as is’ onto modern Eastman colour inter-negative film. From the developed inter-negative then a new colour positive print can be struck. If set up and executed correctly, the colours in the new positive print can resemble very closely the colours in the original print but only as they survive today. Therefore, whatever fading, decomposition and/or other changes, which may have occurred to the colours down through the years, will also be copied along with them. Beyond the possibility to make very slight improvements to the saturation this method offers little in the way of any colour restoration. There are, meanwhile, other notable disadvantages, not least the use of modern colour film stock. Colour film is both expensive and has questionable archival permanence, as modern colour dyes are known to fade in time.Mark-Paul Meyer, Paul Read (eds.) (2000), Restoration of Motion Picture Film, Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann, p. 287 It was largely as a result of these problems that Noël Desmet, starting in the 1960s, developed his own flashing method for restoring silent films, which had originally been coloured either by the process of tinting or toning (or both). With Desmet’s method, the original colour print is first copied onto modern, panchromatic black and white inter-negative film, rather than colour film.Mark-Paul Meyer, Paul Read (eds.) (2000), Restoration of Motion Picture Film, Oxford: Butterworth- Heinemann, p. 289 The colours are then applied later during production of the positive print. ==Technique== For the reproduction of a print coloured by tinting only, the developed black and white inter-negative is first printed onto modern colour print stock in an initial printing pass. The same piece of film is then flashed with the appropriate coloured light (or a neutral light shone through a colour filter) in a second printing pass. The result is effectively little more than a colour image on top of a black and white one but the illusion is quite convincing. The use of coloured lights or filters, meanwhile, allows one greater freedom in attempting to reproduce the colours as they might have originally looked. For the reproduction of prints coloured by toning, the developed black and white inter-negative is exposed onto colour print film using a coloured light source rather than a neutral one. As the light passes more easily through the light parts of the negative image, the result will be colour in only the dark parts of the positive image, effectively simulating the original tone. Combined tints and tones can be reproduced using this same process, to simulate the tone, but with the addition of a second printing pass to colour the light parts of the image, simulating the original tint. It is very important to balance the colours correctly during testing beforehand since, as the second pass covers the whole image, the two colours are apt to mix. ==Benefits and drawbacks== The main benefits of the Desmet method are in cost, as black and white negative film is still generally cheaper than colour film. In addition, the black and white inter-negative provides a greater archival record than colour film, since it is not subject to the same fading as the colour dyes used in modern colour inter-negative films. However, the Desmet method is not without its drawbacks. Principle among these is that the technique cannot be employed for more selectively coloured prints, such as those coloured by the Pathécolor (later Pathéchrome) stencil process or the Handschiegl processes. These prints must still be copied directly onto modern colour inter-negative film or scanned to a digital format, manipulated digitally and then recorded back onto film. The use of modern colour film for the positive print is another drawback. Modern colour film stock effectively produces the required colour range by the subtractive mix of cyan, magenta and yellow dyes. These dyes are incapable of reproducing the same levels of saturation and hue as some of the single colour dyes used to colour the film in the first place, particularly primary colours such as red and green.Mark-Paul Meyer, Paul Read (eds.) (2000), Restoration of Motion Picture Film, Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann, p. 290 Nonetheless, the Desmet method still offers a greater range of saturated colours than the colour inter-negative method. It is still technically possible to reproduce these vintage colour effects by means of the original methods today. This is, of course, the most accurate method in terms of reproduction, though even then it cannot be said to be entirely accurate, as modern black-and-white print film, whilst very similar to the film used in the early years of cinema, will still exhibit different properties to the film stocks used then. It is also the most complex, time consuming and expensive procedure. Moreover, many of the toxic dyes originally offered by manufacturers are no longer available today, on account of increased health and safety standards. Those available, meanwhile, can often only be purchased at great expense. As a result, only a select few film laboratories specialised in film restoration are capable of offering this facility today. Another method worth mentioning, which has become increasingly common in recent years, is to transfer the original colour print to a high resolution digital format and manipulate the image in the digital domain before reconstituting it back on film. Without a doubt this method offers the widest freedom in terms of restoration, since many things are possible with digital that would not be possible by traditional photochemical means. It is also, however, the most ethically questionable, since it involves the transfer to a different medium, which comes with its own unique properties and limitations, losing many of the inherent, film-like properties of the original along the way. It is also the least archivally sound, since the longevity of digital media formats has not yet been determined. Thus, while digital techniques in film restoration are undoubtedly on the rise, they are still far from becoming standard. ==See also== * Colour motion picture film * Film preservation * Film tinting * Silent film ==NotesFurther reading== * ==External links== * Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique * Brian Pritchard's website Explanation of tinting and toning Category:Film preservation Category:Film and video technology Category:Silent film ","title":"Desmet method"},{"id":"20413098","text":"Joseph Tapley Dougherty (November 4, 1898 – April 19, 1978) was an American actor and voice actor, who provided the original voice of the Warner Bros. animation character, Porky Pig, starting with the character's debut in I Haven't Got a Hat in 1935 through Porky's Romance in 1937.

Work on the community began in 1961 and was completed by 1965. The complex contrasts with earlier Park Service architecture that sought to blend with the environment. The Painted Desert community used straight manufactured materials that deliberately draw a contrast with the natural environment. The most significant building is the Painted Desert Visitor Center, designed as a severely modernist structure that includes administrative offices., a visitor center, an auditorium, a clinic and staff apartments. Other structures include a community center, school and a Fred Harvey Company concession building. Neutra and Alexander paid particular attention to the division of the complex into public and private areas, using low walls to divide the Park Service service area from the central zone, and setting the inward-facing residential areas at a distance. Pedestrian circulation paths are used as defining organizing elements. The original landscape design used non-native plants that required regular watering. Removal of irrigation caused these plants to die, altering the landscape.

The school of \\"practical forestry\\" was founded by Carl A. Schenck in 1898 on George W. Vanderbilt's Biltmore Estate near Asheville, North Carolina. The school grounds are now part of Pisgah National Forest in Transylvania County, North Carolina. Today, the former school forms the basis of the Cradle of Forestry in America, a 6500-acre historic site which features exhibits about forestry and forest conservation history. The site includes the Forest Discovery Center, an indoor forestry museum, gift shop and cafe. There are two guided trails that include several of the school's buildings, a 1914 Climax logging locomotive and a portable sawmill. The Center offers special programs, crafts demonstrations, nature education programs and special events. ==History== In 1895, Carl A. Schenck was brought by George W. Vanderbilt from Germany to Vanderbilt's Biltmore Estate in North Carolina to work managing the vast expanses of forest lands on the estate's property. Schenck replaced Gifford Pinchot as Vanderbilt's estate forester, and immediately began introducing new scientific management and practical forestry techniques. As Schenck worked throughout Vanderbilt's vast forest lands in Western North Carolina, he found himself explaining to local young men what he was working on and why it was important to maintain healthy forests. The growing interest in forestry work Schenck found among the locals caused him to look into starting his own forestry education program. With the permission of Vanderbilt, Schenck established the Biltmore Forest School using abandoned farm buildings on the estate grounds. This was the first school of forestry in North America. According to The Biltmore Company, the school \\"opened its doors on September 1, 1898.\\"Biltmore Company, The. July 24, 1998. \\"Cradle of Forestry Celebrates Centennial of The Biltmore School of Forestry: America's First School of Forestry.\\" [press release] Brevard, NC.

According to Steven Anderson, President of the Forest History Society, this was just \\"a few weeks\\" before the opening of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell University, under the leadership of Dr. Bernhard Fernow.Anderson, Steven. 1998. \\"Introduction\\". P. i in Cradle of Forestry in America: The Biltmore School of Forestry, 1898-1913, Carl Alwyn Schenck. Durham, NC: Forest History Society. Darmstadt, Germany, c. 1912 The Biltmore Forest School offered a one-year course of study, and the curriculum focused on providing traditional classroom lectures in silvicultural theory supplemented with extensive hands-on, practical forest management field training. Schenck's students spent most afternoons in the forest doing hands- on work and directly applying the theories they had learned in the classroom. Schenck was a demanding, but engaging professor, and his students took to him immediately, absorbing as much of the scientific forestry theories as they could. ==Biltmore Forest Fair== In November 1908, Schenck hosted the Biltmore Forest Fair, designed to demonstrate the accomplishments and possibilities of scientific management and practical forestry techniques, and to celebrate the 10th anniversary of his Forestry School.November 26, 1908: The Biltmore Forest Fair The three-day festival ran from November 26–29, exhibiting theories of forestry taught at the school. Attendees were given forest plantation tours with Schenck as their guide, and received detailed lessons on forestry practices, planting techniques, logging operations, seed regeneration, soil composition and more. Schenck sent personal letters inviting close to 400 people to the fair, along with these letters of invitation, Schenck also enclosed a 55-page illustrated booklet, A Forest Fair in the Biltmore Forest,A Forest Fair in the Biltmore Forest which served as not only a guide to the forests at Biltmore but also a textbook of forestry and conservation practices. The guests included foresters, lumbermen, furniture manufacturers, botanists, university professors and others. The fair successfully demonstrated Schenck's forestry and conservation practices, with various newspaper editorials from the region subsequently praising him. ==School's end and legacy== First ranger's house on exhibit at the Cradle of Forestry. Vanderbilt's forest ventures had always been unprofitable. Following several years that Schenck was unpaid but paid many employees out of his own pocket, in 1909 Schenck and Vanderbilt quarreled and Schenck was dismissed as forester of the Vanderbilt estate. Although the Biltmore Forest School was financially self-sustaining, he could no longer operate it on Vanderbilt's property. Schenck continued the school through 1913, though, by traveling with his students and operating from various locations including railway cars and locations in Germany. Despite the school's short existence, it laid the foundation for American forestry education. Graduates of the Biltmore Forest School became the first generation of American professional foresters. Schenck's theories of sustainable forestry greatly influenced the field, remaining important long after his death, in 1955. Today, the school continues to be celebrated as \\"the cradle of forestry in America\\" on Vanderbilt's former lands in Pisgah National Forest, and several of the remaining buildings can be seen on trails that are part of the Cradle of Forestry in America site. Biltmore Hall, home of the College of Natural Resources at North Carolina State University, was named in honor of the school. The forestry program located there considers itself the successor to the Biltmore School. == See also == * Biltmore Forest, North Carolina * List of historic schools of forestry ==References Notes = Further reading === * Schenck, Carl Alwin.

The name of the stable is inspired by the New World Order (nWo). ==HistoryBackground=== Villainous wrestler Tracy Smothers debuted in the first season of Juggalo Championship Wrestling's internet wrestling show SlamTV! by cutting a series of promos in which he insulted the company, the owners (Insane Clown Posse), and the Juggalo fanbase. It became a common gesture for him to hide behind the curtain and flip off the crowd prior to entering the ring. He flaunted his PWU Hardcore Championship, which he proclaimed the only championship that he respected, while verbally abusing the fans on the mic. On occasion, Smothers would even get in physical altercations with fans. Tracy ran rampant on JCW, having matches which mostly ended with him choking opponents out. Smothers mercilessly beat opponents by any means necessary, including fan favorites Nosawa and Zach Gowen, the latter being a one-legged wrestler whom Smothers knocked out with his PWU Hardcore Championship and proceeded to choke out before beating up both the referee and security. In the sixth episode, during 2 Tuff Tony's match, Smothers attacked Tony and caused him to be carried out on a stretcher. Just days before Tony's return on the eighth episode, Tracy Smothers was arrested (kayfabe) and dropped from the rest of the tour, leaving Tony and the JCW roster with no way to seek revenge. JCW Heavyweight Champion, and fan favorite, Corporal Robinson was scheduled to face Tracy Smothers at Evansville Invasion, but he first had to defend his title against tweener Scott Hall at Bloodymania. Hall and Robinson wrestled with a mutual respect for each other. During the match, Hall acted in his signature cocky manner. He delivered pokes to the eyes, slaps to the head, and several homosexual mannerisms, all with a smile on his face. Though the tactics normally result in boos from the crowd, after Robinson won the match, the fans cheered for both him and Hall. ===Formation=== 262x161px On October 6, 2007, an unaired event entitled Evansville Invasion took place in Evansville, Indiana. In the main event, Corporal Robinson took on Tracy Smothers, before being attacked by both he and Sid Vicious. Violent J and Scott Hall came down to the ring to defend Robinson. After scaring both Smothers and Vicious away, the trio ripped off their initial jerseys to reveal shirts which read \\"JWO.\\" On October 31, at the Hallowicked After Party in Detroit, Michigan, Shaggy 2 Dope was introduced as a member of the group. Later that night, the jWo (Scott Hall and Corporal Robinson) defeated \\"Richie Boy\\" Breyer Wellington, Joe Doering, and Conrad Kennedy III in a handicapped match with special guest referee Nosawa. Following the match, Nosawa ripped off his referee shirt to reveal that he was the newest member of the jWo. On December 21, Juggalo Championship Wrestling held an event called Big Ballas' X-Mas Party. The main event featured The jWo (Violent J, Nosawa, and Scott Hall) vs. The Thomaselli Brothers. This match marked Scott Hall's first wrestling appearance since no-showing the TNA PPV Turning Point and several WWC shows. ===Adding Members=== Kevin Nash and Scott Hall appeared as a team at Bloodymania II, both wearing jWo jerseys. Prior to their match, Nash proclaimed that he was a member of the Juggalo World Order. That night, the duo defeated the Thomaselli Brothers. On October 31, 2008, at the Hallowicked After Party in Detroit, the Juggalo World Order (Scott Hall, Shaggy 2 Dope, Violent J, and Corporal Robinson) interfered in the opening match, beating up both wrestlers as well as the referee. Violent J got on the microphone and called 2 Tuff Tony down to the ring. He then asked 2 Tuff Tony to join the jWo, before Tony responded by explaining that he was a one-man team. Mid sentence, Tony stopped and exclaimed, \\"Fuck That! I wanna roll with the jWo!\\" Violent J then gave 2 Tuff Tony a Hallowicked version of the jWo jersey, before announcing him as an official member of the Juggalo World Order. At Bloodymania III, the Juggalo World Order (Corporal Robinson, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, Shaggy 2 Dope, and Violent J) was scheduled to face \\"Holy\\" Trent Acid and the Alter Boys (Tim, Tom, Terry, and Todd) in the main event. However, Kevin Nash legitimately no-showed the event. After Hall explained to the crowd that he and Nash had split, Sid Vicious was introduced as his replacement and as the newest member of the jWo. During the end of their match, Diamond Dallas Page ran into the ring wearing a jWo jersey and hit Acid with the Diamond Cutter, allowing Violent J to get the pin. On May 26, 2012 at JCW's Hatchet Attacks 2012 iPPV, the JWO made their return to JCW, represented by Kevin Nash and Sean Waltman. The duo would go on to defeat Mosh and Thrasher of the Headbangers. ==Invasions== On the November 4 edition of the radio show \\"The Main Event\\", Scott Hall dared hosts Violent J, 2 Tuff Tony, and Corporal Robinson to \\"take [the Juggalo World Order] on the road\\" by \\"invading\\" Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, World Wrestling Entertainment, and Ultimate Fighting Championship. On November 9, Scott Hall, Shaggy 2 Dope, Violent J, 2 Tuff Tony, and Corporal Robinson \\"invaded\\" TNA's PPV Turning Point by purchasing front row tickets to the event. They proceeded to promote their faction by flashing their jWo jerseys, which each member had on. As the crowd grew rowdy from the appearance, TNA management became worried that the group may interfere in a match. Backstage, many wrestlers were prepared for a fight with the group. Samoa Joe personally feared that, due to his negative comments toward Scott Hall, the jWo would interfere in his match that night with Kevin Nash. During his match, Sheik Abdul Bashir, friend of both 2 Tuff Tony and Corporal Robinson, spit outside of the ring onto Tony, resulting in Tony splashing beer in the ring. Afterwards, Bashir went ringside and slapped and shoved Robinson.

He stood over tall and was known for his hunting prowess and his brutality toward bears and Indian warriors. Kinman claimed to have shot a total of over 800 grizzly bears, and, in a single month, over 50 elk. He was also a hotel keeper, saloon keeper, and a musician who performed for President Lincoln on a fiddle made from the skull of a mule. Known for his publicity seeking, Kinman appeared as a stereotypical mountain man dressed in buckskins on the U.S. east coast and selling cartes de visites of himself and his famous chairs. The chairs were made from elkhorns and grizzly bear skins and given to U.S. Presidents. Presidents so honored include James Buchanan, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, and Rutherford Hayes. He may have had a special relationship with President Lincoln, appearing in at least two of Lincoln's funeral corteges, and claiming to have witnessed Lincoln's assassination. His autobiography, dictated to a scribe in 1876, was first published in 2010 and is noted for putting \\"the entertainment value of a story ahead of the strict facts.\\" His descriptions of events change with his retelling of them. Contemporary journalists and modern writers were clearly aware of the stories contained in the autobiography, \\"but each chooses which version to accept.\\"Robert H. Roberts, 2010, Transcriber's Forward to Seth Kinman's Manuscript and Scrapbook, pp, i-ii, Ferndale Museum. ==Early life== Seth Kinman's father, James Kinman, ran a ferry across the West Branch Susquehanna River in central Pennsylvania, in an area then called Uniontown, now called Allenwood in Gregg Township, Union County. James also was a millwright and an inn-keeper, whose forebears were Quakers from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Seth's mother, Eleanor Bower Kinman, was of German descent whose family lived in Reading, Pennsylvania.Carranco, p. 33 Seth was born in Uniontown in 1815. While in Pennsylvania, he learned to read and write, \\"I could form good letters with a pen but I never learned to spell well.\\"quoted in Carranco, p. 33 In 1830 his father took the family and migrated to Tazewell County, Illinois.To Springlake near the Mackinaw River according to In his autobiography, Seth stated that his father fought in the Blackhawk War in Illinois in 1832.Autobiography, p. 2. He also claimed that his father and Abraham Lincoln fought together in the war, became friends afterward, and that Seth met the future president during Lincoln's circuit-riding days in Illinois.Carranco, p. 34 At about the same time the Kinmans acquired a rifle, known as \\"Old Cotton Bale,\\" that Seth kept throughout his life. The rifle had a long barrel and \\"is supposed to have killed Gen'l Peckenham\\" at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815.Autobiography, p 3-4 With some skepticism, Anspach relates a long history of the rifle, gleaned from an 1864 local newspaper story on Kinman, of a renegade Kentucky sniper shooting the British general while carrying on a conversation with American General Andrew Jackson. Seth spent ten years working in his father's mill in Illinois, sawing lumber and grinding grain. After his father's death in 1839 he sold the mill and tried farming. He married Anna Maria Sharpless, of Catawissa, Pennsylvania, in 1840 and they had five children together: James (1842), Carlin, who is sometimes called Calvin (1846), Austin (1847), Ellen (1849), and Roderick (1851). Anna Maria and two of their sons, James and Austin, died during the winter of 1852–53, while Seth was in California. By 1848 Kinman was operating the Eagle Hotel in Pekin, Illinois, on the Illinois River. The hotel was known less for its comforts than for Kinman's rendition of the fiddle tune Arkansas Traveler. ==Life in California== Drawing of an early hunter's cabin in Humboldt County. Kinman claimed to have migrated to California in 1849 during the great Gold Rush and worked as a prospector in Pierson B. Reading's party on the Trinity River near present-day Douglas City. He then returned to Illinois for two years. In 1852, he travelled to California and explored the Humboldt Bay area, near present-day Eureka, California. Humboldt Bay had been recently rediscovered by gold miners seeking a faster and cheaper route to transport supplies. An early settlement in the area was also named Uniontown, but is now known as Arcata. During this period, prospectors and their suppliers were often flush with gold, but had little to spend it on. On Christmas, 1852 Kinman was hired to perform on fiddle at the then exorbitant amount of $50, despite his lack of musical training. As described by a fellow '49er: Elkhorn chair presented to President Abraham Lincoln. Photo by Mathew Brady Over the winter of 1852-53 he lived in what is now Ferndale in the cabin of Stephen Shaw. His wife and two of their children died that winter, and he may have gone back to Illinois to bring back his mother and three remaining children by 1854. In 1853 he started working as a hunter, feeding U.S. troops in Fort Humboldt. While at Fort Humboldt he met future president Ulysses S. Grant, and future General George Crook. According to tradition, about this time, he brought the first herd of cattle to Humboldt County. Some events and their timing are unclear during this early period. Sources disagree on whether he brought his family to California from Illinois in 1852 or 1854. Carranco dates Seth's first return to Illinois starting in 1850, with his return to California in August 1852, his arrival in Humboldt County in February 1853, another return to Illinois in September 1853, and a trip back to California starting in May 1854 with his mother, two children, and a herd of cattle.Carranco, pp. 35-37 Thus, in the course of the six years 1849–1854, he is believed to have crossed the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains five times, travelling mostly on foot. Kinman lived in several places in the county, including houses near Fern Cottage and a dairy farm on Bear River Ridge. He bought of farm or ranch land east of the future Table Bluff Lighthouse in October 1858, and about south of Fort Humboldt. This was the first purchase of land in the Humboldt Land District, which was established by an Act of Congress in March 1858. He later built a hotel and bar on the site. Kinman made his name first as a hunter, especially as a hunter of grizzly bears. California was noted for its large population of grizzlies. Seth's son Carlin claimed that they once saw 40 grizzlies at one time. But by 1868, the last grizzly in Humboldt County had been killed. While Kinman was on his way to deliver one of the presidential chairs, he met Methodist bishop and writer Oscar Penn Fitzgerald on a California steamboat. Fitzgerald recorded his impressions in the sketch The Ethics of Grizzly Hunting. He presented Kinman as a drunkard who cruelly abused Indians and grizzly bears. Kinman's eyes made a special impression on Fitzgerald. Decades later he compared Kinman's eyes to those of the California bandit Tiburcio Vásquez, \\"His eyes were nature's special label of one of her malignest creations. Only in two other human beings have I ever seen such eyes as those.... It was the eye of a wild beast, the baleful glitter you have seen in the eyes of snakes, panthers, catamounts, or other creatures of the reptile or feline kind.\\" During a gale on the night of January 5–6, 1860, Kinman was alerted by distress signals from the Northerner which had been breached by a submerged rock. Kinman tethered himself to the shore and waded into the surf to rescue passengers. In all, 70 people were saved by various means and 38 people perished. He was hailed as a hero and awarded a Bible and free life- time passage on the Pacific Mail Steamship Company's ships. ===Relations with Native Americans=== Native Americans in northern California suffered greatly at the hands of European-Americans in the last half of the 19th century, and their population decline was a result of genocide. The Wiyot people, who live around Humboldt Bay, were particularly hard hit. Their population declined from about 1,500-2,000 in 1850 to about 200 in 1860. p. viii pp. 51-52Carranco, pp. 37, 38. Kinman's brutality was noted by James R. Duff, a fellow '49er, who described him as \\"an avowed enemy of the red man, ... (who) shot an Indian on sight.\\"cited in Carranco states that \\"Seth always took an Indian along on a hunt - partly to carry the game, but primarily to serve as bear bait,\\" and concludes \\"sometimes he regarded them (Indians) as human beings ... other times, only as predatory animals to shoot at.\\" Kinman himself claimed to be an official Indian agent, though there is little evidence that he actually served in the position.Carranco, pp. 37, 40-41. He collected \\"Indian artifacts\\" including scalps, which he claimed to have taken himself.Carranco, p. 39. Advertisement used for exhibitions in 1861 Kinman was involved with the Wiyot people who lived on Table Bluff, near his farm. The Wiyot continue to live on Table Bluff on a small rancheria or reservation.Wiyot Tribe and Community accessed April 10, 2012.United Indian Health Services, Table Bluff Reservation - Wiyot TribeBlue Lake Rancheria, History, accessed April 10, 2012. The key event in Wiyot history was the February 25–26, 1860 Wiyot Massacre on Indian Island, when over one hundred Wiyot were murdered in their sleep. At the same time there were massacres of the Wiyot at other sites, possibly including Table Bluff. Kinman has not been specifically identified as one of the murderers. Nevertheless, in May 1860 he was elected to represent Bear River at a county-wide meeting ostensibly called to discuss ways to protect white settlers from the Indians. p. 313 In 1864 he scouted for Captain William Hull's California Volunteers, which according to Kinman, \\"slaughtered and captured Indians, and at one time they took as many as 160 captives to Fort Humboldt.\\"quoted in Carranco, p. 38 ===Life as an entertainer=== While delivering an elkhorn chair to President Buchanan in 1857, Kinman said, \\"l awoke one fine morning and found myself famous.\\"quoted in Carranco, p. 37 He made use of this fame starting in the summer of 1861, together with ventriloquist and magician J. G. Kenyon, by opening an exhibit, first in Eureka and then in San Francisco in August of that same year. Kinman displayed his \\"curiosities\\" including an elkhorn chair, mounted grizzly bears, several fiddles, and scalps, and gave a lecture. Seth (seated) with his son Carlin, displaying a few curiosities in 1876 They then toured gold mining camps and the San Francisco Bay area as entertainers. Later he opened a traveling \\"museums of curiosities\\" in Eureka, San Francisco, Sacramento and Los Angeles. During his trip to the East Coast in 1864–1866, Kinman exhibited his curiosities including his chairs, primarily in Pennsylvania and Illinois.Carranco, p. 40 He took a ten-year-old Native American boy, named Burtch or Burtchfield, with him on this trip, but Burtch died in December, 1864. Kinman said that he took the boy on the trip because he had killed both of Burtch's parents. Kinman may have also displayed his chairs at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876. As late as 1885, Kinman opened a museum in Los Angeles with his sons Carlin and Roderick.Carranco, p. 41 ==Presidential chairs== Kinman first used the large number of elkhorns shed near his farm every year to create a fence. With the help of George Hill, about 1856 he created his first elkhorn chair, which he traded to Dr. Josiah Simpson of Fort Humboldt for a telescope. The construction of an elkhorn chair included using matching horns to make the front legs and arms of the chair. These horns interlocked with another matching pair, which formed the rear legs and the back of the chair. An elk-hide seat was added, along with actual elk feet as the feet of the chair, and the horns were connected beneath the seat.Carranco, p. 37. Kinman in 1857 with the chair he presented to Buchanan. Inspired by the 1856 election of James Buchanan, a fellow Pennsylvanian, to the presidency, Kinman built his first presidential elkhorn chair and brought it to Washington. He arranged free passage on the ship Golden Age to Panama, then to New York, and finally to Washington. With some help from Peter Donahue and O.M. Wozencraft, on May 26, 1857, after an introduction from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs James W. Denver, Kinman presented the chair to Buchanan. p. 69 The President was so pleased by the present that he bought Kinman a rifle and two pistols in return. Lincoln examining Kinman's rifle in 1864, while accepting an elkhorn chair. Drawing by Alfred Waud. In 1861 he advertised that he had made a chair that he would present to Napoleon III. Later, because of French involvement in Mexico, he abandoned the idea. Kinman took two chairs on his 1864 trip to the East Coast for use in exhibitions.Carranco, p. 37. says that both chairs were elkhorn. Anspach suggests that one was made from grizzly bears. Kinman's presentation of an elkhorn chair to President Abraham Lincoln at 10 a.m. on Saturday, November 26, 1864 was recorded by artist Alfred Waud, the only known picture of Lincoln accepting a gift. The Lincoln Log , accessed February 16, 2011. The drawing shows Lincoln examining Kinman's rifle, which he called \\"Ol' Cottonblossum.\\" Kinman also presented a fiddle made from the skull and a rib of his favorite mule and played the instrument. Within three weeks, Lincoln stated that he would prefer to eat Kinman's chair, antlers and all, than to appoint a certain office-seeker. p. 384 The following April, Kinman marched in President Lincoln's funeral cortege in Washington. Kinman in the chair he presented to President Andrew Johnson in 1865 Kinman was allegedly in Ford's Theater the night of the assassination and witnessed the murder. He escorted Lincoln's body on its way to burial as far as Columbus, Ohio. On April 26, 1865, the New York Times described Kinman in the funeral cortege in New York City: \\"Much attention was attracted to Mr. Kinman, who walked in a full hunting suit of buckskin and fur, rifle on shoulder. Mr. Kinman, it will be remembered, presented to Mr. Lincoln some time ago a chair made of California elk-horn, and continuing his acquaintance with him, it is said, enjoyed quite a long conversation with him the very day before the murder.\\"This conversation is not recorded in The Lincoln Log April 13, 1865 , accessed April 10, 2012. During his stays on the East Coast, many cartes de visites photographs of Kinman and his chairs were taken by Mathew Brady. Kinman claimed to have paid Brady $2,100 in one three-month period for photos at 8 cents apiece, which calculates to an unlikely amount of over 26,000 photographs. Kinman sold these photographs, among other places, in the U.S. Capitol. He also toured the country, performing in his buckskins as a frontier story teller and fiddle player. Kinman's tour de force in presidential chairs was presented to President Andrew Johnson on September 8, 1865. Johnson kept the chair in his White House library, the Yellow Oval Room. Kinman and Governor Rutherford B. Hayes on September 18, 1876 On September 18, 1876, Kinman presented an elkhorn chair to Governor Rutherford Hayes of Ohio, who was soon to become the President of the United States. The chair is now displayed in the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center in Fremont, Ohio. He later gave a chair constructed of bearskin and other bear body parts to Hayes's vice-president William A. Wheeler. ==Legacy== In 1876, Kinman dictated his memoirs, but they were not published until 2010. Dictated to a \\"H. Niebur\\" it was originally titled “Seth Kinman: Life and Adventures of the Renowned Humboldt and Trapper, Guide and Explorer.” He also kept an extensive scrapbook of newspaper articles. About 1930, a one-time neighbor of Kinman, George Richmond, copied the memoirs and the scrapbook by hand. Original pieces of H. Niebur's dictations appear in Richmond's manuscript. Portions of H. Niebur's work is available for viewing at Humboldt State University Special Collections. The original manuscript and scrapbook were then sent to a potential publisher or agent, and lost after Richmond's death. The published version is from Richmond's copy. Richmond also recalled many of Kinman's stories and collected others from Kinman's family and friends, then retold these stories in a book now published as I'm a Gonna Tell Ya a Yarn.George Richmond, 2010, I'm a Gonna Tell Ya a Yarn, Ferndale Museum Seth Kinman's hotel and bar in 2010 In his later years, Kinman lived in Table Bluff, California with his family, where he owned a hotel and bar. In 1886, Kinman was preparing to send chairs to President Grover Cleveland and former presidential candidate General Winfield Scott Hancock. He died in 1888 after accidentally shooting himself in the leg. He was interred at Table Bluff Cemetery in Loleta, California, in his buckskin clothing. Mrs. R.F. Herrick bought Kinman's traveling museum collection of 186 items, including at least two of his famous chairs, and displayed them in San Francisco in 1893. She then took the collection to Chicago to display them at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, where she reportedly sold the individual items. The Clarke Historical Museum in Eureka displays a suit of his buckskins, complete with beaded moccasins, as well as a wooden chest he owned. The Ferndale Museum displays several Kinman items, including another of his buckskin suits. ===Kinman's guns=== At least two of Kinman's guns are believed to have survived and have been exhibited on video. His long rifle \\"Old Cotton Blossum\\" was placed for sale in 2018 at an Illinois auction house with an estimated sales price of $20,000 - $40,000. The auction house reported that the gun was offered for sale by a Kinman biographer Alan W. Maki, who bought the rifle from Kinman's great-great granddaughter. One of two pistols given to Kinman by President Buchanan was shown on Antiques Roadshow and valued for insurance purposes at about $50,000. It is a 36 caliber Colt model 1851 made in Hartford, Connecticut. Kinman modified the pistol, trimming the hammer and adding a front blade site made of horn or bone. ==Gallery== File:Yellow-oval-room-c1868.jpgWhite House Yellow Oval Room, c.1868 showing Kinman's chair at far right.

It describes itself as being a historical preface to the Buddhist monastic codes (vinaya). Over half of the text is composed of Jātaka and Avadāna tales, accounts of the earlier lives of the Buddha and other bodhisattvas. The Mahāvastu contains prose and verse written in mixed Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit.Jones (1949), pp. x–xi. It is believed to have been compiled between the 2nd century BCE and 4th century CE.\\"Mahāvastu\\" (2008).Jones (1949), p. xi, writes: \\"\\"... the Mahāvastu is not the composition of a single author written in a well-defined period of time. Rather, it is a compilation which may have been begun in the second century B.C., but which was not completed until the third or fourth century A.D.\\" ==Pali Canon parallels== The Mahāvastu's Jātaka tales are similar to those of the Pali Canon although significant differences exist in terms of the tales' details. Other parts of the Mahāvastu have more direct parallels in the Pali Canon including from the Digha Nikaya (DN 19, Mahāgovinda Sutta), the Majjhima Nikaya (MN 26, Ariyapariyesana Sutta; and, MN 36, Mahasaccaka Sutta), the Khuddakapātha, the Dhammapada (ch. 8, Sahassa Vagga; and, ch. 25, Bhikkhu Vagga), the Sutta Nipata (Sn 1.3, Khaggavisāa Sutta; Sn 3.1, Pabbajjā Sutta; and, Sn 3.2, Padhāna Sutta), the Vimanavatthu and the Buddhavaṃsa.Regarding the Dhammapada parallels, see Ānandajoti (2007), \\"Introduction,\\" where Ānandajoti writes: :Of the incomplete parallels, two chapters from yet another Dharmapada have been preserved in the Mahāvastu, one of the earliest of the Sanskritised Prakrit texts; one of the chapters is named as the Sahasravarga, and appears to be the whole of the chapter; the other is a selection that comes from an unnamed Bhikṣuvarga.

For example, the English Treason Act 1351 declares it to be treason \\"When a Man doth compass or imagine the Death of our Lord the King.\\" This was subsequently interpreted by the courts to include imprisoning the king, on the ground that history had shown that when a king is held captive by a usurper, he often dies in captivity.Specifically Edward II, Richard II, Henry VI, Edward V, and Charles I. See Edward Coke's Institutes of the Lawes of England, Third Part, chapter 1: \\"He that declareth by overt act to depose the king, is a sufficient overt act to prove, that he compasseth and imagineth the death of the king.\\" Despite legislative efforts to restrict the scope of treason, judges and prosecutors in common law jurisdictions still succeeded in broadening the reach of the offence by \\"constructing\\" new treasons. It is the opinion of one legal historian that: ==England and Great Britain== Ironically, the first attempt to constrain the development of constructive treasons in England was the 1351 Act itself. Its preamble states that Parliament had decided to define treason by statute for the first time because the common law definition had expanded so widely (however this had not been constructive treason, since until 1351 treason had always been defined by judges, not by legislation). The Act ended with a clause which prohibited further judicial development of the offence: As noted above, this was not entirely successful. From the seventeenth century, English courts refined and extended the law of treason,Knight, p. 142 tolerated by Parliament, which sometimes even enshrined these new constructive treasons in new statutes — imprisoning the king became written into the Treason Acts of 1661 and 1795. By the nineteenth century, however, Parliament had established itself as the main source of new crimes, as the volume of legislation increased, and the ancient common law tradition of judges creating new crimes fell into disuse. ==United States== The United States inherited the English common law from the British Empire, and the Founding Fathers recognised the danger of what James Madison called \\"new-fangled and artificial treasons.\\"Federalist Papers no. 43 (1788) Therefore, they intentionally drafted the treason clause of the US Constitution narrowly: This avoided vague words like \\"compassing or imagining\\" which had given British judges and lawyers such latitude. The words \\"giving them aid and comfort\\" were added by the Committee of Detail to further narrow the definition of treason.Meese, Edwin; Edwin Meese, III, David F. Forte, Matthew Spalding, \\"The Heritage Guide to the Constitution\\" Regnery Publishing, 2005, p. 264 This was done not only to prevent judges from constructing new treasons, but also to prevent Congress from enacting new ones. The constitutional definition did not immediately deter prosecutors from attempting to prosecute for levying war people who had not directly done so. However the Supreme Court resisted efforts to construe the definition more widely than its text appeared to allow. In Ex parte Bollman (1807) the Supreme Court rejected arguments by prosecutors to the effect that enlisting an army of men against the United States could amount to levying war before they actually assembled. Chief Justice Marshall held: \\"The mere enlisting of men, without assembling them, is not levying war.\\"Ex parte Bollman (1807) 8 U.S. 75 (Cranch). From FindLaw. In United States v. Burr the Court held that mere intent to commit treason was not sufficient either. Subsequent cases have concentrated on evidential requirements for proving treason, rather than definitions of substantive crimes. ==See also== *Trial of Lord George Gordon ==Notes and references== Category:Treason ","title":"Constructive treason"},{"id":"20413686","text":"Pepperwort is a common name for two different plants: *Plants in the species Lepidium *Marsilea minuta ","title":"Pepperwort"},{"id":"20413694","text":"Cedar Park is a historic home at Galesville, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States.

St Mary's was heavily bombed during The Blitz in 1940, all that remains of the old church is the floor plan and a few graves. Included among those buried on the site are Richard Parker, Richard Brandon, Sir John Cass, and \\"Sir\\" Jeffrey Dunstan, \\"Mayor of Garratt\\". The park was renamed Altab Ali Park in 1998 in memory of Altab Ali, a 25-year-old British Bangladeshi clothing worker, who was murdered on 4 May 1978 in Adler Street by three teenage boys as he walked home from work. Ali's murder was one of the many racist attacks that came to characterise the East End at that time. At the entrance to the park is an arch created by David Petersen, developed as a memorial to Altab Ali and other victims of racist attacks. The arch incorporates a complex Bengali-style pattern, meant to show the merging of different cultures in East London. Along the path down the centre of the park are letters spelling out \\"The shade of my tree is offered to those who come and go fleetingly\\", a fragment of a poem by Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore. The Shaheed Minar, which commemorates the Bengali Language Movement, stands in the southwest corner of Altab Ali Park. The monument is a smaller replica of the one in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and symbolises a mother and her martyred sons.

Davis (1999) , p. 82 Another name for injury phobia is traumatophobia, from Greek τραῦμα (trauma), \\"wound, hurt\\"τραῦμα, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and φόβος (phobos), \\"fear\\".φόβος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus It is associated with BII (Blood-Injury- Injection) Phobia. Sufferers exhibit irrational or excessive anxiety and a desire to avoid specific feared objects and situations, to the point of avoiding potentially life-saving medical procedures. According to one study, it is most common in females. What sets injury phobia apart is that it is when a person is exposed to blood, an injury, or an injection, they begin to experience extreme sensations of terror, such as breathlessness; excessive sweating; dry mouth; feeling sick; shaking; heart palpitations; inability to speak or think clearly; a fear of dying, going mad, or losing control; a sensation of detachment from reality; or a full blown anxiety attack. The treatments that are available are mostly behavioral and cognitive therapies, the most common being behavioral. One method of behavioral therapy for traumatophobia is to expose the client to the stimuli, in this case being exposure to blood, injury, and injections, and repeat the process until the client’s reactions are less and/or cured.

Blood-like stimuli (paint, ketchup) may also cause a reaction. This is a common phobia with an estimated 3-4% prevalence in the general population, though it has been found to occur more often in younger and less educated groups. When exposed to phobic triggers, those with the phobia often experience a two-phase response: an initial increase in heart rate and blood pressure, followed quickly by bradycardia (decreased heart rate) and hypotension (decreased blood pressure). This diminishes cerebral blood supply, and will often result in a fainting response. In an individual with BII phobia, expression of these or similar phobic symptoms in response to blood, injection, or injury typically begins before the age of ten. Many who have the phobia will take steps to actively avoid exposure to triggers. This can lead to health issues in phobic individuals as a result of avoidance of hospitals, doctors’ appointments, blood tests, and vaccinations, or of necessary self-injections in those with diabetes and multiple sclerosis (MS). Due to frequent avoidance of phobic triggers, BII phobics' personal and professional lives may be limited. Some may feel that their phobia precludes them from joining a healthcare profession, or from getting pregnant. The phobia is also able to affect the health of those who don't have it; a BII- phobic, for instance, may have difficulty providing aid to someone else in an emergency situation in which blood is present. Causes of BII phobia have yet to be fully understood. There is a body of evidence which suggests the phobia has genetic underpinnings, though many phobics also cite a traumatic life event as a cause of their fear. The fainting response accompanying the phobia may have originated as an adaptive evolutionary mechanism. Applied tension (AT), a method in which individuals alternately tense and relax their muscles while being exposed to a phobic trigger, is widely recognized as an effective form of treatment for BII phobia. While AT is generally the default treatment suggestion, methods of applied relaxation (AR) and exposure-only cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) have been found to be effective in diminishing phobic response in some instances. Certain other strategies can be employed to temporarily alleviate symptoms associated with phobic response, such as coughing to increase cranial blood flow. The acute symptoms associated with an episode of triggering are often fully resolved within a few minutes of stimuli removal. BII phobia does bear some similarity to other phobic disorders: specifically, dental phobia (commonly considered a sub-type of BII phobia) and hemophobia. In each of these phobias, a biphasic fainting response is a common reaction to a trigger. == Signs and symptoms == In a majority of specific phobias, affected individuals experience heightened anxiety when exposed to a phobic trigger. While BII-phobics experience a similar reaction initially upon exposure, most ultimately respond to a trigger with a biphasic, or two-phase, fainting response. In the first phase, phobics often experience an anxiety reaction characterized by elevated heart rate and heightened blood pressure, as occurs in most other phobias. This is the result of increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system. However, with BII phobia, a second phase usually follows closely, in which the phobic individual experiences a massive dip in heart rate and blood pressure known as vasovagal response. Stimulation of the vagus nerve, a part of the parasympathetic nervous system, is responsible for promoting the lowered heart rate and decreased blood pressure. These physiological changes limit blood flow to the brain and can promote pre- syncope (lightheadedness, feelings of faintness) and syncope (fainting): categorized in this instance as vasovagal fainting. This second, fainting phase is not common to other phobias. A fainting response pattern is not seen in all individuals with BII phobia, but is found in a majority. Up to 80% of those with BII phobia report either syncope or pre-syncope as a symptom when exposed to a trigger. Other symptoms that may evolve when exposed to phobic triggers include extreme chest discomfort, tunnel vision, becoming pale, shock, vertigo, diaphoresis (profuse sweating), nausea, and in very rare cases asystole (cardiac arrest) and death. Increase in stress hormone release (particularly of cortisol and corticotrophin) is typical. Neurological responses to phobic triggers include activation of the bilateral occipito- parietal cortex and the thalamus. It has also been suggested that exposing a BII-phobic individual to a trigger will lead to decreased activity in the brain's medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Diminished MPFC activity has been linked with impaired ability to control emotional responses. This lessened emotional control could contribute to a general lack of control over symptoms of anxiety arising when exposed to a phobic trigger. === Complications ===  On the health of those with the phobia  A woman receiving a vaccine. Some individuals with BII phobia may avoid injections, blood draws, or vaccinations (pictured) due to their anxiety and/or the physiological response they experience when exposed to a phobic trigger. The health of individuals with BII phobia can be jeopardized by the condition as a result of avoidance of phobic triggers. As modern healthcare relies increasingly on injections, it can be difficult for phobics to receive the care they need, since situations involving injections, vaccinations, drawing of blood, etc. are usually avoided. Avoidant behaviors can be especially detrimental to an individual's well-being if they are diabetic and require insulin injections, or experience another pathology or disease which requires treatment via self-injection, such as MS. There may be inappropriate cessation of injection treatment by individuals with the phobia, potentially causing adverse events or reducing treatment efficacy. Bodily injuries may also be sustained in the course of a fainting response to a phobic trigger. = Comorbidity with other health conditions = Substantial rates of comorbidity with BII phobia have been demonstrated for the following: * other life-long phobias * marijuana abuse * clinical depression * panic disorder * obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) * agoraphobia (AG) * social anxiety disorder (SAD) In individuals with diabetes: * peripheral vascular disease * cardiovascular disease  On the health of the broader population  BII phobia is able to affect the health of a broader population than just the community of individuals with the phobia. Someone with the phobia may, for instance, be unable to respond appropriately and/or offer assistance in an emergency event in which another person was injured or cut. Avoidance of vaccinations due to BII phobia may also prove detrimental to public health at large, as lowered rates of vaccination in a population tend to increase risk of infectious disease outbreak. Given BII phobics will very often avoid situations involving exposure to blood or needles, these individuals are likely to avoid donating blood. Public health benefit could result from helping them overcome their phobia, such that donation becomes a viable option. === Limitations on personal and professional life === BII phobia may influence the personal and professional decisions of those with the condition. BII-phobic females may, for instance, choose not to get pregnant, as they fear the injections, vaccinations, and labor-induced pain associated with maternity. Those with the phobia may also be unable to pursue a profession in a health-related field, such as nursing, which would require repeated exposure to feared stimuli. Phobic individuals may find their ability to complete medical school severely impaired. === Related disorders ===  Dental phobia  Dental phobia is often considered a sub-type of BII phobia, as dental phobics generally fear the aspects of dentistry that are invasive (those commonly involving blood and injections). Some individuals with dental phobia do, however, have fears which center mainly around choking or gagging during a dental procedure. As with many individuals with BII phobia, many dental phobics will attempt to avoid their triggers. This can lead to refusal to seek dental care, potentially contributing to tooth decay and overall poor oral health. Individuals with dental phobia exhibit symptoms similar to those with BII phobia when exposed to a phobic trigger, including syncope and pre-syncope.  Hemophobia  BII phobia is closely related to hemophobia (fear of blood), though the two are not the same condition. While the anxieties of BII-phobics tend to extend beyond the fear of blood to ideas of pain, needle breakage inside the body, or needle contact with bones, hemophobics tend to be specifically concerned with exposure to blood. However, in both phobias, individuals experience similar symptoms when exposed to phobic triggers. == Causes == The cause of BII phobia is not yet well understood. Various studies indicate an underlying genetic cause, wherein certain genes make an individual more vulnerable to developing specific phobias. The contributing genes have not yet been identified. BII phobia has markedly strong familial aggregation — if present in a family, multiple members are likely to have the phobia. This aggregation is stronger in BII phobia than in any other known phobic disorder: upwards of 60% of those with the phobia have first-degree relatives who are also BII-phobics. It is believed that this evidences the phobia's genetic underpinnings. One study estimated actual heritability of the phobia at 59%. Additionally, a majority of phobics attribute their fear to environmental factors. For instance, some sort of traumatic event involving blood, injury, or injection that conditioned them to fear those particular stimuli. Others self-report being conditioned by seeing another person react to the stimuli with a consistent pattern of fear. It has been theorized that exhibiting vasovagal response when exposed to blood was evolutionarily advantageous, and that this phobia is a vestige of an ancestral evolutionary mechanism. Fainting may have acted as a form of tonic immobility, allowing primitive humans to play dead in a situation where blood was being spilled, perhaps helping them to avoid the attention of enemies. It has also been suggested that the drop in blood pressure associated with seeing blood — as with an individual seeing blood from their own wound — occurs in order to minimize blood loss. == Treatments == Individuals typically seek therapeutic treatment for BII phobia in a bid to alleviate symptoms that arise when exposed to a phobic trigger. Therapists may use a combination of physical and psychological measures, such as cognitive-behavioral-therapy and applied tension (AT), in order to aid in extinguishing the individual's fear response. Early studies of methods to combat vasovagal fainting found that certain leg exercises and that individuals making themselves angry over imagined scenarios could increase blood pressure, thus elevating cerebral blood flow and preventing fainting upon exposure to a phobic trigger. A later study tested applied muscle tension as a way of preventing fainting when an individual with a fear of injuries was exposed to triggering visual stimuli. Lars-Göran Öst expanded upon this research, having BII-phobic individuals engage in applied muscle tension while shown blood stimuli. Those who were trained in the technique showed notable symptom improvement over the course of five one-hour treatment sessions. An AT treatment program most often involves an individual being instructed to clench their arm, leg, and chest muscles in 10 to 15 second intervals as they are systematically exposed to triggers of increasing likeness to real blood or needles. This program is designed to increase heart rate and blood pressure, counteracting vasovagal response. The method of applied tension remains popular — it is the most common BII phobia treatment suggestion, and has been found to be highly effective in a majority of BII- phobics. However, exposure-only cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can also be effective, as can the method of applied relaxation (AR). CBT is a technique which promotes fear extinguishment by way of gradual, repeated exposure to feared stimuli. BII-phobics may be given pictures of needles or blood, asked to illustrate needles or scenes with blood, or to speak about their phobic triggers. This systematically progresses to the point of the individual directly confronting a phobic stimulus: being given a needle, witnessing blood being drawn, etc. As exposure continues, it is expected that the phobic response will become less pronounced, and symptoms less debilitating. While AT targets the phobia’s physiological response, aiming to raise blood pressure and directly prevent fainting, AR focuses mainly on helping an individual avoid the phobia’s associated anxiety. A phobic will learn progressive relaxation techniques to help to calm themselves upon exposure to a trigger. === Temporary alleviation of symptoms === Drinking water before a triggering experience such as blood donation has been indicated to aid in prevention of a fainting response. Water will increase sympathetic nervous system activation, raising blood pressure and combating vasovagal response. Certain physical maneuvers also have the capacity to temporarily boost blood pressure, alleviating symptoms of pre-syncope like lightheadedness by boosting blood flow to the brain. These include the phobic individual crossing their legs, making tight fists with both hands, or engaging muscles of the trunk or arms. Coughing, which can similarly increase cranial blood flow, can also be useful as a coping mechanism to avoid pre-syncope and syncope. Symptoms of a phobic response are generally able to be fully alleviated within a few minutes simply by removing the phobic trigger. == Epidemiology == BII phobia is one of the more common types of phobia — it is estimated to affect about 3-4% of the general population. Onset of the phobia generally occurs in middle childhood, before the age of ten. There are more reports of incidence of the phobia in younger individuals and those with low education levels. Some studies suggest that women also experience the phobia more frequently, however results are mixed concerning relative prevalences of the phobia between the sexes. == References == Category:Phobias ","title":"Blood-injection-injury type phobia"},{"id":"20413970","text":"The Patrick Creagh House is a historic house located at 160 Prince George Street in Annapolis, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. == Description and history == It is a single-pile, -story brick house with a steeply pitched gambrel roof.

It was first recorded by Troilo's orchestra with vocals by Edmundo Rivero on 23 February 1948. The first live performance, by the same artists, was at the Tibidabo night club in Buenos Aires. ==Lyrics== The song is an elegy for a lost love, framed in the landmarks of the south side of Buenos Aires, lamenting both the end of a love story and the changes in the barrio (neighborhood). The male narrator addresses the girl in the second person; it is mentioned that the girl was 20 at the time. Among the landmarks mentioned are: the corner of San Juan and Boedo at the center of the Boedo neighborhood, Pompeya (the barrio located directly to the south of Boedo), the railway crossing and the swampland at the (southern) edge of Pompeya, and the enigmatic \\"blacksmith's corner, mud and pampa\\", which could refer to the corner of Centenera and Tabaré, already named in Manzi's earlier \\"Manoblanca\\" or to a blacksmith shop in the corner of Inclán and Loria, in Parque Patricios neighbourhood. The chorus in its first four words is famously considered to capture the fabled pathos of wistfulness or existencial angst of the Sur of Buenos Aires, with \\"Sur, paredón, y después..:\\" (\\"South, a [crumbling, old] wall, and beyond.. \\") alluding to the desolate open spaces of the flat Pampas that seemed to crouch behind the (long gone at the time of writing) last dividing houses' or vacant lots' brick walls on the barrio's farthest empty cobblestone streets. This ambience can be still partially felt at the southernmost reaches of Boedo and other formerly industrial and working class barrios del Sur such as the mentioned Parque Patricios, Pompeya, Barracas (named so for its barracks) or La Boca, the last three bordering the Riachuelo, the demarcation line (never in plain sight, as always hidden beyond houses, factories, elevated tracks or paredones) that seemed to bring the city to an abrupt end, behind which lay nothingness. In the comparatively not so distant past at the time of the writing of Sur, the Riachuelo marked the transition to the barbarous empty Pampas, at risk of aboriginal raids or malones into the early 19th century, a frontier-like remoteness long present in the collective imagination of the porteños (see for example Jorge Luis Borges' story \\"El Sur\\", Fernando Solanas' film \\"Sur\\") Manzi himself was actually born in Añatuya, Santiago del Estero, and moved into Buenos Aires at the age of nine, living close to the landmarks mentioned in the tango. Rivero himself made two small changes to the lyrics, with Manzi's blessing:: \\"florando\\" became \\"flotando\\" (\\"flowering\\" to \\"floating\\", as the original verb is uncommon and was not understood by audiences), and \\"y mi amor y tu ventana\\" became \\"y mi amor en tu ventana\\" (\\"and my love and your window\\" became \\"and my love in your window\\"). The first of these changes was universally adopted. ==Recognition== Troilo's collaboration with Manzi yielded several hits during the 1940s, including \\"Barrio de Tango\\" and the waltz \\"Romance de Barrio\\", but none achieved the universal recognition of \\"Sur\\", perhaps the tango most loved by Argentines, and certainly one of the most conspicuously recorded.. Besides Rivero's original recording, notable versions include covers by Julio Sosa, Nelly Omar, Roberto Goyeneche, and Andrés Calamaro. Argentine author Ernesto Sabato has said that he'd give away all he's written for the privilege of being the author of \\"Sur\\". ==References * Translated lyrics at planet-tango.com * Translated lyrics at tanguito.co.uk * Video version sung by Nelly Omar, with translated lyrics. *Video version (at 1:23:40) sung by Roberto Goyeneche for the film Sur, shot mostly in Barracas *A scene featuring old cafe \\"Sur\\" in Barracas, showing some of the ambience (with the tango \\"La última curda\\" by Goyeneche) Category:Tangos Category:1948 songs Category:Argentine tango ","title":"Sur (song)"},{"id":"20414162","text":"Albert Capraro (May 20, 1943 – October 2013) was an American fashion designer.

He subsequently progressed onto the club's minor and under-21 teams before eventually making his breakthrough at senior level. On 23 September 1979, Enright was at right wing- back when he won his first County Championship medal after a 2-16 to 0-16 defeat of Tournafulla in the final. After surrendering their title and failing to make the final stage over the following two seasons, Patrickswell qualified for the final once again on 12 September 1982. Enright was at full-back for that game and won a second County Championship medal after a 0-17 to 0-15 defeat of Bruree in the final. Enright was appointed captain of the Patrickswell senior hurling team for the 1983 season. On 11 September 1983, he won a third County Championship medal when he captained the team to a 1-13 to 1-07 defeat of Ballybrown in the final. Patrickswell secured a third successive County Championship title on 14 October 1984, with Enright winning his fourth championship title overall after a 4-13 to 3-05 defeat of Cappamore in the final. On 13 September 1987, Enright won a fifth County Championship medal following Patrickswell's 1-17 to 3-10 defeat of Ballybrown in the final. Patrickswell retained the championship on 16 October 1988 following a 4-10 to 2-06 defeat of Cappamore in a final replay. It was Enright's sixth championship winners' medal. He ended the year by winning a Munster Club Championship medal after Patrickswell's 3-13 to 2-13 defeat of Mount Sion. Enright won his seventh and final County Championship medal on 21 October 1990 after a 1-15 to 1-12 defeat of Adare. He later claimed a second Munster Club Championship medal following an 0-08 to 0-06 defeat of Éire Óg. On 17 March 1991, Patrickswell lined out against Glenmore in the All-Ireland final. Enright scored a point from play, however, Patrickswell suffered a 1-13 to 0-12 defeat. ===Limerick=== Minor and under-21 Enright first played for Limerick when he was selected in goal for the minor team. He enjoyed little success in this grade before progressing onto the Limerick under-21 team in 1972. His three-year tenure in this grade also ended without championship success. Senior Enright made his first appearance for the Limerick senior hurling team when he lined out in goal on 7 March 1971 in a 1-17 to 2-07 defeat of Wexford in the National Hurling League. He ended the campaign by winning his first league medal as a substitute. Enright was dropped from the Limerick team at the end of 1972 and missed out on the team's All-Ireland Championship success in 1973. After a three-year gap, Enright returned to the Limerick panel and made his Munster Championship debut at midfield in a 2-16 to 3-13 draw with Tipperary on 6 July 1975. After two seasons at midfield he became disillusioned and left the panel. Enright gave up hurling altogether, switched codes to rugby union and played with Young Munster in 1977 and 1978. A career-ending eye injury to Pat Hartigan in 1979 paved the way for Enright's return to the Limerick senior team. He initially played in his usual position at midfield before later becoming the first- choice full-back in succession to the injured Hartigan. On 20 July 1980, Enright won his first Munster Championship medal after a 2-14 to 2-10 defeat of reigning champions Cork in the final. This victory secured Limerick a place in the All-Ireland final against Galway on 7 September 1980. Enright played at full-back, however, in spite of a personal scoring tally of 2-07 for Éamonn Cregan, Limerick suffered a 2-15 to 3-09 defeat. Enright ended the season by winning his first All Star award. Enright won a second successive Munster Championship medal on 5 July 1981 after a 3-12 to 2-09 defeat of Clare in the final. He ended the season with a second successive All Star award. Enright was appointed captain of the Limerick senior team for the 1983 season. After losing the National League final to Kilkenny, Limerick's season came to an end with a Munster semi-final replay defeat by Cork. In spite of a trophy-less season, Enright ended the year by winning a third All Star award in four seasons. After retaining the captaincy for the 1984 season, Enright guided the Limerick team to a second successive league final appearance. A 3-16 to 1-09 defeat of Wexford gave Enright a second National League medal and a first won on the field of play. On 14 April 1985, Enright won a third National League medal following Limerick's 3-12 to 1-07 defeat of Clare in the final. It was his second successive title as captain of the team. Enright played his last championship game for Limerick on 5 June 1988, when he captained the team to a 0-16 to 0-08 defeat by Tipperary. ===Munster=== Enright was first selected at full-back for the Munster team in 1981. He retained his position on the team for five successive seasons and won three Railway Cup medals during that time after defeats of Leinster in 1981 and 1984 and Connacht in 1985. ==Personal life== Outside of his sporting life Enright worked as a caretaker with Mary Immaculate College. He was married to Birdie and had three sons and a daughter. Enright died at the Milford Care Centre on 2 November 2018, just hours after his induction into the GAA Hall of Fame was celebrated at the annual All Star Awards. ==Honours== ;Patrickswell *Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship (2): 1988, 1990 *Limerick Senior Hurling Championship (7): 1979, 1982, 1983 (c), 1984, 1987, 1988, 1990 ;Limerick *Munster Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1980, 1981 *National Hurling League (3): 1970-71, 1983-84 (c), 1984-85 (c) ;Munster *Railway Cup (3): 1981, 1984, 1985 ;Individual *GAA Hall of Fame Inductee: 2018 ==References== Category:1953 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Patrickswell hurlers Category:Patrickswell Gaelic footballers Category:Limerick inter-county hurlers Category:Munster inter-provincial hurlers Category:Hurling goalkeepers Category:Hurling backs Category:Young Munster players ","title":"Leonard Enright"},{"id":"20414349","text":"David T.

Gollum, from Wenzel's adaptation of The Hobbit. A recommendation from college classmate Larry Marder was key to Wenzel's landing his next major project. Marder was working with the people who had secured the rights to adapt The Hobbit to comics, and he knew firsthand that Wenzel had devoted his senior year in college to drawing Tolkien's characters. And so Wenzel provided the fully painted art for The Hobbit: An Illustrated Edition of the Fantasy Classic, a three-part adaptation of The Hobbit, written by Chuck Dixon and Sean Deming. The work was originally published by Eclipse Comics in 1989. Published in a collected edition by Ballantine in 1990, The Hobbit: An Illustrated Edition of the Fantasy Classic is one of the most successful graphic format adaptations of a piece of classic literature.Wenzel bio, Arts Center Kilingsworth. In 2001, it was updated by Del Rey Books with a new cover, larger format, and 32 new pages of artwork. Another graphic novel project in a similar vein was Wenzel and writer Douglas Wheeler's adaptation of some of the Brothers Grimm's fairytales for NBM in 1995. In 1998 Wenzel teamed with acclaimed comics writer Kurt Busiek on The Wizard’s Tale, the story of Evernight, a land ruled by a consortium of evil wizards who discover that one of their kind harbors a \\"dangerous\\" glimmer of good. The Wizard’s Tale was designed to be a crossover book that blended children's book elements with the format and readability of a graphic novel. Other notable projects Wenzel has done include Robert L.

The Hungarian broadcaster, Magyar Televízió (MTV), confirmed their participation in November 2008. ==Before Eurovision Internal selection === Artists and composers were able to submit their entries between 14 January 2009 and 2 February 2009. After the submission deadline had passed, 105 entries were received by the broadcaster. A four-member jury reviewed all submissions and the selected entry was announced on 3 February 2009. The jury consisted of Andrea Szulák (represented Hungary in the 1993 Contest), Laszlo Szuts (representative of Mahasz), Levente Harsányi (television presenter) and Gabor Takács (television presenter). Márk Zentai was initially announced as the Hungarian entrant at the 2009 contest with the song \\"If You Wanna Party\\", however Zentai shortly withdrew from the contest as the song was released in 2004 as the Swedish Big Brother theme song, titled \\"We Became Friends\\". Therefore, the jury reviewed the remaining submissions and selected the replacement entry. On 4 February 2009, MTV announced \\"Magányos csónak\\" by actress Kátya Tompos as the replacement. However on 10 February 2009, Tompos also withdrew from the contest as she wanted to focus on her theatre career and that she had no time to prepare her participation in Eurovision properly, due to her having to take part in 8 plays of 3 different theatres. Therefore, the jury had to select a second replacement entry from the remaining 103 submissions. On 23 February 2009, MTV announced \\"Dance With Me\\" by Zoli Ádok as the final replacement entry after shortlisting three songs to be sure one of them will not withdraw and completely meet the requirements. Before the selection of Kátya Tompos, the Alliance of Hungarian Popular Music Composers and Songwriters protested that they did not feel as if the jury had long enough to make a correct decision, and were dissatisfied with the internal selection instead of a national final where the public could vote for the winner. Other claims were made as well, such as that the songwriters should be Hungarian and that the jury was not professional. MTV, however, stood by their decision of the internal selection, as well as revealing that the jury of television and music industry professionals chose the song all day long on 3 February 2009, and that they were satisfied with the jury's decision. { class=\\"sortable \\" style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; ! colspan=\\"5\\" Internal Selection - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" !

At the semi-final allocation draw on 30 January, it was decided that the country would compete in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009. Zoli performed for Hungary in position 11 in the running order, following Slovenia and preceding Azerbaijan. He failed to qualify Hungary to the final for a second successive year. On stage, Zoli was joined by three female dancers and two backing vocalists Gábor Heincz and Jnoffin Kasai. In the beginning of the performance, Zoli and his three female dancers wore black and white costumes. Then, the dancers removed Zoli's costume before undressing themselves, with only skimpy dresses remaining on the girls and a skin-tight shirt on the singer. The LED projections during the performance have floating shapes in the verses, and expanding white lines and the words Dance With Me written across them during the chorus. In Hungary, both the semi-finals and the final were broadcast on M1 with commentary by Gábor Gundel Takács.

While serving in his family's country of origin, he became a political prisoner, and later, after his release, an author. Ratiu served as a pastor in both Giurtelecu Șimleului, Romania, and in Plainfield, Illinois, in the United States. == Early life == Ratiu was born on 4 May 1916, in Scalp Level, Pennsylvania, in the United States, one of the four sons of Elisabeta Chindriș and Grigore Rațiu, immigrants from Romania. His brothers were named Grigore, Ioan and Emilian. In 1921, his family moved back to Romania where he was raised in Moftinu Mic, Sălaj County (now Satu Mare County). In Carei, Ratiu attended \\"Vasile Lucaciu\\" State High School. Then he studied philosophy at Oradea, where he was a schoolmate with Coriolan Tămâian, who later became a noted prelate of the diocese. Following his university studies, in preparation for the priesthood, he studied theology at the seminary in Blaj. Ratiu then went to Rome, where he attended the Pio Romano Seminary and the Pontifical Urbaniana University, where he received a doctorate in theology. Ratiu was a classmate for seven years with Virgil Maxim (1923–1997), who was also a noted prisoner of the Romanian communist government for his religious beliefs.My Orthodoxy \\"A Christian marriage role model: Virgil and Petruța Maxim\\" == Ministry in Romania == Ratiu was ordained a priest of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church in Rome on 20 July 1941, by Bishop Alexander Evreinov, for the Greek Catholic Diocese of Oradea Mare in the region of Transylvania in Romania. Ratiu worked as a volunteer for the National Peasants' Party, for which, in 1946, he worked to organize the country's general election. In May 1947, he served as a priest in Giurtelecu Șimleului. Between May 1947 and July 1948, Ratiu was arrested and imprisoned for his political activity against the Romanian Communist Party. After his release, Ratiu taught at the Greek-Catholic seminary in Oradea. A few months later, in October 1948, the Romanian government dissolved the Greek-Catholic Church in the country, declaring that the will of the people was to join the Romanian Orthodox Church. They seized all its churches and institutions and gave them to the Orthodox Church. The government then arrested the six bishops of the Church, along with many priests and lay leaders, and attempted to convince them to declare publicly their allegiance to the Orthodox Church. Refusal led to torture and often death. Ratiu refused, however, to renounce his faith. == Political prisoner == { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 25%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  \\"In prison one either goes mad or becomes a saint.\\" -  style=\\"text-align: right;\\"  Alexander Rațiu } Consequently, Ratiu was arrested again on 19 October 1948, by the Communist government and remained imprisoned for the next sixteen years, of which eighteen months were passed in solitary confinement at the Sighet Prison. Between 1948–1964, Rațiu was imprisoned at a succession of prisons: , Sighet prison (May 1950 – July 1955), Gherla (1955–1959), Jilava, Bătești, followed by being sent to labor camps at Strâmba, Stoienești and Great Brăila Island. Ratiu was subsequently placed under house arrest for another two years (1962–1964), during which time he was confined in Lățești, Ialomița County. == Return to the United States == In 1964, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the Secretary General of the Romanian Communist Party, declared a general amnesty for political prisoners, which set Ratiu free. The Communist authorities allowed him to leave Romania in 1970, and he returned to the United States in 1971, staying with his brother Grigore and his family. Rațiu met with Pope John Paul II in Rome and presented the situation of Greek-Catholic Church in Romania. He served in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Joliet in Illinois from 1974 until his retirement. Ratiu was an assistant priest at St. Mary Immaculate Church in Plainfield, Illinois (1975–1982). Rațiu became a member of the Cardinal József Mindszenty Foundation in 1977, and for 25 years served on the Board of Directors, participating in the foundation's conferences in St. Louis, Kankakee, and Chicago, where he gave many talks. An abridged edition of his book, Stolen Church, was a Christmas gift by the Foundation to its members.http://www.mindszenty.org/report/2002/MindszentySep02.pdf Ratiu was generous in his friendship and financial support for countless persons in Romania seeking to emigrate to the United States. He helped establish a Romanian Greek-Catholic Mission of Saints Peter and Paul in Chicago in December 1994. Ratiu spoke eight languages fluently, and this aptitude for languages led him to learn Spanish to celebrate Mass for Mexican migrant workers. In 1996, following the collapse of Communist rule in Romania, Rațiu returned for a visit to witness the rebirth of the Greek Catholic Church. He preached to large crowds of the faithful as parishes reopened, and attended the consecration of several new bishops for the Byzantine Rite. == Awards == In 1983, the Polish Freedom Fighters bestowed upon Alexander Ratiu the Solidarity Freedom Award. == Death == Raţiu died on 25 July 2002, at his home in Plainfield, Illinois, at the age of 86. On his deathbed Rațiu said, \\"Spiritual freedom gives us courage, the courage to preach. So I preached freely and defended the faith when the persecution began, and I rejoiced when I was arrested.\\" His funeral took place at the Romanian Greek Catholic Church \\"Sf. Gheorghe\\", in Aurora, Illinois, on the morning of 27 July 2002. Ratiu was interred in Plainfield, Illinois. == Legacy == Alexander Rațiu remarked that prison had an unexpected effect on priests and other believers, as well as former atheists: \\"In prison one either goes mad or becomes a saint.\\" For many who suffered imprisonment, it was the first time in their lives that they were led to pray and to look for God's support: == Works == * Alexander Ratiu and William Virtue, Stolen Church: Martyrdom in Communist Romania (Huntington, Indiana: Our Sunday Visitor, Inc., 1979). * Alexandru Rațiu, Biserica Furată (Cluj-Napoca: Ed.

Its purpose is an examination and condemnation of violence and sexuality in cinema, as well as other media, such as TV and rock music.Charles Oliver,\\"It's Not a Wonderful Book\\" (Review of Hollywood vs. America), Reason Magazine, February 1993, (pp. 46-48). Medved argued in the book that since the 1960s, American popular culture- especially Hollywood cinema-had been producing art that was excessively violent, sexual and disrespectful to authority, and that such art was having a harmful effect on American society. The book's evidence relies heavily on the Lichter & Rothman book Watching America and the 1990 conference \\"The Impact of the Media on Children and the Family\\" to conclude that violence in cinema has a negative impact on American culture, especially by motivating viewers to mimic the violence they see on the screen. The book was praised by George Gilder in its American edition. ==Reception== In his book Movies About the Movies, film historian Christopher Ames took issue with Hollywood vs. America. Ames described the book's viewpoint as overly simplistic, and argued that it exhibited \\"virtually no awareness of the function of fantasy and vicarious experience…That audiences might have complex reasons for viewing behavior they do not wish to emulate or experience firsthand eludes Medved.\\" Christopher Ames, Movies about the movies : Hollywood reflected. Lexington, Kentucky : University Press of Kentucky, (p. 121) . Charles Oliver, reviewing the book for the libertarian monthly magazine, Reason, took issue with many of Medved's arguments. Oliver stated the commercial failure of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier was due to the fact \\"it was simply the worst of the series\\", not because of Medved's statement that audiences objected to what Medved claimed as the anti-religious tone of the film. Oliver pointed out themes like anti-heroes, crime and adultery had been staples of the American film industry since the 1940s, citing films like Double Indemnity and White Heat. Oliver also stated \\"Medved never once considers the idea that maybe adultery is a powerful dramatic theme-powerful because we value marriage so much\\". In the liberal magazine, The New Republic, the then-film critic for The New Yorker magazine, David Denby, wrote that Hollywood vs. America \\"is the stupidest book about popular culture that I have read to the end.\\" \\"At Odds With Hollywood Values: Interview with Michael Medved\\". November 17, 1992. Christian Science Monitor. Retrieved November 8 2019. John Podhoretz in the conservative magazine Commentary praised the book, stating: \\"The central point of Hollywood vs. America is, however, unassailable: not only is there a gaping chasm between Hollywood's America and the real America, but Hollywood seems willing to pay in the coin of reduced profits for its continual refusal to bridge the chasm\\". Hollywood vs America was criticized in two articles by Brian Siano in the January 1993 issue of The Humanist magazine as being a case of Medved trying to exaggerate in order to make his point.The Screening Room of Dr. Caligari Reprint of Siano's article The English novelist Martin Amis agreed with some of Medved's points about violence affecting young audiences, while still ultimately rejecting Medved's argument, saying violence was an inevitable part of any artistic medium.Martin Amis: The War Against Cliche: Essays and Reviews, 1971-2000 .Knopf Canada, 2001 == References  *Booknotes interview with Medved on Hollywood vs. America, December 27, 1992.

The Mark II Blit was introduced in January 2002 and ended production in June 2007 due to consolidation efforts. The car remained in production until three years after the Mark X came out, which replaced all of Toyota's X-body sedans, the Verossa, which in turn is a successor to the Chaser and the Cresta, and the Mark II. Toyota's official Mark II Blit successor is the front-wheel drive minivan, the Mark X ZiO, from September 2007. The Mark II Blit marked the return to the Mark II platform with rear-wheel drive layout with optional four-wheel drive and not a wagon version of the front-wheel drive Camry. The car was given a minor facelift in December 2004, including changes to the headlamps, grille and taillamps, which are replaced with LED units. The Mark II Blit uses inline-six engines with an optional turbocharger that was discontinued in May 2006, as a result of Japan's emission standards in 2005.

The Highway heads until it reaches the Town of Midwest where it meets the northern terminus of Wyoming Highway 259 (Old US 87).

U.S. Route 185 was commissioned in 1926 to run from Cheyenne, Wyoming to Orin. It was proposed that US 185 continue north to Gillette, via US 20 between Orin and Douglas, and via Wyoming Highway 59 between Douglas and Gillette. But the road now carrying WYO 59 did not exist. So when Highway 59 was constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s, it carried the designation US 185. After the Great Recommissioning of 1936, Wyoming 185 was renumbered to Wyoming 387, since the route directly connected to the new U.S. 87, not U.S. 85.Wyoming @ AARoads.com - Wyoming Highway 185 (US 185) In 1945, the 387 designation was changed to WYO 59.Wyoming @ AARoads.com - Wyoming Highway 59 Wyoming Highway 387 was recommissioned in the late 1940s to run from US 87 in Midwest to Wyoming Highway 59 in Wright. Wyoming Highway 387 maintained this route until the 1980s, when I-25 was completed. At that time, Wyoming 387 was extended west along old US 87 to meet the new I-25.

It earned tenth place in the first semi-final, failing to proceed to the final round. ==Before Eurovision Possible withdrawal === A possible withdrawal of Macedonia from the 2009 contest was rumoured, due to financial difficulties within MKRTV which could have ended in bankruptcy or liquidation of the company. As such, there would have been no Macedonian broadcaster within the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the contest’s organisers, and so a withdrawal of Macedonia from the contest would have been inevitable. Despite this, MKRTV confirmed Macedonia’s participation at the 2009 contest in Moscow, Russia. === Skopje Fest 2009 === MKRTV officially revealed that they were looking for a new selection method for the country for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009. Weekly debate programs were held by MKRTV on television, which were used as a platform for discussion between MKRTV and the Macedonian public on how the selection process for the Macedonian entry can be fair and successful.  Format  The contest consisted of two semi finals held on 19 and 20 February 2009. Sixteen songs competed in each semi-final and the top six from each semi-final qualified for the final on 21 February 2009. The results of the semi-finals and the final were determined by a 50/50 combination of votes from a jury panel and public televoting. All shows took place at the Universal Hall in Skopje, and were hosted by Zoran Ljutkov and Biljana Gjorgjiovska.  Competing entries  A submission period for interested artists and composers to submit their entries was opened on 26 November 2008 and closed on 25 December 2008.

It was opened in 1848 by the Maldon, Witham & Braintree Railway (MWBR) on a branch line from to Maldon. It was originally named Maldon but was renamed Maldon East in 1889 and then Maldon East and Heybridge in 1907. It was a terminus station located at the end of two branch lines from Witham and Woodham Ferrers. A plan dated 1920 shows that the station had a goods shed and a two-road engine shed. A turntable was situated adjacent to the station building and there were sidings that served the Blackwater Canal and the river wharf. The line and the station closed to passenger services in 1964 as part of the Beeching closures. == Description== The station building at Maldon is an impressive example of Victorian railway architecture. The reason behind this is during the 1847 election the potential MP (David Waddington a vice- chair of the Eastern Counties Railway) was looking to woo his constituents. A lot of local people found employment on the construction of the railway and it was reported in an investigation into the election afterwards that some of these were not actually fit to do the work they were paid for. The station building was built in the Jacobean style, with a large booking hall, waiting rooms and ticket office on the ground floor. The upper floor contained the station master’s apartments which were reached by a winding staircase from the booking hall. Originally the single platform was partly covered by a glass roof but this was removed after an explosion of an engine boiler caused significant damage. A second bay platform was added in 1889. Maldon East Railway Station building ==History== The branch from Witham was part of a scheme to link Braintree (\\"the granary of Essex\\") with its traditional port at Maldon. The scheme started in 1845 as a direct link from Braintree rather than the two branches that were actually built. It soon ran into financial trouble and was taken over by the Eastern Counties Railway keen to ensure there was no competition for its own interests. And this was before work actually started Construction started in March 1847 and the first goods trains ran in August 1848 followed by the opening to passenger trains on 2 October of the same year. In 1862 the Eastern Counties Railway was taken over by the Great Eastern Railway (GER). The station was originally named Maldon, but after the opening of the Maldon West line on 1 October 1889, the station was renamed to Maldon East. The 50 foot diameter turntable (manufactured by Ransomes & Rapier of Ipswich was installed at this time and a second platform was added to the west of the station building at this time. In 1907 the station was further renamed to Maldon East and Heybridge as its actual position is half way between the two villages. At the beginning of 1923 operation of the station was taken over by the London & North Eastern Railway. In 1939 traffic was withdrawn from the Woodham Ferrers line as a wartime economy measure. The branch saw heavy usage in World War 2 with additional freight traffic. Following nationalisation of the railways in 1948 the station became part of British Railways Eastern Region. In 1953 the Woodham Ferrers branch was closed - it had been operating one goods service per weekday for many years. However between 31 January 1957 and 31 January 1959 the line did re-open for freight as far as Maldon West with trains reversing at Maldon East and Heybridge station. In 1958 Railbuses started operating the line to Witham with an improved schedule and in 1959 more frequent services were introduced. It was however too late as the rise of road transport and cheaper competing bus services saw the Witham branch carrying just 400 passengers per day. It is thought by 1959 the engine shed had closed (precise date unknown ) as no steam locomotives were using the branch. The line was slated for closure in the Beeching Report and despite the efforts of local campaigners the last passenger train ran on 6 September 1964. Freight lingered on with gravel and fruit traffic until 15 April 1966. ==Locomotives== Ex Norfolk Railway 2-4-0 locomotives worked early trains on the branch. From GER days until 1958 the passenger service was generally in the hands of a GER Class M15 (LNE class F4 2-4-2T engine hauling two GER corridor coaches (three in summer). Occasionally GER Class Y14 (LNE class J15) 0-6-0 locomotives worked passenger services as did a T26 (LNE Class E4 2-4-0) for one summer. Other GER tank engines occasionally worked passenger services and 0-6-0T engines from the R24 (LNE class J67) and C72 (LNE class J68) classes worked goods traffic until succumbing to dieselisation. From 1958 the station was operated by the first generation of BR Railbuses numbers E79960-E79964 which were based at Cambridge and which also worked a number of lightly used East Anglian branch lines. The Class 15 locomotives took over freight workings as weight restrictions on the timber bridges on the branch meant nothing heavier could work as far as Maldon. A member of this class operated the last goods train in April 1966. ==Maldon engine shed== This was a substantial two track building. Until the Maldon West branch opened in 1889 there was no turntable located at Maldon so any tender engines working the branch would have had to have worked one direction tender first. In organisational terms Maldon was a sub-shed of Colchester and any locomotives needing heavy repair were sent there. In GER days the shed had two drivers, two acting drivers, four firemen and a boiler washer (who probably did most of the odd jobs around the shed as well). On 1 January 1922 the shed had an allocation of four GER Class C32 2-4-2T locomotive (later LNER Class F3) and a single GER Class Y65 2-4-2T locomotive (later LNER Class F7 and nicknamed Crystal Palace tanks). The shed closed sometime after dieselisation c 1959. ==Goods traffic== The sidings to the River Blackwater and Blackwater Canal provided additional traffic. As well as agricultural produce there was significant coal traffic in the early years of the railway. ==Train services== In 1847 there were five trains each way to Witham. Between 1874 and 1883 there were nine services per day to Witham, but ten years later this had reduced to seven. Bradshaw’s Timetable Guide for 1910 shows seven trains per day with two additional services on a Wednesday (market day?). By 1939 there were nine services per day but it was not until 1958 and the introduction of Diesel Multiple Units that the branch enjoyed a service of 17 trains per day. On opening the Woodham Ferrers branch was served by five trains per day and this struggled for traffic throughout its life. By 1914 there were six trains per day although this reduced during the First World War. In 1939 traffic was withdrawn from the Woodham Ferrers line as a wartime economy measure and never restarted. ==Since closure== The station building has survived and was for many years a restaurant. As of August 2013 it is largely surrounded by an industrial estate although its impressive frontage can still be viewed from Station Road. The original large goods shed stood until May 2008 when it was illegally demolished to make way for development.https://www.itsaboutmaldon.co.uk/railway/ Former Services ==References * Maldon East and Heybridge station on navigable 1945 O.

Hallway connecting the main hall to the platforms 1, 2 and 3 and the bus station. Old signs are still visible above the tunnels from the days that border customs were present in this station. Due to the fortified character of the town, the first railway station was in fact situated outside of Maastricht, within the municipality of Meerssen. The first station was built out of wood, so that in case of enemy attack, the station could quickly be demolished. The municipality borders were adjusted in 1907, thus making the station part of the municipality of Maastricht. The current, brick building was built in 1913, designed by George Willem van Heukelom. Due to the station's international connections, the station housed border customs. Even though trains from Belgium still call at Maastricht, passport and security checks have gone with the implementation of the Schengen Agreement. The former customs space is now used for small shops, such as a flower boutique, Albert Heijn, HEMA and some snack stores. ===Plans=== There are plans to reopen the line to Hasselt as a tramway.

In doubles, the quarter finals began with Mikhail Youzhny playing his second match of the day partnering Fabrice Santoro against Jeff Coetzee and Wesley Moodie for a place in the semi-finals. Youzhny and Santoro shocked the second seeds 7–5, 7–6 to book their semi-final place. About 15 minutes later, top seed and ten-times Grand Slam doubles finalists Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić (twice together) started their quarter-final match with Łukasz Kubot and Dmitry Tursunov, emerging victorious 7–5, 6–4. Third seeds Christopher Kas and Philipp Kohlschreiber were also knocked out of the tournament at the quarter-final stage, losing to Spanish wildcards Marc López and Rafael Nadal. Philipp Kohlschreiber had won the tournament last year with Czech David Škoch. *Seeded players out (singles): None *Seeded players out (doubles): Jeff Coetzee/Wesley Moodie, Christopher Kas/Philipp Kohlschreiber ===Day Four=== All quarter-final matches in the men's draw were completed on day four. Andy Roddick started off the action with his best performance of the week in a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Victor Hănescu. The second match of the day produced the biggest surprise of the event, as #5 seed Gaël Monfils routed world #1 Rafael Nadal 6-4 6-4, facing only one break point. He was followed by world #2 Roger Federer, who was heavily tested by Philipp Kohlschreiber, coming back from 5-1 and 6-3 in the tiebreak to win 6-2, 7-6, after having led the German 6-2 4-1. The day ended with world #4 and defending champion Andy Murray cruising to a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Sergiy Stakhovsky in a repeat of his victory over the Ukrainian in the US Open junior's final. Murray and Federer knew they would meet for the third tournament in a row. In the doubles, #1 team Daniel Nestor & Nenad Zimonjić advanced to the final with a 6-1, 6-7(8), 10-3 victory over James Cerretani & Victor Hănescu. Their opponents are Marc López & Rafael Nadal, who narrowly defeated Fabrice Santoro & Mikhail Youzhny 1-6, 7-6, 11-9. *Seeded players out (singles): Rafael Nadal, Philipp Kohlschreiber *Seeded players out (doubles): None ===Day Five=== The two singles semi-finals were played on day five. Gaël Monfils was unable to continue his hot streak from the previous day's play, losing to Andy Roddick 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, after serving for the first set. The second semifinal saw the very anticipated matchup between defending champ Andy Murray and #2 Roger Federer. The match didn't disappoint fans, seeing plenty of memorable points, with the Brit prevailing 6-7, 6-2, 6-2, even though Federer had 3 consecutive break points early in the second set and Murray received medical attention on his back in the third. The match ended with Federer smashing a low overhead into the net. It was the third consecutive official time that Murray prevailed, with Murray also winning an exhibition match last week; Murray extended his head to head lead to 5-2, and goes into his final with a 5-2 lead over Roddick. In the doubles final, the world #1 team of Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić faced singles world no. 1 Rafael Nadal and partner Marc López. Nestor and Zimonjić, the ATP World Tour Champions for 2008, were bidding for the seventh doubles title as a partnership. Nestor had previously won the title at Doha with Mark Knowles in 1996 and 2001. On the opposite side, Nadal and López were teaming up for the first time. Nadal had won four of his last seven doubles finals while López was appearing in his second ATP doubles final. In the final, López dropped his serve twice in the opening set but in the second, a single break sufficed for Nadal and López to level the match, from Nestor in the third game. In the deciding champions tiebreak (first to ten points), Zimonjić and Nestor led 6–5 but López and Nadal won 5 of the last seven points to seal a 4–6, 6–4, 10–8 victory. *Seeded players out (singles): Gaël Monfils, Roger Federer *Seeded players out (doubles): Daniel Nestor & Nenad Zimonjić ===Day Six=== The only match to take place on the final day of the tournament was the singles final. World no. 4 and third seeded Briton Andy Murray took on American Andy Roddick. Despite initial fears from Murray that he would be unfit to play after suffering from a back injury, he recovered enough to participate. The final started with four service holds before Murray broke Roddick in the fifth game for a 3–2 lead. This was followed by another in the seventh game and Murray sealed the set. In the second, Roddick just about held his opening service game but was broken in the third game of the set and then again two games later. Holding a 5–2 lead, Murray fell behind 0–30 on serve and had break point against him. However, he regained his composure and served out to win the match. In winning the tournament, Murray won his ninth career ATP title and defended the title he won in 2008. *Seeded players out (singles): Andy Roddick ==References *Official website *ATP – Tournament information *ITF – Tournament details Qatar Open Category:2009 in Qatari sport Category:Qatar Open (tennis) ","title":"2009 Qatar Open"},{"id":"20415734","text":"Barrel Race 2013 Competitive barrel rolling is both a team or individual sport which is practiced by bourbon distilleries in Kentucky. It is also referred to as a bourbon barrel relay. The world championship takes place at the Kentucky Bourbon Festival annually in Bardstown, Kentucky. ==Origins and History== The first bourbon barrel relay took place in 1991 at the Kentucky Bourbon Festival in Bardstown, Kentucky. The participants are all employees of one of the Kentucky bourbon whiskey distilleries. ==Playing Area== The playing area is a 40 foot by 28 foot rectangle, with rails on each edge for the barrels to roll upon. A simulated barrel rick with posts and cross beams is constructed on one of the long sides. The rick has a removable bar at one end which the first barrel will strike. A metal plate rests on each corner to aid in both turning the barrel around corners and spinning the barrel into position. ==Players== Only four people are allowed to touch barrels on the team. Coaches or set callers can communicate with the players, but can not participate in any physical aspect of the sport. ===Setter=== The setter takes the first barrel and rolls it to the rick. His job is to properly align the barrels such that after rolling down the final rail, the bungs of all the barrels are pointed straight up. ===Rick person=== The rick person takes the second barrel and delivers it to the setter. His job is to help the barrels roll down the final rail and to reposition any barrels that either impact the rick itself or fall off the rails. ===Corner=== The man in the corner takes the third barrel to the first corner and pushes the barrel to the ricker. He stays in this position and moves the remaining barrels between the two rails. ===Kicker=== The Kicker's job is to push all the remaining barrels to the corner man as quickly as possible. After all 10 barrels are delivered to the corner person they move to the rick and help the rick person move all barrels back and help with any post stuck or down barrels. ===Set Caller=== And additional person may be employed to call the sets to the ricker. He will tell the ricker to either spin the barrel or dribble it to get the arrow in the correct position. He can not touch a barrel himself. ===Safety=== The safety person stands next to the ricker and ensures that moving barrels do not hit the setter. ==Equipment== *Barrels: Ten 55 gallon wooden barrels are filled with water. The total weight of each is about 500 lbs. *Gloves: Gloves are recommended as the wood construction and metal bands around the barrels can easily cut the hands. *Shoes: Steel toed shoes are recommended. ==Gameplay== Time is started as soon as the first barrel is moved. Time stops when all barrels are in their final resting place on the rick. Barrels must be supported only by the rails, and not the ground between. 10 seconds are subtracted from the time for each barrel whose bung is facing straight up, within two bung diameters. With the time deduction taken into account, talented teams and individuals will often end with negative time. For the team event, only two barrels can be on the second rail. The remaining barrels can be started behind the corner or on the first rail. For the individual event, 9 barrels are placed in line with the rick, but behind the ricking position. The individual must push one barrel from the starting point around the track, set it and rick it. The remaining 9 just need to be set into position and rolled onto the rick. ==External links== *Competition article at 2Camels.com *Kentucky Bourbon Festival *Video of the competition Category:Racing Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Competitive barrel rolling"},{"id":"20415744","text":"To learn is the act of acquiring knowledge.

They lived primarily in and around modern-day Plymouth, Massachusetts. The Patuxet have been extinct since 1622. ==Devastation== The Patuxet were wiped out by a series of plagues that decimated the indigenous peoples of southeastern New England in the second decade of the 17th century. The epidemics which swept across New England and the Canadian Maritimes between 1614 and 1620 were especially devastating to the Wampanoag and neighboring Massachuset, with mortality reaching 100% in many mainland villages. When the Pilgrims landed in 1620, all the Patuxet except Squanto had died. The plagues have been attributed variously to smallpox, leptospirosis, and other diseases. ==The last Patuxet== Some European expedition captains were known to increase profits by capturing natives to sell as slaves. Such was the case when Thomas Hunt kidnapped several Wampanoag in 1614 in order to sell them later in Spain. One of Hunt's captives was a Patuxet named Tisquantum. Tisquantum eventually came to be known as Squanto (a nickname given to him by his friend William Bradford). After Squanto regained his freedom, he was able to work his way to England where he lived for several years, working with a shipbuilder. He signed on as an interpreter for a British expedition to Newfoundland. From there Squanto went back to his home, only to discover that, in his absence, epidemics had killed everyone in his village. Squanto succumbed to \\"Indian fever\\" in November 1622. ==The Pilgrims== The first settlers of Plymouth Colony (modern Plymouth, Massachusetts), sited their colony at the location of a former Patuxet village, named \\"Port St. Louis\\" (Samuel de Champlain, 1605) or \\"Accomack\\" (John Smith, 1614). By 1616, the site had been renamed New Plimoth in Smith's A Description of New England after a suggestion by Prince Charles of England. When the Pilgrim Settlers decided to make their settlement, the land that had been cleared and cultivated by the prior inhabitants (since dead through disease) was a primary reason for the location. Squanto was instrumental in the survival of the colony of English settlers at Plymouth. Samoset, a Pemaquid (Abenaki) sachem from Maine, introduced himself to the Pilgrims upon their arrival in 1620. Shortly thereafter, he introduced Squanto (presumably because Squanto spoke better English) to the Pilgrims, who had settled at the site of Squanto's former village. From that point onward, Squanto devoted himself to helping the Pilgrims. Whatever his motivations, with great kindness and patience, he taught the English the skills they needed to survive, including how best to cultivate varieties of the Three Sisters: beans, maize and squash. Although Samoset appears to have been important in establishing initial relations with the Pilgrims, Squanto was undoubtedly the main factor in the Pilgrims' survival. In addition, he also served as an intermediary between the Pilgrims and Massasoit, the Grand Sachem of the Wampanoag (original name Ousamequin or \\"Yellow Feather\\"). As such, he was instrumental in the friendship treaty that the two signed, allowing the settlers to occupy the area around the former Patuxet village. Massasoit honored this treaty until his death in 1661. ==Thanksgiving== In the fall of 1621, the Plymouth colonists and Wampanoag shared an autumn harvest feast. This three-day celebration involving the entire village and about 90 Wampanoag has been celebrated as a symbol of cooperation and interaction between English colonists and Native Americans. The event later inspired 19th century Americans to establish Thanksgiving as a national holiday in the United States. The harvest celebration took place at the historic site of the Patuxet villages. Squanto's involvement as an intermediary in negotiating the friendship treaty with Massasoit led to the joint feast between the Pilgrims and Wampanoag. This feast was a celebration of the first successful harvest season of the colonists. == See also == * List of Native American Tribal Entities ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * Moondancer and Strong Woman.

In February 1977, Lispector gave her only televised interview, with Júlio Lerner of TV Cultura in São Paulo. In it, she mentioned a book she had just completed with \\"thirteen names, thirteen titles\\", referencing the thirteen alternative titles on the title page of the novella.

Interview with Clarice Lispector, produced by TV Cultura, filmed in February 1977, first aired in December 1977.This interview is widely available on the Internet, from YouTube and other sources. ==Characters== # Rodrigo S.M.: the narrator, writer # Macabéa: regular girl from the Northeast that gets hit by a car # Olimpico: metal worker that puts metal rods on conveyor belts, dates Macabéa and cheats on her with Gloria # Gloria: works with Macabéa, dates Olimpico, suggests Macabea should go to fortune teller # Madame Carlota: Fortune teller Macabéa goes to preceding her death # Doctor: indifferent towards his patients, does not care about his job, money oriented # Guy in Mercedes: Murderer ==Background and publication== Clarice used her own childhood in the Northeast region of Brazil as reference to build the protagonist Macabéa. She also mentioned a gathering of people from this region in the São Cristóvão neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, where she first captured the \\"disoriented look\\" of the Northeasterns in the city. Clarice was also inspired by a fortune teller she visited, an event upon which she bases the final part of the plot. When she was leaving the fortune teller's house, she found it amusing to imagine herself being hit by a yellow Mercedes and dying immediately after hearing all the good projections the fortune teller foresaw for her future. The novel was composed from short fragments that Lispector and her secretary, Olga Borelli, pieced together. Lispector was not aware that she was dying at the time she wrote it, though the work is full of premonitions of her upcoming death. == Plot == The novel starts with the narrator, Rodrigo S.M., discussing what it means to write a story. He addresses the reader directly and spends a lot of time talking about his philosophical beliefs. After some time, he begins the story, which centers on Macabéa, an impoverished 19 year old living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She leads a difficult life, but seems to be oblivious to this fact. She starts dating a boy named Olímpico, who mistreats her and eventually leaves her for her coworker, Gloria. Feeling guilty, Gloria recommends that Macabéa visit a fortune teller named Madame Carlota. She predicts that Macabéa's life will soon turn around, saying that she will be rich, happy, and marry a foreigner named Hans. However, none of this comes true as Macabéa's life comes to an abrupt end when a yellow Mercedes runs her over. ==Style== While the narrator in The Hour of the Star reveals to the audience his wish to ensure the novel's simplicity (in terms of writing) and stray from philosophical tangents, in reality the story is marked by complicated existentialist notions of identity. The author often reflects on his conscious effort to do so: > \\"Like every writer, I am clearly tempted to use succulent terms: I have at > my command magnificent adjectives, robust nouns, and verbs so agile that > they glide through the atmosphere as they move into action. For surely words > are actions? Yet I have no intention of adorning the word, for were I to > touch the girl's bread, that bread would turn to gold—and the girl … would > be unable to bite into it, and consequently die of hunger.\\" As the novel unfolds, it becomes apparent that this quest for identity is as much about Macabéa's search for self as it is the narrator's own. Notions of being, who we are and who we aren't, and the struggle to finding meaning are all touched upon. ==Reception== Peter Bricklebank in his review for Library Journal described the novel as \\"both introspection and fiction\\" and that it was a \\"compassionate meditation with a fine afterward, this slim volume will attract lovers of philosophical fiction\\". Barbara Mujica in her review for Americas described the novel as \\"the last and perhaps greatest novel of the Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector\\" and that \\"The Hour of the Star is also a meditation on writing. Through Rodrigo, Lispector brings into question the notion of authorial supremacy. Rodrigo is not the omnipotent, invisible creator, but a thinker who doubts, vacillates, and questions his own work. In The Hour of the Star and other novels, Lispector throws into doubt the ability of fiction to capture the truth.\\" ==Notes== Category:1977 novels Category:Brazilian novels Category:Novels by Clarice Lispector Category:Portuguese-language novels Category:Brazilian novellas Category:Novels set in Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Brazilian novels adapted into films ","title":"The Hour of the Star"},{"id":"20416017","text":"Wolf Wilhelm Friedrich von Baudissin Wolf Wilhelm Friedrich Graf von Baudissin (26 September 1847 – 6 February 1926) was a German Protestant theologian who was a native of Sophienhof, near Kiel. Baudissin studied theology and Oriental studies at Berlin, Erlangen, Leipzig and Kiel, earning his doctorate in 1870 at Leipzig, where he worked as privatdocent from 1874 to 1876. In 1876 he was appointed associate professor of theology at the University of Strassburg, where four years later he gained a full professorship. In 1881 he became a professor of Old Testament exegesis at the University of Marburg, where he remained until 1900. From 1900 to 1921 he was a professor at the University of Berlin. He was rector of the university in 1912–1913. Theologian Franz Delitzsch (1813–1890) and Orientalist Heinrich Leberecht Fleischer (1801–1888) were major influences in his career. Baudissin was a prominent figure in the Religionsgeschichtliche Schule (School of Religious History). He is largely remembered for his work involving analysis of various ancient Semitic faiths in order to clarify the religious meaning of the Biblical Old Testament.

He was killed in action by Pakistani terrorists during 2008 Mumbai attacks. In 2009, he was posthumously given the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest peacetime gallantry decoration. Karkare succeeded K. P. Raghuvanshi as the Chief of ATS in January 2008 and was eventually succeeded by Raghuvanshi after he was shot dead on 26 November 2008. He was credited with solving the serial bombing cases in Thane, Vashi and Panvel, and led the investigation of the 2008 Malegaon blasts. ==Education and career== Karkare did his primary schooling from Chittranjan Das Municipal Primary School, Wardha and then received his middle school and high school education from New English High School, Wardha. He obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Mechanical Engineering from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur in 1975. After graduation he worked for the National Productivity Council of the Government of India and then Hindustan Lever Limited (now called Hindustan Unilever Ltd.), India's largest FMCG company.http://patientcare.lvpei.org/vision-rehabilitation/images/feb-2010.pdf He joined the Indian Police Service (IPS) as a member of the 1982 batch. Before becoming ATS Chief of Maharashtra State in January 2008, he was Joint Commissioner of Police (Administration) of Mumbai Police. He served seven years in Austria in the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India's external intelligence agency. According to former senior Mumbai Police officer Y.C. Pawar, Mr. Karkare was regarded as very influential officer in police circles. ==Malegaon investigation== On 8 September 2006, a series of bomb blasts took place in Malegaon, Maharashtra On 29 September 2008, three bombs exploded in Modasa, Gujarat and Malegaon, Maharashtra killing eight people, and injuring 80. Several unexploded bombs were found in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Hemant Karkare, as the chief of the state Anti-Terror Squad, led the investigation into the 2008 Malegaon blasts. In late October 2008, the ATS arrested eleven suspects, all Hindu, including a former ABVP student leader Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, Swami Amritananda alias Dayanand Pandey, a retired Major Ramesh Upadhyay and a serving Army officer Lt. Col. Prasad Shrikant Purohit. The meaning very clearly was, don’t get us favourable orders: Malegaon SPP Rohini Salian, The Indian Express, 13 October 2015. Most of the accused belonged to a Hindutva group called Abhinav Bharat with prior links to Sangh Parivar organisations. Karkare's ATS identified, for the first time, Hindutva organisations as being responsible for terrorism in India, and political commentators began to call it Hindutva terror or Saffron terror. Opposition parties, including the Bharatiya Janta Party and Shiv Sena, and Hindu organizations alleged that the arrests were made under the pressure of the incumbent radical government, in an attempt to appease India's Muslim population. These parties called him 'a traitor to the nation' for his investigation in this direction.Rajdeep Sardesai, Voting with our heads, Hindustan Times, 12 December 2008.Malegaon case: Was there a 'message from top' to Rohini Salian, asks Congress, Firstpost, 25 Jun 2015 Narendra Modi, then the Chief Minister of Gujarat, accused the ATS of undermining the military morale. Some BJP, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) leaders accused the ATS of being used as a tool to attack the Sangh Parivar and of using illegal detention and torture. Thakur was given a clean-chit in the chargesheet presented by NIA in 2016 to the court. And the court dropped charges of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) put by ATS following which she applied for a bail and the Court granted it.

Flowers at the spot of Karkare's death after Mumbai terror attacks. Karkare's wife receives the Ashok Chakra from president Pratibha Patil on 26 January 2009. Karkare, along with senior police officials Ashok Kamte and Vijay Salaskar, were killed outside the Cama Hospital after the LeT terrorists Kasab and his partner Ismail opened fire on their police van. At 9.45 p.m. on 26 November 2008, while having his dinner at his Dadar residence, he received a call about a terrorist attack at Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus (C.S.T.) station. He switched on the TV for news and left at once with his driver and bodyguards for C.S.T. There he donned a bullet-proof vest and helmet (shown on news channels live), and went to Platform No.1, but found it deserted. He was then informed that the terrorists had moved to the Cama and Albless Hospital (\\"Cama\\") next to the Azad Maidan police station. The operation was difficult as it was dark and the terrorists were well prepared and virtually on a fidayeen mission. The officers, with a few constables, went into Cama from the back. A couple of constables were left stationed at the back entrance of Cama, while the rest boarded a Qualis jeep. Senior Police Inspector Vijay Salaskar asked the driver of the Qualis to let him take over at the wheel. About that time, they heard on the wireless that the terrorists were hiding behind a red car. As they turned from the Crime Branch office towards Rang Bhavan looking for the red car, near the Corporation Bank ATM, they saw one of the terrorists running. Ashok Kamte, ACP of Mumbai East, or Salaskar – or both – fired, the bullet hitting the terrorist on his arm, his AK-47 fell down. He was Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive later. As they were thinking of getting down, a second terrorist, Ismail Khan appeared and fired a volley of bullets at them. All but one, Assistant Police Inspector Jadhav, died. Hemant Karkare, Ashok Kamte, Salaskar and others died in fighting the Mumbai attacks, on 27 November 2008 in a narrow lane between St. Xavier's College and Rang Bhavan, just a stone throw away from the Crime Branch office. Indian Express quotes statements by Constable Arun Jadhav, who was with the officers Hemant Karkare, Vijay Salaskar and Ashok Kamte when they died. The three officers and four constables had received information that Sadanand Date had been injured in the gunfire at the Cama and Albless Hospital for women and children. Located at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), a ten-minute drive from the hospital, they took a Toyota Qualis and proceeded in that direction. Salaskar was driving, Kamte in the passenger seat, Karkare in the second row, and the four constables, including Jadhav, were in the back row of seating. According to Jadhav, five minutes later, two terrorists stepped out from behind a tree and opened fire with AK-47 automatic rifles. The six policemen, other than Jadhav, were all killed quickly in the gunfire. Kamte was the sole officer who managed to retaliate, wounding terrorist Ajmal in the arm. The wounded Jadhav had no opportunity to render assistance. The two terrorists approached the vehicle, dumped the bodies of the three officers on the road and, leaving the constables for dead, proceeded to Metro Cinema. Upon arrival, they aimed three bursts of automatic fire at the police and press vehicles drawn up at that location, then drove off towards the government offices (Vidhan Bhawan) in South Mumbai. Here again they fired several times. While attempting to leave the area, one of the tires of the vehicle burst, so the terrorists departed to obtain another. At this point, Jadhav was able to contact headquarters. The bodies of the dead were recovered and taken to St George Hospital. However the statement that Kasab fired \\"inside the car\\" was rejected by the court. The crucial evidence in Karkare's death - the source of bullet fired into his body was absent. The bullets did not match with few of the terrorist's recovered guns which made it impossible to decide who amongst the terrorists killed Hemant Karkare. In an investigation, Headline Today, an Indian news agency, found that a substandard bulletproof jacket had been issued to Mr. Karkare. Though, according to the post mortem report, the quality of the vest was not a factor in his death as bullets did not pierce the vest. Concerns in the media about the quality of the vest continue because the vest itself was, according to Indian authorities, misplaced in the hospital. In 2018, the Bombay High Court discarded a pending petition that had claimed that Karkare was not gunned down by terrorists Ajmal Kasab and Abu Ismail. His wife Kavita Karkare, suffered a massive brain haemorrhage on 27 September 2014 and soon slipped into coma. Thereafter she died on 29 September 2014, at age of 57. She lived in Hindu colony, Dadar, and was a professor at the NSS B.Ed college, Tardeo, but left work a few months ago and was suffering from hypertension. The Karkares are survived by their two daughters and a son. ==See also== * Sandeep Unnikrishnan * Havaldar Gajendra Singh * Rakesh Maria * Vijay Salaskar * Ashok Kamte * Sadanand Date ==References== Category:1954 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in India Category:Male murder victims Category:Murdered Indian police officers Category:Terrorism victims in India Category:Police officers from Mumbai Category:Indian police officers killed in the line of duty Category:Victims of the 2008 Mumbai attacks Category:People from Nagpur Category:Recipients of the Ashoka Chakra (military decoration) Category:Marathi people Category:Indian Police Service officers Category:State funerals in India Category:Ashoka Chakra ","title":"Hemant Karkare"},{"id":"20416040","text":"Adolf Holzhaus (1892–6 June 1982) was an Esperantist and historian of the Esperanto movement.

He was an interlinguistics lecturer at the Humboldt University of Berlin. He was one of Germany's most active Esperanto philologists and was from 1991 to 2016 both the chair of the Gesellschaft für Interlinguistik (\\"Interlinguistics Society\\") and the editor of its newsletter, Interlinguistische Informationen. He and his wife, Wera Blanke, were especially interested in the evolution of language, particularly in the development of terminology for the constructed language, Esperanto, and questions of sociolinguistics. Blanke made a study of Eugen Wüster's work toward common international terminology and international standardization. ==Academic career== After completing his initial university studies he worked as a teacher of German and geography. He earned a doctorate from Humboldt University of Berlin in 1976 with his dissertation on comparative word construction of Esperanto and German. In 1985 he earned a second doctorate from Humboldt on constructed languages. (In the former East Germany such a second degree was known as \\"dissertation B\\", corresponding to the highest academic qualification of \\"habilitation\\" awarded to full professors in many European countries.) In 1988 the university appointed him \\"Honorary Lecturer of Interlinguistics.\\" ==Esperanto activities== Having first taught himself Esperanto in 1957, he later became secretary (1968 through 1990) of the Centra Laborrondo de Esperanto-Amikoj (\\"Central Working Circle of Friends of Esperanto\\"), a government-sanctioned affiliate of East Germany's Cultural Association (Deutsche Kulturbund). After 1981 the group became a part of the newly founded German Democratic Republic Esperanto Association (Esperanto-Asocio de GDR, GDREA). From 1970 to 1990 Prof. Blanke was also editor of the newsletter of those organizations, Der Esperantist.

It was his 31st studio album. == Background == Cliff Richard had seen a dip in popularity in the early 1970s until his 1976 album I'm Nearly Famous gave him major success. This comeback kept Richard regularly in the charts until the mid-1980s. Of the albums released during this period, only the 1978 Small Corners gospel album and Green Light failed to make the top 10. The latter, with full commercial expectations proved to be a particular disappointment, only reaching No.25 in the album charts and failing to provide any high charting singles. The lead single, \\"Please Remember Me\\" failed to chart at all, as did the follow-up, \\"Can't Take the Hurt Anymore\\". This left Richard without a hit single in 1978, only the second year since 1958 that this had happened. A third and final release, the title track \\"Green Light\\" finally gave him a chart entry in early 1979, but only managed to creep up to No.57. Despite the album's lack of commercial success, Green Light was well received by critics. Allmusic stating that this was \\"Richard at his most commercial and appealing and deserved to be more widely heard - particularly in the US\\".[ Allmusic.com - Album review] Probably the most well-known song on the album however was \\"Count Me Out\\", which was later released as the B-side to Richard's 1979 single \\"We Don't Talk Anymore\\", which was the song that got his revival back on track by becoming the biggest selling single of his career.Cliff Richard songs.com - \\"Count Me Out\\" Another ballad, the striking \\"Never Even Thought\\" with intense lyrics and heavy orchestration building to a dramatic crescendo, was first released by Murray Head in 1975 on his album Say It Ain't So and also covered by Colin Blunstone in 1978. Richard later remixed his original version of the track and added new instrumentation for his remix album My Kinda Life in 1992. Since his 1977 Every Face Tells a Story album, Richard had released two other albums - a Christian music album, Small Corners and a compilation album 40 Golden Greats, which had reached No.1 in November 1977. Soon after this, he also released a live album, Thank You Very Much, which celebrated 20 years of Cliff Richard and The Shadows in the music business. The title track was covered in 1979 by Yvonne Elliman on her album Yvonne.

Strengths of the over 20,000-object permanent collection (including the approx. 3,300-object Adkins Collection and the more than 4,000-object James T. Bialac Native American Art Collection) are French Impressionism, 20th-century American painting and sculpture, traditional and contemporary Native American art, art of the Southwest, ceramics, photography, contemporary art, Asian art and graphics from the 16th century to the present. The museum has become well known in art circles for its fine art collections, including paintings, sculptures, works on paper, and photographs. The museum offers free admission. ==History== The Oklahoma University Museum of Art, the forerunner of the Fred Jones Jr. Museum was founded in 1936 by OU art professor Oscar Jacobson, who became the museum's first director and served in that post until his retirement in 1950. The collection continued to grow, and in 1971, a building just for the large collection was built, and it was officially established as the Fred Jones Jr. Memorial Art Center. In 1992 it was renamed the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art. When current OU president David Boren arrived at OU in 1994, he and his wife Molly Shi Boren began a campaign to expand the museum's collections, which has resulted in many of the museums most valuable acquisitions. 2000 was a watershed year in the development of the FJJMA's collections, with the gift of the Weitzenhoffer Collection of French Impressionism. In 2003, it became apparent that the original facilities could not properly display enough of the museum's rapidly growing collection. Construction began on a $14 million new wing to the museum, which, when completed two years later, doubled the museum's size. Designed by Washington, D.C.-based architect Hugh Jacobsen, its signature \\"hut-like\\" design has made it one of the most recognizable buildings on campus. In 2005 the museum opened the new addition, named in honor of Mary and Howard Lester of San Francisco. In 2007, the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art and the Philbrook Museum of Art were named stewards of the Eugene B. Adkins Collection. To properly display OU’s portion of the Adkins Collection, the University began construction in 2009 on a new level above the original museum structure. Opened in October 2011, the Stuart Wing provides a new 18,000-square-foot expansion of the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art to house the museum’s many collections acquired within the past 15 years. Designed by noted architect Rand Elliott, the new addition is named the Stuart Wing to honor a $3 million lead gift from the Stuart Family Foundation made possible by the generosity of OU Regent Jon R. Stuart and his wife, Dee Dee, a member of the art museum’s board of visitors. Construction includes renovations to the original 1971 building and the addition of the Eugene B. Adkins Gallery, a new photography gallery and new administrative offices. In all, the new Stuart Wing, with renovations, includes of exhibition space. Combining that with the 2005 Lester Wing’s , the total museum exhibition space, is approximately . Ghislain d'Humières served as the Wylodean and Bill Saxon Director of the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art from 2007 to 2013. Emily Ballew Neff was appointed Wylodean and Bill Saxon Director and Chief Curator 2013-14. In 2015, Mark White was named the Wylodean and Bill Saxon Director and Eugene B. Adkins Curator. ==Collections== The main collections are: *The Weitzenhoffer Collection, a collection of paintings by various Impressionists, including Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Mary Cassatt, Vincent van Gogh, Camille Pissarro, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Valued at over $50 million, it is considered the most important collection of Impressionist art ever donated to a university. *The Fleischaker Collection, a large collection of more than 350 pieces of Native American and southwestern paintings, sculpture and ceramics, including some of the most famous works by Russian Taos painters Leon Gaspard and Nicolai Fechin.http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/sooner/articles/p9-15_1997v17n3_OCR.pdf *The McGhee Collection, which features dozens of Eastern Orthodox icons dating back to the 15th century. *The Thams Collection, containing 32 paintings by members of the Taos Society of Artists. Together with the Taos paintings in the Fleischaker Collection, this gift give OU one of the world's leading collections of Taos art. *The State Department Collection was purchased by the museum in 1948 from the controversial Advancing American Art collection. Hailed as a \\"cultural Marshall Plan,\\" this traveling exhibit was created by the Department's Office of International Information and Cultural Affairs to demonstrate to the world America's cultural diversity and cosmopolitanism in the mid 20th century. Critics accused the exhibition of portraying an unflattering image of American life and found leftist sentiment in many of the paintings. The exhibition was dismantled by congress in 1947, after only two years, and sold to various institutions. Highlights of the collection include works by Georgia O'Keeffe and Edward Hopper. *The Eugene B. Adkins Collection - The Adkins Foundation Board announced in 2007 that the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art and the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa had been jointly selected to receive the Eugene B. Adkins Collection. The joint partnership by OU and the Philbrook was among many proposals submitted by leading museums across the country. The Adkins Collection, which is valued at approximately $50 million, features nearly 3,300 objects, including more that 400 paintings by American artists. The collection also includes impressive examples of Native American paintings, pottery and jewelry. *The James T. Bialac Native American Art Collection, a multimillion-dollar collection of more than 4,000 works representing indigenous cultures across North America, especially the Pueblos of the Southwest, the Navajo, the Hopi, many of the tribes of the Northern and Southern Plains and the Southeastern tribes. Bialac gave his private collection to the University of Oklahoma in 2010. Included in the collection are approximately 2,600 paintings and works on paper, over 1,000 kachinas and approximately 400 works of varying media, including ceramics and jewelry, representing many major Native artist such as Fred Kabotie, Awa Tsireh, Fritz Scholder, Joe Herrera, Allan Houser, Jerome Tiger, Tonita Pena, Helen Hardin, Pablita Velarde, George Morrison, Richard “Dick” West, Patrick DesJarlait and Pop Chalee. Special exhibitions are held every few months to showcase works in the museum's permanent collection, traveling exhibitions and more. ==Gallery== File:Norman, OK - Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art - University of Oklahoma and \\"Sphinx\\", a monumental sculpture by Colombian artist Fernando Botero - panoramio.jpgFred Jones Jr. Museum of Art - University of Oklahoma and \\"Sphinx\\", a monumental sculpture by Colombian artist Fernando Botero.

The Hodag Country Festival, founded in 1978, is an outdoor music festival held each summer in Rhinelander, in Oneida County, Wisconsin, United States. The 2021 festival is scheduled for 08–11 July 2021. When the first festival was held August 4–6, 1978, it featured Freddy Fender and Jana Jae and had an attendance of about 500. It is named for the folkloric Hodag, first reported to exist in 1893 in Rhinelander. The \\"Hodag\\" was founded by Bernie and Diane Eckert, Ernie Feight, and Ted Tschannen. Tschannen left after about two years, while Feight was part of the festival until 1994, when he sold his shares to the four Eckert children and the festival became an Eckert family business. After Bernie and Diane Eckert's deaths in 2002 and 2008, their children have operated the festival. Held the second weekend in July, the festival has an estimated attendance of 30,000-50,000 each year. The Hodag Country Festival Campgrounds will often have space available for 9 day ticket holders. 9 day tickets, 2 day tickets and 1 day tickets can be purchased by phone, online, and at established ticket outlets in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In conjunction with the Hodag Country Festival, country music radio stations around the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan sponsor regional country band contests.

Wayne was also a Confederate adjutant and inspector-general for Georgia and a brigadier general during the American Civil War. ==Early life and career== Henry Wayne was the son of U.S. Supreme Court Justice James Moore Wayne. He graduated from West Point in 1838 and joined the artillery as a second lieutenant. Later in that year Wayne participated in the Aroostook War over the boundary of Maine. In 1841, he became the assistant instructor of artillery and cavalry at West Point .Thomas Cushing's Memorials of the Class of 1834 of Harvard College: Prepared for the Fiftieth Anniversary of Their Graduation (1884) pgs. 108-09 Henry became a first lieutenant in 1842.Ezra J. Warner's Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders (1959) pg. 329 From 1843 to 1846 he was the first military member to serve as Master of the Sword at the academy. When the United States declared war on Mexico, Wayne joined the troops to fight. He was brevetted a major for his bravery at the Battles of Contreras and Churubusco. ==U.S. Camel Corps== After the Mexican-American War, Henry Wayne befriended George H. Crosman. Crossman brought up his idea of using camels for transportation of people and supplies in the newly conquered American Southwest.John Walker Guss's Savannah's Laurel Grove Cemetery (2004) pg. 58 Wayne relayed this idea to Senator Jefferson Davis; and when Davis became Secretary of War on 1853, he urged Congress to pass a bill to experiment with the camels. Wayne was chosen to lead an expedition to the Middle East to purchase $30,000 worth of camels.Byron Farwell's The Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-century Land Warfare: An Illustrated World View (2001) pg. 154 The group sailed to London on the USS Supply to examine camels in zoos. They then journeyed to Italy and met Grand Duke Leopold II to see his 250 camels that were said to be able to do the work of 1000 horses. They then purchased thirty-three camels: three in Tunisia, nine in Egypt, and twenty-one in Turkey. When the group arrived back, they experimented with the animals in the deserts of the western United States. Forty-one more camels would arrive later to join the corps. Congress, on the request of the Department of War, proposed a bill to buy 1,000 more camels, but the start of the Civil War quickly ended the debate . The experiments were also ended with the start of the Civil War, and the remaining camels were either sold or released into the wild. ==Civil War service== Wayne resigned his commission after receiving the results of Abraham Lincoln's victory in the presidential election. He joined the Confederate Army and was appointed the adjutant and inspector-general of Georgia by Governor Joseph E. Brown, where he was responsible for putting the army of Georgia into order in companies, regiments, and brigades. He also commanded Georgia's Quartermaster General, Ira Roe Foster, to immediately provide supplies for the troops, instructing Foster to \\"proceed personally, or by duly accredited agents, into all parts of the state, and buy 25,000 suits of clothes and 25,000 pairs of shoes3rd Georgia equipment - Picture of Brogans (shoes) for the destitute Ga. troops in the Confederate service.\\" On December 16, 1861, Wayne was commissioned a brigadier general. Through his orders, the men of Georgia guarded the crossings of Chattahoochee River. After being ordered to Manassas, Virginia, Wayne resigned his commission as a brigadier general and he instead just stuck to his duties as adjutant and inspector- general until the end of the war. Although, he did briefly see action during the Savannah Campaign (Sherman's March to the Sea). He commanded Confederate troops at the Battle of Ball's Ferry November 23–26, 1864. In this action, he was unsuccessful in stopping Union forces from crossing the Oconee River in Wilkinson County, GA. ==Awards and books== Wayne received the First Class Gold Medal of Mammal Division by the Société impériale zoologique d'acclimatation of France in 1858 for his introduction of the camel into the United States.Thomas William Herringshaw's Herringshaw's National Library of American Biography (1914) pg. 620 In 1856 he wrote The Sword Exercise, arranged for Military Instruction.John Fiske's Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography (1889) pg. 400 ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Confederate) *Ira Roe Foster ==NotesReferences== * Cushing, Thomas.

He has contributed to several journals, periodicals and newspapers ranging on many topics. His organization which is a branch of his journalistic interests, actively attempts to bridge several sectors of Judaism together. == Biography == Graeber, born in 1948, is the second child born to Holocaust survivors. He wrote about his experience as the child of survivors in an essay published in Louis Finkelstein Quarterly (Fall 1978). He describes the sensitivity that he fostered for all victims of oppression under governmental abuses of power. In 1974 he was awarded a PhD from Dropsie College in Jewish history for his study on the ability of building a historical narrative of the Jewish people based on questions posed to Jewish law deciders from the 12th century to today. A main focus of his thesis was on the responsa of Rabad of Posquières, later to be the subject of a book by Isadore Twersky of Harvard. He also received a B.Th from Derech Ayson Seminary. From 1999 through 2003 he served as director of The Tri-State Jewish Community Council. He was also on the directors board of the Bal Teshuva Halfway House of New York, and is currently the president of The Jewish Scholarship Society. Graeber has never retained any formal teaching positions, although he was listed as holder of the Akiba and Sara Gurtner Chair of Jewish Studies at Touro College for the scholastic year of 1992. His absence was due to his contracting an obscure psychological disorder, Capgras syndrome. He regularly submits papers to various Jewish and secular journals for publication. After a trip to Israel in 1997 he authored an essay on the need for the inclusion of Yiddishist principles into the fabric of Orthodox Jewish life. He wrote: :Only through the acceptance of Yiddishism will Judaism finally after its 2,000 year exile reach the apex of its purpose...The opposition to Yiddishism historically was primerally from the extreme right wing of the religion. The modern Jewish community should not fear integration\\". The article was highly controversial and much debate ensued. The debate within the Jewish community led Graeber to found the Jewish Scholarship Society. == The JSS == The Jewish Scholarship Society, also known as (in Yiddish) Der Yiddisher Gelerntkeit Gelzelshaft, according to its mission statement is to \\"mesh together Yiddishist principles with an active Jewish lifestyle\\". The organizations headquarters in Lawrence, New York houses a vast library. The libraries holdings include several antique items of significant historical importance as well as books ranging on topics from the Social Sciences to biographies on notable Jewish personalities. It was founded in 1997 in New York. Its member base now exceeds 4,500, with members from several different countries and backgrounds. All prospective members must provide proof of their Orthodoxy with their application. == Scholarship == Graeber, as freelance journalist and scholar, has written on many topics, mainly within the scope of Jewish studies. He has been published in most Jewish newspapers, as well as on several on-line news sources. He has also been published in secular journals. Subjects of his writing have included graphology, rabbinical history, dangerous animals and several works of fiction. His most recent essay, \\"Eybeschutz–Emden Controversy Alive And Well\\", appeared this past March. Several notable essays include: \\"The Spanish Cholov Yisroel Controversy of 1763 and its effects on the Jews of Barcelona\\", \\"Slobodka Yeshiva: Myth or Musser\\", \\"How Hungarian Jews have ruined American Judaism: A Complete History\\" and \\"West Side vs. East Side: Two communities. One park\\". His article \\"How Hungarian Jews have ruined American Judaism: A Complete History\\" won the Rabbi Solomon Schechter Literary Award, and was published in March 1983 in \\"Rabbi Louis Finkelstein Quarterly\\". Other awards include the annually awarded Chazon Ish Grant for his contribution to the study of the prohibitions involved in Amirah L'Otzmoi.

It is nearly identical to steroid induced acne from the standpoint of etiology.http://dermnetnz.org/acne/steroid-rosacea.html Topical Steroid induced rosacea (left); after steroid withdrawal and photobiomodulation therapy (right). ==Cause== Steroid-induced rosacea can be caused by the prolonged used of a topical steroid on the face. Topical steroid comes in 7 different strengths (Some countries use 4 categories). Class I is super potent, and class VII is very weak. Usually, any categories of steroids over class VI can induce rosacea with prolonged use. The typical presentation is inflammatory acne lesions consisting of pustules, papules, and cysts. The patient often admits to the daily use of a topical steroid, often being under the advisement of a physician. Examination of the pustules often revealed inflammatory cells, and in many cases, numerous motile demodex mites. == Prevention == Physicians need to be aware of the danger of topical steroids. Only mild steroids should be applied to the face. The use of the topical steroid should be limited to the condition. Alternate week therapy or 3 consecutive days a week therapy is better than continuous therapy in preventing steroid-induced rosacea. Only the mildest topical steroid should be used on the face if a condition warrants such use. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) does not necessary prevent steroid induced rosacea. Similar conditions have been seen with both Elidel and Protopic, possibly from immunosuppression and Demodex or bacterial growth. ==Treatment== Treatment often involves the gradual weaning off the topical steroid, and the use of a systemic anti-inflammatory antibiotic. If the patient is using a strong topical steroid, he or she is weaned to a weaker class VI or VII steroid. Usually, they are to use the substitute steroid daily, then only on weekends, then stop completely. The facial dermatitis and discomfort often worsen when they stop the offending steroid. The oral antibiotic will decrease the inflammatory nature of the lesions. The antibiotic of choice is usually a tetracycline antibiotic. Additionally, tacrolimus combined with oral antibiotics has proven to speed up the recovery process.http://dermnetnz.org/acne/steroid-rosacea.html == See also == * Rosacea * List of cutaneous conditions == References  * Steroid Rosacea Category:Acneiform eruptions ","title":"Steroid rosacea"},{"id":"20416484","text":"Vilma Sindona Eichholz (1926 - July 15, 1995) was a German-born Canadian Esperantist, teacher, and vice president of the Canadian Esperanto Association.

Spry Woodhall made his League debut on 8 September 1888, as a forward for West Bromwich Albion in a 2–0 win against Stoke at the Victoria Ground. He also scored the second goal in the match. He played ten of the \\"Throstles\\" 22 Football League matches and scored three goals in season 1888-89 and was part of a forward-line that scored three goals or more in a League match on one occasion.

He could centre with great accuracy and combined well in team work, especially with Billy Bassett as his partner. Woodhall represented England twice, making his debut against Wales on 4 February 1888, when he scored the third goal in a 5–1 victory. Woodhall's goal was England's 100th international goal. He also played in the next match against Scotland which was won 5–0; the following month, England defeated Ireland 5–1 (although Woodhall was not selected, his place on the right wing going to his West Bromwich team-mate Billy Bassett) to claim the 1888 British Home Championship convincingly. ==Honours== ;West Bromwich Albion *FA Cup winners: 1888 *FA Cup runners-up: 1886, 1887 ==References * Category:1863 births Category:1924 deaths Category:Sportspeople from West Bromwich Category:Association football forwards Category:English footballers Category:England international footballers Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. players Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Worcester City F.C. players Category:Oldbury Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players ","title":"George Woodhall"},{"id":"20416553","text":"Martin Haase, December 2009.

After a long struggle to finance its construction, it was completed in 1893. It derived most of its freight revenue from logging and to a certain extent from anthracite coal traffic. It also carried many passengers to mountain resorts in Sullivan County, Pennsylvania. With the decline of the logging industry and increased accessibility of the region by automobile in the 1910s and 1920s, the railroad's business rapidly declined. The economic blow of the Great Depression proved insurmountable, and it was abandoned as unprofitable in 1937. ==Muncy Creek Railway== The railroad was originally chartered as the Muncy Creek Railway on May 21, 1864. It was intended to provide a railroad outlet for Laporte, the newly established county seat of Sullivan County, via the valley of Muncy Creek. Some surveying, and possibly even grading, was done, but the new corporation ran out of money around 1867 and remained quiescent for several years. Interest in the railroad did not resume until 1871, when the Catawissa Railroad, later part of the Reading system, completed its line up the east bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River, passing through Muncy and Halls. Muncy, near the mouth of Muncy Creek, was an established town and would have been the logical terminus of the railroad. However, residents of Muncy feared the railroad would compete with an existing plank road to Hughesville and refused it permission to enter the town. Accordingly, the railroad was built from Halls to Hughesville in 1872, but money for further work was again lacking. The railroad was extended to Picture Rocks in 1875 using wooden rails to save money. However, the wooden rails could not withstand the weight of trains and the extension was abandoned in early 1876. The Muncy Creek Railway continued to struggle along until 1881, when the bondholders petitioned to have it placed in receivership. It was foreclosed on August 9, 1882, and reorganized on September 1, 1882 as the Williamsport and North Branch Railroad. ==Completion== The new owners still intended to extend the railroad towards Laporte and the coalfield at Bernice, but this could only be accomplished in slow stages. The track from Halls to Hughesville was rebuilt to make up for the deferred maintenance of previous years, and in late 1883, construction north and east began again. The new line followed a different route from the unsuccessful wooden-railed extension, following the west side of Muncy Creek through Tivoli up to Glen Mawr, which was reached in 1884. There was a picnic grove at Tivoli which was the destination of summer excursions, and a stage connection to the resort of Eagles Mere, then called Lewis Lake. Extension of the line continued. At Glen Mawr, the railroad crossed Muncy Creek and followed its east bank up to Sonestown, which it reached in 1885, and Nordmont, where it ended in October 1886. Here the railroad's expansion ceased again, but the sawmills and tanneries of the Muncy Valley provided the revenue to keep it solvent. In the late 1880s, the Pennsylvania Railroad took an interest in the W&NB; as a means of reaching the Bernice coalfields. The State Line and Sullivan Railroad, a subsidiary of the Lehigh Valley, had already reached the area, and the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad, backed by the Reading interest, had been chartered in 1883 to reach Bernice from the south via Fishing Creek. The PRR backed a new syndicate which took over the W&NB; in 1888, and named George Sanderson president. However, the PRR's interest in the W&NB; quickly waned, especially after the Bloomsburg & Sullivan's construction halted in Jamison City, never to reach Bernice. The failure of Sanderson's bank in 1891 resulted in the transfer of his investment in the W&NB; to his creditors, including John Satterfield; Satterfield now became vice-president and Henry C. McCormick president of the railroad. Satterfield was determined to complete the railroad, and after raising money and surveying, construction began in 1892. At Nordmont, the railroad crossed Muncy Creek on a horseshoe curve and began climbing up the other side of the valley, then turning up Deep Hollow and crossing over into the Loyalsock Creek watershed. The new line passed Lake Mokoma and Laporte and descended high on the east side of the Mill Creek valley, turning and descending along the Loyalsock to Ringdale. The line from Ringdale to the summit between Loyalsock and Muncy creeks was built on a 1% grade to facilitate handling heavy coal trains from Bernice. At Ringdale, the line crossed the Loyalsock on a high trestle, long, and ran up Birch Creek. The line forked at Birch Creek Junction, with one branch going up a tributary of Birch Creek to a junction with the State Line & Sullivan at Dohm's Summit, while another followed Birch Creek to join the State Line and Sullivan at Bernice. John Satterfield, vice-president of the W&NB; The line was completed into Laporte in August 1893, and to Dohm's Summit in September. The latter was renamed Satterfield in honor of the promoter who had completed the W&NB.; Construction of a depot at Satterfield began in October, but a dispute with the Lehigh Valley over property ownership resulted in its demolition, and it was relocated in November. The W&NB; did obtain trackage rights over the State Line & Sullivan to Towanda for its passenger trains. The branch to Bernice was finished in 1894. ==Business of the railroad== The finished W&NB; enjoyed considerable business, both passenger and freight. Along the southern portion of the line, three furniture factories operated in the lower Muncy Valley. Above Picture Rocks was the Lyon sawmill, the largest sawmill on Muncy Creek. Logs were floated down the creek to the mill, and it shipped finished lumber over the railroad. Smaller sawmills were common along the line north of Picture Rocks. Tanneries at Muncy Valley and Laporte came under the control of the Union Tanning Company (a subsidiary of the United States Leather Company) in 1893, using hemlock bark supplied by logging. In the late 1890s, a chemical company was built at Nordmont which made charcoal, acetic acid, and wood alcohol from wood. Attempts to develop Lake Mokoma for ice harvesting were largely unsuccessful. Finally, anthracite coal mined around Bernice supplied some of the railroad's freight traffic. Passenger service was also important to the railroad's revenue. Several hotels around Highland Lake were connected by stage to the railroad's station at Chamouni (later renamed Essick and Tivoli). The opening of the narrow gauge Eagles Mere Railroad on July 1, 1892 provided additional passenger traffic. The narrow gauge interchanged with the W&NB; at Sonestown, providing passenger service to the many hotels at the resort of Eagles Mere. ==Prosperity== The station at Sonestown. The W&NB; once served a clothespin factory and a stave mill here. Extension to the coal fields did not result in immediate prosperity. Despite an increase in traffic, the additional cost of extending the railroad resulted in interest charges that dragged the railroad down. McCormick resigned as president in 1896, and an economic downturn in 1897 brought the railroad into insolvency. The owners decided to sell out to a group of New York financiers and local businesspeople, and B. Harvey Welch, a native of Hughesville, became president. This transaction eliminated the bond interest and put the railroad back on a reasonably sound financial footing. After 1900, a lime-burning business began to develop on the south end of the line, using local limestone deposits and coal shipped south from Bernice. In 1901, the Eagles Mere Railroad was leased to the W&NB; for $5,000 a year. This proved to be a fortunate decision, for in that same year, Union Tanning decided to log large tracts of forest to the north and west of the line. Charles W. Sones contracted to do the logging, and built a sawmill at Kettle Creek, and a logging railroad to connect it with Eagles Mere. The lumber was shipped down the Eagles Mere Railroad to Sonestown and then over the W&NB; a narrow gauge rail was laid from Sonestown to Muncy Valley to allow Eagles Mere trains to haul bark directly to the tannery there. About this time, the Northern Anthracite Company built its Murray coal breaker two miles west of Bernice. The W&NB; was given exclusive rights to serve it, operating via trackage rights over the Lehigh Valley to a new spur to the mine. At high, the breaker was the tallest structure in central Pennsylvania. When the Coal Strike of 1902 paralyzed many of the mines on the Reading, Northern Anthracite experienced a boom in business, and for a short while, the W&NB; was shipping a thousand tons of coal per day to Halls for interchange with the Reading. The rosy prospects of coal traffic proved illusory, however. After the strike ended, coal traffic rapidly fell off. A further blow occurred in 1906, when Sones' logging railroad (incorporated in 1904 as the Susquehanna and Eagles Mere Railroad) was extended to Masten and a connection with the Susquehanna and New York Railroad, owned by Union Tanning. The Laporte tannery closed about this time, and Sones' lumber traffic was diverted to move through Masten rather than Sonestown. The closing of the Muncy Valley Tannery in 1908 effectively removed Union Tanning's traffic from the railroad. However, wood products traffic was still generated at Nordmont. Sutton Peck Chemical had built a standard gauge logging railroad up Cherry Run and down Painter Run in 1900. Sutton Peck became Nordmont Chemical in 1904, and in 1908, it removed the Cherry Run-Painter Run line. A new line was incorporated by the chemical company as the Wyoming and Sullivan Railroad, and built several miles up Muncy Creek to continue supplying wood to Nordmont Chemical. ==Decline and abandonment== The W&NB;'s most profitable year was in 1906, when it netted $15,000. Thereafter, it fluctuated between surplus and deficit until 1912, the last year it showed a profit. Most local industries, such as logging, tanning and agriculture, declined through the 1910s, with only coal shipments remaining dependable. The only significant industrial development was the opening of the Big Run Manufacturing Company's stave mill at Sonestown in 1914. Big Run Manufacturing was a project of local loggers, including Col. R. Bruce Ricketts. The company laid a standard gauge rail a short distance on the Eagles Mere Railroad, and then turned up Big Run to collect timber. This line was removed around 1917 or 1918, and a new line was laid on part of the old Nordmont Chemical grade from Nordmont up Cherry Run. Logging trains originating on this line operated over the W&NB; from Nordmont to Sonestown until 1922, when the stave mill was closed and its logging line abandoned. The W&NB; went into receivership in 1917 due to its inability to pay off its bonded interest, and the lease of the Eagles Mere Railroad was canceled in 1920. The W&NB; was reorganized as the Williamsport and North Branch Railway on May 1, 1921. In addition to the closing of the Sonestown stave mill, Nordmont Chemical sold out to Charles Sones in 1924. He closed the factory, replaced it with a sawmill, and continued to haul logs on the Wyoming & Sullivan until 1930. With local traffic falling off, the W&NB; depended on the small amount of bridge traffic allotted it by the ICC to help sustain it. It was only allowed freight traveling over the Grand Trunk Railway and the Lehigh Valley which was destined for the Reading. In practice, this amounted largely to automobiles and grain. Pennsdale, one of three remaining stations from the railroad. It was the Great Depression that ultimately finished off the Williamsport and North Branch. The Eagles Mere Railroad had been abandoned in 1926 after flood damage, but it no longer supplied any significant traffic for the W&NB.; After 1930, the logging and wood products industry had essentially shut down, leaving only the coal mines as regular generators of freight traffic north of Picture Rocks. The furniture factories lower in the valley also suffered during the Depression. During the 1930s, the railroad just scraped along, able to pay its operating expenses but unable to maintain track or equipment. By 1937, it was in so decrepit a state that the owners decided to abandon it. The last train ran on October 11, 1937, and tracks were removed by summer 1938. Little remains of the railroad, although the Pennsdale and Sonestown stations are now private residences, the Nordmont station stands vacant, and part of the grade has been incorporated into the Loyalsock Trail. ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== *Map of the Williamsport and North Branch Railroad Category:Defunct Pennsylvania railroads Category:Transportation in Sullivan County, Pennsylvania Category:Railway companies established in 1882 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1921 ","title":"Williamsport and North Branch Railroad"},{"id":"20416716","text":"Magomet Izmaylovich Isayev (; 1928 – June 20, 2011) was a Russian Esperantist, translator, and linguist.

They are one of the first black metal bands from the United States (alongside Von formed in 1987), and are among the top American black metal bands to have emerged early during the second wave of black metal. Under the direction of Paul Ledney they have placed profound emphasis on blasphemous themes. == History  Initial formation (1990–1992) === After the founding members of death metal band Incantation split ways due to artistic differences, Paul Ledney, Aragon Amori, and Brett Makowski adopted the name Profanatica while John McEntee continued as Incantation. In an interview, it was implied that Ledney did not recognise the legitimacy of Incantation under McEntee, and he claimed that it was he, Amori, and Makowski who originally proposed the name. He has also claimed that McEntee was reluctant to pursue their interests in black metal, corpse paint, and blasphemous themes. However, both parties have remained on good terms, and have often collaborated. In the summer of 1990, they released their first demo Putrescence Of..., followed by Broken Throne of Christ in December. Brett Makowski was unable to participate in the recording of the latter demo, so the band recruited John Gelso to play guitar. Both demo tapes eventually caught the interest of After World Records. The band signed a deal with the label and in 1991 they released Weeping in Heaven on 7\\" EP, strictly limited to 500 hand-numbered copies. Following the success of this EP, After World chose to re-release it on cassette with two bonus live tracks the following year. Also in 1992, the band signed a deal with French label Osmose Productions to release a second EP. The EP turned out to be a split 12\\" with the Colombian band Masacre. During this time, Profanatica extensively toured the northeastern United States, often shocking many with their sick and blasphemous live act. As the end of the year approached, Brett Makowski and John Gelso both officially left the band. Paul and Aragon invited Wicked Warlock of Demonic Blasphemy (nowadays known as Ixithra) of the band Demoncy, to perform the guitar work. The three of them played one gig together, and were planned to participate in an American black metal festival that Halloween, appearing with bands such as Order from Chaos, Vital Remains, and Acheron; however, this never took place. The band entered the studio to record a full-length release, initially entitled The Raping of the Virgin Mary, although in other instances the name was known as Sodomy of Sacred Assholes. The master tapes of these recordings were destroyed (according to Ledney, by Aragon and Ixithra from Demoncy) in the studio, and the band parted ways soon after. Following the end of Profanatica, Ledney formed Havohej. Although Profanatica had split up, several records were released, all of which are official. === Reunion === In early 2001, Paul Ledney recruited two new members and resurrected Profanatica.Biography, March 2001, accessed on 12 April 2013. Their first full-length album Profanatitas de Domonatia was released in 2007. In late 2007, Ledney announced that both Profanatica and Havohej were back, and that Profanatica would headline the Sacrifice of the Nazarene Child Fest Texas the following summer. On 16 August 2010, Profanatica released its second full-length album, Disgusting Blasphemies Against God. On 26 November 2013, Profanatica released their third full-length studio album, Thy Kingdom Cum. Profanatica released their fourth album The Curling flame of Blasphemy on 22 July 2016. In 2016 longtime guitarist and bassist John Gelso exited the band and was replaced by Ryan Adams. The band released the EP Altar of the Virgin ***** on 2 November 2018. == Musical style and ideology == Profanatica's music is influenced by Possessed, old Venom, old Bathory, Hellhammer, Necrovore and Sarcófago, and is close to death metal. According to both Proscriptor and Tony Laureano, they are among the first American black metal bands,Gunnar Sauermann: Special: Black Metal in den USA. Schwarzes Amerika. In: Metal Hammer, August 2007, p. 87f.Gunnar Sauermann: Verfeindete Brüder. Tod gegen Schwarz – Death oder Black Metal?. In: Metal Hammer, August 2007, p. 90. although Laureano considers them to be obviously death metal. The second demo was recorded quickly after the third one because they \\"wanted something more raw\\", like Necrovore's demo. Their songs \\"are very simple in structure so anyone can really play them. The trick is to play them aggressive like Gelso does.\\" The music is written by Ledney and John Gelso. The lyrics are about blasphemy and profanation of \\"anything sacred and holy\\". Ledney writes \\"most of the blasphemies and Aragon does most of the lyrics\\". A Profanatica video showed the bassist ejaculating unto a bible and Ledney licking it up; the latter claims they are \\"definitely not homos\\". Asked how deeply he is into Satanism, Ledney replied Profanatica were \\"into our own deal\\" and had their own beliefs, making \\"our own Satanism\\" and being \\"into black perversion. We shit on God. We are larger than God and he is smaller than us. That's the way we think. We put down false religions.\\" He does consider himself a Satanist, while \\"a lot of other people wouldn't\\". He believes he is his own God and does not \\"believe Satan is an actual entity. It's just a worship figure, but a lot of people do think of Satan as a real god. Maybe they're crazy, why should their 'master' care about someone like them anyhow?\\" His beliefs are mostly drawn from Aleister Crowley, whose Book of the Law \\"really opened my eyes. Satanism is anti-religion. I don't believe in any Gods. I suppose it's good that some people gather for black masses with their corresponding dark beliefs, but I think everybody should think for themselves. If everyone thought the same way then that would be hell on earth.\\" Asked about Anton LaVey, he replied that \\"he doesn't look too good in that little devil costume he wears. I wore one of those costumes for Halloween when I was nine with the pitchfork and that's all I'm gonna say...\\" He does not agree with the views of the Church of Satan, referring to an ad for a Baphomet mug in their magazine The Black Flame for around $15.95 which he called \\"the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen\\" and \\"money-making junk\\". He rejects \\"Satanic churches and so forth\\" as \\"just more organized religion\\". Asked about the Necronomicon, he replied \\"it was written as a joke - kind of. But I think it was 1/2 real and 1/2 fake. HP Lovecraft is a great writer. One of my favorites. But if someone believes in Pazuzu, then he exists. That's the way I look at it.\\" Ledney called the Norwegian bands \\"kinda a joke. Anyone can take a lot of drugs and put on make-up, that's what I think. […] Bands that claim they're true aren't true! That's like someone saying how big their cock is. It's definitely small! If they talk about it all the time. Except for us.\\" He would not \\"really put a label on where bands are from\\", but called the Swedish scene \\"definitely retarded and Norway is not far behind that. There's so many bands that play the same style and rip off from each other and other bands, that it's just ridiculously fake!\\" As Profanatica were rejected by Varg Vikernes from the Norwegian band Burzum, Ledney replied that \\"the only reason for his hatred is jealousy\\". According to him, \\"95% of the bands from Norway and all of Europe can't play their instruments at all. I don't even call it music. I just call it a sad attempt at Black Metal. […] I think Europe is making it trendy with all of the bands from Norway. They use samples on the guitars and they just don't know how to play. […] The only band I like from Norway is IMMORTAL.\\" Asked to mention bands he \\"think[s] are true Black Metallers\\", he named Impaled Nazarene and Beherit from Finland, Necromantia and Rotting Christ from Greece, and Bestial Summoning from the Netherlands. The album Profanatitas de Domonatia differs from early releases in terms of productions, which \\"happened on purpose. That was the sound we were trying to get all these years. More of a thick INCANTATION feel to it. PROFANATICA has not changed our style / ideas since 1990, unlike other bands.\\" ==LineupCurrent lineup=== * Paul Ledney - vocals, drums (1990–1992, 2001–present) * Richard Olseen - bass (2018–present) * Pat Davies - bass (2020-present) *Live* * Adam Besserer - guitars (2018-present) ===Former members=== Guitars: * Brett Makowski (1990–1992) * Wicked Warlock (1992) * Rod Ware (2001–2006) * John Gelso (1990-1992, 2007-2016) * Ryan Adams - guitars (2016-2018) Bass: * Aragon Amori (1990–1992) * Malcolm Tent (2001–2006) * Alex Cox (2007-2018) ==DiscographyAlbums=== * Profanatitas de Domonatia (2007)Andi Bauer: Profanatitas de Domonatia, Voices from the Darkside, accessed on 11 April 2013. * Disgusting Blasphemies Against God (2010)Leonard Likas: Disgusting Blasphemies Against God, Voices from the Darkside, accessed on 11 April 2013. * Thy Kingdom Cum (2013) * The Curling Flame of Blasphemy (2016) * Rotting Incarnation of Christ (2019) ===Compilations=== * Profanatica - Live (2000) * The Enemy of Virtue (2006) * Sickened by Holy Host (The Grand Masters Session) (2012) ===EPs=== * Weeping in Heaven (1991) * Altar of the Virgin Whore (2018) ===Singles=== * Broken Jew (2002) ===Demos=== * Official Rehearsal Tape (1990) * Putrescence Of...

The elections were primarily a contest between the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led by Benazir Bhutto and the conservative nine-party alliance, Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) headed by Nawaz Sharif. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dissolved the National Assembly and dismissed Bhutto's government in August 1990 on charges of corruption and maladministration.A Leaf From History: Ghulam Ishaq invokes Article 58-2(b), sends Benazir packing Dawn, 15 January 2017 However, the PPP was still extremely popular and there was a fear amongst anti-PPP forces that it might be re-elected. Numerous steps were taken by Ishaq with help of the military establishment to sway the results in favour of the IJI, including the appointment of IJI chairman Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi as caretaker Prime Minister.An overview of 1990 general elections: The game gets dirtier Dawn, 12 April 2013 Despite their efforts, the PPP remained ahead in opinion polls.1990 election was rigged, rules SC Dawn, 19 October 2012 However, the result was a surprise victory for the IJI, which won 111 of the 207 seats. The PPP won just 44 seats amidst a voter turnout of only 45.5%.Dieter Nohlen, Florian Grotz & Christof Hartmann (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume I, p678 The IJI's parliamentary leader Sharif became Prime Minister while Bhutto became the Opposition Leader. In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled that the elections had been rigged. == Background == The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led by Benazir Bhutto won a plurality of seats in the 1988 election and Bhutto became Prime Minister. However by 1990 there was discontent over rising lawlessness, allegations of corruption and the failure of the government to fulfill the promises it had made during the 1988 campaign. == Parties == The PPP ran in the election in a coalition with 3 parties as the People's Democratic Alliance. == Campaign == By the start of the campaign reports suggested that Bhutto and the PDA were in a stronger position as the caretaker government failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove any charges against her. At the end of the campaign Bhutto led hundreds of thousands of supporters in a procession in Lahore, while Sharif held a rally for about ten thousand nearby. ==Electoral fraud== On 19 October 2012, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled on a petition by Asghar Khan, requesting that the court probe allegations that the 1990 elections had been rigged. The court officially ruled that two Army Generals – Mirza Aslam Baig and Asad Durrani (Head of the ISI) – along with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan – had provided financial assistance to favoured parties. The motive was to deliberately weaken the mandate of the Pakistan Peoples Party. It was believed that the PPP, led by Benazir Bhutto, was a liability to the nation. == Results == The outgoing party, the PPP/PDA, lost the elections. IJI won the popular vote by a very narrow margin of only around 100,000 votes, but the narrow victory in the popular vote translated into 106 seats for IJI against the PDA's 44 seats. The popular argument regarding PDA's huge loss of seats is that the PDA's vote, despite being almost equal to that of IJI, was much more spread out whereas IJI's vote bank was more concentrated. This resulted in PDA candidates losing in IJI won seats by narrow margins. { class= style=text-align:right !Parties !Votes !% !Seats !+/– - align=leftIslami Jamhoori Ittehad7,908,51337.4106+50 - align=leftPeople's Democratic Alliance7,795,21836.844New - align=leftHaq Parast1,172,5255.515New - align=leftJamiat Ulema-e- Islam622,2142.96−1 - align=leftAwami National Party356,1601.76+4 - align=leftJamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan (Noorani)310,9531.53New - align=leftPakistan Awami Tehrik237,4921.10New - align=leftJamhoori Wattan Party129,4310.62New - align=leftPakistan National Party127,2870.62+2 - align=leftPakhtun-khwa Milli Awami Party73,6350.31New - align=leftSindh National Front51,9900.20New - align=leftPakistan Democratic Party51,6450.200 - align=leftBalochistan National Movement51,2970.20New - align=leftSindh National Alliance31,1250.10New - align=left13 other parties64,4700.30– - align=leftIndependents2,179,95610.322−18 - align=leftInvalid/blank votes231,568––– - align=leftTotal21,395,4791002070 - align=left colspan=5Source: Nohlen et al. } ===Punjab=== { class= style=text-align:right !party !votes !% !seats - align=leftIslami Jamhoori Ittehad6,917,7234992 - align=leftPakistan Democratic Alliance5,362,0843814 - align=leftIndependent1,142,05986 - align=leftJamiat-Ulema-e- Islam(Noorani)246,63323 - align=leftPakistan Awami Tehreek218,58420 - align=leftOthers91,98910 - align=leftTOTAL13,979,072100115 } ===Sindh=== { class= style=text-align:right !party !votes !% !seats - align=leftPakistan Democratic Alliance1,827,6124223 - align=leftHaq Parsat1,172,525 2715 - align=leftIndependent717,170165 - align=leftIslami Jamhoori Ittehad373,40993 - align=leftOthers281,53360 - align=leftTotal4,372,24910046 } ===KPK=== { class= style=text-align:right !party !votes !% !seats - align=leftIslami Jamhoori Ittehad522,546258 - align=leftPakistan Democratic Alliance467,801225 - align=leftJamiat-Ulema-e-Islam (Fazal-Ur- Rehman)426,351204 - align=leftIndependent358,295179 - align=leftAwami National Party308,051156 - align=leftOthers304,87020 - align=leftTOTAL2,117,91410032 } ===Balochistan=== { class= style=text-align:right !party !votes !% !seats - align=leftJamiat-Ulema-e-Islam(Fazal-Ur-Rehman)130,853192 - align=leftJamhoori Wattan Party129,431192 - align=leftPakistan Democratic Alliance103,216152 - align=leftPakistan National Party90,886132 - align=leftPakhtoon Milli Awami Party70,673101 - align=leftIslami Jamhoori Ittehad62,35491 - align=leftBalochistan National Movement51,29770 - align=leftIndependent29,38841 - align=leftothers26,49840 - align=leftTotal694,59610011 } ==References== 1990 Category:1990 elections in Pakistan Category:October 1990 events in Asia Category:Electoral fraud in Pakistan ","title":"1990 Pakistani general election"},{"id":"20416854","text":"Carrickbeg ()http://www.logainm.ie/47379.aspx is a village on the southern side of the river Suir in southern Ireland. Carrickbeg comprises that part of the town of Carrick-on-Suir on the southern side of the River Suir. The area is in County Tipperary, but a minority of residents have an affinity for County Waterford, as well as it previously being a part of Waterford. Carrickbeg came to national attention in 2008 when the winning ticket for a €15 million EuroMillions jackpot was sold in the village. ==History== The Franciscan order had a presence in Carrickbeg between 1336 and 2006. The land on which the friary was constructed was first granted to the order by the 1st Earl of Ormond. However, the suppression of monasteries by Henry VIII led to the closure of the friary. Just prior to the invasion of Ireland by Oliver Cromwell, the friars had returned for an 11-year period, before being shut down again and the friars having to go underground to avoid persecution. It was not until 1820 and the onset of Catholic Emancipation that the friars were able to fully return and a new chapel was built. Saint Francis Roman Catholic Church was built on the grounds of the former fourteenth-century Franciscan Friary. The friars served the local community until a lack of vocations led to the order finally leaving Carrickbeg in 2006. ==Features== The main features of Carrickbeg are the old St. Molleran's church, the River Suir and the views of Slievenamon. ==Sport== The local Gaelic Athletic Association club is St. Molleran's. The club is one of three GAA clubs in the town of Carrick-on-Suir, the others being Carrick Davins and Carrick Swan.

Pakistan initially contested this attribution, but agreed this was the case on 7 January 2009. To back up its accusations, the Indian government supplied a dossier to Pakistan's high commission in Delhi. The Pakistan government dismissed the dossier as \\"not evidence,\\" but also announced that it had detained over a hundred members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a charity linked with Lashkar-e-Taiba. In February 2009, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik agreed that \\"some part of the conspiracy\\" did take place in Pakistan. Moreover, Indian government officials have said that the attacks were so sophisticated that they must have had official backing from Pakistani \\"agencies\\",India accuses Pakistani \\"agencies\\", NYT, 6 January 2009 an accusation denied by Pakistan. ==Attribution== The Mumbai attacks were planned and directed by Lashkar-e- Taiba militants inside Pakistan, and carried out by ten young armed men trained and sent to Mumbai and directed from inside Pakistan via mobile phones and VoIP. In July 2009 Pakistani authorities confirmed to their Indian counterparts that their investigations confirmed that LeT plotted and financed the attacks. Investigations conducted in LeT camps in Karachi and Thatta revealed diaries, training manuals, maps of India and operational instructions. According to a report from Pakistani investigators to Indian authorities, \\"the investigation has established beyond any reasonable doubt that the defunct LeT activists conspired, abetted, planned, financed and established [the] communication network to carry out terror attacks in Mumbai.\\" The criminal investigation begun by the Mumbai police has identified 37 suspects – including two army officers – wanted for their alleged involvement in the plot. All but two of the suspects, many of whom are identified only through aliases, are Pakistani. David Headley was a member of Lashkar-e-Taiba, and between 2002 and 2009 Headley travelled extensively as part of his work for LeT. Headey received training in small arms and countersurveillance from LeT, built a network of connections for the group, and was chief scout in scoping out targets for the Mumbai attacks.New York Times, 16 October 2010 \\"U.S. Had Warnings on Plotter of Mumbai Attack,\\" https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/world/asia/17headley.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref;=global- homePro Publica, 15 October 2010, \\"FBI Was Warned Years in Advance of Mumbai Attacker’s Terror Ties,\\" https://www.propublica.org/article/mumbai-plot-fbi- was-warned-years-in-advance Lashkar-e-Taiba was created and sponsored by Pakistan's intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI). US officials have stated that current or retired ISI officers probably played some role in the Mumbai attacks. An ISI officer known as Major Iqbal gave Headley $25,000 in cash in 2006 to scout out the target sites in Mumbai, helped him arrange a communications system for the attack, and oversaw a model of the Taj Mahal Hotel so that gunmen could know their way inside the target, according to Headley's testimony to Indian authorities. Headley also helped ISI recruit Indian agents to monitor Indian troop levels and movements, according to a US official. At the same time, Headley was also an informant for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, and Headley's wives warned American officials of Headley's involvement with LeT and his plotting of terrorist operations, warning specifically that the Taj Mahal Hotel may be their target. ===Cooperation by Pakistan=== Pakistan initially contested that Pakistanis were responsible for the attacks, but agreed this was the case on 7 January 2009. A year after the attacks, Mumbai police continued to complain that Pakistani authorities are not co-operating by providing information for their investigation. Meanwhile, journalists in Pakistan said security agencies were preventing them from interviewing people from Kasab's village. The Indian government supplied evidence to Pakistan's high commission in Delhi, in the form of interrogations, weapons, and call records of conversations during the attacks. The evidence, shown to friendly governments and media, provided a detailed sequence of training, supplying, and constant communications of attackers with handlers from Pakistan. In addition, Indian government officials said that the attacks were so sophisticated that they must have had official backing from Pakistani \\"agencies\\", an accusation denied by Pakistan. In February 2009, Pakistani newspaper The Dawn, citing Pakistani investigators, claimed that the attacks were planned in Bangladesh and refined in India with significant support being provided by Indian-based militant groups and criminal organisations. However, Indian investigators refuted this claim, with the Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram dismissing the claim as \\"rubbish\\". On 12 February 2009, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik agreed that some part of the conspiracy did take place in Pakistan. Malik said that Pakistan had lodged a First Information Report (FIR) under Anti-Terrorism Act against three persons. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said on 15 February 2009 that the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings and the Mumbai attacks were linked, and that Pakistan needed information from India to continue its investigation. ===Attackers=== Police looking for attackers outside Colaba There were ten gunmen, nine of whom were subsequently shot dead and one captured by security forces. Witnesses reported that they looked to be in their early twenties, wore black T-shirts and jeans, and that they smiled and looked happy as they shot their victims. It was initially reported that some of the attackers were British citizens, but the Indian Government later stated that there was no evidence to confirm this. Similarly, early reports of twelve gunmen were also later shown to be incorrect. On 9 December, the ten attackers were identified by Mumbai police, along with their home towns in Pakistan: Ajmal Amir from Faridkot, Abu Ismail Dera Ismail Khan from Dera Ismail Khan, Hafiz Arshad and Babr Imran from Multan, Javed from Okara, Shoaib from Sialkot, Nazih and Nasr from Faisalabad, Abdul Rahman from Arifwalla, and Fahad Ullah from Dipalpur Taluka. Dera Ismail Khan is in the North-West Frontier Province; the rest of the towns are in Pakistani Punjab. === Arrests === Ajmal Kasab was the only attacker captured alive by police and was hanged on 21 November 2012 at 7:30 am. Much of the information about the attackers' preparation, travel, and movements comes from his confessions to the Mumbai police. On 12 February 2009 Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik said that Pakistani national Javed Iqbal, who acquired VoIP phones in Spain for the Mumbai attackers, and Hamad Ameen Sadiq, who had facilitated money transfer for the attack, had been arrested. Two other men known as Khan and Riaz, but whose full names were not given, were also arrested. Two Pakistanis were arrested in Brescia, Italy on 21 November 2009, after being accused of providing logistical support to the attacks. In October 2009, two men were charged by the FBI for involvement in terrorism abroad, David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Hussain Rana. Mumbai police suspect these two may be involved in the Mumbai attacks, too. Headley is reported to have posed as an American Jew and is believed to have links with terrorist outfits based in Bangladesh.

On 6 January 2009, they admitted that \\"part of\\" the attacks were planned inside Pakistan. They accepted that Ajmal Amir Kasab, the only attacker captured alive, was Pakistani. In the months since the attacks, police in Pakistan have produced their own dossier which adds information about the Lashkar-e-Taiba network and of the involvement of specific individuals in planning and training.Officials Fear New Mumbai-Style Attacks, Lydia Polgreen and Souad Mekhennet, The New York Times, 30 November 2009 Pakistani authorities have arrested seven men linked to the Mumbai attacks, including Hammad Amin Sadiq, a homoeopathic pharmacist, who arranged bank accounts and secured supplies, and Zaki ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the chief of operations for Lashkar. They are searching for at least 13 other suspects. But their investigation has come up short of the founder of Lashkar, Hafiz Saeed, the man Indian and Western officials accuse of masterminding the attacks. In June 2009, a Pakistani court freed Mr. Saeed from detention, declaring it did not have enough evidence to hold him. He now has an international warrant out for his arrest, issued by Interpol. ==Attackers== The names and photographs of the ten attackers and their hometowns in Pakistan were released by Mumbai police on 9 December.Pakistan confirms arrests of militants, Jane Perlez and Salman Masood, The New York Times, 9 December 2008 All were from Punjab except Ismail Khan, who was from Dera Ismail Khan in the North-West Frontier Province. Their names were difficult to establish because the alleged trainers of the attackers maintained \\"a system of changing the names of the members every few months, so that everyone had layers of names that were discarded over time.\\" Some of the terrorists booked a room in the Taj hotel posed as students using forged Mauritian identity documents and credit cards, but there is no evidence any of them were actually from Mauritius, which is an Indian Ocean island nation. Each attacker carried a dozen hand grenades, a 9×19mm handgun with two 18-round magazines and an AK-47, seven to nine 30-round magazines and more than 100 rounds of loose ammunition. Each terrorist also carried a 17.6-pound (8 kg) bomb. Three of these bombs were recovered and defused, while the others exploded during the attacks. To navigate to Mumbai by sea and to find some targets, the terrorists used Global Positioning System handsets. On 2 December, the number of ten terrorists, all coming into Mumbai from Karachi via a hijacked trawler, was repeated by Mumbai Police Commissioner Hassan Gafoor. He detailed that the terrorists broke up into five groups of two men each. One attacker, Mohammad Ajmal Amir, is known to be a Pakistani national. The Pakistani government denies it, but several reporters have visited the small town in Pakistan where he said his family lives, and verified it. In addition, Mohammed Ajmal Amir was able to identify his home town on Google Maps, and pointed out places he used to hang out as a teenager. The Observer stated that it had found Ajmal Amir's parents in the electoral record for \\"Faridkot, near Depalpur\\" containing 478 registered voters, and described comments from villagers about Ajmal Amir and about the village being \\"an active recruiting ground\\" for Lashkar-e-Taiba.Revealed: home of Mumbai's gunman in Pakistan village.

Maintains LeT was uninvolved in the attack. India has demanded Pakistan arrest him and extradite him to India. * Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi – In custody of Pakistan military – Senior member of Lashkar-e-Taiba. Named as being one of the masterminds of the Mumbai attack. Said by US officials to have been involved in operations in Chechnya, Bosnia and Kashmir, where he allegedly trained LeT operatives to carry out suicide attacks. * Masood Azhar – In custody of Pakistan military – Wanted by India in connection with the attacks on the Indian Parliament in 2001. Involvement with present Mumbai bombings unspecified. Leader and founder of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). * Yusuf Muzammil – Status Unknown, Presumed living in Pakistan – Senior member of Lashkar-e- Taiba. Named as the handler of Faheem Ansari, who was arrested in February 2008 scouting sites for attack in Mumbai, as well as mastermind of the attacks by surviving gunman Amjal Kamal. * Zarar Shah – In Pakistani custody\\"Pakistan confirms Mumbai arrests\\", AP, 10 December 2008 – one of Lashkar-e-Taiba's primary liaisons to the ISI. Investigators in India are also examining whether Mr. Shah, a communications specialist, helped plan and carry out the attacks in Mumbai. \\"He's a central character in this plot,\\" an American official said.Pakistan’s Spies Aided Group Tied to Mumbai Siege, Eric Schmitt, et al., NYT, 07-Dec-2008 Zarar Shah confessed to Pakistani authorities that LeT carried out the attacks, according to the Wall Street Journal.Pakistani investigators find Mumbai link, NYT, 31 December 2008 * Hamad Ameen Sadiq – In Pakistani custody – Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency calls him the \\"main operator\\".

Not directly connected to the Mumbai plot. Added by the U.N., after the 2008 Mumbai blasts, to the list of people who sponsor terrorism. ==Scouts== *David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-American, and Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a Pakistani- Canadian, were arrested in Chicago in October 2009 in a different matter. But Indian investigators are looking at these two closely because they made multiple trips to India prior to the attacks and may have scouted locations. ==Indian collaborators== As of 6 December, there are at least two groups of possible Indian collaborators being investigated: * Surveillance Team – One group of six men, consisting of Faheem Ahmed Ansari, Saba'uddin Ahmed, and others, already in police custody for a separate bombing in northern India, who may have conducted surveillance of the Mumbai landmarks that were attacked. * SIM Card Suppliers – A second group, consisting of Tauseef Rahman, Mukhtar Ahmed, who purchased the SIM cards that were used in the Mumbai attackers' phones.Indian police arrest 2 men, Manik Banerjee, AP news wire, 06-Dec-2008 ===Surveillance team=== Faheem Ahmed Ansari, an Indian from Mumbai, is a suspected collaborator. His group of six Indian men were initially arrested in connection with an attack on a police station in northern India. Ansari had also carried out reconnaissance of targets in Mumbai earlier in the year. He was caught with hand-drawn sketches of 8 to 10 Mumbai landmarks. This group said they had been directed by two Lashkar-e- Taiba leaders: Zaki ur-Rehman Lakhvi, and a man known alternately as Yusuf or Muzammil—the same people who directed the Mumbai attackers by phone from Pakistan. * Faheem Ahmed Ansari – Under arrest in India – Indian citizen, resident of Goregaon. Arrested in Rampur, northern India, in February 2008 with hand-drawn maps, sketches of targeted sites. Ansari worked in Saudi Arabia in 2006, from where he said he was recruited by the Lashkar-e-Taiba and given a Pakistani passport, then trained in Pakistan. Claims to have carried out reconnaissance in the fall of 2007 against 8–9 targets including the attacked hotels, the US Consulate, the Mumbai stock exchange, and other sites. Named Yuuf Muzammil as his Lashkar-e-Taiba handler in Pakistan, and claimed to have been trained in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan. A senior STF officer said, \\"Fahim guided the ATS to all the attack sites, particularly the Taj and CST, which he'd surveyed. He had sent the information by e-mail to somebody in Pakistan.\\" The report went on to say, \\"Fahim used more than 16 e-mail accounts to communicate with his handlers. He sent them nine scanned copies of handmade maps. His disclosures were later cross-checked with another Pakistani militant Sabauddin, who was arrested for the Rampur attack.\\" * Sabauddin Ahmed (aka Saba'uddin Ahmed) – Under arrest in India. May have provided help to the Mumbai attackers. Arrested along with Faheem Ansari in February 2008. He is a well-educated young man from an affluent family in Bihar, who said he had been trained both by Lashkar-e-Taiba and by an ISI operator for four months. On 18 December Both Mohammad Faheem Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed were taken on remand to Mumbai by a Mumbai Crime Branch team. ===SIM card suppliers=== Two Indian men were arrested in Kolkata on 6 December for illegally buying mobile phone cards used by the gunmen in the Mumbai attacks. It is not known whether the two had advance knowledge of the attacks. Tauseef Rahman allegedly bought SIM cards by providing fake documents, including identification cards of dead people, and sold them to Mukhtar Ahmed. Ahmed is suspected to be an undercover policeman based in Srinagar. * Tausif Rehman, Muktar Ahmed – Under arrest in India – On 6 December 2008, two men were arrested in Calcutta, India, in connection with the Mumbai attacks, charged with conspiracy and forgery. These two men were being questioned in connection with selling of 22 cell phone Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards to the Mumbai attackers. One of the men was said to be from West Bengal and the other was from Kashmir. The Kashmiri suspect was at first believed to be a police officer. Later the two men were identified as Tausif Rehman, a clerk from Howrah Station, and Mukhtar Ahmed, an auto-rickshaw (three-wheel taxi) driver of Kolkata. Rehman used the identity documents of a dead relative to acquire the SIM cards, and later sold the cards to Ahmed. ==Erroneous reports and theories== There was enormous media coverage during and immediately after the attacks, and many of the early reports turned out to be erroneous in some details. The Government of Pakistan repeatedly dismissed claims that the attackers were Pakistani, presented alternative theories, and sought to link the attacks with other bombing incidents which, they claimed, the Indian government was responsible for. Similarly, many news outlets carried opinions and unattributed theories, which also caused confusion. ==See also== * Allegations of state terrorism committed by Pakistan ==External links== * Translation of Message From 'Deccan Mujahideen' 2008-11-28 * Terrorists Ring Up India TV Twice During Siege Using Hostages’ Cellphones Transcript of cell phone calls made to India TV India TV 2008-11-27 * Identity of Mumbai attackers still uncertain TV3 2008-11-30 * Who's Behind the Mumbai Massacre?

He began his pro baseball career with the Yankees' organization in 1941. Buzas batted and threw right-handed and was listed as tall and . He made it to the major leagues in 1945, the final year of the World War II manpower shortage; during his 30-game trial, he had 17 hits, with two doubles, one triple, six runs batted in, two stolen bases, and a .262 batting average. A shoulder injury shortened his playing career, and Buzas briefly became a player-manager in the Cincinnati Reds' organization before going into private business in 1951. In 1958, at age 39, he began his ownership career by taking over the moribund Syracuse franchise in the Class A Eastern League. Moving it to Allentown, Pennsylvania, he signed a working agreement with the Boston Red Sox and began a long association that would see Buzas operate Bosox farm clubs at the Class A, Double-A and Triple-A levels over the next 35 years.

In people with psoriasis using topical steroids it occurs in up to 5% of people after a year of use. Skin atrophy can occur with both prescription and over the counter steroids creams. Low doses of prednisone by mouth can also result in skin atrophy. ==Signs and symptoms== Steroid-induced atrophy It can also present with telangiectasia, easy bruising, purpura, and striae. Occlusive dressings and fluorinated steroids both increase the likelihood of developing atrophy. == Prevention == In general, use a potent preparation short term and weaker preparation for maintenance between flare-ups. While there is no proven best benefit-to-risk ratio, if prolonged use of a topical steroid on a skin surface is required, a pulse therapy should be undertaken. Pulse therapy refers to the application of a corticosteroid for 2 or 3 consecutive days each week or two. This is useful for maintaining control of chronic diseases. Generally a milder topical steroid or non-steroid treatment is used on the in-between days. Strong steroids should be avoided on sensitive sites such as the face, groin and armpits. Even the application of weaker or safer steroids should be limited to less than two weeks on those sites. == Treatment == The obvious priority is immediate discontinuation of any further topical corticosteroid use. Protection and support of the impaired skin barrier is another priority. Eliminating harsh skin regimens or products will be necessary to minimize potential for further purpura or trauma, skin sensitivity, and potential infection. Steroid-induced skin atrophy is often permanent, though if caught soon enough and the topical corticosteroid discontinued in time, the degree of damage may be arrested or slightly improve. However, while the accompanying telangiectasias may improve marginally, the stretch marks are permanent and irreversible. == References == __notoc__ Category:Drug safety Category:Corticosteroids Category:Cutaneous conditions ","title":"Steroid-induced skin atrophy"},{"id":"20416985","text":"Hans Baruch (September 16, 1925 – June 6, 2013) was an American physiologist/inventor, noted mainly for his contributions to scientific apparatus and instruments in the field of automated clinical chemistry. His Robot Chemist \\"was the first commercially available discrete analyzer, and probably the first to produce results with a digital print-out.\\" Rosenfeld, Louis. Four Centuries of Clinical Chemistry. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, 1999. . Pp. 490-492 Automatic discrete analysis instrumentation revolutionized the field of clinical chemistry, and, eventually, the practice of medicine, as well. ==BiographyEarly life=== Hans Baruch, born in 1925 and raised in Hamburg, Germany, immigrated to the United States in 1938. He was admitted to the Bronx High School of Science (class of 1942), a newly founded (1938) school for students thought to be talented in the sciences. The entrance examinations for this school were quite rigorous and only a small percentage of applicants was admitted. After graduating from The Bronx High School of Science (June, 1942), Baruch attended Brooklyn College, where he met Abraham Maslow and quickly became one of his research assistants. Although Maslow was already interested in the hierarchy of basic needs, at that time his interests included human dominance and security, as well as self-esteem. Baruch acquired a practical and theoretical knowledge of statistics while helping to develop tests to measure those traits. In November 1943 Baruch was drafted into the United States Army, serving until November 1945, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Prisoner of War Medal, as well as 3 battle stars for his service in the European Theater of War. Prior to discharge from the U.S. Army, Baruch was posted to Ft. DuPont, Delaware, where he was put in charge of the clinical laboratory of the post hospital. It was this experience that led him to start thinking about mechanizing clinical chemistry. ===Post World War II=== After discharge from the U.S. Army, Baruch enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he continued his studies in psychology until he met Nikolaas Tinbergen at a seminar. At that seminar (1946) Tinbergen described his experiments performed during World War II in the Netherlands under the German occupation. Then, materials and equipment were scarce, so Tinbergen had to work under relatively primitive conditions. The experiments he performed on new-born baby chicks and cardboard cutouts that were moved back and forth along an overhead wire resulted in what is now known as the \\"hawk/goose effect.\\" The above-described experiments so affected Baruch that he decided to change fields and study biology and chemistry, a change consistent with his thinking along these lines that had begun during his army service. Shortly after his arrival in California, Baruch met, and then married, Flora Krauzer (January 26, 1918 - January 17, 2011). They have three children, twin boys, David and Duncan, and a girl, Claudia Kimbrough. In 1951, as a graduate student, Baruch invented a new incubation flask for metabolic studies on tissue slices. That incubation flask was described by Baruch and Chaikoff and was adopted in numerous laboratories throughout the U.S.A. (See the paper by E.D. Neville and D.D. Feller.) In that paper the authors state: \\"The incubation flask described by Baruch and Chaikoff (1) for tissue slices and decarboxylation studies has gained widespread popularity.\\" In other publications the flask was simply described as the \\"Baruch flask.\\"(e.g. Baker, N., et al.) In the period from 1951-1953 Baruch worked in the fields of lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism (cf. P.F. Hirsch, H. Baruch, and I.L. Chaikoff and Hans Baruch and I.L. Chaikoff) In 1953 Dr. Baruch decided to leave academic life because he found its constraints incompatible with his ideals and his character. In the same year he founded Research Specialties Co., devoted solely to the design and manufacture of scientific instruments. This new enterprise grew quickly and became one of the leading manufacturers of apparatus and instruments in the fields of paper chromatography, liquid chromatography and gas chromatography, as well as some other instruments used in the biological sciences. Baruch's designs for gas chromatography instruments introduced the concept of modular design that has become standard in the industry. By 1954 the concept of an automatic discrete sample analyzer had become sufficiently concrete in his mind that Baruch began work on actual design. Construction of prototypes began in 1956 and design, development, and engineering continued until 1959 when the first units of the Robot Chemist were sold commercially. It was at this juncture that a theoretical competition began between the continuous flow concept of analysis (CFA) and the discrete sample analysis concept of the Robot Chemist. At first, it appeared that CFA would prevail, but it turned out that \\"it was the discrete sample concept of the Robot Chemist that eventually was adopted by instrument designers and manufacturers and achieved the dominant position in the clinical laboratory.\\" A detailed description of all the components and features of the Robot Chemist exceeds the scope of this article. Therefore, we shall give a brief explanation of the apparatus and instruments, providing references to the Baruch patents involved in that equipment. The original Robot Chemist, marketed in 1959, was a desk-sized instrument that appeared to be too large for general acceptance. Thus, a much smaller, desk-top unit was designed in 1958-1962 and first marketed in 1963. This latter instrument contained the first precipitation-filtration unit ever sold commercially in order to provide protein-free blood for analysis of blood components that could not be analyzed in the presence of proteins. The desk-top Robot Chemist consisted of four main components: 1) The Precipitation-filtration module described in U.S. patent #3,282,431 (see Bibliography for this and the following other units mentioned.) 2) The Sample processing module described in U.S. patent #3192968 3) The spectrophotometer 4) The digital print-out unit was the first digital printout made commercially for automatic clinical analyzers. In order to provide the reader with some idea of how the Robot Chemist functioned in a clinical chemical laboratory setting, the following references might be useful. center By early 1963 it had become obvious to Baruch that a really successful commercial development of a Robot Chemist was only possible with an infusion of substantial new capital into Research Specialties Company. The Board of Directors of the now publicly owned company was unwilling to provide further investments in the company, as they were (with the exception of one or two) only interested in short-term profits. At scientific meetings and trade shows Baruch met representatives of PerkinElmer and Warner Lambert Pharmaceutical Corporation both of whom evinced an interest in acquiring Research Specialties Co. He was invited to visit PerkinElmer, and there met Chester W Nimitz Jr, who was the Chief Executive Officer of that company. They immediately became friends, and Baruch decided that he could work with Nimitz in a productive manner. At the same time he expressed strong doubts about Warner Lambert's ability to manage successfully a complex scientific instrument company such as Research Specialties. Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Research Specialties Company decided to pursue its acquisition by Warner-Lambert. In an interview with Dr. Baruch he called this course \\"an egregious decision by a massively ignorant Board.\\" Because he could not see a useful future with the company, he resigned from Research Specialties in early 1964. ===Post-Research Specialties Co.=== After leaving the company Baruch turned first to business and technical consulting with a number of firms. Starting in the late 1960s he became interested in computer programming, and this discipline occupied him for the next 25 years in which time he wrote numerous software programs for application to controlling specialized business and technical/scientific needs; during 1975 he served for a short time as Education Director of the Alameda County, California Data Processing Center. He also designed some instruments for laboratories, one of which, a precision liquid dispensing device, (marketed under the name \\"Jet Pipet\\") sold many tens of thousands. In 2003 Baruch published his last peer- reviewed scientific paper, together with his old friend and research partner Philip F. Hirsch. This paper was a theoretical one, questioning the physiological importance of the hormone calcitonin. ==BibliographyNotesFurther reading== Marsh, Walton H. Automation In Clinical Chemistry.

This index is released by UNESCO. In its simplest form, it is calculated as the quotient of the number of females by the number of males enrolled in a given stage of education (primary, secondary, etc.). A GPI equal to one signifies equality between males and females. A GPI less than one is an indication that gender parity favors males while a GPI greater than one indicates gender parity that favors females. The closer a GPI is to one, the closer a country is to achieving equality of access between males and females. It is used by international organizations, particularly in measuring the progress of developing countries. The Institute for Statistics of UNESCO also uses a more general definition of GPI: for any development indicator one can define the GPI relative to this indicator by dividing its value for females by its value for males. For example, some UNESCO documents consider gender parity in literacy. UNESCO describes attempts to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education and emphasizes the plight of girls in unequal access in third world countries. However, the GPI ignores the gender disparity that benefits first-world women in tertiary education. In Iceland, for example, 65% of students enrolling in tertiary education are female. The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2016 allows users to look at and compare country GPI data, calculate your own country's gender parity, and explore global patterns. ==See also Indices === * Bhutan GNH Index * Broad measures of economic progress * Disability-adjusted life year * Full cost accounting * Green national product * Green gross domestic product (Green GDP) * Gender-related Development Index * Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) * Global Peace Index * Gross National Happiness * Gross National Well-being (GNW) * Happiness economics * Happy Planet Index (HPI) * Human Development Index (HDI) * ISEW (Index of sustainable economic welfare) * Legatum Prosperity Index * Leisure satisfaction * Living planet index * Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) * Money-rich, time-poor * OECD Better Life Index BLI * Subjective life satisfaction * Where-to-be-born Index * Wikiprogress * World Happiness Report (WHR) * World Values Survey (WVS) === Other === * Economics * Democracy Ranking * Demographic economics * Economic development * Ethics of care * Human Development and Capability Association * Human Poverty Index * Progress (history) * Progressive utilization theory * Post-materialism * Psychometrics * International Association for Feminist Economics * International development * Sustainable development * System of National Accounts * Welfare economics *Gender Empowerment Measure *Gender-related Development Index *Gender equality *Gender inequality ==References== Category:Gender equality Category:Index numbers Category:Socioeconomics Category:Women and education ","title":"Gender Parity Index"},{"id":"20417036","text":"Hilton Towers, Hilton & Towers or Hilton Tower may refer to: *Hilton & Towers Chicago, former name of Hilton Chicago *Hilton Towers Mumbai, former name of Trident Nariman Point Mumbai Hotel *Pittsburgh Hilton & Towers, former name of Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh Downtown *Beetham Tower, Manchester, also called Hilton Tower ","title":"Hilton Towers"},{"id":"20417060","text":"Opponents of Proposition 8 protest the LDS Church's support of the proposition in front of the Newport Beach California Temple. Protests against Proposition 8 supporters in California took place starting in November 2008. These included prominent protests against the Roman Catholic church and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which supported California's Proposition 8. The proposition was a voter referendum that amended the state constitution to recognize marriage only as being between one man and one woman, thus banning same-sex marriage, which was legal in the state following a May 2008 California Supreme Court case. The highly emotional, closely contested nature of the voter referendum created a political maelstrom that was unusual in intensity for its time. After closely passing, the backlash from those who opposed Proposition 8 was widely covered by news media and was controversial. Anti-Proposition 8 activists looked up supporters in state-government-required donation documentation, then posted their names and personal information, and organized protests at their places of work. Several religious buildings were vandalized, and several Proposition 8 supporters received death threats, were mailed envelopes of white powder resembling anthrax, or lost their jobs. This method of shaming and forcing out Proposition 8 supporters was called a \\"mob veto\\" in a full-page advertisement in The New York Times, which was signed by law professors, diplomats, civil rights activists, and heads of religious organizations, while others cited concerns about bigotry against those with religious beliefs. ==The ballot== Proposition 8 added \\"Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California\\" to the California Constitution. Proposition 8 was the most expensive proposition in United States history and sharply divided social conservatives and social liberals, as part of the ongoing American culture wars. The ballot initiative was approved by a majority (52%) of voters. Immediately same-sex marriages were halted and the legal status of the 18,000 same-sex couples was thrown into question. Supporters of the proposition included a coalition of religious and social conservatives that felt the court ruling had redefined marriage. Those opposed to Proposition 8 argued that same-sex couples deserved the same public recognition and marriage rights that other couples are afforded, and that equality could not be achieved without state recognition in the form of marriage. On November 19, 2008, the California Supreme Court accepted three lawsuits challenging Proposition 8 but denied the requests to stay its enforcement. ==Candlelight vigils and pickets== As a result of the proposition's passage, there were organized autonomous protests directed against supporters of the proposition including marches, actions, vigils, boycotts, intimidation, and vandalism. The actions brought awareness to marriage rights issues for LGBT people and the role of tax-exempt churches in this political campaign. There has also been renewed debate in LGBT communities whether boycotting companies or organizations is an appropriate and effective response toward the proposition's supporters. Many anti-Proposition 8 protests, particularly those targeting specific groups that supported Proposition 8, took the form of pickets or candlelight vigils. A candlelight vigil by about 600 mothers of LGBT children was held at the LDS Church's Salt Lake Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah, shortly following the passage of Proposition 8. A protest was also held outside of the Los Angeles California Temple. Protests were held outside of Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles. == Boycotts== Following the passage of the proposition, opponents obtained lists of those who had donated to the \\"Yes on 8\\" campaign, published the list, organized an activism group, and called for boycotts of supporters' places of work. Boycott targets included: * Marc Shaiman, a Broadway composer who had featured his musical, \\"Hairspray,\\" at the California Musical Theatre, demanded other gay artists boycott the theatre over a $1000 personal donation that the artistic director had made to the Pro Prop 8 campaign. The director resigned on November 15, 2008. * The LA Film Festival publicly distanced itself from its own director, who resigned on November 25, 2008. The director had made a personal $1,500 donation to the Yes on 8 campaign. * The El Coyote Restaurant in Los Angeles was picketed after it was learned that the daughter of its owner had donated $100 to the Yes on 8 campaign. While pressured to resign, she refused. The restaurant was popular as a late-night hangout for gay people, but was picketed after her donation was made public.http://www.frontiersla.com/News/Context/Story.aspx?id=1251277 * The Sundance Film Festival, based in Park City, Utah, was the target of calls for boycotts. Utah ranked second only to California for total donations in support of Proposition 8, while it ranked sixth for opposing donations, behind California and such heavily populated states as New York, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan. Over the last two and a half weeks before the election, the Yes on 8 campaign received donations totaling $5 million from Utah residents. * The Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel in San Diego was boycotted after owner Doug Manchester donated $125,000 in support of Proposition 8. The boycott was against the Manchester Hyatt hotel specifically, and not against the Hyatt Hotel chain as a whole. * Terry Caster, San Diego businessman, who persuaded Manchester to donate the $125,000 and who gave almost $700,000 to support Proposition 8. Caster built and owns the A-1 Self Storage Company, which gay- rights groups have also boycotted. * William Bolthouse, Jr, founder of Bolthouse Farms, was forced out of the company for donating to the Proposition 8 campaign. *Leatherby's Family Creamery, in Sacramento, was targeted after The Sacramento Bee published a list of contributors in support of Proposition 8. Their business increased when their establishment was picketed. ==Claims of religious bigotry== Some public figures, writers, media commentators, and individuals expressed concern over the actions and the implications of targeting supporters of the proposition. Supporters of the measure, such as Kathryn Jean Lopez, editor of the National Review Online, and Jonah Goldberg, a Los Angeles Times columnist, have referred to some of the backlash as religious bigotry, especially since many of those targeted are members of the LDS Church. Gregg Araki, an independent filmmaker who is gay, Jeff McDonald and John Marelius of the San Diego Union-Tribune, and others have articulated arguments depicting this characterization as misleading and provided possible justification of such actions. Various individuals and groups have decried actions by those opposed to Proposition 8: * The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty sponsored a full-page ad in the New York Times titled \\"No Mob Veto\\" which read in part, \\"When thugs send white powder to terrorize any place of worship, especially those of a religious minority, responsible voices need to speak clearly: Religious wars are wrong; they are also dangerous.\\" It was signed by 13 people. The Human Rights Campaign responded to this, opposing violence but claiming that the ad distorted the truth when \\"they say we are in favor of mob intimidation and violence\\", suggesting that comments painted the entire opposition to Proposition 8 with the actions of a few. Another full-page New York Times ad placed by Truth Wins Out in response to The Becket Fund page goes further, accusing that ad of \\"blatant falsehoods\\", as well as \\"spotlighting the religious bigotry of the ad's very own signers.\\" * Several opinion pieces condemn the tactics, including \\"Editorial: Protest and civility in a democracy\\" from the Dallas Morning News, \\"So Much for Tolerance\\" from Chuck Colson of the Christian Post, and \\"California and Thank-A-Mormon Day\\" from John Reynolds of Biola University. == Death threats and vandalism == Before the vote, Alan Autry (the mayor of Fresno) received an email containing death threats against both himself and Cornerstone Church pastor Jim Franklin. This caused police to assign the pastor officers for his protection and motivated the mayor to obtain a bodyguard. According to Fresno's Police Chief Jerry Dyer, the email \\"did state as to why that threat was made and it was stemming from prop 8.\\" Both Autry and Franklin were prominent Proposition 8 supporters. As of August 12, 2009, no arrests had been made. In the ten days following the November 4 election, seven houses of worship in Utah and ten LDS Church buildings in the Sacramento area were vandalized, including graffiti and meetinghouse glass doors shattered. According to the LDS Church's spokesperson for the Sacramento area, the vandalism that they were victims of in the ten days after the election was more than they usually get in an entire year. A copy of the Book of Mormon, a Latter-day Saint religious text, was found burning at the front of one of the church's meetinghouses. The FBI investigated these events to determine whether a violation of civil rights had occurred. Most Holy Reedemer Church, a Catholic parish church in The Castro was vandalized in protest of the Catholic Church's position on the proposition. The windows on the Sundstrom family vehicle parked at their home in San Jose were painted \\"Bigots Live Here\\", \\"Stop Bigots\\", and \\"God Hates Haters\\". They had a \\"Protect Marriage Yes on 8” banner. Several people had homes damaged: bricks thrown through house windows, graffiti, and cars damaged. An affiliate group of the radical trans/queer organization Bash Back! claims credit for pouring glue into the locks of an LDS Church meetinghouse and spray painting its walls. A Web posting signed by Bash Back!'s Olympia chapter said, \\"The Mormon church (just like most churches) is a cesspool of filth. It is a breeding ground for oppression of all sorts and needs to be confronted, attacked, subverted and destroyed.\\" According to the Chicago Tribune, the acts of vandalism against the Latter-day Saint meetinghouse appeared to be in retaliation for support of Proposition 8. The Anti-Defamation League released a statement condemning the \\"defacement and destruction of property.\\" ===Anthrax hoax=== In November 2008, the United States Postal Service delivered envelopes containing white powder to the LDS Church's temples in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City and to the national headquarters of the Knights of Columbus in New Haven, Connecticut, prompting a hazardous materials response and a federal domestic terrorism investigation. The envelope to the Knights of Columbus had a postmark from California. Both organizations were heavy backers of Proposition 8. The FBI has determined the substances were not biological agents, and FBI spokesman Special Agent Juan Becerra stated, \\"We've got to follow the evidence, and at this point we have not received anything that would lead us to believe the opponents of Prop. 8 are behind any kind of terroristic activity. It would be irresponsible to say that at this point.\\" (Anthrax toxin was used in the 2001 anthrax attacks against lawmakers and media members, killing five people. Since then, the FBI has investigated more than 1,000 anthrax hoaxes modeled on the mailings, which usually turn out to be harmless.Anthrax hoaxes pile up, as does their cost By Bob Drogin, Los Angeles Times, March 8, 2009.) The LDS Church blamed opponents of the marriage ban for sending the hoax mailings. LGBT rights groups, such as Equality Utah and Equality California, have spoken out against the use of violence in protests, and note that the source of the \\"white powder\\" mailings has not been determined. ==See also== * Americans United for Separation of Church and State * Californians Against Hate * Join the Impact * November 15, 2008 anti- Proposition 8 protests * Separation of church and state in the United States ==References Category:2008 California Proposition 8 Category:2008 protests Category:Boycotts Category:Criticism of Mormonism Category:Latter Day Saint movement in California Category:Political controversies in the United States Category:Protests in California ","title":"Protests against Proposition 8 supporters"},{"id":"20417071","text":"Interior, September 2007 The Leopold Cafe and Bar is a large and extremely popular restaurant and bar Boozy and Raucous, a Cafe Defies Terror, THOMAS FULLER, New York Times, DEC. 14, 2008 on Colaba Causeway, in Colaba area of Mumbai, India, located across from the Colaba Police station.

During the 1970s the store became the center of the neighborhood's growing gay community, as well as campaign headquarters for Milk's various campaigns for elected office. ==History== Harvey Milk, here with his sister-in-law in front of Castro Camera in 1973 Milk, an avid amateur photographer, was disappointed over a developer ruining a roll of film. With his then-partner, Scott Smith, Milk opened the store in 1972, using the last $1,000 of their savings. The store soon became a focus of the growing influx of young gay people, who were coming from across the US to the Castro, where their sexual orientation was accepted. Beyond selling cameras and film, Milk turned the store into a social center, and a refuge for new arrivals. He also made it an official polling station for San Francisco elections. Because he was so well known for his civic involvement promoting gay businesses and gay consumers, Milk soon became known unofficially as the \\"Mayor of Castro Street\\". Daniel Nicoletta, the photographer best known for chronicling Milk and his times, first met Milk as a patron of the store, then later worked there as a store assistant and campaign worker. Another customer, Anne Kronenberg, who later became Milk's campaign manager, also met Milk at the store, and described her first impression of him as a \\"raving maniac\\". Other members of Milk's inner circle such as Cleve Jones and his speechwriter Frank Robinson met, befriended, and worked with Milk at the store. ==Post-closure== Milk The location at 575 Castro Street, a Human Rights Campaign Store as of 2011, was recreated as a set for Milk, the biopic of Milk's life. The sparse set, carefully built to original detail including an old red couch and barber's chair, drew the attention of many local residents who remembered the original. The modern-day shop owner and film crew also described seeing a ghost at the store, whom they assumed to be Milk. A memorial plaque outside of the former Castro Camera store A metal plaque set into the sidewalk in front of the store memorializes Milk, and the location has been used as the stepping-off point for an annual memorial march on the date of his death. Artifacts from Castro Camera, including Milk's barber chair, a collection of antique cameras that was displayed at the store and the front panel of the awning bearing the name of the shop, are preserved in the holdings of the GLBT Historical Society, a museum, archives and research center in San Francisco. The society displayed the camera collection in an exhibition it devoted to Milk in 2003, \\"Saint Harvey: The Life and Afterlife of a Modern Gay Martyr.\\" In addition, the art director for Milk consulted the collection when creating props for the Castro Camera set.Koskovich, Gérard (2009-03-02). \\"A quoi sert un centre d'archives?

It is emblazoned with a bear on the civil flag, while it bears the coat of arms of Berlin on the state flag. The civil flag of West Berlin was adopted on 26 May 1954. Designed by Ottfried Neubecker, it came in second in the contest of 1952, the winner being rejected by the Senate. The bear is placed slightly off-center toward the left. A bear occurs on seals, coins and signet rings from as early as the late 12th century (but not as heraldic charge before 1709), presumably due to a canting association with the city's name.Konrad Berlin, \\"Berliner Bär und Mäuseturm\\", Muttersprache 1958, pp. 271-273. The name Berlin is of Slavic origin and unrelated to the word bear, but the area was settled by German speakers from as early as the 12th century. Reinhard E. Fischer: Die Ortsnamen der Länder Brandenburg und Berlin. Alter – Herkunft – Bedeutung. be.bra wissenschaft verlag, Berlin-Brandenburg 2005, , S. 25. The state flag replaces the bear with the full coat of arms, with the bear inside the escutcheon. Being the state flag for West Berlin, it became the flag of the entire city after the reunification of Germany in 1990. Prior to that, it had also been the naval ensign as no other existing flag could be used. The proportions of the flag are 3:5. ==Historical flags== Between 1618 and 1861 a bicolor of black over white was used as both a civil and state flag, under Brandenburg and successive Prussian rules. Between 1861 and 1912, a horizontal triband (\\"tricolor\\") of black, red, and white was used in the proportions of 2:3. It was designed by Ernst Fidicin based on the colors of Brandenburg following the coronation of Wilhelm I on 19 December 1861. Between 1913 and 1954, the civil flag was similar to the current one, except the design of the bear was different. Until 1935, the emblem itself was not established. From 1955 on, East Berlin had the addition of two white stripes taking the outside halves of the upper and lower red stripes, and a slightly different design for the bear inside an escutcheon, topped with a crown. The East Berlin flag was therefore a slightly modified version of the old state flag, with the civil flag being deliberately avoided in East Berlin—and conversely, adopted as official in West Berlin—due to the bear in the civil flag being off-center to the left and facing left, strongly suggesting an orientation toward the West. The West Berlin flag was adopted for all of Berlin after 1990. ==See also== * Berolina, personification of Berlin ==References== Berlin Berlin Category:Culture in Berlin Category:History of Berlin Category:Bears in art Berlin ","title":"Flag of Berlin"},{"id":"20417164","text":"Alexandru Hâjdeu (Алекса́ндр Фадде́евич Хижде́у, 30 November 1811 – 9 November 1872) was a Russian writer of Romanian origin, who lived in Bessarabia (Russian Empire). He was the father of Romanian writer and philologist Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu. Alexandru Hâjdeu was one of the founding members of the Romanian Academy. ==Education== He studied at the Theological Seminary in Chișinău, then at the Law School of the University of Kharkov. In 1830, the first philosophical writings of Alexandru Hajduu - About the Divine Poetry Quality and About the Purpose of Philosophy - are published in the Moscow magazine \\"Vestnik Evropa\\". In 1836, he married Elisaveta Dauksz. In the same year he became an ephor of the schools in Hotin County. In 1838 his son Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu was born. On June 24, 1840, he held a famous speech in front of the graduates and pedagogical staff of the county school in Hotin - The souvenirs from the past, which is the present and shows the future of Moldova, translated immediately in Romanian by Constantin Stamati. In 1842, he was \\"forced” to resign from the ephor position of the schools in the Hotin County. Then, he was employed as a teacher of French language and mathematics at the boys' school in Vinnytsia. In this period he wrote the study \\"The Problem of Our Time\\" which will be translated and published in Bucharest only in 1938. In 1860, in \\"History and Literature Note\\" appears his work Notiţă (\\"Note\\") on the work of Kantemir Voievod. In 1866, he was elected as founder member of the Romanian Philological Society. ==The Bessarabian School== Hâjdeu made an important contribution to the unification of the Romanian Principalities, especially, through his speeches held in 1837 and 1840. His speech held in 1837 and then, published in 1838 in Brașov and in 1839 in Bucharest, was the cornerstone of the unification of the Romanian Principalities on January 24, 1859. By the letter Epistle to the Romanians (Published on January 2, 1859), Hâjdeu defines the key element of \\"Romanian Messianism\\", also called the \\"Bessarabian School\\", by which he proves the intelligent implication (and often decisive, as in 1918) of the Basarabians in unification process of the Romanian nation. ==Gallery== Image:Alexandru Hâjdeu 2.jpg Image:Alexandru Hâjdeu bust.jpgAlley of Classics, Chişinău Category:Romanian people of Moldovan descent Category:1811 births Category:1872 deaths Category:People from Shumsk Raion Category:Russian writers Category:Moldovan writers Category:Moldovan male writers Category:Romanian writers Category:Founding members of the Romanian Academy Category:Romanian academics Category:National University of Kharkiv alumni ","title":"Alexandru Hâjdeu"},{"id":"20417182","text":"The World in Winter (US title The Long Winter) is a 1962 post-apocalyptic science fiction novel by British writer John Christopher. It deals with a new ice age caused by a reduction in the output of the Sun. ==Plot summary== The story involves a new ice age hitting Europe, British refugees fleeing to Nigeria, and what a later group find when they return. As the story opens, Andrew Leedon, a London-based television documentary producer, is given a new story to research: an Italian scientist, Fratellini, has proposed an imminent fall in solar radiation for the forthcoming few years which may lead to harsher winters. Leedon meets with David Cartwell, a Home Office civil servant and useful source, to see if he can find out more. Cartwell quickly becomes a close friend of Leedon, but also begins an affair with Leedon's wife, Carol. The winter of that year is, as predicted, long and harsh, but by January is it becoming clear to insiders that the solar downturn is worse than Fratellini had calculated and no upturn is in sight. By March, food stocks are becoming dangerously low, rationing has been imposed and the Government imposes martial law. Those in the know, including Andrew's estranged wife, sell up and move south to the tropics and countries such as Nigeria. Leedon stays behind, as inner London is finally cordoned off from the rest of the UK to protect the seat of power – an area called the London Pale – as the rest of the country is abandoned to starvation and barbarism. Finally Leedon is persuaded both by Carol and by David Cartwell to exit the country while safe passage is still possible. Taking with him Cartwell's wife Madeleine, he moves to Lagos in Nigeria, finding that the tables have now turned – white refugees fleeing from the ice-bound northern countries are living in slums, unemployed or with only menial jobs, and penniless, as African governments have withdrawn recognition of currencies such as Sterling and no longer recognize the British Government, with reason, as it no longer exercises sovereignty over its own land. A ray of hope arrives for Leedon as Abonitu, a young Nigerian whom Leedon had treated with kindness and generosity one evening in London, finds him and in turn helps him and Madeleine out of the slum. Abonitu plans a reconnaissance expedition back to Britain.

The streetcars are the first to run in the District of Columbia since the dismantling of the previous streetcar system in 1962. The District of Columbia began laying track in 2009, for two lines whose locations in Anacostia and Benning were chosen to revitalize blighted commercial corridors. The system is owned by the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT); the RATP Group, a French transportation company, has been chosen as the initial operators. The system's H Street/Benning Road Line began public service on February 27, 2016. ==DevelopmentFirst iteration of streetcars=== Between 1862 and 1962, streetcars in Washington, D.C., were a common mode of transportation, but the system was dismantled in the early 1960s as part of a switch to bus service. ===Second iteration of streetcars=== In the late 1990s, Metro began considering a series of rapid bus, light rail, and streetcar projects throughout the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region as a means of providing intra-city and intra-regional mass transit and to meet the transit needs of the quickly growing population of the area. The first project was proposed for Alexandria, Virginia, in 1999. In January 2002, District of Columbia officials began studying the economic feasibility and costs of constructing a long system of streetcars throughout the city. The project received Metro's backing. DDOT studied the feasibility of both a citywide system and one or more \\"starter\\" lines. D.C. Council Member David Catania specifically requested that DDOT study adding streetcars in the Anacostia neighborhood. First line proposal DDOT issued a favorable report, and the D.C. Council approved an expenditure of $310 million for the streetcar project in September 2002. The first line to be built would be a \\"starter\\" streetcar line in Anacostia. The goal of the project was to bring light rail to Anacostia first (rather than last, as had happened with Metrorail), and to provide a speedier, more cost-effective way to link the neighborhood with the rest of the city. Initially, the line was planned to run along the abandoned CSX railway tracks (known as the Shepherd Industrial Spur) from the Minnesota Avenue Metro station to the Anacostia Metro station, then cross the 11th Street Bridges before connecting with the and Metro stations. DDOT originally planned to purchase diesel multiple unit cars (self-propelled rail cars powered by diesel engines) from Colorado Railcar. Layton Lyndsey, reporting in The Washington Post, asserted the cars would be the first of their kind to be built in the United States and approved by the Federal Railroad Administration. Financial problems Financing for the plan proved problematic. In November 2002, the same month that the D.C. government agreed to co-fund the streetcar project, Metro formally changed its strategic plan and proposed spending $12 billion over 10 years on rapid bus, light rail, and streetcar projects throughout the D.C. area.The change included the abandonment of previously-adopted plans to build several new heavy-rail Metrorail lines throughout the region. See: Layton, Lyndsey. \\"$12 Billion Metro Plan Has Trolleys, Rapid Buses.\\" Washington Post. September 13, 2002. Metro proposed allocating half the total amount to build the D.C. streetcar line, complete the Silver Line, build a streetcar line on Columbia Pike in Arlington County in Virginia, and build a Purple Line light rail link between Bethesda and New Carrollton in Maryland. However, state and local governments said they were unable to fund Metro's proposal, and the planned projects died. The District of Columbia subsequently decided to build the initial components of the DC Streetcar system on its own. The Anacostia line was scaled back to a demonstration project just in length with only four stations: Bolling Air Force Base, the Anacostia Metro station, the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE and Good Hope Road SE, and the Minnesota Avenue Metro station. DDOT began an environmental assessment of the CSX tracks in July 2003. In September 2004, Metro agreed to move ahead with the project (whose $45 million cost was now being funded completely by the District of Columbia), with construction to start in November 2004 and end in 2006.Smith, Candace. \\"Light Rail Closer to Coming to Anacostia.\\" Associated Press.

September 16, 2004; Lively, Tarron. \\"Metro Approves Subsidy Increase.\\" Washington Times. September 17, 2004. Circulator oversight In December 2009, D.C. Councilmember Jim Graham proposed establishing a D.C. Transit Board to oversee the DC Circulator bus system as well as the DC Streetcar system. The board would oversee the establishment of routes and transit fares. In order to determine whether the local business community would support the streetcar project, several local real estate and commercial developers visited the Portland Streetcar system which operates in Portland, Oregon. The goal of the trip was to investigate whether streetcars had the intended positive economic consequences and whether the return on investment seemed worthwhile. Local media reports indicated that the D.C. developers were impressed by the effect streetcars had on Portland's economic development. 2011 announcement and more delays On August 22, 2011, DDOT announced the first streetcars would roll on the H Street line in the summer of 2013.Halsey III, Ashley. \\"D.C. Wants Streetcars to Roll By Mid-2013.' Washington Post. August 22, 2010. Accessed 2011-08-23. In April 2014, DDOT estimated that the H Street Line would open in the fall of 2014. A temporary car barn at the former Spingarn High School was scheduled for completion in July. Testing of the system would take several weeks, and then the system would need to be certified for operation by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), which would take another 60 to 80 days. DDOT also said it needed to take delivery of a sixth streetcar, likely in June, before any testing could begin.Neibauer, Michael. \\"On D.C. Streetcar: Possible Fare, Barry's Angst, National Harbor's Joy and More on the Launch Date.\\" Washington Business Journal. April 30, 2014. Accessed 2014-04-30. With a decision on the fare structure still months off, Council Member Marion Barry threatened to cancel all funding for all planned DC Streetcar lines. Barry argued that the rider subsidy was too high and that the $800 million planned for construction of the remaining lines could be better used for road maintenance and school construction. ==Rolling stockCurrent railcar fleet=== A United Streetcar-built streetcar to be used on the DC Streetcar system being tested along H Street NE in December 2014\\\\.

The second set of streetcars, initially numbered 13-001 through 13-003 (subsequently renumbered 201–203), were built in the U.S. in 2013 by United Streetcar, of Oregon, based on a Skoda design (model Skoda 10T) that was originally developed jointly by Inekon and Skoda, and the shared design history explains the similarity between the two designs. They are United Streetcar model 100. The first United car was delivered to DC Streetcar in January 2014 and the third and last in June 2014.Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, July 2014, p. 305. Visually, the United units differ from the Inekon cars in appearance with different fiberglass driver compartments, and cowling, but the overall dimensions are identical.

Cancels Proposed Streetcar Deal.\\" Washington Business Journal. January 11, 2012. Accessed 2012-04-02.DeBonis, Mike. \\"How Many Streetcars Will H Street Get?\\" Washington Post. February 23, 2012. Accessed 2012-04-02. D.C. City Council member Mary Cheh, chair of the council's transportation committee, said the DDOT's management of the streetcar project had lost the confidence of the public and that she would seek legislation establishing an independent authority to run the system. A new contract was awarded to United Streetcar in April 2012, for two streetcars, and the order was expanded to three cars in August 2012. ==LinesH Street NE/Benning Road Line=== Construction of the H Street NE/Benning Road Line in October 2009 In 2003, then-Mayor Anthony A. Williams unveiled a draft Strategic Development Plan which proposed redeveloping and revitalizing six blighted areas of the city, including H Street NE and Benning Road.Wilgoren, Debbi. \\"New Residences, Stores To Transform H Street.\\" Washington Post. March 13, 2003. Among the proposals to revitalize H Street was the construction of a streetcar line to downtown D.C. in five to 10 years. On January 20, 2006, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation announced that it would build a $13 million streetcar line on H Street NE, from Union Station to Benning Road and the Minnesota Avenue Metro station as part of its Great Streets initiative,Schwartzman, Paul. \\"Turning Northeast's H Street Into Main Street.\\" Washington Post. February 9, 2006. on much of the same route established by the Columbia Railway Company in 1870. By 2008, the extension to the Minnesota Avenue Metro station had been dropped. Streetcar tracks were installed on H Street as part of the H Street/Benning Road Great Streets project that was started in December 2007 and ended on June 30, 2011. DC Streetcar at Union Station stop at the end of the H Street NE line. In late August 2011, DDOT announced the H Street Line would begin operation in the summer of 2013. City officials said all platform stops had been constructed along the route, but overhead electricity lines, turnarounds at each end of the line, a streetcar overnight holding facility (\\"car barn\\"), maintenance facility, and three power substations remained to be built. On December 17, 2012, DC Streetcar officials said only 20 percent of the H Street line remained to be completed, and that they anticipated streetcars to be rolling in October 2013. Testing on the H Street-Benning Road Line began in August 2014, with a planned opening date for the line in late 2014. After more delays, the line had been tentatively projected to open in January 2015, but on January 16 the DDOT's director Leif Dormsjo announced that the Department would no longer issue any estimates for an opening date and that he intended to reorganize the project's management team. On February 21, 2015, a brief flash fire was ignited on the top of a streetcar in simulated service.The D.C. Streetcar's Latest Problem: Catching on Fire In early March 2015, DDOT suggested that the project may be scrapped entirely, if an outside review being conducted by the American Public Transportation Association found \\"fatal flaws\\", but the findings, released on March 16, found no \\"fatal flaws\\" in the project. Dan Mauloff, a writer for the Greater Greater Washington website, reported on July 10, 2015, that a review prepared for the DDOT had identified 33 causes for continued delay in rolling out fare service. He said that none of the reported causes for delay were considered \\"fatal\\", but the DDOT had not yet responded to the report with a prediction as to when all the problems would be attended to. The DC Streetcar's H Street/Benning line eventually began public service operations on February 27, 2016. ===Anacostia Line=== Interior of a DC Streetcar vehicle constructed in 2006–7 for use on the Anacostia line.

However, 10 months into the project, DDOT and Metro temporarily mothballed the streetcar line. Two days after the groundbreaking, CSX announced it would abandon the railway track but refuse to allow the city to use it for the streetcar project.\\"Exile to Main Street.\\" Washington City Paper. November 25, 2005.

Shifts Light-Rail Plan From Waterfront to Streets in SE.\\" Washington Post. April 28, 2005. The city was unwilling to build the project on the CSX tracks, only to have the other owners demand payment in the future. CSX disputed these claims, saying that it had the legal right to lease the tracks and land in perpetuity to the city for $16 million. Subsequently, DDOT announced that the streetcars would run on city streets instead of heavy railroad track, angering local residents who said the streetcars would worsen traffic congestion, eliminate parking, and reduce bus service. DDOT and Metro announced in April 2006 that work on the revised streetcar line in Anacostia would start again in a few months.Gowen, Annie. \\"Fairfax Board on Track To Consider Streetcars.\\" Washington Post.

Although $25 million had been spent over the past two years, rails at the intersection of Firth Stirling Avenue SE and Suitland Parkway were buried under asphalt and weeds grew among the rails at South Capitol Street and Bolling Air Force Base. In 2014, DDOT said it was planning to spend $64 million to begin construction on the Anacostia Line Extension from the Anacostia Metro station to the 11th Street Bridges. The agency said it would also spend another $16 million to acquire the right-of-way currently owned by railroad company CSX Transportation and $15 million to build a car barn for the line extension. DDOT applied for a $20 million National Infrastructure Investments — Consolidated Appropriations Act grant to assist it in building the extension. ===Proposed lines=== In October 2010, D.C. officials unveiled tentative plans to build a streetcar line up Georgia Avenue. The city began holding public hearings on construction of the line ahead of schedule, due to the imminent 2011 closing of Walter Reed Army Medical Center.O'Connell, Jonathan. \\"D.C. to Unveil Plans for Redevelopment of Walter Reed.\\" Washington Post. October 14, 2010. The streetcar line was part of a proposed $500 million, mixed-use housing, office, and retail development that would begin construction in 2013. D.C. officials moved up hearings on (and potential construction of) the Georgia Avenue Line because the redevelopment of the Walter Reed site would be heavily dependent on the streetcar reaching the area by the time the new homes and businesses opened. In March 2011, the Washington Business Journal said that the city's reuse plan for its portion of the Walter Reed Campus included a retail hub serviced by a streetcar line.Neibauer, Michael. \\"Feds Give District Better Acreage for Walter Reed Redevelopment.\\" Washington Business Journal. March 25, 2011. In January 2010, the Washington Post reported that the K Street Line would probably be the third line to be constructed.Smith, Will and Wellborn, Mark. \\"From Seedy to Sought-After: D.C.'s Mount Vernon Triangle Becoming Urban Village.\\" Washington Post. January 30, 2010. The K Street Line would extend from Union Station to K Street NE, then run west to 26th Street NW. It would link with the H Street/Benning Road Line at Union Station via a pedestrian bridge which would require passengers to alight at Union Station and board an unconnected line. The two lines would thus form a cross-city streetcar line, although not directly. DDOT officials confirmed in August 2011 that linking to the H Street Line was still the option. To help move the K Street line forward, the Downtown D.C. Business Improvement District (Downtown BID) proposed in March 2012 to fund a plan that would lay out how K Street should be reconfigured for streetcars, and how a K Street streetcar line would be planned, constructed, maintained, and serviced. The board of directors of the Downtown BID proposed a self-imposed $258 million tax on hotels and commercial property within the district to fund BID projects, which included the streetcar design proposal.Neibauer, Michael. \\"Proposed Hike in Downtown D.C. BID Tax Rate Will Fund 100-Item To-Do List.\\" Washington Business Journal. March 22, 2012. It is included in the Constrained Long-Range Transportation Plan. Another streetcar line was proposed for Maine Avenue SW. In October 2010, the D.C. government unveiled its long-awaited, $1.5 billion development proposal for the city's southwest waterfront district.Kravitz, Derek. \\"Southwest D.C.

He supported Islamic revolution and after its victory, served and helped safeguarding it. He was engaged in many operations during the war, namely Dawn 8, in which he captured troops of Saddam's Republican Guard in al-Faw Peninsula; and in Operation Karbala-5 as the commander of the vanguard forces. Kharrazi was killed by shrapnel from a mortar bomb during Operation Karbala-5. ==History== During his adolescence he was interested in religious publications. Kharrazi participated in religious congregations and learning theological subjects. His curiosity toward religious matters increased during the campaigns against the Pahlavis and he became more aware of the contemporary political circumstances. While performing his military service, Kharrazi was sent to Dhofar. He deserted the armed forces finally in 1978, according to the direction of Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the revolutionaries. ==Iran–Iraq War== His first considerable command was in Darkhovin region close to Abadan–Ahvaz road, known as \\"The Lion Frontier\\". In the battle, the Iranian troops resisted Saddam's army for 9 months. He became the commander of Darkhovin front. Kharrazi served actively in freeing Bostan afterwards. Following Operation Tarigh ol-Qods, Imam Hussein Brigade was established which soon was reorganized to a division with Kharrazi being appointed as the Major General. His troops participated in the operations Fath-ol-Mobeen and Beit ol-Moqaddas (which liberated Khorramshahr). In the later operation, his division was among the first which passed Karun river and reached Ahvaz–Khorramshahr road. As a commander he was also involved in other operations like Ramadan, Before the Dawn, Dawn 4; and Khaibar during which he lost an arm. He often reconnoitered combatant's territories himself. In Operation Dawn 8, his troops managed to defeat Saddam's Republican Guard and had victories in Al-Faw Peninsula and around \\"Salt Factory\\". During Operation Karbala-5, Kharrazi's division was the spearhead and succeeded to pass arched embankments of the combatant army. He was incredibly popular among Iranian fighters. \\"Karbala-5\\" was his last operation. Under the heavy artillery bombardment of Saddam's forces, food supplies became critical. He took the direct responsibility of providing food. Kharrazi was a staunch adherent of Islam and the ideals of the Islamic revolution of Iran. However, senior commanders criticized him for taking towns in excess of their requests and on his own initiative. Kharrazi believed that the Iran–Iraq War could have been over in a week, had he not been held back by the Iranian command. He was killed in action by shrapnel from a mortar bomb during battle in Operation Karbala-5 in 1987. ==See also== * List of Iranian commanders in the Iran–Iraq War * Military of Iran * Basij ==References== * The official site of Holy defense - Iraq-Iran War 1980-1988 Category:1957 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Iranian military commanders Category:Iranian military personnel killed in the Iran–Iraq War Category:Recipients of the Order of Fath Category:People from Isfahan Category:Iranian military personnel posthumously promoted to the rank of major general Category:Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel of the Iran–Iraq War ","title":"Hossein Kharrazi"},{"id":"20417283","text":"Ayden-Grifton High School is a high school in Pitt County, North Carolina, United States.

He is also credited with forming the first professional string quartet in Sarajevo. Unfortunately, he died when Pap was only 14. Her mother is the Serbian-Montenegran pianist Angelina Bojovic, who still teaches at the Music Academy in Sarajevo. Her many talented pupils from around the world include the pianists M. Karacic (USA), B. Hrovat (Canada), M. Olenjuk (Germany)and S. Kulenovic (Slovenia). Her uncle is a violinist and conductor in Luxembourg and her cousin the Serbian percussionist A. Radulovic. By the age of 10 Pap could play works by nearly all the leading composers and gave her first public recital when she was just 14. The Boznian-Herzgovinian authorities awarded her a scholarship to the faculty of music at Belgrade University in 1991, when she came first in the entrance exams that year at the age of 17. While there, she won numerous prizes and competitions, notably the Olga Mihajlovic Prize for best pianist in the university and the Radmila Djordjevic Prize for best piano accompanist. She also won several competitions and prizes during this time, of which the Petar Konjovic Prize pleased her most. Pap was fortunate to study under a series of leading pianists and teachers, including A.Valdma, N. LJ. Starkman, S. Bogino, V. Ogarkov, S. Dorensky, L. Istvan, I. Khudolei, Y. Kot, I. Alekseyhuk, R. Kehrer, D. Anderson, P. Scheyder, L. Pogorelich and D. Protopopescu. This led to her being given a teaching post at the university at the age of 21, and in 1997 she became a professor of music there, specialising in piano, chamber music and accompaniment. By 2000 she also held a professorship at the Sarajevo Music Academy. The major Russian piano composers feature strongly in her performing repertoire, especially Mussorgsky, Scriabin, Rachmaninov and Prokofiev. Indeed, in 2003 at the meeting of the EPTA (European piano teachers association) she was invited to play Rachmaninov's second concerto with the Belgrade Symphony Orchestra. This led to a scholarship offer at the Luxembourg Conservatoire for one year which she took up and during which she was awarded the \\" Victor Fenigstein \\" prize for outstanding talent. She graduated there with a Diplôme Supérieur de Piano studying under professor S. Bausch and gained first prize for harmony, counterpoint, fugue and composition under professor A. Mullenbach. By this time Pap Pap was playing in several European countries, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Macedonia, Hungary, Luxembourg and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In most of these she was in great demand at music festivals. But her musical talents did not stop with the piano. Her mastery of accompaniment led her to be invited to join the Sarajevo Opera as a voice and lyric coach, in which role she helped in productions of Die Fledermaus, Rigoletto,and La Bohème as well as some Slavonic operas. As her reputation grew, Pap served as head of the piano department at the Sarajevo Music Academy (2005/06) and was given a visiting professorship at Sarajevo University in 2006. She accepted in 2007 to be in charge of European reform of education in her university (Bologna Process). Since September 2008 she has lived in France sharing her time between Nantes and Paris . In the former city she has already built a reputation as a teacher and vocal accompanist while also giving recitals. In Paris her work has centred round her ambition to study the work and set up of the world-famous Paris Conservatoire with the hope of one day establishing a similar institution in Sarajevo. French musicians and musicologists have received her enthusiastically and admire her plans. However, like so many Yugoslavians born before the Balkan conflicts of the last decade, her career has been hampered and her life scarred by the misfortunes of war. For four years when she was in Belgrade she never set eyes on her mother and was basically a stateless person with no passport who could not travel anywhere. These were the years when most young virtuosi would be making their mark on the world stage. In addition this experience made her very sympathetic to ethnic minorities suffering from persecution as her own family came from several different ethnic groups. In 1998 she even tried, with help from UNESCO, to start a project called \\"Music without Frontiers\\" to unite the Balkan peoples, but so far it has proved politically impractical. However it is still an ambition she wants to fulfill someday. Pap's extensive repertoire, superb technique and deep knowledge of music have at last brought her to the attention of a much wider audience, and it is to be hoped that she will soon take her rightful place in the modern world of classical music as one of the greatest pianists of her generation. The recent uploading on YouTube of her recital of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition has caused many music critics to start asking who she is and where such a talent has been hiding for so long. ==References * Site officiel de Milica Pap * Official Website of Milica Pap * Fan-club Facebook * Profil Facebook Category:University of Belgrade faculty Category:Croatian classical pianists Category:Serbian classical pianists Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina classical pianists Category:Women classical pianists Category:21st-century classical pianists ","title":"Milica Pap"},{"id":"20417301","text":"Transmission of M47 Patton II, probably CD-850-4 A cross-drive steering transmission is a transmission which is used in tracked vehicles to allow precise and energy efficient steering. It consists of the following main parts: * Two identical single-stage planetary gearings * a differential * a hydraulic pump connected to the engine (similar to an oil pump of cars) * a hydraulic motor powered by the hydraulic pump * hydraulic control valves A steering transmission combines the two functions needed for a tracked vehicle transmission: a transmission to couple the relatively constant engine speed to varying road speeds and a steering gearbox to drive the two output shafts (and so the tracks) at different speeds, thus steering the vehicle. Cross-drive transmissions developed after WWII, at a time when tanks were growing larger and heavier. A growing problem with earlier gearboxes had been the amount of heat dissipated in the brakes used for steering. As tanks grew heavier, a more efficient system was required not just for efficiency (i.e. more available power from the same engine) but also to reduce the wasted power having to be disposed of through heat and wear in the steering brakes. Cross-drive transmissions were developed from the earlier controlled-differential steering gearboxes. Their innovation was to cross-couple the two sides, so that excess power from the slow side of the gearbox could be supplied to the faster side. This reduced the power to be dissipated by braking and it increased the power available to drive the fast track. Implementing this was difficult for most transmissions as it required a varying gear ratio between the sides. Most gearboxes simply offered a single ratio, through fixed gears and clutches, which restricted steering to a single radius. The particular innovation of the cross-drive, over earlier attempts, was to use a torque converter in the cross shaft. This allowed a continuously variable ratio between the two sides and so more precise steering. Torque converters are also easier to make for the high torques required in tank design, saving weight and cost. Cross-drive transmissions also improved the drivability of the manual transmissions then in use. Manual transmissions were heavy and tiring to drive, requiring skill and strength from the driver, and also frequent adjustments as the clutch plates wore. The pre-selector gearbox had been used to simplify the driving task, but at the cost of mechanical complexity. The cross-drive transmissions offered a mechanically-actuated self-changing gearbox, where the ratio selection could be either manual, automatic, or by pre-selection. The control input for steering also became lighter, allowing the use of a single hand- controlled joystick or 'wobble stick', as used for the CD-850-1 transmission in the T44 Cargo Tractor of 1950. The construction of these transmissions also integrated the transmission and steering gearbox functions into a single casing. This gave reduced overall weight and volume, and reduced servicing times. A related development at this time was the 'power pack' concept, where engine and transmission could be removed as a single unit. As size and complexity increased, fitter time became short but mechanical handling through mobile cranes became available in the field. It was now quicker and simpler to exchange one large unit than to dismantle and re-assemble more connections to remove a smaller component. == X1100 == A later design of cross-drive transmission, the Allison X1100, was used in the 1970s experimental US MBT-70 and XM1 tanks, then later adopted in the M1 Abrams. This adopts a different principle for the steering cross-coupling: instead of a hydro-dynamic torque converter, it uses a hydrostatic combination of a hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor. The X1100 was designed as a modular system, allowing its easy adaption to vehicles with different power plants, ranging from diesels to gas turbines. The central module is matched to the engine driving it, the outer steering modules to the weight and speed of the vehicle. == References == Category:Automotive transmission technologies Category:Automotive steering technologies ","title":"Cross-drive steering transmission"},{"id":"20417321","text":"Licauquén River a short river or riachuelo south of Lebu and west of Cañete.

Before Pappochelys was discovered and Eunotosaurus was redescribed, Odontochelys was considered the oldest undisputed member of Pantestudines (i.e. a stem-turtle). It is the only known species in the genus Odontochelys and the family Odontochelyidae. ==Discovery== Odontochelys semitestacea was first described from three 220-million-year-old specimens excavated in Triassic deposits in Guizhou, China. The locale of its discovery at one time was the Nanpanjiang Trough basin, a shallow marine environment surrounded on three sides by land. These deposits preserve an ecosystem known as the Guanling biota, which was dominated by marine reptiles. ==Description== Life reconstruction as a marine reptile, a controversial ecological hypothesis Odontochelys differed grossly from modern turtles. Modern turtles have a horny beak without teeth in their mouth. In contrast, Odontochelys fossils were found to have had teeth embedded in their upper and lower jaws. One of the most striking features of turtles, both modern and prehistoric alike, are their dorsal shells, forming an armored carapace over the body of the animal. Odontochelys only possessed the bottom portion of a turtle's armor, the plastron. It did not yet have a solid carapace as most other turtles do. Instead of a solid carapace, Odontochelys possessed broadened ribs like those of modern turtle embryos that still have not started developing the ossified plates of a carapace. Aside from the presence of teeth and the absence of a solid carapace, a few other skeletal traits distinguish Odontochelys as basal compared to other turtles, extant and otherwise. The point of articulation between the dorsal ribs and the vertebrae is decidedly different in Odontochelys than in later turtles. In a comparison of skull proportions, the skull of Odontochelys is far more elongated pre- orbitally (in front of the eyes) compared to other turtles. The tail of the prehistoric turtle was longer in proportion to its body than other turtles. In addition, the transverse processes found in the tail are not fused such as in later turtles. Also, the scapulae of the examined specimens were identified to lack acromion processes. Taken together, these anatomical differences have been interpreted by the discoverers to mean that Odontochelys has some of the most primitive features ever seen in a turtle and is somewhat of a transitional fossil. Evidence that the plastron evolved before the carapace, as indicated by the lack of carapace in Odontochelys semitestacea, is often viewed as an indication of the aquatic origin of turtles. The fossil was found in marine deposits, further supporting that the primitive turtle frequented shallow marine water. Since it is generally accepted that the shell arose to provide protection against predators, the semi-aquatic nature of turtles and the development of the plastron complement each other. Ancestral turtles with protection on their underside are more protected from predators that attack from below. Based on this interpretation, the development of the carapace was likely driven in a land animal. Reisz and Head (2008), however, have a different interpretation on the same specimen. Instead, they suggest that the carapace on O. semitestacea was in fact present; it just lacked ossification of some of its dermal components. With this interpretation, the authors suggest that either turtle shells originally evolved in aquatic environments, or this fossil represents the earliest turtle transferring from terrestrial environments to marine habitats. ==Paleoecology== Even though the Odontochelys specimens were found in marine deposits, there is uncertainty over whether it was a primarily aquatic reptile, in transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats, or fully terrestrial. Li et al. (2008) argued that Odontochelys lived in coastal or freshwater environments based on its hand proportions, which were similar to those of modern turtle species which lived in small, slow-moving bodies of water. Joyce (2015) supported a terrestrial origin for turtles based on his study of Eunotosaurus. His study noted that the hands of Odontochelys were not comparable to any modern turtles due to the retention of a plesiomorphic (\\"primitive\\") feature: four phalanges (finger bones) in the third and fourth fingers, rather than three. While the total relative finger lengths of Odontochelys do line up with those of semiaquatic freshwater turtles, the individual phalanges (finger bones) themselves were short and stout, much more similar to those of modern tortoises. Aquatic turtles achieved long hands by lengthening their phalanges, while Odontochelys retained long hands due to its plesiomorphic phalangeal count, similar to that of other reptiles (including terrestrial ones). In addition, Joyce (2015) argued that even if Odontochelys was semiaquatic, it probably would have avoided open marine waters due to a lack of efficient adaptations for swimming. On the other hand, a pathological study of Odontochelys performed by Rothschild & Naples (2015) discovered that both the left and right humeri (forearm bones) of the paratype specimen (IVPP 13240) of Odontochelys had been degraded near the shoulder sockets. The study rejected explanations such as weathering or a wound-induced bone infection, arguing that it would not have made sense for the shoulder area to degrade before the rest of the forelimbs, since the shoulder was more well-protected during life and after death. Instead, the study argued that decompression sickness was responsible for the injury. This condition has been observed in diving animals which are forced to make rapid ascents within a deep marine environment. Similar injuries have been reported in other fossilized marine reptiles, and their presence in Odontochelys supports the idea that it lived in an open marine environment. Modern sea turtles utilize behavioral tactics to avoid rapid ascension within water, which may also indicate that Odontochelys had not yet acquired the same behaviors to defend against decompression sickness. ==References *Figures and Tables from the above-referenced article An ancestral turtle from the Late Triassic of southwestern China in the journal Nature *Oldest Turtle Found; May Crack Shell-Evolution Mystery *First known turtle swam on the half shell Category:Triassic pantestudines Category:Prehistoric reptile genera Category:Triassic reptiles of Asia Category:Prehistoric animals of China Category:Triassic China Category:Fossils of China Category:Fossil taxa described in 2008 Category:Transitional fossils ","title":"Odontochelys"},{"id":"20417377","text":"As of 2009, the Netherlands is the country of birth to three astronauts, one of whom went to space as an American citizen.

A 2-split is shown: one partner receives the largest section, and the other receives the remaining two pieces. Necklace splitting is a picturesque name given to several related problems in combinatorics and measure theory. Its name and solutions are due to mathematicians Noga Alon and Douglas B. West. The basic setting involves a necklace with beads of different colors. The necklace should be divided between several partners, such that each partner receives the same amount of every color. Moreover, the number of cuts should be as small as possible (in order to waste as little as possible of the metal in the links between the beads). == Variants == The following variants of the problem have been solved in the original paper: #Discrete splitting: The necklace has k\\\\cdot n beads. The beads come in t different colors. There are k\\\\cdot a_i beads of each color i, where a_i is a positive integer. Partition the necklace into k parts (not necessarily contiguous), each of which has exactly a_i beads of color i. Use at most (k-1)t cuts. Note that if the beads of each color are contiguous on the necklace, then at least k-1 cuts must be done inside each color, so (k-1)t is optimal. #Continuous splitting: The necklace is the real interval [0,k\\\\cdot n]. Each point of the interval is colored in one of t different colors. For every color i, the set of points colored by i is Lebesgue-measurable and has length k\\\\cdot a_i, where a_i is a non-negative real number. Partition the interval to k parts (not necessarily contiguous), such that in each part, the total length of color i is exactly a_i. Use at most (k-1)t cuts. #Measure splitting: The necklace is a real interval. There are t different measures on the interval, all absolutely continuous with respect to length. The measure of the entire necklace, according to measure i, is k\\\\cdot a_i. Partition the interval to k parts (not necessarily contiguous), such that the measure of each part, according to measure i, is exactly a_i. Use at most (k-1)t cuts. This is a generalization of the Hobby–Rice theorem, and it is used to get an exact division of a cake. Each problem can be solved by the next problem: * Discrete splitting can be solved by continuous splitting, since a discrete necklace can be converted to a coloring of the real interval [0,k\\\\cdot n] in which each interval of length 1 is colored by the color of the corresponding bead. In case the continuous splitting tries to cut inside beads, the cuts can be slid gradually such that they are made only between beads. * Continuous splitting can be solved by measure splitting, since a coloring of an interval in t colors can be converted to a set t measures, such that measure i measures the total length of color i. The opposite is also true: measure splitting can be solved by continuous splitting, using a more sophisticated reduction. ==Proof== The case k=2 can be proved by the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. When k is an odd prime number, the proof involves a generalization of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. When k is a composite number, the proof is as follows (demonstrated for the measure-splitting variant). Suppose k=p\\\\cdot q. There are t measures, each of which values the entire necklace as p\\\\cdot q\\\\cdot a_i. Using (p-1)\\\\cdot t cuts, divide the necklace to p parts such that measure i of each part is exactly q\\\\cdot a_i. Using (q-1)\\\\cdot t cuts, divide each part to q parts such that measure i of each part is exactly a_i. All in all, there are now p q parts such that measure i of each part is exactly a_i. The total number of cuts is (p-1)\\\\cdot t plus p (q-1)\\\\cdot t which is exactly (pq-1)\\\\cdot t. ==Further resultsOne cut fewer than needed=== In the case of two thieves [i.e. k = 2] and t colours, a fair split would require at most t cuts. If, however, only t − 1 cuts are available, Hungarian mathematician Gábor Simonyi shows that the two thieves can achieve an almost fair division in the following sense. If the necklace is arranged so that no t-split is possible, then for any two subsets D1 and D2 of { 1, 2, ..., t }, not both empty, such that D_1\\\\cap D_2=\\\\varnothing, a (t − 1)-split exists such that: * If colour i\\\\in D_1, then partition 1 has more beads of colour i than partition 2; * If colour i\\\\in D_2, then partition 2 has more beads of colour i than partition 1; * If colour i is in neither partition, both partitions have equally many beads of colour i. This means that if the thieves have preferences in the form of two \\"preference\\" sets D1 and D2, not both empty, there exists a (t − 1)-split so that thief 1 gets more beads of types in his preference set D1 than thief 2; thief 2 gets more beads of types in her preference set D2 than thief 1; and the rest are equal. Simonyi credits Gábor Tardos with noticing that the result above is a direct generalization of Alon's original necklace theorem in the case k = 2. Either the necklace has a (t − 1)-split, or it does not. If it does, there is nothing to prove. If it does not, we may add beads of a fictitious colour to the necklace, and make D1 consist of the fictitious colour and D2 empty. Then Simonyi's result shows that there is a t-split with equal numbers of each real colour. === Negative result === For every k\\\\geq 1 there is a measurable (k+3)-coloring of the real line such that no interval can be fairly split using at most k cuts. ===Splitting multidimensional necklaces=== The result can be generalized to n probability measures defined on a d dimensional cube with any combination of n(k − 1) hyperplanes parallel to the sides for k thieves. ===Approximation algorithm=== An approximation algorithm for splitting a necklace can be derived from an algorithm for consensus halving. == See also == * Combinatorial necklaces * Necklace problem * Exact division ==References== Category:Combinatorics on words Category:Discrete geometry Category:Fair division Category:Mathematical problems ==External links== * , an introductory video presenting the problem with its topological solution.

The album was released on April 7, 2009. Guilt garnered a mixed reception from critics, debuted at number 53 on the Billboard 200 and spawned two singles: \\"Move (If You Wanna)\\" and \\"Love Rollercoaster\\". The album sold 12,500 copies in the first week. ==Singles== The first single for the album is \\"Move (If You Wanna)\\".MIMS - Move (If You Wanna) - Listen Now Later, a video was shot for the single as a promotion for the album, revealing its title to be Guilt, and premiered February 14, 2009. Mims has stated that his song \\"Donkie Booty\\" featuring Trey Songz will not be on the album because it was leaked. Many other songs too leaked on Internet but it is not confirmed whether they were recorded for the album. The song \\"Rock 'N Rollin'\\", produced by Jim Jonsin and featuring rapper Tech N9ne, sees the two rappers incorporate the names of several notable rock bands into their lyrics. Jake Paine of HipHopDX made a comparison, based on the concept, to GZA's \\"Labels\\", which incorporated hip hop imprints into its lyrics in a similar fashion. The track \\"Love Rollercoaster\\" is also featured on Letoya Luckett's second album, Lady Love. ==Critical reception== Guilt received generally mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 49, based on 7 reviews. Rolling Stone editor Jody Rosen commented about the record: \\"Mims has good taste in beats. But this [album] seems just... superfluous. As for the single \\"Move (If You Wanna)\\": not \\"Hot.\\" AllMusic's David Jeffries found the highlights to be \\"empty-headed club tracks\\" that aren't prevalent throughout the track listing, concluding that \\"While Guilt may be a bad title for a pop-rap album so slick and shallow, the completely ludicrous I Am Hip Hop's Savior was the original plan, suggesting that this project was misguided since early development.\\" Andrew Rennie of NOW noted how throughout the album, Mims borrows styles from fellow contemporaries like Busta Rhymes and Kanye West. Rennie later added that \\"[T]here are a couple of moments of idiosyncrasy here, particularly on the title track and \\"On & On\\", but Guilts formulaic approach makes it easy to pass on the whole album. Instead, head over to your favourite download site and cherry-pick the radio bangers.\\" Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly simply said in her review, \\"The rapper behind 2007’s party anthem ”This Is Why I’m Hot” returns with more heat for the dance floor.\\" Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews said that despite the two singles and the rest of the tracks showing variety in tone and style, he felt that either Mims \\"or his record label may have overestimated how interested people would be in his sound after a two year layoff.\\" He concluded that \\"Any number of things might have changed the outlook here - more big name guests, more outside producers, better marketing or even making \\"Love Rollercoaster\\" the lead single instead of the followup. Whatever the answer, people in 2009 will be left asking the question why he's NOT as opposed to why he's HOT.\\" Writing for The New York Times, Jon Caramanica gave credit to Mims' \\"ear for clever production\\" and self-awareness of his limited appeal but found his lyrical skills lacking and said that 'Move (If You Wanna)' \\"has made him a one-hit wonder two times over.

Samuel Leavitt (1641-1707) was an early colonial settler of Exeter, New Hampshire, one of the four original towns in the colony of New Hampshire, where Leavitt later served as a delegate to the General Court as well as Lieutenant in the New Hampshire Militia, and subsequently as member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. The recipient of large grants of land in Rockingham County, Leavitt held positions of authority within the colonial province. Leavitt first appeared in Exeter in 1664, where he was granted of land by the town. Three years later, in 1667, he bought a home and barn and of land from his father-in-law John Robinson.The Robinsons and Their Kin Folk, The Robinson Family Genealogical and Historical Association, Third Series, 1906, Published by the Association, New York, 1906 In 1668, Leavitt was granted another of land by the town, and in 1670 was granted an additional . In 1675 the records reflect that Leavitt was granted more, and a year later was granted more. In 1697 Leavitt received a grant for , and more the following year, by which time his children were receiving their own grants of land in the town.The Common Lands, The History of Exeter, Rockingham County, New Hampshire, Charles H. Bell, J.E. Farwell & Co., Boston, 1888 In 1652 Samuel Leavitt's father John, then living in Hingham, Massachusetts, had been granted in Exeter. There is no evidence that John Leavitt, father of Samuel, ever settled at Exeter - but both his sons eventually did; his son Moses Leavitt married Dorothy Dudley, daughter of Exeter's minister Dr. Samuel Dudley; his son Samuel married Mary Robinson, daughter of John Robinson, who was an early settler of Ipswich, Massachusetts and later an early Exeter settler. (Samuel and Moses Leavitt were half- brothers.) As one of Exeter's earliest settlers, Leavitt was an early enforcer of town rules. In March 1673, for instance, he and John Wedgewood were charged with seizing any person who violated an order allowing new residents to cut 1,000 white oak pipe staves within a year. For their pains, the two were allowed to keep half the seized staves for themselves.Exeter Under the Massachusetts Government, History of Exeter, Rockingham County, New Hampshire, Charles H. Bell, J.E. Farwell & Co., Boston, 1888 Samuel Leavitt eventually began to assume powerful positions within the state. In 1690 he was named to represent the town of Exeter at a convention of state deputies to assess the Province's relationship with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. (The reason for the meeting was the attempt by John Mason, the royal patentee of New Hampshire, to try to transfer his claim to a London merchant.) Leavitt is listed in this and subsequent documents as Lieutenant Samuel Leavitt, indicating that he was of some stature in the community by virtue of his leadership of the local militia.The History of New Hampshire, Vol. I, Jeremy Belknap, John Farmer, Published by S.C. Stevens and Ela & Wadleigh, Dover, 1831 Left without a functioning government, New Hampshire voted to renew its association with Massachusetts until His Majesty's government in London was heard from.Colony, Province, State, 1623-1888: History of New Hampshire, John Norris McClintock, B.B.

Jenks, Concord, 1866 By the end of the decade Samuel Leavitt was routinely acting on behalf of the town. On April 28, 1698, for instance, he and John Wedgewood and his cousin Moses Gilman acted to affirm a land grant to two settlers next to the land of 'Mr. Edward Hilton'.History of Newfields, New Hampshire, 1638-1911, James Hill Fitts, The Rumford Press, Concord, N.H., 1912 In 1703 Leavitt was a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing Exeter.Provincial and State Papers, Documents and Records Relating to the Province of New Hampshire from 1692 to 1722, Vol. III, Nathaniel Bouton (ed.), John B. Clarke, Manchester, 1869 Leavitt served in the House of Representatives again the following year.Ibid, page 270 But Leavitt's life was not entirely free of trouble. In 1684 he and his relative Moses Gilman were hauled before His Majesty's Justice of the Peace Henry Roby in Hampton and charged with disturbing the peace. 'Samuel Levett', as he is called in the original record, then called the marshall and his deputy \\"a couple of rogues\\", after which he struck the lawman, telling him that he had no power and that Leavitt would not obey his command. \\"The said Moses Gilman did suddenly rise up, and said that Samuel Levett should not go to prison\\", according to the record of the trial of the two men. In the resulting fracas, Leavitt and Gilman were eventually hauled off by the authorities. The source of the trouble had apparently been a political discussion about taxes and Royal authority in the province.Collections of the New Hampshire Historical Society: Province Records and Court Papers from 1680 to 1692, Vol. VIII, Otis Grant Hammond, New Hampshire State Historical Society, McFarland & Jenks, Concord, 1866 Lieut.

The round has a total overall length of , with a -diameter cast solid-lead heeled bullet. The original propellant load is of black powder. The round has a muzzle velocity of approximately , giving a muzzle energy of 568 foot-pounds (770 joules ). ==Background== The cartridge is named after the intended firearm of usage Henry rifle, which the latter is in turn named after Benjamin Tyler Henry, the 19th-century American gunsmith who invented both. Henry designed both in his spare time while he was the foreman of the New Haven Arms Company, and was granted a US patent for his creations on October 16, 1860. While it was not the first repeating rifle, it was one of the first successful designs (alongside the Spencer rifle), and it provided the basis for the iconic Winchester rifle. Part of the Henry rifle's great success was due to the relatively novel self-contained metallic cartridge, which allowed a repeating mechanism to work. Other breechloaders of the time often relied on a simple, separate percussion cap for ignition, just like a typical muzzleloader of the era, and often used paper or linen cartridge cases, which provided no obturation, or sealing of the breech against the expanding gases (such as the Sharps rifle). Some utilized self-contained primers, but still lacked metallic cases (the Dreyse \\"needle gun\\"). While these one-shot breechloading weapons were great improvements over the muzzleloader, it required the adoption of the self-contained metallic case before repeaters could become viable weapons. The .44 Henry was an early self-contained metallic cartridge, and was one of the main reasons for the ultimate success of the Henry rifle.44WCF ==Ballistics== The cartridge's original 200-grain bullet had a flat nose. A more pointed nose bullet was later used, in order to decrease aerodynamic drag and increase range. Even so, it still achieved a ballistic coefficient of only 0.153, which reflects very poor long range capabilities. The .44 Henry is a large and slow bullet, giving poor external ballistics and a great deal of ballistic drop during its trajectory, making hitting a target past 200 yards almost impossible for the average shooter.The Henry Repeating Rifle, Chapter 4: Power and Accuracy Modern comparisons to the .44 Henry rifle's ballistics would include such large-bore handgun cartridges as the 200gr .45 ACP, and 200gr .44 Special. Due to the vast advances in propellant and metallurgy technology, these latter can nearly achieve the Henry Rifle's velocity from a handgun, and don't even require the long barrel of a rifle to give equivalent velocity. By modern standards, the resulting effective range for the .44 Henry fired from a rifle on military targets or small medium game would be well under 100 yards. However, when it was introduced in 1860, standards such as \\"effective range\\" to ensure a humane kill and a hit in a vital area were far more lax, and most hunters were accustomed to hunting game at short ranges in any case. Such performance was not unusual or remarkable, and the idea of weapons capable of engaging a target at hundreds of yards was generally reserved for dedicated, long-barreled target rifles and trained shooters. A .44 Henry is not particularly less accurate than a muzzleloading Springfield carbine; a longer- barreled Springfield rifle musket could theoretically hit at ranges of up to , but such performance was rarely within the ability of the average soldier, and was generally achieved only by designated \\"sharpshooters\\". For a typical infantry or cavalry soldier, or hunter, a rifle accurate at was sufficient. The ability to fire 16 rounds before reloading made the Henry's lack of long range capability even less of an issue. ==Use== The .44 Henry cartridge was used most notably in the Henry Model 1860 repeating rifle. This rifle was first used in the American Civil War, mainly by Union cavalry troops, although only in very limited numbers. It was also used by the very few Confederate troops who managed to capture one of these rifles along with a supply of ammunition, which was impossible to find in the Confederate south. After the Civil War, the Henry cartridge was used in the Winchester Model 1866 rifles during the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878) by the Turkish troops and in the Franco-Prussian War 1870/71 by the French. In civilian models, Winchester Model 1866 rifles and carbines, Smith & Wesson No. 3 Revolvers, Colt Model 1860 Army long cylinder conversion and the Colt Model 1871-72 \\"Open Top\\" revolvers were available in .44 Henry. From 1875 until 1880, Colt produced Model 1873 Single Action Armys in .44 Henry to accommodate owners of Henry Model 1860 and Winchester Model 1866 rifles and carbines. ==Later developments== The cartridge cases were originally made from copper, and later brass. The cartridge was still commercially made into the 1920s and 1930s. The .44 Henry cartridge was perfected by George R. Stetson’s U.S. Patent 120403, assigned to the Winchester Repeating Arms Company on October 31, 1871. It has as its object the use of swaged and lubricated projectiles of greater perfection in shape. ==See also== *List of rimfire cartridges *List of handgun cartridges *List of rifle cartridges *Table of handgun and rifle cartridges ==References== Category:Pistol and rifle cartridges Category:Military cartridges Category:Rimfire cartridges Category:Winchester Repeating Arms Company cartridges ","title":".44 Henry"},{"id":"20417664","text":"Passage East () is a fishing village in County Waterford, Ireland, situated on the west bank of Waterford Harbour. It is 12 km from Waterford 10 km from Dunmore East and 21 km from Tramore. ==History== On 23 August 1170, a year after Strongbow landed in Bannow, symbolising the beginning of the Norman invasion of Ireland, he returned to the country with 200 knights and 1,000 men, landing in Passage East. Nearby are the ruins of Geneva Barracks, a one time planned utopian colony turned into a notorious prison and point of departure for thousands of rebels transported from the country for participation in the 1798 rebellion. ==Tourism and fishing== Passage East has a long beach which is used for fishing bass, codling, whiting, various flatfish and pollock. It is possible to walk from Passage to Woodstown when the tide is out. Passage East also has a natural mussel bed in which it is possible to dig for ragworm. Lug can be dug all the way along the coast to Woodstown. The Waterford Estuary Mussel Festival is held each September in Passage East and some nearby villages. ==TransportCar ferry=== Passage East Ferry Company Limited, which has been in operation since 1982, links the village, and County Waterford as a whole, with County Wexford, specifically the village of Ballyhack. A journey on the company's vessel, The Tintern, which has a capacity for 28 cars, saves motorists a road journey of approximately 55 km. There has been some local concern in recent years about the level of traffic through the village generated by the car ferry. ===Bus service=== Suirway operate a bus route linking Passage East to Waterford. Some buses operate via Dunmore East. ==Sport== The local GAA club, Passage GAA, concentrates on hurling. Its best known players are Sean Cullinane and Eoin Kelly. Eoin Kelly won Passage's first All-Star award in 2008. The football club associated with the Passage area is Gaultier. ==See also== * List of towns and villages in Ireland ==References * Passage Car Ferry website Category:Towns and villages in County Waterford Category:Fishing in Ireland ","title":"Passage East"},{"id":"20417671","text":"John Shebbeare (1709–1788) was a British Tory political satirist. ==Life== He was the eldest son of an attorney and corn-factor of Bideford, Devonshire. A hundred and a village in Devon, where the family had owned land, bear their name. Shebbeare was educated at the free school, Exeter, under Zachariah Mudge, and there, it is said, \\"gave evidence of his future eminence in misanthropy and literature.\\" In his sixteenth year he was apprenticed to a surgeon, and afterwards set up for himself. Having, however, lampooned both his master and the members of the Exeter corporation, he in 1736 removed to Bristol, where in 1750 he was listed in land tax records as being at 10, Guinea Street, a house which is extant. He entered into partnership with a chemist in the city. In 1740 he published A new Analysis of the Bristol Waters; together with the Cause of Diabetes and Hectic, and their Cure, as it results from those Waters, which was reissued in 1760. The Shebbeare family had left Guinea Street by 1751. In 1752 he went to Paris, where he claimed to have obtained a medical degree, and to have been elected member of the Academy of Sciences. But he found his pen more remunerative than his practice. Settling in London, he began his career as a political writer in 1754, with The Marriage Act, a novel, dedicated to John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, one of the chief opponents of Lord Hardwicke's reform. The author was imprisoned for his reflections on the legislature, but his book was reissued in 1755 as Matrimony, and reappeared in 1766. Shebbeare followed up his success in 1756 by an attack on the Duke of Newcastle in the form of Letters on the English Nation, by Batista Angeloni, a Jesuit resident in London, of which he professed to be the translator only. This political satire, modelled on Bolingbroke's writings against Robert Walpole, alone entitled Shebbeare (in the opinion of Boswell) to a respectable name in literature. Meanwhile, he attacked the ministry directly in the Monitor and the Con-test, as well as in a series of outspoken pamphlets entitled Letters to the People of England, having, it was said, determined to write himself into a post or into the pillory.via DNB:, Mem. George II, p. 153 The Pillory at Charing Cross At the close of 1757, after Pitt's dismissal, Shebbeare issued his sixth letter, \\"in which is shown that the present grandeur of France and calamities of this nation are owing to the influence of Hanover on the councils of England.\\" On 12 January 1758 a general warrant was issued against the author, printer, and publisher. On 23 January all copies of a seventh Letter were seized and suppressed. On 17 June Shebbeare was tried for libel on an information laid against him by the attorney-general, Pratt, who on this occasion admitted the right of the jury to judge of the law. During the trial, as Walpole laments, Mansfield laid it down that satires on dead kings were punishable. In summing up he declared that the Letter nearly approached high treason. On 28 Nov. Shebbeare was sentenced to a £5 fine and three years' imprisonment in King's Bench Prison, as well as having to pay a bond of £500 and find two £250 sureties for good behaviour for seven years on his release. He was also to stand in the pillory at Charing Cross on 5 December. Owing to the friendship of Arthur Beardmore, the under-sheriff, he was allowed to stand upright between the upper and lower boards of the pillory, while an Irish chairman held an umbrella over his head. At the end of an hour he retired amidst the cheers of the crowd, who had been invited by printed bills to come and see 'the British champion.' Beardmore was afterwards punished for his conduct.via DNB:cf. Churchill's The Author, quoted in Notes and Queries, 2nd ser. xi. 91 An anonymous squib appeared under the title Memoirs of the Pillory; being a consolatory Epistle to Dr. Shebbeare. While in prison Shebbeare received subscriptions for a history of England, and actually composed one volume, which was not published. When attacked on the subject in a letter in the Public Advertiser of 10 Aug. 1774 he excused himself chiefly on the ground of debts incurred in consequence of a lawsuit against Francis Gwyn, who had been concerned with him in the publication of an edition of Clarendon's History of the Reign of Charles II. The book, for which Shebbeare wrote a strong tory introduction, was suppressed by an injunction in chancery at the instance of the Duchess of Queensberry, and, though Shebbeare recovered expenses from Gwyn, half the sum went in costs. Notwithstanding his position, he refused to avail himself of the Insolvent Act. On his release he advocated peace with France, and attacked John Wilkes. On 29 Feb. 1764 a memorial signed by several members of parliament was presented to George Grenville in his favour,and Shebbeare was granted a pension of £200 a year. The king, in reply to Sir John Philips, who made the application, is said to have spoken of Shebbeare \\"in very favourable terms.\\" Almon's statement that a pension of £400 had been previously granted by Bute seems doubtful.via DNB:cf. Grenville Papers, ii. 271 Henceforth Shebbeare became a steady advocate of the measures of the court, and even assailed his old favourite, Pitt. His most elaborately written work was The History of the Excellence and Decline of the Institutions, Religion, Laws, Manners, and Genius of the Sumatrans, and of the Restoration thereof in the reign of Amurath the Third, 2 vols. 1763. It is a skilful exposure of the weak points in whig policy and administration, followed by a panegyric on George III and his ministers. In style it is a colourable imitation of Bolingbroke. On 3 Aug. 1764 Walpole sent Lord Hertford a pamphlet written by Shebbeare under Grenville's direction, adding the remark, \\"We do not ransack Newgate and the pillory for writers.\\" He speaks of him as engaged with Carteret Webbe, solicitor to the treasury, in writing against Pratt, the lord chief justice, in a paper called The Moderator.via DNB:Mem. George III, ed. Barker, i. 262 In 1766 Shebbeare offered to John Beard, the manager of Covent Garden, a play he had written in early life, and its non-production led to the publication of the correspondence between them (1767). In 1768 he wrote for three months the reviews of books in the Political Register. In 1770 Shebbenre published an Eighth Letter to the People of England. He defended the American policy of George III against Price and Edmund Burke in the Public Advertiser and elsewhere. The former he \\"abused daily in the papers,\\"via DNB:, Last Journals, 19 March 1777 In 1774, in reflecting on some speeches lately delivered by Thomas Townshend (afterwards Lord Sydney) and Councillor Lee, he took occasion to cast aspersions on the character and reputation of William III, Algernon Sidney, and other Whig heroes, as viewed in the light of the recently published Memorials of Sir John Dalrymple. An answer appeared as an appendix to a Letter to Dr. Johnson on his late Political Publications, 1775, by a \\"Doctor of Laws\\" (Hugh Baillie). Despite a protest made by Fox in the House of Commons on 16 Feb. 1774,via DNB:Parl. Hist. xvii.1058 the names of Johnson and Shebbeare were usually coupled in whig pasquinades. It was said that the king had pensioned both a He-bear and a She-bear.via DNB:, Johnson, ed. Hill, iv. 113 In 1776 Wilkes spoke of them as the \\"two famous doctors\\" who were \\"the state hirelings called pensioners\\" and whose names disgraced the civil list.\\"via DNB:Parl. Hist. xix. 118 William Mason the poet, writing under the pseudonym \\"Malcolm Macgregor,\\" in 1777 addressed a scathing Epistle to Shebbeare, as:via DNB:cf. , Letters, vi. 453 The Polling, The Humours of an Election series, 1755 Print of The Polling, with the Sixth Letter in Shebbeare's pocket Nor did Shebbeare's own political friends altogether spare him. His sudden transition from pillory to pension was glanced at in The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, and he is the \\"Ferret\\" of Tobias Smollett's Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves. Shebbeare seems to have shared Johnson's dislike to Scotsmen. He criticised adversely Smollet's History, and assailed the \\"Scotch gentlemen criticks\\" of the Critical Review, then conducted by Smollett.via DNB:see the Occasional Critic, 1757 In the revised edition of the History, however, the passage relating to Shebbeare's prosecution in 1758 is curiously laudatory.via DNB: and Hist. of Engl, 1855, x. 186 William Hogarth, also one of George III's pensioners, introduced Shebbeare as one of the figures in The Polling, the third work of his four-part Humours of an Election series (he is seen, a shackle on his leg, whispering into the ear of a mad man; in the later print version, he has a copy of the Sixth Letter in his pocket.). Frances Burney met him in 1774 at the house of Catherine Reid, a Scottish portrait-painter, and has recorded a specimen of his conversation in her Early Diary. It was marked by extraordinary coarseness, and consisted chiefly of abuse of women and Scotsmen, whom he declared to be \\"the two greatest evils upon earth.\\" The last production by Shebbeare was The Pole Cat, or C. Jennings, the Renegade Schoolmaster ... Detected, 1788, 8vo. Shebbeare died on 1 Aug. 1788 in Eaton Street, Pimlico. ==Family== He married young and unhappily. He was quoted by Burney as saying: His wife, Susanna, also from Bideford, died on 25 November 1779. They had three children. One, Elizabeth, was baptised 6 April 1737. His son John, baptised 4 September 1734, matriculated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, on 28 October 1758, and graduated B.C.L. in 1765. After having been incumbent of Gaston, Norfolk, John died rector of East Horndon, Essex, on 7 February 1794.via DNB:, Alumni Oxon He wrote The Ornaments of Churches considered, with particular view to the late Decoration of St. Margaret's, Westminster.via DNB:, Lit. Anecd. viii. 457 Some contemporary documents spell his surname \\"Shebear\\" or \\"Shebbear\\". ==Works== Shebbeare's writings generally are vigorous and well informed, and in scurrility go little, if at all, beyond those of the chief polemical writers of the day. Walpole admitted that his pen was \\"not without force,\\" and Boswell, who was introduced to him by General James Oglethorpe, thought \\"his knowledge and abilities much above the class of ordinary writers.\\" Besides the works mentioned, he published: *A Love Epistle in Verse found at Paris, 1753, 4to; reissued in 1755. *Lydia, or Filial Piety: a novel, 4 vols. 12mo, 1755; 2nd edit. 2 vols. 1769; another edit. 1786. *Authentic Narrative of the Oppressions of the Islanders of Jersey, to which is prefixed a succinct History of the Military Actions, Constitution, &c.;, of that Island, 2 vols. 8vo, 1771. *Address to the Privy Council pointing out an effectual remedy to the Complaints of the Islanders of Jersey, 1772, 8vo. *Tyranny of the Magistrates of Jersey ... demonstrated from Records of their Courts, 1772, 8vo. *Answer to the Printed Speech of Edmund Burke, esq. ... in the House of Commons, April 19, 1774, 1775, 8vo. *Essay on the Origin, Progress, and Establishment of National Society; in which the principles of Government ... contained in Dr. Price's observations are examined and refuted; together with a justification of the Legislature in reducing America to obedience by force; to which is added an appendix on the excellent and admirable in Mr. Burke's speech of 22 March 1775, 1776, 8vo. Also the following medical works: *The Practice of Physick, founded on principles in Physiology and Pathology hitherto unapplied in Physical Enquiries (undated) *Candid Enquiry into the Merits of Dr. Cadogan's Dissertation on the Gout; with appendix containing a certain Cure for Gout, 1772, 8vo.

He studied art at the Cincinnati Art Museum as a high school student and moved to Manhattan, where he studied painting at the Art Students League of New York in the late 1930s.Grimes, William. \\"Karl Bissinger, Portraitist, Dies at 94\\", The New York Times, November 25, 2008. Accessed November 26, 2008. ===Career=== Bissinger's first connection to photography was when he was a stylist for the studios of Condé Nast Publications, where he developed relationships with some of the portrait and fashion photographers on staff, including Cecil Beaton, George Hoyningen-Huene, Irving Penn and John Rawlings. He was part of group that shared a residence on Fire Island with Richard Avedon, who lent him a camera and encouraged him to take pictures. His first photographic subjects were Avedon's wife and author James Baldwin. Avendon was impressed with Bissinger's work and sent him to Lillian Bassman, art director for Junior Bazaar.Guide to the Karl Bissinger papers, Special Collections, University of Delaware Library, Newark, Delaware. Retrieved 11 May 2020. His first assignment as a photographer was for Junior Bazaar and he started taking portraits and doing fashion shoots for Harper's Bazaar, Theater Arts, Town & Country and Vogue. He was staff photographer for the 12-issue lifespan of the magazine Flair, edited by Fleur Cowles, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Gary Cooper, John Ford, Katharine Hepburn and John Wayne. Bissinger developed an interest in the arts scene, photographing Truman Capote on the set of a film in Paris and Marlon Brando in front of a window in his New York City apartment. A 1949 photograph taken at a table in the garden of Manhattan's Café Nicholson of the up-and-coming in the arts world included artist Buffie Johnson, ballerina Tanaquil LeClercq, author Gore Vidal, playwright Tennessee Williams and novelist Donald Windham, in what The New York Times described as \\"a class picture of the young and the talented in the American arts, more than ready for their close-ups\\".Vidal, Gore. \\"Salad Days: Karl Bissinger's 1949 photograph of the author and a few friends at lunch in a Manhattan restaurant garden invokes the optimism of youth\\", Smithsonian, October 2007.

Café Nicholson, which he created with Johnny Nicholson, who had worked with him as a window-dresser at Lord & Taylor earlier in his career, was the frequent setting of his photographs. During this time, Bissinger met fashion illustrator and designer Richard Hanley, who became his life partner. ===Later years=== Bissinger left photography as a profession in the 1950s and developed a focus on political issues, becoming involved in a number of peace organizations. He met Julian Beck and Judith Malina, founders of The Living Theatre, at a demonstration in the early 1960s and would take photos of the company's performances. He became a draft counselor during the Vietnam War, working full-time at the Greenwich Village Peace Center, providing guidance on avoiding being drafted for military service.Braun, Saul. \\"From 1-A to 4-F And All Points In Between\\", The New York Times, November 29, 1970.

Developed in the early 1960s, it was specially designed for use as a lift engine for VTOL aircraft but was also used in a later variant of the Hawker Siddeley Trident airliner as an auxiliary boost engine. A smaller related variant, the RB181 remained a design project only, as did a turbofan version designated RB.175. ==Design and development== The RB162 was designed to meet an anticipated need for a lift engine to power VTOL aircraft with the emphasis on simplicity, durability and lightweight construction. Development costs were shared by Britain, France and Germany after signing a joint memorandum of agreement.Gunston 1989, p.150. The engine featured fibre glass compressor casings and plastic compressor blades to save weight which also had the effect of reducing production costs. The engine has no oil system, a metered dose of oil instead being injected into the two main bearings by the compressed air used to turn the compressor at startup.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%200953.html Although the RB.162 was a successful design the expected large VTOL aircraft market did not materialise and the engine was only produced in limited numbers.Gunston 1989, p.150. ===Development for the Trident=== In 1966 British European Airways (BEA) had a requirement for an extended range aircraft to serve Mediterranean destinations. After a plan to operate a mixed fleet of Boeing 727 and 737 aircraft was not approved by the British GovernmentSwanborough 1971, p.89. Hawker Siddeley offered BEA a stretched and improved performance version of the Trident that they were already operating. This variant, the Trident 3B, used, in addition to its three Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines, a centrally mounted RB162-86 which was used for takeoff and climb in the hot prevailing conditions of the Mediterranean area. The 'boost' engine was shut down for cruising flight. Some conversion was needed for the change from vertical to horizontal installation. With the RB162 fitted the Trident 3B had a 15% increase in thrust over the earlier variants for an engine weight penalty of only 5%.Swanborough 1971, p.90. ===RB175 and 181=== A design study for a turbofan version of the RB162 was designated RB175.Flight International, 7 January 1965 www.flightglobal.com Retrieved: 31 December 2009 Another projected derivative, the RB181 was to be a scaled-down version of the RB162 producing approximately 2,000 lbs of thrust.

He briefly worked for the Krupp factory from January to November, 1936. From there, he was recruited by Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer, the director of Mauser Werke's Weapons Research Institute and Weapons Development Group. Vorgrimler remained with Mauser until August 1945. He was ultimately assigned to Department 37, which was responsible for military small arms up to 15 mm in caliber. Vorgrimler eventually led the sub-department in charge of aircraft weapon construction. By January 1944, Vorgrimler was ordered to design a heavy machinegun using the roller-delayed blowback operating system then under development for military rifles. In response, Vorgrimler attempted to convert the gas-operated roller-locked MG215 to the roller-delayed system. Work was not completed by the end of the Second World War. Vorgrimler would later claim that he participated in the development of the MG 45, a conversion of the roller-locked MG 42 to roller-delayed operation. == After World War II == After the war ended, Mauser's Department 37 development group was placed under control of the French War Department's armament group, Direction des Etudes et Fabrication d'Armament (DEFA). The Mauser factory was renamed the DEFA Development Center, Oberndorf. The French continued work there through 1946, when workers and equipment began to be transferred to the Mulhouse area of Alsace. This became the Centre d'Etudes et d'Armament de Mulhouse (CEAM). The transfer of operations to Mulhouse was complete by March 1948. In February 1948, Vorgrimler and fellow Mauser engineer Theodor Löffler were assigned the development of roller-delayed carbines for the French. They worked separately on carbines for the experimental 7.65×35mm cartridge, developed by Cartoucherie de Valence. Their carbines were patterned upon the prototype StG45, which had been under development at Mauser prior to the end of the war. The French ultimately abandoned their 7.65×35mm cartridge in favor of the US .30 Carbine cartridge. Vorgrimler and Löffler then went to work on roller delayed carbines for the latter cartridge. Ultimately, Löffler's designs won out. Vorgrimler then devoted his efforts to improving Löffler's designs. Eventually, Vorgrimler tired of this and left CEAM at the end of June, 1950. Vorgrimler was recruited to work for CETME in Spain. The French initially attempted to prevent him from leaving the country, but Vorgrimler and family were allowed to move to Madrid in September 1950. Once there, Vorgrimler went to work on a roller-delayed rifle chambered for the experimental 7.92×40mm cartridge. Former Rheinmetall engineers led by Hartmut Menneking already had a nine-month head start on the gas-operated Modelo 1, but Vorgrimler and his team of former Mauser engineers had their own Modelo 2 prototype ready by December 1950. The Spanish government selected the Modelo 2 for continued development in July, 1952. == CETME Modelo B == Beside the interest at home in Spain, the Modelo 2 attracted a lot of attention from the West German Border Guards (Bundesgrenzschutz), which sought a new service rifle. Not willing to accept a cartridge outside of the NATO specification, the Germans asked CETME to develop a 7.62 mm version of the rifle. Misunderstanding the German request, CETME developed a 7.62 mm version of the 7.92x40mm cartridge. The Germans then had to explain that they wanted a version chambered for the standard 7.62×51mm NATO. Instead, the resulting CETME Modelo A was chambered for the 7.62×51mm CETME cartridge, which had identical chamber dimensions but a reduced-power load compared to the standard NATO round. Further development of the rifle produced the CETME Modelo B, which had been \\"improved\\" with the help of Heckler & Koch, receiving several modifications including the ability to fire from a closed bolt in both semi-automatic and automatic firing modes, a new perforated sheet-metal handguard (the folding bipod had been the foregrip in previous models), improved ergonomics, and a slightly longer barrel with a rifle grenade launcher mount. In 1958, this rifle was introduced into service with the Spanish Army as the Modelo 58. For his efforts in developing the rifle, Vorgrimler was awarded the Encomienda de Alfonso X el Sabio. In 1956, the Bundesgrenzschutz canceled its planned procurement of the CETME rifles, adopting the FN FAL (G1) instead. However, the newly formed West German Army (Bundeswehr) now displayed interest and soon purchased a number of CETME rifles for further testing. The CETME, known as the Automatisches Gewehr G3, competed successfully against the SIG SG 510 (G2) and AR-10 (G4) to replace the previously favored G1 rifle. In January 1959, the Bundeswehr officially adopted the CETME rifle. The CETME design was licensed by the West German government, and production was transferred to German manufacturers, Heckler & Koch and Rheinmetall. Heckler & Koch would go on to develop an entire family of weapons based on the G3, including the HK33 rifle, HK21 machine gun, and MP5 submachine gun. ==Later years== In the summer of 1956, Vorgrimler moved back to West Germany. Despite the recruiting efforts of Heckler & Koch engineering director (and former Mauser Department 37 colleague) Alex Seidel, Vorgrimler returned to work at Mauser as the head of research and development. By then, Mauser and CETME had entered a working alliance. Soon after, Vorgrimler developed a companion machinegun based on the CETME rifle design. While commercially unsuccessful, it inspired Heckler & Koch's HK21 introduced years later. Vorgrimler continued to be granted patents for his work throughout the 1960s and 70s. This included work on commercial sporting rifles, caseless infantry rifles, and an automatic cannon with Mauser and Industriewerke Karlsruhe. ==References== *Vorgrimler, Ludwig, Entwicklungsgeschichte CETME-Gewehr - Deutsches-Bundeswehrgewehr G3, 1977. ==External links== * International patents of Ludwig Vorgrimler Category:Firearm designers Category:1912 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Engineers from Freiburg im Breisgau Category:German expatriates in Spain ","title":"Ludwig Vorgrimler"},{"id":"20417860","text":"Morris Lake is a long shallow lake in Nova Scotia's Halifax Regional Municipality bordering the communities of Dartmouth, Shearwater and Cole Harbour.

Edward sent Gilbert de Clare and his army to subdue and hold down the southern areas of Wales while other armies would invade elsewhere. == The battle == Gilbert de Clare with an army of around 1600 infantry and 100 cavalrymen had captured Carreg Cennen Castle from the Welsh. Following their victory, the men sacked the castle, and on the 17th of June they headed back to the nearby English settlement, Dinefwr Castle, to stash the spoils. However, along the way Clare and his men were ambushed by Welsh troops and much of the army was destroyed. == Aftermath == The battle was a great victory for the Welsh. English expansion into south Wales was halted for a few weeks and Edward's plans of an attack on multiple fronts were somewhat spoiled. Among the dead was the son of William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke. Following the defeat, Edward relieved Clare of his command and replaced him with Valence, who was now determined, following the death of his son. == References == * Category:Battles involving Wales Category:Battles involving England Category:1282 in Wales Category:Conflicts in 1282 Category:Edward I of England Category:Llandeilo ","title":"Battle of Llandeilo Fawr"},{"id":"20417901","text":"Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade (born ) is a Brazilian judge on the International Court of Justice, based in The Hague (Den Haag), Netherlands, a position he has held since 6 February 2009.

As built it was streamlined and was the first to be fitted with a double chimney (previous locomotives being built with single chimneys and later modified). Its livery was LMS crimson lake with cheat lines, but during the Second World War it acquired austere unlined black livery. Though it carried the name City of Birmingham from new, 6235 was officially named at a ceremony at Birmingham New Street on 20 March 1945, and a special coat of arms plate was then fitted above the nameplate. The streamlining was removed for maintenance reasons in April 1946, making 6235 the first streamliner to be destreamlined, and at the same time it was fitted with smoke deflectors, and livery continued to be black. 6235 passed to British Railways ownership in 1948, and in March was given the BR number 46235, which was applied in May. It was one of the engines given the short-lived blue livery for top express passenger engines in 1950. In April 1952, the semi-streamlined sloping smokebox front was replaced with a round-topped smokebox. 46235 was repainted into BR Brunswick Green livery from April 1953, and it retained this livery through withdrawal in September 1964 and through into preservation. 46235 was prepared by BR for preservation, and after storage at Nuneaton MPD, moved to the Birmingham Museum of Science and Industry, which was built around the locomotive. After closure of that museum 46235 was moved into Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum in 1997.

In 1940 he married Joan Moore, another sculptor. They separated in the 1950s but never divorced. They had no children. After leaving the army, Armitage became head of the sculpture department at the Bath Academy of Art in 1946. In 1952, he held his first one-man show in London. In 1953, he became Great Britain's first university artist in residence, at the University of Leeds (to 1956). In 1958, he won best international sculpture under age 45 at the Venice Biennale. Armitage was made CBE in 1969 and was elected to the Royal Academy in 1994. In 2001, his sculpture \\"Both Arms\\" was erected along with a blue plaque in Millennium Square, Leeds, being unveiled by Nelson Mandela. His 2001 sculpture \\"Legs walking\\" was erected in City Square, Leeds outside Mill Hill Chapel in 2018. He died 22 January 2002. ==Work== Armitage's striking mature style was evident as early as 1952. Most of his works are recognizably human, but are sometimes joined with the forms of animals or furniture. Many displayed quirky humor. Armitage was also interested in ancient Egyptian and Cycladic art and his works have an archaic flavour.

The word is Tetun and literally means \\"surpassing the earth\\".Also, but less convincing, explained as a Portuguese term meaning small king; Gunn (2011) p. 120. It is originally associated with Wehali, a ritually central kingdom situated at the south coast of Central Timor (now included in Indonesia). The sacral lord of Wehali, the Maromak Oan (\\"son of God\\") enjoyed a ritually passive role, and he kept the Liurai as the executive ruler of the land.Therik (2004) p. xvi-xvii. In the same way, the rulers of two other important princedoms, Sonbai in West Timor and Likusaen (Liquica) in East Timor, were often referred as Liurais, which indicated a symbolic tripartition of the island.Müller (1857) p. 145-7; Castro (1867) p. 243; Schulte Nordholt (1971) p. 391. In later history, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the term Liurai underwent a process of inflation. By this time it denoted any ruler in the Portuguese part of Timor, great or small. In the Dutch part in West Timor the title appears to have been restricted to the Sonbai and Wehali rulers. The rulers in the west were known by the Malay term raja, while there were internally used terms such as Usif (lord) among the Dawan-speaking groups, and Loro (sun) among the Tetun speakers.Schulte Nordholt (1971). The role of the Liurais underwent changes after the great Boaventura Rebellion which was suppressed by the Portuguese authorities in 1912.Gunn (2011) p. 50-1. Up to then they were by and large traditional rulers in whose realms the colonial authorities seldom interfered. However, after this date the Liurai was often appointed due to his loyal stance and connections with the colonial center in Dili. The Liurai families have kept a certain role in Timorese society until recent times, and a few scions have enjoyed nationwide political roles. The Liurais do not have any official rank any more, but still tend to command a degree of local respect.Gunn (2011) p. 120. ==See also== * List of rulers of Timor * History of East Timor ==References Bibliography == * Castro, Affonso de (1867), As possesões Portuguezas na Oceania.

Also known as the Battle of the Bridge of Boats, it is now considered unlikely the battle site was near Moel-y-Don, but farther north. ==Background== After stripping much Welsh land from Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1277, Edward I of England imposed harsh terms on the lands he had conquered. He had been aided in 1277 by many Welshmen, including Llywelyn's own brother Dafydd ap Gruffydd, but the terms of the peace, coupled with domination by English laws and by Edward's officials drove many of them into rebellion. The war began when Dafydd turned against the English and slaughtered the garrison of Hawarden Castle. Edward raised several armies through levy and indenture, and sent them into Wales on multiple fronts to surround and destroy Llywelyn's armies. One important expedition, consisting of 2000 infantrymen and 200 cavalrymen under the former constable of Gascony, Luke de Tany, was sent to capture the island of Anglesey. This would deprive the Welsh of much of their grain, and outflank the Welsh who were defending the Conwy. ==The battle== After successfully capturing Anglesey, Luke de Tany's men constructed a bridge of boats across the Menai Strait which separates Anglesey from the mainland. Edward's plan was to cross the River Conwy while Tany crossed the Menai and attacked from the north. However, Tany ignored the plan, believing he could defeat the Welsh without Edward's aid. He had contacted some of the clergy in Bangor, who had promised to aid him by giving a signal when the time was right to attack. The bridge was finished in September that year and, on 6 November, Tany and his men crossed the bridge, having been given the signal to attack. Llywelyn ap Gruffydd had been alerted to the crossing somehow, and emerged with a large army to meet the English as they crossed. A rising tide cut off de Tany's men from the bridge. When they tried to flee, many of them drowned when their heavy armour dragged them under the sea. Walter of Guisborough wrote an account of the battle: > When they had reached the foot of the mountain and, after a time, came to a > place at some distance from the bridge, the tide came in with a great flow, > so that they were unable to get back to the bridge for the debt of water. > The Welsh came from the high mountains and attacked them, and in fear and > trepidation, for the great number of the enemy, our men preferred to face > the sea than the enemy. They went into the sea but, heavily laden with arms, > they were instantly drowned. Luke de Tany, the nobles Roger de Clifford, Phillip and William Burnell (brothers of the chancellor Robert Burnell), sixteen English knights (and their esquires) and over 400 of Tany's men perished. The Welsh suffered few casualties. The remaining English army made it back to Anglesey; their losses, however, were too great for them to launch a further attack. ==Aftermath== This victory, and the Battle of Llandeilo Fawr in which another English army was destroyed in South Wales, boosted Welsh morale and set back Edward's plans for conquering Wales. ==References== * Also http://battlefields.rcahmw.gov.uk/collections/getrecord/404319 Category:Battles involving Wales Category:Battles involving England Category:1282 in England Category:13th century in Wales Category:Conflicts in 1282 Category:1282 in Wales Category:England–Wales relations ","title":"Battle of Moel-y-don"},{"id":"20418169","text":"The Manning Cabin was the first vacation cabin built in what is now Saguaro National Park.

It touched down there on Wednesday, July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern Connecticut during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC) on the shore of the Hudson River before becoming a waterspout and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered Westchester County and struck the town of Sleepy Hollow at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of Greenwich at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million. ==Meteorological synopsis== Weather radar animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT On July 12 a supercell thunderstorm developed over eastern New Jersey in association with a surface low-pressure area in southwestern Ontario. Daytime heating in the Tri-State Region led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of showers and thunderstorms. With conditions favorable for the development of a tornado, the Storm Prediction Center issued a tornado watch at 12:40 p.m. EDT (16:40 UTC). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a funnel cloud near Carlstadt at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into New York. About 15 minutes later, a tornado warning was issued for southern Rockland and Westchester counties, which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an F1 tornado touched down near Grand View-on-Hudson along the Hudson River in Rockland County. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a waterspout as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the Tappan Zee Bridge before crossing into Westchester County. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county. The tornado hit the town of Sleepy Hollow, New York, around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared New York State Route 9A, it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the Kensico Reservoir in Valhalla as the tornado neared the New York–Connecticut border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into Fairfield County, Connecticut, it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m EDT (20:03 UTC) in Greenwich after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the Merritt Parkway. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes. ==Impact== Tornado damage near a forested area The tornado took a path through Rockland, Westchester and Fairfield counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million in damage. Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the Hudson River, the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of Sleepy Hollow, damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10-foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of Pocantico Hills was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby Comfort Inn had part of its roof torn off. After a tornado warning was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated. An area where numerous trees were knocked down, the white tubes support saplings being grown to re-populate the affected area. As the tornado crossed New York State Route 9A, it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of Mount Pleasant and Hawthorne, damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the Saw Mill River Parkway prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting Metro-North Railroad service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the Kensico Reservoir in Valhalla, the tornado crossed into Connecticut, where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million. The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of Greenwich. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million. ==Aftermath== In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a state of emergency for the entire village. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. ConEdison crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in Westchester County. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in Tarrytown, New York, was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. Metro-North Railroad suspended trains on the northern part of the Harlem Line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. Southbound passengers took buses while the tracks were shut down. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC). ==See also== *1900 Westchester County tornado *1904 Chappaqua tornado *List of Connecticut tornadoes *List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks *Tornadoes of 2006 ==References * Westchester County Category:F2 tornadoes Category:Greenwich, Connecticut Category:Mount Pleasant, New York Category:Natural disasters in New York (state) Category:Rockland County, New York Category:Tornadoes in New York (state) Category:Tornadoes in Connecticut Westchester County tornado Category:Westchester County, New York Westchester County tornado Westchester County tornado Category:July 2006 events in the United States ","title":"2006 Westchester County tornado"},{"id":"20418221","text":"Washington García Rijo (1921 – 22 September 2010) was a Uruguayan political figure. == Background == His political base has been in Rocha Department.

It is part of the Ghaeltacht in Waterford Gaeltacht na nDéise. ==Geography== An Sean Phobal, as it is known locally, is a large parish covering about 35 square kilometres with approximately 8 km of coastline along Muggort's Bay. It is the second largest parish in Waterford stretching west to east bordering the villages of Ardmore and Grange to the other Gaeltacht na nDéise parish of An Rinn and north to south from slightly beyond the Cork-Waterford N25 roadway to the coast. The closest centres of population to An Sean Phobal are Dungarvan and the County Cork town of Youghal. ==Amenities== There is a primary school, a pre-school/child-care centre, public house, Roman Catholic church, parish hall, lighthouse, a GAA pitch and an all-weather pitch, a Gaeltacht Development office along with other businesses and cottage industries. For people working day to day within the parish farming and agriculture-related industries are still the largest source of employment. Leisure-wise there are two beaches with numerous coves and angling rocks along the cliffs, a fresh water lake and 2 large manmade lakes. The cliffs, deeply incised stream gullies and small bays of the area attract a wide variety of seabirds and make the area a paradise for bird-watchers. ==Irish language== The Irish language plays an important role in the area. Gaoluinn na nDéise, the Waterford variant of the Munster Irish dialect, is spoken. The local primary school is Scoil Náisiúnta Baile Mhic Airt. Drama plays in Irish are produced annually by the local drama group, Aisteoirí An tSean Phobail, and the parish's GAA club competes in the Comórtas Peile na Gaeltachta, an annual Gaelic football competition contested by clubs from the Irish language-speaking Gaeltacht areas of Ireland. The official name of the area is An Sean Phobal or An tSean Phobail in the genetaive case. Both An Sean Phobal and Old Parish were on the local road-signs until 2005, when the anglicised form ceased to have any official standing. Today, roadsigns show the Irish name, An Sean Phobal, only. ==HistoryPlace name=== Welcome sign in An Sean Phobal The anglicised place name of the parish, Old Parish, is rare among place-names in Ireland in that it is a fairly direct translation of the original Irish name. The Irish word 'Pobal' is community in English and Sean is \\"old\\" in English. According to local lore, it is the oldest parish in Ireland. This myth is probably spurred on by the parish saint, Saint Colman, who had a monastery in Cill Comán in An Sean Phobal, having baptised Saint Declan, who went on to Christianise Waterford before the coming of Saint Patrick. But the name of the area is more likely due to the following reasons: It once was part of an older parish pairing that consisted of Ardmore and An Sean Phobal. It is said that people in neighbouring parishes (who at the time would have spoken Irish) referred to the area as An Sean Phobal after it left Ardmore to join in a new parish pairing with An Rinn in the early 1900s. Another theory is that the devastating effect the famine had on the parish population could have led people to call it An Sean Phobal (The Old Community), as it would have been a vibrant populated community beforehand. Either way, the nickname people had for the parish became the adopted place name for the area. Prior to the area being called An Sean Phobal, it was probably known as Baile Mhic Airt, the largest townland within An Sean Phobal. Scoil Náisiúnta Baile Mhic Airt is the name of the local primary school, Baile Mhic Airt and other parish townlands appear on O.S maps without An Sean Phobal and Baile Mhic Airt is still recognised within the postal service. === 'Caileach Bhearra' megalithic tomb=== Plaque at megalithic tomb The late Neolithic or early Bronze Age court cairn at the Ballynamona townland of An Sean Phobal is the only example of its kind in the south-east of Ireland. The site is marked 'dolmen' on the Ordnance Survey map, and is known locally as 'Cailleach Bhearra'. It is located about 1.5 km (1 mile) north of the lighthouse and about 100 m (~100 yards) from the cliff edge. The tomb at Ballynamona is a court cairn. This type of megalithic tomb is usually found north of a line between Clew Bay in the west and Dundalk in the east. It would have been constructed by a tribal group and an immense amount of social organisation was required in its building. There would have been many burials in the grave. The bodies were burnt and the cremated bones were placed in the burial chambers sometimes with pottery, beads and stone and bone, and tools for use in the next life. Although the Ballynamona court cairn is neither spectacular nor large, its importance cannot be overlooked. It is known to date from 2000 B.C. during the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age. It is clear evidence of the early settlement of An Sean Phobal by a developed, agricultural society. The views of the Waterford and Wexford coastlines along with the vast Celtic Sea southwards from this site answer any questions one would have as to why the earliest known settlers of An Sean Phobal chose this location. It was excavated in May 1938 by a team led from the Office of Public Works in collaboration with the National Museum of Ireland. ===War of Independence and Civil War=== The men and women of An Sean Phobal played their part in the cause of Irish freedom during this revolutionary period. A Company of Irish Volunteers was organised in Old Parish, in late 1917. The company was initially 8-9 but this quickly rose to 20 and doubled and tripled as the conflict escalated. In March 1918, men from An Sean Phobal defended Sinn Féin voters in a Waterford by election against Crown sympathisers, Pig traders and ex-British soldiers. The third battalion of The West Waterford IRA brigade, or Déise Brigade as it is also known, was the Ardmore-An Sean Phobal battalion its main personal were: Jim Mansfield, O.C, Willie Doyle, Vice-O.C., Paddy Cashen, Adjutant, Declan Slattery, Q.M., Dick Mooney, Engineer, Jerry Fitzgerald, Dispatch Rider, Tom Mooney, Transport and Declan Troy, Training. The Staff Engineer Mick Mansfield (brother of Jim Mansfield above) of Cruabhaile, An Sean Phobal took part in many operations across the county including the Burgery ambush. In 1918, Declan Slattery of Scrahan, An Sean Phobal was appointed Battalion Quartermaster. During the period 1918- 1919 activities were mostly confined to training and organisation. By the end of 1919 there were 8 companies of around 50 men each in the 3rd battalion. Roughly, 40% of the An Sean Phobal company were armed with shot guns this was probably helped by the companies location within a farming community. There were also a few Lee–Enfield rifles, about a half dozen revolvers but a poor supply of ammunition. A local blacksmith named Patrick Roche made some bayonets and about four dozen ‘Croppy’ pikes in his forge at An Cruabhaile but the pikes never came into any use by the company. Staff Engineer Mick Mansfield in IRA uniform Anti Treaty IRA volunteers have breakfast on Baile Mhic Airt beach, An Sean Phobal about 1922 In January 1920, Declan Slattery and other men from An Sean Phobal were in a party of thirty who attacked Ardmore R.I.C. police barracks which was about four miles from Youghal. Previous to the attack, twenty men or so were placed on outpost duty on the roads leading to Ardmore. These men were armed with shotguns, their job being to hold up any enemy reinforcements coming to relieve Ardmore. On the night of the attack, Slattery, armed with a shotgun, took up a position (with others) in houses opposite the barracks. The intention was to explode a land mine near the barracks and then rush it. The land mine tuned out to be a dud one: it never exploded. The party opened fire at the windows, which were steel- shuttered with loop-holes for firing. The R.I.C. were called on to surrender. They replied with rifles and machine guns. The gun battle went on for about an hour. It is unknown if any R.I.C. men were hit, but the IRA suffered no casualties. The day after the Ardmore attack, British Army and police raided the house of Commandant Jim Mansfield at Cruabhaile, An Sean Phobal. The three Mansfield brothers Jim, Mike and Charlie were all well-known I.R.A. men and badly wanted by the British. When the raiders led by Captain King (chief inspector of Police, Dungarvan) arrived at the house, the Mansfield brothers were gone. They interrogated family members and threatened to shoot Hannah Mansfield unless she informed on her sons. In order to curb Captain King's zeal, a group of Dungarvan Volunteers took the captain's car which was in a garage over half a mile from his house. They then pushed it through the town to his front door, where they drenched it with petrol and set it on fire. Shortly afterwards the Captain was transferred to Mallow at his own request The Active Unit West Waterford Flying Column officers George Lennon, Mick Mansfield and Pat Keating held a conference at the house, of Mrs Margaret Portle, Baile Mhic Airt, An Sean Phobal, as to the best means of bringing the British into a position suitable for ambushing. it was there and then decided to stage another but feint attack on the R.I.C. barracks at Ardmore and ambush any relieving force coming out from Youghal at a place called Piltown Cross about 4 miles north of Youghal on the Yougal-Dungarvan main road. This Ambush was to become known as the Piltown Cross ambush. ===Great Famine=== The Glens of An Sean Phobal were once home to hundreds of families. Pictured here is Gleann Anna taken from Baile Mhic Airt Beach An Sean Phobal had a much greater population before the famine than it does now. In many ways, it has never recovered, Most notably in the seaside glens along the coast where many towns- land villages once existed Tóin Tí Thaidhg, Baile Mhic Airt íoctarach, and Baile na hAirde to name but a few. Immigration and death ridded these glens of a great majority of their human inhabitants. Plenty of ruined Boháns or cottages are still visible to the eye after years of vegetation overgrowth in these glens. ===Reilig an tSléibhe=== Signage directing people to Reilig an tSléibhe, the Famine Graveyard in the Waterford GaeltachtStatue found at Reilig an tSléibhe This is the famine graveyard in the Waterford Gaeltacht, it is located in An Sean Phobal, off the N25 from Dungarvan to Cork just before An Seanachaí pub about 4 km south-west of Dungarvan. The field itself was owned by the Villiers-Stuart family. In July 1847, the Clerk was directed to advertise for contractors to erect a stone wall around the site, four feet high and five feet wide, faced with stones on both sides ’the stones to be laid on edge.’ Two men were employed assisted by the workhouse inmates. On 28 August William Veale’s tender to make an iron gate 5½ feet high by 8 feet wide for 14 shillings was accepted. The graveyard was to be ready in a matter of weeks. In early September the Guardians ordered that any paupers who died were to be buried in the new graveyard for Grange and Ardmore until the site at Slievegrine, as the area in which Reilig an tSléibhe is located was then recorded, was opened. Henry Villiers-Stuart was chairperson of the Board of Guardians who ran the workhouse at the time. There are possibly 3 mass graves in the field that were used to cope with the large numbers and as the deaths declined, it is believed single graves were dug. The corpses were brought by pony and trap from the town along what would have been the old Cork road. A Mr Fitzgerald made this journey with his cart up to three times a day. A Mr Barron was also in charge of the burials. Currently, it is not known how many were buried there but there are certainly 100s if not up to 1000. Officialdom, at the time, had such disregard for the inmates of the workhouse, they only had a number and no names were recorded. Many literally had to dig their own graves a matter of days before they themselves would be tipped in. They were buried without coffins or even shrouds. There is a local story of a young baby that was about to be buried with a number of other corpses and just before the cart was tipped in, she left out a loud cry. That child emigrated to America and lived into her 90s. An Seanachaí, which is located beside the graveyard obtained its first licence in 1845, issued to John Ketts. The public house was originally established to provide food and drink for the gravediggers and the Kett family were caretakers of the graveyard in the immediate aftermath of the famine. In the early 1860s some members of the Board of Guardians felt that a small monument should be erected at Reilig an tSléibhe to commemorate those buried there, but nothing came of the idea. The subject came up again in August 1866 when it was proposed that a monument should be erected at a cost not exceeding £50. Denis McGrath’s plan for the monument was accepted in August 1866 but the Commissioners objected once again. The plan was eventually dropped, probably because of the opposition from the Commissioners. According to Seamus Clandillon writing in 1925 a wooden cross marked the site, this had reportedly crumbled well before 1943. In 1953 a new monument, which still stands on the site, was erected to commemorate the Holy year and a small inscription was included to mention the famine victims. The unveiling took place as part of the celebrations of the An Tostal festival in Dungarvan on Sunday 19 April 1953. This monument consists of a large plain limestone cross with inscriptions in Irish and English. On 20 August 1995, for the 150th commemoration of the famine, a commemorative mass was celebrated at Reilig An tSléibhe by Dr. William Lee, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore. A new memorial which was inscribed with part of Máire Ní Dhroma's poem, Na Prátaí Dubha was unveiled and a moving recital of Na Prataí Dubha was given by Peig, Bean Uí Reagáin. Also to be seen at the site is a solitary figure in mourning, at the side of the field. This sculpture was created by Seán Creagh, however, he died before it was complete and so the fiberglass structure that would have been used to create the mold for the final piece was erected instead. As such it is not very weather proof and is showing signs of damage. Within the field if you look at the surface of the grass, there are depressions which are very apparent. These are most likely the burial sites of the mass graves and the single interments. None of the graves are marked in any way. Within the field there is also a headstone where GR Jacobs from the HMT Bradford is buried. He died at sea in 1916.Dungarvan Observer - 09-10-2015 ===Castle ruin=== Castle ruin and mass stone A castle ruin and a famine mass stone is situated in Baile Mhic Airt lower. There is very little known about the ruins; it is said that the initial owner was Lord Barron who came to the area and built it as a hunting lodge. This site is listed in the Buildings of Ireland Survey as an early 19th-century gate screen incorporating a central gateway with flanking lodges, probably built as part of plans to develop Glenanna Cottage grounds.Glenanna Cottage, BALLYMACART UPPER, County Waterford ==Education== All education in An Sean Phobal is delivered through the medium of Irish.

This coastline consists of a dramatic seascape of cliffs (approximately 70 m, 230 ft., high) together with a number of deeply incised stream gullies and small bays. The unimproved grassland along the cliffs attracts a wide variety of seabirds. An Sean Phobal is a paradise for bird-watchers, anglers and people interested in nature. ===Mine Head Lighthouse=== Minehead Lighthouse The red sandstone lighthouse at Mine Head, was built in the mid 1800s. George Halpin Senior designed the major light of Mine Head. The red sandstone structure sitting on top of the steep cliffs of An Sean Phobal is higher above sea-level (88 m, 290 ft.) than any other Irish lighthouse. Local merchants and mariners from Youghal and Cork pressured the Ballast Board to begin a lighthouse tower on Capel Island off Youghal. This building was begun even though George Halpin felt the best place for a light was on Mine Head. The work was well under way when the local people changed their mind and decided that the light should be at Mine Head after all. After much debate, including input from Trinity House and the Admiralty, it was decided to abandon the site on Capel Island and build on Mine Head. The light was established on 1 June 1851, the same day as Ballycotton lighthouse. Mine Head has a 22 m (72 ft.) white tower with a black band. It was converted to electricity in Sept. 1964. The beacon flashes white and red every 2.5 sec. and has a nominal range of 52 km (28 nautical miles) since it sits so high above sea-level. Today the Commissioner of Irish Lights operates the lighthouse, which is not open to the public and is not accessible. ==Sport== Crest of C.L.G An tSean Phobail.

Trail had a prolific junior tennis career and played on the professional tour from 1997 to 2003. She retired due to injury in 2003. ==Junior career== Trail began playing tennis at the age of 4. At 7 years old, she won the first sanctioned United States Tennis Association (USTA) sanctioned tournament that she entered. In 1992, at the age of 12, Trail was ranked #1 in Kentucky in the Girls 12s, Girls 14s, Girls 16s, Girls 18s and Women's Open divisions. In 1993, Trail won the Kentucky State High School Tennis Championship as a 7th grader. She repeated the following year as an 8th grader. Trail won seven national junior titles, second all-time only behind Tracy Austin when Trail turned professional at age 16. Her national junior titles are: * 1997 Girls 18s Hardcourts (age 16) * 1997 Girls 18s Claycourts (age 16) * 1996 Girls 18s Indoors, Singles and Doubles (age 15) * 1996 Girls 16s Hardcourts (age 15) * 1995 Girls 16s Hardcourts (age 14) * 1995 Girls 18s Indoors (age 14) In 1996, Trail won the Girls 16s USTA National Sportsmanship Award.

Significant public and political outcry was roused, and at least one senior figure of a government organisation resigned. The scandal first emerged in June 2008 when Dáil Éireann (the lower house of the Irish parliament) was told one morning by Leader of the Opposition Enda Kenny that gardaí were investigating the alleged misappropriate use of funds by a senior executive within FÁS. The director general of the training and employment agency, Foras Áiseanna Saothair (FÁS; referred to in the English language as the Training and Employment Authority), Rody Molloy resigned late on 25 November after revelations that himself and fellow FÁS executives spent hundreds of thousands of euro belonging to the company on lavish holidays to the United States, which included first-class travel and expensive rounds of golf, including €643,000 over a period of four years on transatlantic travel for the purpose of promoting the Science Challenge programme and almost €48,000 in air fares for journeys undertaken by Molloy, sometimes accompanied by his wife. Just prior to this, Taoiseach Brian Cowen had publicly defended Molloy before his resignation, amidst increasing public outcry and calls for him to resign by TDs including the Fine Gael spokesperson for enterprise Leo Varadkar. The turning point proved to be an interview Molloy gave to the RTÉ Radio 1 show Today with Pat Kenny in which he grossly underestimated the tide of public opinion in his defence of his company's expenses. On 24 November, Molloy explained to Pat Kenny: \\"We broke no rules or regulations. At the time we were doing it, it was standard practice.\\" The Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee investigated the affair and issued a report on 19 February 2009. == Background  Shane Ross, Nick Webb and the Sunday Independent === The Sunday Independent broke the story on 23 November 2008 after an investigation by its business editor, Senator Shane Ross and fellow journalist Nick Webb. Documents were obtained by the duo under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. Ross later discussed his findings on the current affairs television programme Questions and Answers. Ross and Webb would later win the Bord Gáis journalist of the year award for their scoop, as well as the TV3 story of the year award. \\"Wasters\\", a book exposing waste and cronyism in the public sector by Shane Ross and Nick Webb, was published by Penguin in October 2010. === RTÉ Radio 1 interview === Molloy was questioned on a number of issues relating to the expenses of FÁS in an RTÉ Radio 1 interview with Pat Kenny on 24 November 2008. Asked about the FÁS official who, along with his wife, purchased business class tickets costing €12,021 for a three-week round-the-world trip that took in destinations as exotic as Frankfurt am Main, Tokyo, Honolulu and San Francisco before a flight back to Dublin via Frankfurt, Molloy confirmed he had signed the expense claim and that the official was at an event in Tokyo on official business associated with the World Skills competition and with the graduate programme FÁS operate in Japan. He claimed that the official \\"at his own expense, spent some time on the way back coming back through the US\\". Quizzed on the necessity of FÁS's chairman, the trade union boss Peter McLoone, accompanying Molloy on a €7,300 per-person return business class flight to Orlando, Florida for a week-long stay, Molloy pointed out that the city \\"also happens to be very close to the NASA facility where the shuttle lands and takes off from\\". He then alluded to the special relationship he claims his organisation have built up with NASA over a number of years, a relationship which led to Irish students being given opportunities to work and develop their research skills within NASA. He summed up his view with the line: \\"I think anyone who knows Florida knows it's not just about Disney World.\\" Asked about the FÁS executives who billed the Irish taxpayer for pay- per-view movies ranging in price from $12.71 to $34.40 that they then watched in their US hotel rooms, Molloy compared the price of pay-per-view movies to \\"chickenfeed\\", asking the presenter \\"What's $10 for a movie?\\". When Kenny informed Molloy that his employers RTÉ did not cover pay-per-view movies in their expenses, Molloy hinted at an \\"oversight on our part\\" but reiterated his belief that NASA was a major US government agency and that to develop \\"relationships\\" with them was \\"not easy\\". On FÁS's corporate affairs director Greg Craig's company credit card being used to cover a $410 bill at Solutions beauty and nail salon on West Cocoa Beach, Florida in August 2005 (later infamously linked with the politician Mary Harney), Molloy implied that the amount of money, \\"in terms of the total package, is very, very small\\". On the FÁS credit card used to pay $942.53 for Molloy to play a three-ball golf match at the Orlando Florida Grand Cypress Resort Golf club in January 2005, Molloy again defended himself by referring to his \\"developing relationships\\" policy. He then apologised for committing \\"a major sin\\". Molloy was then questioned about the clocking up of almost €48,000 in business-class airfares, sometimes accompanied by his wife, over a four-year period. On the most recent of these in February 2008, they ran up an airfare bill of €7,500 for a return trip to the US east coast. In May 2007, the duo flew to New York at a cost of €6,655, both travelling business class. In November 2007 the pair made their return to New York and in doing so ran up airfares of €7,281. Also in 2007 they claimed FÁS expenses of €6,455 for a similar trip, travelling business class again. In June 2005, they visited Boston on a cheaper flight, costing €1,634 and prior to this in July 2004, the duo flew to Orlando at a cost of €9,648 for their business class fares. Molloy emphasised that this was not the \\"hellishly expensive\\" first class travel and that on occasions that his wife had travelled, there had been valid and \\"appropriate\\" reasons for this being so. These reasons, he suggested, were \\"to do with the kind of activities that were involved there\\", including a dinner involving the President of Ireland Mary McAleese and her husband. He then proposed that on such occasions he had traded down his travel \\"entitlement\\" (he alleged an entitlement to travel first class) to allow his wife to buy a ticket on the plane with the leftover money. Finally Molloy was quizzed on the €500 glass barometer that a FÁS representative had purchased as a gift for the Irish Minister for Education Mary Hanafin on a visit to their US project. FAS then paid an extra €419 in postage costs to send it back to Ireland. Molloy did not have such detail with him at that time but described such gifts as of a \\"corporate\\" kind, usually consisting of items such as Waterford Glass crystal. He did suspect that the barometer was a \\"probably sizeable\\" corporate gift to the Minister from NASA but claimed a lack of knowledge due to not having the relevant information at hand.\\" === Rody Molloy's resignation === Rody Molloy's resignation as director general of FÁS was announced on 25 November shortly before 23:00 by Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Mary Coughlan. In the aftermath, the Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore said the rest of the board's situation was \\"untenable\\". Molloy said he would not appear before the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee on 27 November to investigate the issues that cost him his job, with Assistant Director General, Christy Cooney acting as accounting officer for the meeting instead. He also received €500,000 compensation for resigning. Molloy later claimed he was \\"afraid of flying\\". He was replaced by a new six- month interim director-general, Eddie Sullivan, a former secretary general with the Department of Finance who was previously commissioned by the government to report on the 2006 rape law controversy, medical card fees for doctors and data protection legislation. On 16 January 2009, it was reported that Molloy would receive €111,000 severance payments and full pension benefits despite his resignation. === Additional spending controversies ===  Croke Park controversy  Questions were also raised about Molloy's decision to move a jobs fair from the smaller RDS venue to the larger Croke Park stadium in Dublin. He described the catering facilities at the RDS as \\"unacceptable\\" in standard and price, before suggesting that children might be killed whilst crossing the road to obtain nutritional maintenance elsewhere and insisting that incoming Gaelic Athletic Association president Christy Cooney, an assistant director with FAS, was not involved in the move.  Astronaut video visit controversy  Nearly €30,000 was spent by FÁS on a film crew to capture the 2006 visit of US astronaut, Commander Eileen Collins, whom the agency invited to Ireland to promote a science project. €7,856 was incurred on the Cork leg of Collins's visit, whilst €16,000 expenses arose from filming her tour of Dublin schools. Hiring the cameraman and equipment cost €5,900. Added to this €30,000 estimate was a €13,000 bill for the chauffeur-driven limousines hired for the drive around Ireland, availed of not only by the astronaut but also by some senior executives of FÁS. == Individuals  Mary Hanafin === Mary Hanafin defended her involvement in the scandal by saying she was in the United States \\"to present certificates\\" to students at NASA headquarters. === Peter McLoone === The head of the FÁS board, Peter McLoone, denied that he had \\"turned a blind eye\\" to foreign travel expenses, saying he was \\"never aware\\" of any excess expenditure. === Rody Molloy === Rody Molloy is a career civil servant who was appointed as director general of FÁS eight years prior to his resignation. Before this, he had served in a number of government departments including Industry and Commerce, Department of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs, gaining much of his FÁS management skills at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment where he received promotion to the level of assistant secretary. Molloy is originally from Birr, County Offaly (Brian Cowen's constituency) but resided in Maynooth, County Kildare at the break-out of the scandal. His communication skills led to high praise from the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern during the years of economic boom brought on by the Celtic Tiger. He once described his \\"principal interest in life\\" as GAA; an avid hurling fan he was overheard boasting to a Dáil committee that he had tickets to a game at Croke Park. He is married to Noreen, and has four children. === Mary Harney === In a Radio 1 interview on 27 November, Fianna Fáil TD Mary O'Rourke described Mary Harney's involvement in the scandal as \\"a load of hoo-hah\\". Health Minister Mary Harney has defended her use of expenses while on a FÁS trip to the US. On 28 November Mary Harney defended herself with the claim that she was \\"not on holiday\\", had not used public taxes for her own personal grooming, blamed the use of the government jet on the Taoiseach and had followed \\"advice\\" in claiming her expenses. When she admitted using her time in the United States to receive a visit from a relative, the Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore asked her to resign. == Outcome == In a statement released on 29 November, the Board of FÁS said they had assured the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of their determination to release \\"all matters of concern about past practice\\" to the public domain. The Public Accounts Committee is set to report on the scandal in 2009. Mary Harney's husband, the former FÁS chairman Brian Geogheghan, is amongst those to be interviewed about his expenditure by the Public Accounts Committee. On the day prior to this, the Irish Times published a letter from FÁS instructor Niamh McCarthy telling of how she was instructed by a representative from FÁS that any student absent from class for a day, with or without a doctor's certificate, is to have 80 cents deducted from their €4 trainee weekly meal allowance.The Irish Times – Fri, Nov 28, 2008 – Controversy over Fás expenditure === Reaction === Michael Lillis, a former leading civil servant and diplomat, said Molloy \\"should not have been driven out\\" and that he \\"played an important part for a generation in developing the Irish economy\\". == Report == A Public Accounts Committee report on the affair was released on 19 February 2009. It found that proper procurement protocols were not adhered to and standard foreign travel policy was not abided by FÁS, resulting in a loss to the Exchequer. It found that FÁS should not have paid for flights of former board members, journalists and spouses of executives, whilst costs in respect of ministers and civil servants should have been borne by the department. The report said FÁS's expenditure of €35 million on advertising between 2003 and 2007 was carried out in \\"an unorthodox fashion from a procurement perspective\\". == Sunday Independent once again exposes Molloy == In September 2009, the Sunday Independent reignited the FÁS controversy when it reported that Mr Molloy had had his pension topped up by Tánaiste Mary Coughlan.Disgraced Fas chief's €1.4m hike in pension – National News, Frontpage – Independent.ie The front-page story, written by the paper's Chief Reporter, Daniel McConnell, detailed how Mr Molloy's pension was added to by the tune of an additional four and a half years, bringing the overall value of his pension to over €4m. The matter was made worse as two senior ministers, Brian Lenihan and Mary Coughlan appeared to blame each other for the affair. The following day at the FF party think-in at Athlone, Tánaiste Mary Coughlan defended the move to top up Mr Molloy's pension saying it was politically imperative to see a change of DG. The matter rumbled on for weeks with the Tánaiste initially stating she acted on legal advice and said she did so to avoid a lengthy court battle to remove Mr Molloy from his position. Taosieach Brian Cowen later admitted that in fact there had been no threat by Mr Molloy nor had legal advice been sought. The issue was further raised at the Public Accounts Committee where more damaging revelations emerged. There were calls for Ms Coughlan to resign her post. Coughlan would go on to lose her seat in the 2011 general election. In November 2009, the Sunday Independent revealed how Catriona Ceitin exposed the top-up granted to Mr Molloy. The enhanced severance packages offered to Secretary Generals created much controversy and discussions over the following two years and in November 2011, it was announced that such severance deals would no longer be available to future Secretary Generals. == References == 29\\\\. * Woman who revealed FAS Golden Handshake – Independent.ie – 1 Nov 2009 30\\\\. * No more golden handshakes – Independent.- civil servants wave goodbye to generous severance payments – Independent.ie – 8 Nov 2011 Category:2008 in Irish politics Category:2008 scandals Category:Brian Cowen Expenses FAS ","title":"FÁS expenses scandal"},{"id":"20418789","text":"Blue Giant is an American rock band from Portland, Oregon. An eclectic mix of country, indie rock, and psychedelic styles, Blue Giant have been called a Portland supergroup. The band was originally composed of the songwriters and musicians from Viva Voce, Kevin Leigh Robinson and Anita Lee Elliott, Chris Funk of The Decemberists, Evan Railton of Swords, and Seth Lorinczi of The Golden Bears, Circus Lupus & The Quails. Musically, Blue Giant could be characterized as rural psychedelic rock, with one music critic calling them a perfect country rock band. ==History== After touring extensively in 2007 with The Shins and Jimmy Eat World, Kevin and Anita of Viva Voce took a brief hiatus. Tiring of the confines of a two-piece band, they began writing songs they considered for another band. Evan Railton of Swords was asked to play drums. Seth Lorinczi of The Golden Bears & Circus Lupus was invited to play bass. Last to join on pedal steel was Chris Funk of The Decemberists, who, upon hearing the band's early demos, demanded to join the band. Infused with their own respective indie-rock, punk and DIY backgrounds, the Blue Giant songs reflect a greater part of the Robinson's Southern heritage. The band name is a reference to a blue giant star, a transitory phase in the life cycle of a star, and one of the brightest types of stars in the universe. Blue Giant played their first show in June 2008 headlining the Wonder Ballroom in Portland. The band gave each audience member a free download of their first recording. ===Collaborations=== Blue Giant has recorded and performed with Corin Tucker of Sleater Kinney. Tucker's distinct voice is featured on a duet with Kevin Robinson on Blue Giant's debut EP. ===Portland tour=== Delving further in their collaborative spirit, Blue Giant went on a mini-tour of Portland in October 2008, each night bolstered by special guests such as Corin Tucker of Sleater Kinney, Sam Coomes of Quasi, Corrina Repp and Rachel Blumberg of Norfolk & Western, and M. Ward. The tour culminated in a collaboration with The Portland Cello Project, which saw Blue Giant accompanied by nine cellists. ===Target Heart=== Prior to release, Kevin was asked to talk about Blue Giant and the Target Heart EP in an eMusic Selects Q&A;, on November 10, 2008. The 6 track CD EP was subsequently released by the imprint label Amore!Phonics. The 12\\" vinyl version of the album contains two additional tracks (\\"Wasn't Born To Follow\\" by The Byrds, and \\"Got To Be Free\\" by The Kinks) and was released through Jealous Butcher Records, the same label that printed the vinyl edition of Viva Voce's Rose City. ===New tour, record deal, and lineup change=== In February 2010, the band announced a nationwide tour and a recording deal with Vanguard Records, with plans to release a debut LP album on July 13, 2010. The announcement also stated that Funk and Lorinczi had relinquished their duties on pedal steel and bass, being replaced by Jesse Bates and Dave Depper, respectively. ==Discography== {  ! style=\\"width:3.5em;\\"  Year ! style=\\"width:15em;\\"  Title ! style=\\"width:20em;\\"  Label -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2009  Target Heart EP  Amore!Phonics / Jealous Butcher -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2010  Blue Giant  Vanguard Records - } ==References *Official Blue Giant Website *Willamette Week Feature Category:2008 establishments in Oregon Category:Indie rock musical groups from Oregon Category:Musical groups from Portland, Oregon Category:Musical groups established in 2008 ","title":"Blue Giant (band)"},{"id":"20418831","text":"NGC 14 is an irregular galaxy in the Pegasus constellation.

On May 14, 1945, he was injected with 131 kBq (3.55 µCi) of plutonium without his knowledge or informed consent. Plutonium remained present in his body for the remainder of his life, the amount decaying slowly through radioactive decay and biological elimination. Stevens died of heart disease some 20 years later, having accumulated an effective radiation dose of 64 Sv (6400 rem) over that period, i.e. an average of 3 Sv per year or 350 μSv/h. The current annual permitted dose for a radiation worker in the United States is 0.05 Sv (or 5 rem), i.e. an average of 5.7 μSv/h. ==Background== Plutonium was first synthesized in 1940 and isolated in 1941 by chemists at the University of California, Berkeley. Early research (pre-1944) was carried out on small samples manufactured using a cyclotron. The Manhattan Project built mass scale production facilities for the war effort. In November 1943, the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory began producing significant amounts of the element, and industrial–scale production began in March 1945 with the commissioning of the B Reactor at the Hanford Site in Washington State. The plutonium produced by the B-reactor was earmarked for the implosion-type, plutonium cored nuclear weapons that were being developed as part of the Manhattan Project. Of the three nuclear weapons made during the war, two of them used plutonium as their fissile material. Plutonium was handled extensively by chemists, technicians, and physicists taking part in the Manhattan Project, but the effects of plutonium exposure on the human body were largely unknown. A few mishaps in 1944 had caused certain alarm amongst project leaders, and contamination was becoming a major problem in and outside the laboratories. Plutonium was tracked into civilian areas, plutonium dust was being inhaled by workers, and accidental ingestion was a grave concern for those who routinely handled it. In August 1944, a chemist named Don Mastick was sprayed in the face with liquid plutonium chloride, causing him to accidentally swallow some. ==Manhattan Project == Plutonium-238 and plutonium-239 are exceedingly difficult to detect inside the body because they are alpha particle emitters. Unlike the case of radium, which can be detected quite easily, there are no gamma rays to detect from outside the body. As long as a person is alive, the simplest way to detect plutonium would be to analyze a person's excretion through urine and feces. Unfortunately, this method has its limits in that only a small fraction of Pu is excreted, for example 0.01% of the body burden per day is typical, 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. As the Manhattan Project continued to use plutonium, airborne contamination began to be a major concern. Nose swipes were taken frequently of the workers, with numerous cases of moderate and high readings.Plutonium in Man: A Twenty-Five Year Review, UCRL 20850, TID-4500 (58th Ed.), Patricia W. Durbin, 1971. While Dr. Robert Stone was the Health Director at the Met Lab in 1944, lead chemist Glenn Seaborg, discoverer of many transuranium elements including plutonium, urged him that a safety program be developed and suggested \\"that a program to trace the course of plutonium in the body be initiated as soon as possible ... [with] the very highest priority.\\"Final Report , Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, 1985 Tracer experiments were begun in 1944 with rats and other animals with the knowledge of all of the Manhattan project managers and health directors of the various sites. In 1945, human tracer experiments began with the intent to determine how to properly analyze excretion samples to estimate body burden. Numerous analytic methods were devised by the lead doctors at the Met Lab (Chicago), Los Alamos, Rochester, Oak Ridge, and Berkeley. The first human plutonium injection experiments were approved in April 1945 for three tests: April 10 at the Manhattan Project Army Hospital in Oak Ridge, April 26 at Billings Hospital in Chicago, and May 14 at the University of California Hospital in San Francisco. Albert Stevens was the person selected in the California test and designated CAL-1 in official documents. Dr. Joseph G. Hamilton was the primary researcher for the human plutonium experiments done at U.C. San Francisco from 1944 to 1947. Hamilton wrote a memo in 1950 discouraging further human experiments because the AEC would be left open \\"to considerable criticism,\\" since the experiments as proposed had \\"a little of the Buchenwald touch.\\"\\"The Media & Me: [The Radiation Story No One Would Touch]\\", Geoffrey Sea, Columbia Journalism Review, March/April 1994. The plutonium experiments were not isolated events. During this time, cancer researchers were attempting to discover whether certain radioactive elements might be useful to treat cancer. Recent studies on radium, polonium, and uranium proved foundational to the study of Pu toxicity. For example, polonium (another alpha emitter) research indicated that test sample contamination was a major concern, which is why a clean room had to be established at Los Alamos in February 1945 in the Medical Labs Building. Behind this human experiment with plutonium was Dr. Joseph Gilbert Hamilton, a Manhattan Project doctor in charge of the human experiments in California. Hamilton had been experimenting on people (including himself) since the 1930s at Berkeley. He was working with other Manhattan Project doctors to perform toxicity studies on plutonium. It was Hamilton who had begun the 1944 tracer experiments on rats. The opportunity to select a human patient was relatively easy: Hamilton was not only a physicist assigned to U.C. Berkeley, he was \\"professor of experimental medicine and radiology\\" at U.C. San Francisco.\\" Hamilton eventually succumbed to the radiation that he explored for most of his adult life: he died of leukemia at the age of 49. Although Stevens was the person who received the highest dose of radiation during the plutonium experiments, he was neither the first nor the last subject to be studied. Eighteen people aged 4 to 69 were injected with plutonium. Subjects who were chosen for the experiment had been diagnosed with a terminal disease. They lived from six days up to 44 years past the time of their injection. Eight of the 18 died within two years of the injection. All died from their preexisting terminal illness, or cardiac illnesses. None died from the plutonium itself. Patients from Rochester, Chicago, and Oak Ridge were also injected with plutonium in the Manhattan Project human experiments. As with all radiological testing during World War II, it would have been difficult to receive informed consent for Pu injection studies on civilians. Within the Manhattan Project, plutonium was referred to often by its code designation \\"49\\" (from its atomic number 94 and its atomic mass 239) or simply the \\"product.\\" Few outside of the Manhattan Project would have known of plutonium, much less of the dangers of radioactive isotopes inside the body. There is no evidence that Stevens had any idea that he was the subject of a secret government experiment in which he would be subjected to a substance that would have no benefit to his health. ==Experiment on Stevens== Stevens was a house painter, originally from Ohio, who had settled in California in the 1920s with his wife. He had checked into the University of California Hospital in San Francisco with a gastric ulcer that was misdiagnosed as terminal cancer. According to Earl Miller, acting chief of radiology at the time, he was chosen for this study because \\"he was doomed\\" to die. Stevens was injected with a mixture of plutonium isotopes having the Pu(VI) chemical species (Pu+6) as the nitrate PuO2(NO3)2. The injection consisted of 0.2 micrograms of 238Pu and 0.75 micrograms of 239Pu. According to Kenneth Scott, a scientist who worked at the U.C. Berkeley Rad Lab alongside Dr. John H. Lawrence and Nobel laureate Ernest Lawrence, U.C. San Francisco radiologist Earl Miller injected the plutonium into Albert's body. Scott transported the plutonium from the lab to the hospital where Albert Stevens was being treated for stomach cancer. Miller repeatedly denied that he injected plutonium. According to Scott, \\"[Albert Stevens] got many times the so-called lethal textbook dose of plutonium.\\" Although the original estimates (and some later figures) concerning the activity of the injected solution were erroneous, modern research indicates that Stevens (who weighed ) was injected with 3.5 μCi 238Pu, and 0.046 μCi 239Pu, giving him an initial body burden of 3.546 μCi total activity.Rowland, R.E., and Durbin, P.W. Survival, causes of death, and estimated tissue doses in a group of human beings injected with plutonium. United States: N. p., 1975. Web. The fact that he had the highly radioactive Pu-238 (produced in the 60-inch cyclotron at the Crocker Laboratory by deuteron bombardment of natural uranium) contributed heavily to his long-term dose. Had all of the plutonium given to Stevens been the long-lived Pu-239 as used in similar experiments of the time, Stevens's lifetime dose would have been significantly smaller. The short half-life of 87.7 years of Pu-238 means that a large amount of it decayed during its time inside his body, especially when compared to the 24,100 year half-life of Pu-239. When specimens were taken during Stevens's cancer surgery, Earl Miller took them for radiological testing; Scott collected urine and stool samples. When the hospital's pathologist analyzed the materials removed from Stevens during surgery, a startling conclusion was made: Stevens had no cancer. Evidence was that surgeons removed a \\"benign gastric ulcer with chronic inflammation.\\" The hospital staff reacted with disbelief. There had been no reason for surgery, although the size of the inflammation was extraordinary. There had also been no therapeutic intent for the experiment, although surgeons assumed that Stevens had received radioactive phosphorus for \\"special studies.\\" While at the hospital, \\"both a radiologist and a surgical consultant concluded that Albert probably had cancer but suggested a gastroscopy be done to confirm the diagnosis.\\" This had never been done. Prior to Stevens's trip to the hospital, \\"A local physician suspected Albert had a malignant ulcer that had spread to the liver and advised him to consult specialists at the University of California Hospital.\\" Stevens's surgeons found a \\"huge, ulcerating, carcinomatous mass that had grown into his spleen and liver... Half of the left lobe of the liver, the entire spleen, most of the ninth rib, lymph nodes, part of the pancreas, and a portion of the omentum... were taken out\\" to help prevent the spread of the cancer that Stevens did not have. ==After surgery== Once Stevens was out of surgery, his urine and stool samples were analyzed for plutonium activity. The Pu-238 helped the researchers in this respect, because it was much easier to detect. But as Stevens's condition improved and his medical bills soared, he was sent home to recover. The Manhattan District decided to pay for his urine and stool samples to keep him close to San Francisco on the pretext that his \\"cancer\\" surgery and remarkable recovery were being studied. According to Stevens's surviving son Thomas, Stevens kept samples in a shed behind his house for storage; an intern and a nurse would pick them up once a week. The original data from Stevens's stool and urine samples was collected for 340 days post-injection. Kenneth Scott analyzed the samples, but he never told Stevens the true reason for collecting them; he also recalled that Stevens's sister was a nurse and quite suspicious. Whenever Stevens had continued health problems, he would return to the U.C.S.F. hospital and receive free gastro-intestinal lab work by Dr. Robert Stone, a radiologist who performed extensive human experiments in the 1940s. About 10 years after the injection, a \\"radiologist noted 'rather marked' degeneration in the lumbar region of his spine and several degenerating discs.\\" Plutonium, like radium and many other heavy metals, accumulates in the bones. None of the people at U.C.S.F. or those who treated Stevens ever explained to Stevens that he did not have cancer, nor did they disclose to him that he was a part of an experiment; his wife and daughter \\"figured they were using him for a guinea pig,\\" but that the experimental treatment had worked. Thomas Stevens, Albert's son, always filled out medical forms indicating that there was a \\"history of cancer\\" in his family because his father had been led to believe that the \\"treatment\\" for his cancer had worked. Stevens received approximately 6400 rem (64 Sv) in the 20 years after his injection, or about 300 rem (3 Sv) per year. The annual, whole-body dose currently permitted to radiation workers in the United States is 5 rem; Steven's total dose was approximately 60 times this amount. He died on January 9, 1966, of cardiorespiratory failure (heart disease) at the age of 79. His cremated remains were shipped to the Argonne National Laboratory Center for Human Radiobiology in 1975, but they were never returned to the chapel which held them from 1966 to 1975. Some of the ashes were transferred to the National Human Radiobiology Tissue Repository at Washington State University, which keeps the remains of people who died having radioisotopes in their body. In a 1975 study of the eighteen people who received plutonium injections in Manhattan Project experiments, CAL-1 (Albert Stevens) was shown to have received by far the highest dose to his bones and liver, calculated as 580 and 1460 rad, respectively. The dose of 580 rad was calculated based on the \\"average skeletal dose\\" contributed from the two radionuclides Pu-238 (575 rad) and Pu-239 (7.7 rad). This was then converted to the bone's surface dose, which was 7,420 rad. Stevens's absorbed dose was almost entirely based on the Pu-238 in his system. One of the findings of the 1975 study was that Stevens and five others injected with plutonium had endured \\"doses high enough to be considered carcinogenic. However, no bone tumors have yet appeared.\\" The word \\"yet\\" reflected the fact that four other subjects were still alive in 1975. ==Investigative journalism== Pulitzer Prize–winning author Eileen Welsome wrote extensively about Stevens and other unwitting subjects of similar experiments in The Plutonium Files: America's Secret Medical Experiments in the Cold War in 1999.The Plutonium Files: America's secret medical experiments in the Cold War (Book Review) The New England Journal of Medicine, Volume 341:1941-1942, Harriet A. Washington, December 16, 1999. She had uncovered the stories and published a series of articles in 1993 detailing the identification of CAL-1, CAL-2 (4-year-old Simeon Shaw), CAL-3 (Elmer Allen), and others. Her work brought intense scrutiny on the wartime experiments which made Stevens famous, posthumously, for his contributions to science without informed consent. Shortly after the article was published in November 1993, the Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary, publicly stated that the government should compensate victims.

Founded in 1789 by Spanish and Portuguese Jews as Kahal Kadosh Beth Shalome (Hebrew: Holy Congregation, House of Peace) it is one of the oldest synagogues in the United States.Olitzky, Kerry M.; Raphael, Marc Lee. The American Synagogue: A Historical Dictionary and Sourcebook, Greenwood Press, June 30, 1996, p. 359. ==History== When the congregation was founded, there were 100 Jews in Richmond's population of 3,900. After meeting for some years in leased space, the congregation built its first synagogue in 1822. It was a handsome, if modest, one-story brick building in Georgian style. The community grew and in 1841 the Ashkenazi members founded a new congregation called Beth Ahabah. In 1846 Beth Ahabah established the first Jewish school in Richmond, and 1846 built a synagogue at Eleventh and Marshall Streets. The Congregation moved toward Reform in 1867 with discussion of acquiring an organ, the decision to switch to family pews (mixing men and women) and allowing women to join the choir. Beth Ahabah joined the Reform Movement Union of American Hebrew Congregations in 1875. A new building was erected, also at Eleventh and Marshall, in 1880. In 1898 K.K. Beth Shalome formally merged with Congregation Beth Ahabah. On March 4, 1904 the congregation laid the cornerstone for its present building, known as the Franklin Street Synagogue. The building was dedicated on December 9, 1904. The domed, Neoclassical synagogue was designed by the Richmond-based firm of Noland and Baskervill, who also designed nearby St. James' Church and the wings of the Virginia State Capitol. The synagogue has 29 stained glass windows. Most notable is a window on the building's eastern wall created and signed by the Louis Comfort Tiffany Studios in 1923. It depicts Mt. Sinai. The congregation maintains the Hebrew Cemetery of Richmond and the Cemetery for Hebrew Confederate Soldiers, as well as the original site of the 1789 Franklin Street Burial Grounds, which was the first Jewish cemetery in Virginia. ==Beth Ahabah Museum== Congregation Beth Ahabah is the home of the Beth Ahabah Museum & Archives, located at 1109 West Franklin Street. Established in 1977, the museum's focus is the history and culture of Richmond's Jewish community and the Southern Jewish experience. Three galleries feature changing exhibits. The museum is open from Sunday through Thursday. ==References * Congregation Beth Ahabah * Beth Ahabah Museum & Archives Category:1789 establishments in Virginia Category:18th-century synagogues Category:Ashkenazi Jewish culture in the United States Category:Ashkenazi synagogues Category:European American culture in Virginia Category:Hispanic and Latino American culture in Virginia Category:Reform synagogues in Virginia Category:Religious organizations established in 1789 Category:Sephardi Jewish culture in the United States Category:Spanish and Portuguese Jews Category:Synagogues in Richmond, Virginia Category:Synagogues on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia ","title":"Congregation Beth Ahabah"},{"id":"20419067","text":"The Clinton B.

He was widely credited with killing 75–80 criminals in encounters – most of these were members of the Arun Gawli gang. Salaskar was martyred while fighting terrorists in the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. Captured terrorist Ajmal Amir Kasab claimed responsibility for the killing. Before his death Salaskar was head of the Anti-Extortion Cell, Mumbai. Retrieved 27 November 2008 His patriotism and bravery was honoured with the Ashoka Chakra on 26 January 2009. ==Early life and his career== He joined Bombay Police (now Mumbai Police) as a sub inspector in 1983. India Today reports Salaskar's first lethal encounter occurred during his first year of appointment, when he shot dead Raja Shahabuddin, known to police on several counts. Salaskar, who was reportedly sidelined for the last two years for unearthing the gutka-underworld nexus, was recently attached to the crime branch, where he headed the anti-extortion cell. An officer of the 1983 batch, Salaskar in his 24 years of service had eliminated many criminals. According to sources, the police officer had once even gone hunting for former don Arun Gawli. \\"But Gawli fled from the scene, forcing Salaskar to return empty-handed. However, Salaskar got even by killing his two trusted men, Sada Pawle and Vijay Tandel, in 1997, triggering allegations that the encounters were fake. After this, Gawli was so scared that during the 2005 elections, he complained to the government that Salaskar was trying to kill him and requested that he be transferred,'’ sources said. This is what Salaskar said in 2004 about Gawli.\\" Gawli may have become an MLA. But for me, he continues to remain a former Mumbai don and I have to keep tabs on his activities. If I get any information of his group's involvement in a crime or learn about any shady activity going on at Dagdi Chawl, I will not hesitate to raid his Byculla residence. If I have to arrest him, I will not refrain from doing so. Now that Gawli is an MLA, arresting him will involve certain procedures. I will not bow to any political pressure. I will only take orders from the police commissioner, who is my supreme commander. It was embarrassing that khaki-clad policemen would be deployed to protect Gawli. In the past, we refused him police protection on several occasions. At that time, I had gunned down several of his top henchmen and so he was scared of me. But if Gawli is really reformed, he should not be afraid of me or any other policeman. We do not target innocent persons.\\" ==Death== Salaskar's wife receives the Ashok Chakra from president Pratibha Patil on 26 January 2009. Vijay Salaskar was killed in action by terrorists during the Mumbai attacks, on 26 November 2008. India Express quotes statements by Constable Arun Jadhav, who was with the officers Vijay Salaskar, Ashok Kamte and Hemant Karkare when they died. \\"Witness account of Karkare, Kamte and Salaskar's death\\", India Express, 29 November 2008. The three officers and four constables had received information that Sadanand Date had been wounded while resisting hostile terrorist action at the Cama and Albless Hospital for women and children. Currently located at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), a ten-minute drive from the hospital, they took a Toyota Qualis and proceeded in that direction. Salaskar was driving, Ashok Kamte in the passenger seat, Hemant Karkare in the second row, and the four Constables, including Jadhav, were in the back row of seating. According to Jadhav, five minutes later two terrorists stepped out from behind a tree and opened fire with AK-47 automatic rifles. The six policemen, other than Jadhav, were all killed quickly in the gunfire. The wounded Jadhav had no opportunity to render assistance. The two terrorists approached the vehicle, dumped the bodies of the three officers on the road and, leaving the constables for dead, proceeded to Metro Junction. Upon arrival, they aimed three bursts of automatic fire at police and journalist vehicles drawn up at that location, then drove off towards the government offices (Vidhan Bhawan) in South Mumbai. Here again they fired several times. While attempting to leave the area, one of the tyres of the vehicle burst, so the terrorists departed to obtain another. At this point, Jadhav was able to contact headquarters. The bodies of the dead were promptly recovered and taken to St George Hospital. ==See also== * Sandeep Unnikrishnan * Havaldar Gajendra Singh * Hemant Karkare * Ashok Kamte * Tukaram Omble * Sadanand Date ==References * An interview with Vijay Salaskar * Witness account of Salaskar's death * Humphrey Fellows – bios including Sadanand Date from the official University of Minnesota website Category:2008 deaths Category:Police officers from Mumbai Category:Deaths by firearm in India Category:People associated with the 2008 Mumbai attacks Category:Victims of the 2008 Mumbai attacks Category:Recipients of the Ashoka Chakra (military decoration) Category:Indian police officers killed in the line of duty Category:Marathi people Category:1957 births Category:Ashoka Chakra ","title":"Vijay Salaskar"},{"id":"20419107","text":"Alan Herbert is a Canadian politician and activist, who was an NPA member of Vancouver City Council from 1996 to 1999.

Lilburne later described this as the declaration of Lex Talionis, and it brought about a practical—rather than moral—mutual restraint by the parties to the war on how they treated prisoners of war.Barbara Donagan (2008), War in England 1642-1649, Oxford University Press, , p. 131 ==History== Early in the English Civil War, John Lilburne, a prominent supporter of the Parliamentary cause who because of his radical views was known as \\"Free Born John\\", was captured by the Royalists during the Battle of Brentford while serving as a captain in the Parliamentary army. Moves were taken to try him and two other prisoners of war (Clifton Catesby and Robert Vivers), in the civil court of the Kings Bench as traitors. Elizabeth, Lilburne's wife, appealed to Parliament and on 17 December 1642 Parliament stated that it would hold the Judge and officials of the court responsible for the treatment of the three men, and if they were tried and punished would retaliate in kind against Royalist prisoners of war. This lifted the threat to the men and in May 1643 Lilburne was exchanged for Royalist prisoners of war. Thanks to the declaration of Lex Talionis, in England during the war Royalist prisoners of war were not tried and executed as traitors, but the Parliamentary side were well aware of what could happen if they lost the war, as Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester a Parliamentary general said \\"We may beat the king 99 times, and yet he will be king still.

When they reached rear entrance of the Cama and Albless Hospital (A women and children's hospital) which is next to AMPS, Kamte spotted and fired at terrorists with the terrorists retaliating by throwing hand grenades; with this situation Kamte suggested that they should take on the terrorists from the front entrance of the Cama. At this point the terrorists had left the Cama area before the Kamte's plan could be implemented; during pursuit the police received a report that the terrorists were hiding behind a red car in the same lane. At around the same time a terrorist was spotted running from the area which Kamte fired at, injuring him. The terrorist Ajmal Kasab was the only terrorist to be captured alive during the attacks. As they were about to get down another Pakistani terrorist, Ismail Khan fired a volley of bullets killing all but Asst. Police Inspector Arun Jadhav. Kamte was hit in the head; although he was wearing helmet with no ballistic vest. India Express quotes statements by API Arun Jadhav, who was with the officers Ashok Kamte, Vijay Salaskar and Hemant Karkare when they died. The three officers and four constables had received information that Sadanand Date had been injured in the gunfire at the Cama and Albless Hospital for women and children. Currently located at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), a ten-minute drive from the hospital, they took a Toyota Qualis and proceeded in that direction. Kamte was in the passenger seat, Salaskar driving, Karkare in the second row, and the four Constables, including Jadhav, were in the back row of seating. According to Jadhav, five minutes later two terrorists stepped out from behind a tree and opened fire with AK-47 automatic rifles. Kamte was the sole officer who managed to retaliate, wounding terrorist Ajmal in the arm. The six policemen, other than Jadhav, were all killed quickly in the gunfire. The wounded Jadhav had no opportunity to render assistance. The two terrorists approached the vehicle, dumped the bodies of the three officers on the road and, leaving the constables for dead, proceeded to Metro Junction. Upon arrival, they aimed three bursts of automatic fire at police and journalist vehicles drawn up at that location, then drove off towards the government offices (Vidhan Bhawan) in South Mumbai. Here again they fired several times. While attempting to leave the area, one of the tyres of the vehicle burst, so the terrorists departed to obtain another. At this point, Jadhav was able to contact headquarters. The bodies of the dead were promptly recovered and taken to St George Hospital. Kamte was cremated with state honours at the Vaikunth crematorium on 27 November 2008. ==See also== * Havaldar Gajender Singh * Sandeep Unnikrishnan * Hemant Karkare * Vijay Salaskar * Tukaram Omble * Sadanand Date ==References* Category:1965 births Category:Kodaikanal International School alumni Category:Camp Rising Sun alumni Category:Police officers from Mumbai Category:Indian police officers killed in the line of duty Category:Deaths by firearm in India Category:Terrorism victims in India Category:Victims of the 2008 Mumbai attacks Category:2008 deaths Category:Recipients of the Ashoka Chakra (military decoration) Category:Marathi people Category:Indian Police Service officers Category:State funerals in India Category:Ashoka Chakra ","title":"Ashok Kamte"},{"id":"20419181","text":"The are film-specific prizes awarded by the Hochi Shimbun. == Categories == *Best Picture *Best International Picture *Best Animated Picture (since 2017) *Best Actor *Best Actress *Best Supporting Actor *Best Supporting Actress *Best New Artist *Special Award *Best Director == Winner == {  style=\\"font-size:small;\\" -

A symphonic cycle should not be confused with the closely related song cycle. ==Symphonic cycle as a whole symphonic work== A symphony is essentially cyclic in nature, typically containing four interconnected movements as part of a larger work. At first the movements of a symphony were meant to be distributed among other works -- arias, overtures, concertos -- in extended evening social events at which music served a background or occasionally center role. The movements were meant to be connected and identified as part of the symphonic cycle through recall and quotation of earlier movements, and the finale movement meant to be seen as a destination and recap. It was not until Beethoven that a symphonic cycle came to be seen as a work needing isolated, consecutive play of the constituent movements. ==Symphonic cycle as a set of works== A symphonic cycle may also refer to a set of symphonies linked through a common composer or conductor. For example, the symphonic repertoire of Ludwig van Beethoven, consisting of his nine numbered symphonies, may be wholly referred to as the Beethoven symphonic cycle. Another conception of the symphonic cycle is that of a set of composer's works as performed and recorded on audio/visual media by a common conductor. This practice came into existence with the establishment of audio record companies in the 1920s. A symphonic cycle of particular note is that of Leonard Bernstein's first attempt at providing recordings for the complete symphonic works of Gustav Mahler. The Bernstein–Mahler cycle became an advertising mechanism by which Bernstein championed the revival and critical acceptance of Mahler's music during the 1960s and '70s. Symphonic cycles of various composers are now recorded and sold in this sort of fashion featuring complete sets rendered by a common conductor or performing group. ==References== Category:Symphonies ","title":"Symphonic cycle"},{"id":"20419318","text":"Real Club Deportivo Carabanchel is a Spanish football club from the Carabanchel district in the city of Madrid, Spain. It is the third oldest team in the capital, after Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, and the thirteenth oldest in Spain. The highest level reached by the club was the Segunda División B and on various occasions the team has come close to promotion to the Segunda División. ==History== Real Club Deportivo Carabanchel was officially founded on September 8, 1906. It started playing sports teams friendlies against others in the capital city in the Alto and Bajo quarters of the district. In 1916, Pedro Arranz became president, who gives the team a charter officers. Carabanchel also signed the same year Castellana in the Federation Cup, which began as a regional tournament. In 1927 amounts to the First Regional club, and proclaimed champion Castilla at amateur level in 1936, before the start of the Civil War. In 1955, Carabanchel was promoted, for the first time in its history, to the Third Division to become a champion of the regional division. In season 1966–67, the Madrid team was crowned champions of their group in the Tercera earning the right to play CD Badajoz in the first play-off round, which it lost 12–1 on aggregate. During the 1970s and 1980s the team went through various sporting crises, which were not resolved until 1988 when it returned to the third division. Carabanchel then improved, and finished in third place in the Madrid group in 1990. After several varying seasons, in 1994–95 Carabanchel qualified for the second phase of promotion to B, eventually losing to Cultural Leonesa. Finally, in the 1995–96 season, Carabanchel were promoted to Segunda División B to finish third in regular season champion and its group for promotion. The club spent two years in the category of bronze in its first season, the team from Madrid to enter into a good season when finishing eighth, but in 1998 consume their descent to the finish next to last group. Since then, Carabanchel fell into a deep economic crisis and sports even threatened the existence of the system: in 2006 the Third down to black and white, and without professional staff fell in 2008 he First Regional. In the 2009/2010 season, the club renewed the project with a total change of the board after a motion of censure and creating a team to climb to third division two years. After winning that year's rise to preferences, in the 2010/2011 season promotion to the Third Division was achieved, along with Club Deportivo Colonia Moscardo. Among its historic rivals are CD Colonia Moscardo in Usera, CD Puerta Bonita in Carabanchel, and Getafe CF. ==Logo== The logo represents the Cross of Saint James, pattern Carabanchel, and the Royal Crown, granted by HM Juan Carlos I of Spain in 1997 in recognition of the club's history as one of the pioneers of football in Madrid. This coat is used since then as the officer. ==Kit== Real Carabanchel's kit in season 2010–2011 is a white shirt and black shorts and socks, with the sponsorship of Limpiezas Garro, Joma and Junkers. Features of the shirt are the old coat and Cross of Saint James behind the current shield. At the same time they added the player's name. The away kit is a shirt, shorts and blue socks. It also has a third kit of shirt, shorts and red socks. ==Stadium== R.C.D. Carabanchel plays its games in the stadium known as Campo de La Mina, with a capacity for 2,000 spectators.

Until 2001, it was considered a subspecies of the common brown lemur, E. fulvus. In 2001, E. fulvus was split into several separate species, including Eulemur rufus, in which this species was included. In 2008, E. rufus was split into two species, the red lemur (E. rufus) and the red-fronted lemur (E. rufifrons). E. rufus covers the population on the west coast north of the Tsiribihina River and E. rufifrons covers the population on the west coast south of the Tsiribihina River and the population in eastern Madagascar. The species split was based on genetic and morphological evidence. Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates that E. rufifrons may be more closely related to the common brown lemur (E. fulvus), white-headed lemur (E. albifrons) and Sanford's brown lemur (E. sanfordi) than it is to E. rufus. Two individuals from Kirindy. The red-fronted lemur lives on the western coast of Madagascar between the Tsiribihina River to the north and south of the Fiheranana River and in eastern Madagascar from the Mangoro River and Onive River to the Andringitra Massif. It lives in dry lowland forests. It has a head and body length of and with a tail. Its weight ranges between . It has a gray coat and black face, muzzle and forehead, plus a black line from the muzzle to the forehead, with white eyebrow patches. Males have white or cream colored cheeks and beards, while females have rufous or cream cheeks and beards that are less bushy than males. There is considerable geographic variation in the natural history of this species. Western populations tend to have smaller home ranges and higher population densities than eastern populations, although group size tends to be fairly consistent (generally 4-18 animals averaging of 8-9). None of the studied populations show dominance hierarchies and aggression tends to be low. Diet is diverse, encompassing leaves, seeds, fruit, nectar and flowers, but more so in eastern populations. Western populations tend to rely more on leaves for their diet. Western populations are primarily diurnal, but increase nocturnal activity during the dry season, while eastern populations show less such dichotomy. Reproduction is seasonal. In western populations one male usually monopolizes all the females in the group, while in eastern populations such monopolization is less typical. ==References== Category:True lemurs Category:Mammals described in 1833 ","title":"Red-fronted lemur"},{"id":"20419361","text":"{{Infobox hospital  name = Cama Hospital  org/group =  logo =  logo_size =  image = Cama_Hospital.jpg  image_size = 225  alt =  caption = Building in 1887.  map_type =  relief =  map_size =  map_alt =  map_caption =  location =  region = Mumbai  state = Maharashtra  country = India  coordinates =  healthcare =  funding =  type =  affiliation =  patron =  network =  standards =  emergency =  helipad =  beds = 367  speciality =  founded = 30 July 1886  closed =  demolished =  website =  other_links =  module = }} The Cama & Albless Hospital (originally just Cama Hospital) is a hospital for women and children in the city of Mumbai, India, with 367 beds.

The cavoatrial junction (CAJ) is the point at which the superior vena cava meets and melds into the superior wall of the cardiac right atrium. Both the superior and inferior vena cavae enter the right atrium, but only the superior entry is called the cavoatrial junction. This junction marks the inferior end of the superior vena cava, the continuation below that point being considered part of the heart. For purposes of radiographic visualization, the most reliable indicator of junction location is to find the carina, then observe the vertebrae it overlies. The junction will lie two vertebral body units (VBUs) below the carina, counting the single intervertebral disc between them, but not the disc below them. It has been demonstrated that the more ordinary method of looking for the \\"bulge\\" in the cardiac outline is unreliable, since cardiac or other thoracic pathology can shift the apparent position of that landmark. Hospitalized patients may need to receive solutions and medications that, if given through an ordinary intravenous therapy catheter, would severely damage both blood cells and the vascular system. In these cases, it is common to insert a central venous catheter. All such catheters placed for the purpose of venous access and being inserted in the upper body will ideally have the tip placed within the superior vena cava at or just above the cavoatrial junction. Passing the line through the junction and into the atrium is avoided by some practitioners, as they fear the result may be cardiac arrythmias and even cardiac tamponade, a potentially fatal outcome. However, other practitioners prefer the proximal RA and state that there is no evidence of harm. Modern catheter tip verification systems often rely on ECG readouts which correlate with tip position. A chest xray may still be obtained to confirm or when an ECG is contraindicated. ==References== * * Category:Human anatomy Category:Veins of the torso ","title":"Cavoatrial junction"},{"id":"20419475","text":"Robert Henry Strotz (September 26, 1922 – November 9, 1994) was an American economist who served as the 13th President of Northwestern University from 1970 to 1984.

Upon German's defeat, Strotz served a brief stint as an economist-statistician in Berlin where he \\"estimated necessary food imports to feed the German population\\". == Career == In 1945 Strotz returned to the University of Chicago as a graduate student in economics. He supported himself by teaching economics courses to returning G.I.'s for the University of Illinois at Navy Pier. In 1947 Strotz joined Northwestern University's economics department as an instructor while pursuing his Ph.D. at University of Chicago. He earned his Ph.D. at University of Chicago in 1951 for his dissertation on welfare economics under future Nobel Prize–winning economist Tjalling Koopmans. In 1955 - 1956 Strotz, whose specialty was econometrics, studied at major centers of econometric research in the Netherlands, England, and Sweden on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. He was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1958 and 1959. Outside of his university career, Strotz was an editor of Econometrica, International Economic Review, and Economic Analysis. He also served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as well as director of six publicly traded companies including USG Corporation and the National Merit Scholarship Program. ===Northwestern University=== Strotz was promoted to full professor by 1958, and served as Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences from 1966 to 1970. In 1970, Strotz was named President of Northwestern. He assumed the office after it was vacated 15 months earlier by his predecessor, J. Roscoe Miller, in the midst of intense campus protests. While Strotz's appointment was opposed by the Daily Northwestern and Associated Student Government president owing to his positions opposing the closure of campus during a strike and politicization of university classes, he was supported by the faculty. Strotz served in the position until 1984 and was succeeded by Arnold R. Weber. Following his presidency, Strotz was appointed university chancellor and led fundraising and alumni relations efforts until 1990. == Personal life == Strotz died in a nursing home in Deerfield, Illinois, on November 9, 1994. He had four daughters, one son, and thirteen grandchildren. ==References== Category:Presidents of Northwestern University Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Rockefeller Fellows Category:1922 births Category:1994 deaths Category:20th-century economists Category:Economics journal editors ","title":"Robert H.

He chaired the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Oversight of the Troubled Asset Relief Program; he was the second and final person to hold the position, succeeding then-law-school-professor Elizabeth Warren. Kaufman is a Democrat. Kaufman was appointed to the Senate to fill the term of longtime Senator Joe Biden, who was elected Vice President of the United States in 2008. Prior to becoming a U.S. Senator, Kaufman had served as an adviser to Biden for much of his political career. ==Early life, education, and business career== Kaufman was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Helen (née Carroll), a teacher, and Manuel Kaufman, a social worker. His father was of Russian Jewish ancestry and his mother was of Irish descent.Edward E. “Ted” Kaufman roots He was raised in his mother's Catholic religion. Kaufman graduated Central High School in Philadelphia, earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Duke University, and a Master of Business Administration degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Kaufman originally moved to Delaware in 1966 to work for DuPont as an engineer. ==Work for Joe Biden== In 1972 he joined Joe Biden's long-shot U.S. Senate campaign on a volunteer basis. After Biden's surprise victory in 1972, he took a one-year leave of absence from DuPont to organize and head Senator Biden's Delaware Office. In 1976 he became Biden's Chief of Staff/Administrative Assistant and served until 1995, also working on Biden's subsequent Senate campaigns. Most recently, Kaufman was chosen to head Biden's transition team, should he win the 2020 Presidential Election. Prior to serving as a U.S. Senator, Kaufman was a member of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) – the independent, autonomous, federal entity responsible for all U.S. government and government sponsored non-military international broadcasting. He was appointed to the BBG by Presidents Clinton and Bush and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate for four terms. ==U.S. Senate (2008–2010)Appointment=== On November 24, 2008, Delaware Governor Ruth Ann Minner announced her intention to appoint Kaufman to replace Biden in the Senate. He was appointed on January 15, 2009, the same day Biden resigned his seat, and was sworn in the next day. Kaufman served in the Senate until his successor, Chris Coons, was elected in a special election in 2010 to finish out the term. Kaufman chose not to run for a full term. Kaufman inherited appointments to the same two committees that his predecessor, Biden, had served on before his resignation – the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on the Judiciary. ===Tenure=== Early in his term, Kaufman supported the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The stimulus package has meant more than $800 million in federal funding to support Delaware's economic recovery. In July 2009, Kaufman participated in the Senate Judiciary Committee's Supreme Court nomination hearing for Judge Sonia Sotomayor. During the hearing, Kaufman's line of questioning focused on the current Court's recent treatment of business cases and on Judge Sotomayor's judicial approach. Kaufman voted to send Judge Sotomayor's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/yb/133516617&usg;=AFQjCNFsgTAU8zf2DMtQsn2gk7gCMF- lkA In June 2010 Kaufman participated in the Senate Judiciary Committee's Supreme Court nomination hearing for Judge Elena Kagan. Kaufman voted to send Judge Kagan's nomination to the full Senate for a vote. In response to his perception that \\"people just feel it's perfectly okay to denigrate federal employees\\", Kaufman gave speeches once a week starting in May 2009 praising a different federal employee until the end of his term. Kaufman was succeeded by Chris Coons, a Democrat, after Coons defeated Republican nominee Christine O'Donnell in November 2010. Kaufman resigned and Coons took office on November 15, 2010, in accordance with Delaware state law and Senate rules. Financial industry As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kaufman introduced bipartisan legislation with Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to strengthen tools and increase resources available to federal prosecutors to combat financial fraud. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA) was signed into law by President Obama on May 20, 2009.https://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=460597&keyword;=&phrase;=&contain;= Kaufman had sought to further restore confidence in the U.S. financial markets by introducing bipartisan legislation to address abusive short selling and other market manipulation. Kaufman urged the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to consider reinstating the \\"uptick rule\\" – which aids market stability and hampers price discovery. He gave multiple floor statements and written numerous letters to the agency with Senate colleagues on this issue, as well as the need for a pre-borrow requirement or a \\"hard locate\\" system for short sales. In 2010, Kaufman, along with Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), introduced an amendment to the then-proposed Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, known as the Brown–Kaufman amendment. The amendment would have limited the nondeposit liabilities of banks to two percent of gross domestic product, effectively curtailing the size to which banks could grow. Kaufman stated on the Senate floor his intention to recapture the spirit of the Glass–Steagall Act, passed in 1933, which had been rescinded in 1999. The amendment failed in a Senate vote of 61 to 33 on May 6, 2010. Foreign affairs In April 2009, Kaufman took his first trip to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, where he visited with U.S. troops, foreign leaders, and others to examine U.S. strategy in the region. He is a co-sponsor of the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009, which will triple non-military aid to Pakistan, providing $1.5 billion per year for development over the next five years. Kaufman has also stressed the need for increased civilian-military training focused on counterinsurgency and stability operations as essential to success in Afghanistan, introducing an amendment to the 2009 Defense Supplemental Appropriations Bill with Senators Richard Lugar (R-IN) and Jack Reed (D-RI). Kaufman has since visited Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan twice more. In May 2009, Kaufman visited Israel, Syria and Turkey to discuss regional security issues and areas of mutual interest and cooperation. He met with foreign government and military officials, political leaders and civil society representatives. During the 2009–2010 Iranian election protests, Kaufman introduced a resolution supporting the protesters that was unanimously passed in the Senate. Kaufman also introduced the Victim of Iranian Censorship Act (VOICE) as an amendment to the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act. The VOICE Act – unanimously adopted by the Senate – supports similar objectives and authorizes funding for the Broadcasting Board of Governors to expand transmission capability and programming on Radio Farda and the Persian News Network. Kaufman spoke out for freedom of the press in China. Education reform Kaufman sponsored the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (\\"STEM\\") Education Coordination Act to establish a committee to coordinate the efforts of Federal STEM education programs. Kaufman also supported the Edward M. Kennedy National Service Act, which provides increased service opportunities for engineers and scientists to help inspire a new generation of science and technology students. In 2010 Kaufman was presented with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers 2010 President's Award for his work on promoting STEM education. ===Committee assignments=== *Committee on Armed Services *Committee on Foreign Relations **Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South and Central Asian Affairs **Subcommittee on African Affairs **Subcommittee on International Operations and Organizations, Human Rights, Democracy and Global Women's Issues **Subcommittee on European Affairs *Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs *Committee on the Judiciary **Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts **Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights **Subcommittee on the Constitution **Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs **Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security *Impeachment Trial Committee on the Articles against Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. ==Congressional Oversight Panel (2010–2011)== Senator Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, appointed Kaufman to replace Elizabeth Warren on the Congressional Oversight Panel on October 1, 2010. Three days later, Kaufman was unanimously elected as the panel's second chairman, succeeding Warren in that capacity as well. He remained chairman of the panel despite the expiration of his Senate term. ==Post-Senate career== Since 1991, Kaufman has taught a course on the United States Congress in the law school of his alma mater, Duke University as well as \\"Government, Business, and Public Policy in the Global Economy\\" for law and business students at Duke. From 1995 to 1999 he was Co-Chair of the Duke Law School Center for the Study of the Congress. Kaufman is currently a member of the board of trustees of the Institute of International Education He is also Co-Chair of the Delaware STEM Council In September 2014, Kaufman joined the board of directors of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs. ==Personal== Kaufman and his wife, Lynne, have been married since 1960 and reside in Wilmington. They have three daughters, Kelly, Murry, and Meg, and seven grandchildren. He was a member of the Board of Directors of Children and Families First, WHYY, and the Board of Trustees of Christiana Care. ==References  *Senator Ted Kaufman official U.S. Senate website (archived) *Duke University School of Law *Kaufman Bill to Punish Financial Fraud Passes Senate *Passage of Edward M.

Divas are a football team in the Women's Football Alliance. Based in the Washington Metropolitan Area, the Divas play their home games at The St. James Sports Complex in Springfield VA. Formerly, the Divas played at Eastern High School in Washington DC; Largo High School in Largo MD; the Prince George's Sports and Learning Complex in Landover (where the NFL's Washington Football Team's home stadium FedExField is located), and at John R. Lewis High School (known at the time as Lee High School) in Springfield VA. ==History2001=== The Divas were formed in 2000 as one of the ten charter franchises of the National Women's Football Association. The Divas were the first women's football team in the nation's capital and were coached by Ezra Cooper. The Divas' first win came on May 13, 2001, with a 10-6 victory at home over the Connecticut Crush. The Divas finished their inaugural season with a 3-4 record, the team's only losing season to date. ===2002=== The Divas were purchased by Lee Fahringer and Kelly George before their second season. The Divas finished the 2002 season with a 5-3 record, the first of six consecutive winning seasons for the team. A chance at the Divas' first playoff berth came down their final game of the year, but the Divas fell short of the Baltimore Burn in their season finale, 6-0. ===2003=== The 2003 season is considered by many to be the birth of the Divas' dynasty. Finishing the regular-season 7-1, the team clinched their first of five consecutive playoff berths and division titles. After defeating the Connecticut Crush in their first ever playoff game, the Divas fell to the Philadelphia Phoenix in the conference semifinals. The Divas' Donna Wilkinson became the first running back in women's football history to eclipse 1,000 rushing yards in a single season, totaling 1,267 rushing yards in 2003. That year, the Divas were featured on CBS Evening News.D.C. Divas on CBS EVENING NEWS 2003 - YouTube ===2004=== Winning their second consecutive division title by finishing 8-0, the Divas clinched home- field advantage throughout the Northern Conference playoffs. After defeating the Southwest Michigan Jaguars in the conference semifinals, the Divas lost to the eventual NWFA champions, the Detroit Demolition, in the Northern Conference championship game, 20-14. Following the season, the Divas played in a charity game against a men's team assembled by The Sports Junkies, who host a local syndicated sports radio show. Although the Divas lost, 28-6, the contest set a new record for the highest attendance at a women's football game, as 8,200 fans came to the event. Later that offseason, the Divas had a second ownership change when Paul Hamlin, father of Divas' quarterback Allyson Hamlin, bought the team. ===2005=== For the second consecutive season, the Divas finished the regular season with a perfect 8-0 record. For the second straight year, however, they were handed their first defeat of the season in the Northern Conference championship game by eventual NWFA champion Detroit. After that season, the Divas moved from Eastern High School in Washington, D.C. to the new Prince George's Sports and Learning Complex in nearby Landover, Maryland, and a new uniform design was also unveiled. These changes set the stage for the biggest moment in the franchise's history. ===2006=== As was the case the past two seasons, the Divas finished 2006 with a perfect 8-0 regular season record and advanced to the conference championship game. Unlike '04 and '05, however, the Divas won the conference championship, defeating the Columbus Comets and advancing their first ever league championship game. The Divas traveled to Pittsburgh to take on the Oklahoma City Lightning for the 2006 NWFA national championship. The Divas capped an 11-0 season with a 28-7 victory over the Lightning for the team's first ever league championship. Running back Rachelle Pecovsky and linebacker Ivy Tillman received the game's MVP honors on offense and defense, respectively. ===2007=== Before the 2007 season, the Divas left the NWFA to join the Independent Women's Football League. The Divas were just as successful in this new league, however, finishing with an 8-0 regular season record for the fourth straight year and capturing the Mid-Atlantic Division title. However, their playoff run ended abruptly when the Divas lost in the conference semifinal round to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Atlanta Xplosion. ===2008=== 2008 was a disappointing year for the Divas. The season began with a loss to the Boston Militia, 27-22, which snapped the Divas' 32-game regular season winning streak. That was a sign of things to come, as the Divas lost four games in 2008, each by six points or less. They finished the year with a 4-4 record, their worst since 2001. Because of that record, the Divas failed to win their division and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2002. ===2009=== Rebounding from the 2008 season, the Divas returned to their winning ways in 2009. The Divas compiled a perfect 8-0 regular season record for the fifth time and claimed the Mid-Atlantic division title. The Divas had home field advantage throughout the playoffs, but because of a scheduling conflict at their home field, they had to travel to Boston to play the Militia in the 2009 IWFL Eastern Conference championship game. In a thrilling game, the Divas defeated the Militia, 27-21, giving the franchise just their second conference championship (and their first in the IWFL). On July 25, the Divas went to Round Rock, Texas, a suburb of Austin, to play for the 2009 IWFL World Championship. The Western Conference champion Kansas City Tribe pulled a 21-18 upset and handed the Divas their first loss of the season, taking home the IWFL championship in the process. ===2010=== 2010 was another successful season for the Divas. Despite finishing the regular season at 5-3 (two games behind the 7-1 Atlanta Xplosion), a stronger overall schedule gave the Divas the division crown, their seventh in team history. The Divas then justified their place in the division in the conference semifinals, defeating the Xplosion, 35-7, and getting some revenge for the playoff loss in 2007. However, it was the Militia who got revenge in the 2010 Eastern Conference championship game, avenging the previous season's defeat by eliminating the Divas; the Militia went on to win the 2010 IWFL national championship. That season, the Divas were featured on CNN as part of a team profile.CNN profiles the D.C. Divas - YouTube Also that season, former Diva wide receiver Natalie Randolph made national headlines as one of the first female head coaches of a high school football team. ===2011=== Along with many of their archrivals, the D.C. Divas moved from the IWFL to the Women's Football Alliance for the 2011 season. In their first year in the new league, the Divas didn't slow down, easily winning the Northeast Division with a 7-1 record. However, for the second year in a row, the eventual league champion Boston Militia ended the Divas' season by knocking them out of the playoffs. After the season, the Divas made a change, hiring Alison Fischer as their new head coach. Fischer played on the Divas' first team in 2001 and became one of the few female head coaches in women's pro football. ===2012=== In a situation similar to 2010, the Divas, with a 5-3 record, claimed a division title over 7-1 Pittsburgh thanks to a stronger strength of schedule. Once again, the Divas proved that was the correct decision by defeating Pittsburgh in the playoffs and advancing to the conference semifinals. For the fourth straight year, the Divas clashed with the Boston Militia in the playoffs, and for the third straight time, the Militia came out on top, this time by a 55-34 score. But this time emotions spilled over, and the game ended in a bench-clearing brawl which attracted negative media attention and resulted in several suspensions by the league against Divas players. ===2013=== For the third time in four seasons, the Divas finished the regular season with a 5-3 record. The Divas also won their tenth division title, which tied the record for the most division championships all-time in women's football by a single franchise. The D.C. Divas advanced to the conference semifinals, where they were eliminated for the fourth consecutive season by the Boston Militia. ===2014=== The D.C. Divas began their 14th season of play on April 5, 2014. ===2015=== The D.C. Divas were undefeated in the regular season, post-season, and beat the Dallas Elite for the national championship. Quarterback Allyson Hamlin threw her 200th touchdown and crossed the 13,000 yards passing mark for her career. ==Season- by-season== -  colspan=\\"6\\" align=\\"center\\"  D.C.

These major hurricanes were Bertha, Edouard, Fran, Hortense, Isidore, and Lili. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation. The timeline also includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, has been included. The season officially began on June 1, 1996, and ended on November 30 that same year. The season's most destructive storms were Hurricane Cesar, Hurricane Fran, and Hurricane Hortense. Hurricane Cesar (later known as Hurricane Douglas in the Eastern Pacific basin) was the deadliest storm of the season; it killed at least 51 people and caused severe damage in northern Colombia and southern Central America. Hurricane Fran caused $3.2 billion (1996 USD; $4 billion 2009 USD) worth of damage in the United States, mostly in North Carolina, and killed 26 people. Hurricane Hortense dropped torrential rainfall on southwestern Puerto Rico and the eastern Dominican Republic, killing 21 people and leaving behind $127 million (1996 USD; $174 million 2009 USD) in damage. All three storms had their names retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 1997, and were replaced with Cristobal, Fay, and Hanna for the 2002 season, respectively. ==Timeline of storms== ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1996 till:01/12/1996 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1996 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0-62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39-73_mph_(63-117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74-95_mph_(118-153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96-110_mph_(154-177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111-130_mph_(178-209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131-155_mph_(210-249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:11 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:17/06/1996 till:21/06/1996 color:TS text: \\"Arthur\\" from:05/07/1996 till:14/07/1996 color:C3 text: \\"Bertha\\" from:24/07/1996 till:29/07/1996 color:C1 text: \\"Cesar\\" from:19/08/1996 till:26/08/1996 color:C1 text: \\"Dolly\\" from:19/08/1996 till:03/09/1996 color:C4 text: \\"Edouard\\" from:23/08/1996 till:08/09/1996 color:C3 text: \\"Fran\\" barset:break from:26/08/1996 till:02/09/1996 color:TS text: \\"Gustav\\" from:03/09/1996 till:15/09/1996 color:C4 text: \\"Hortense\\" from:24/09/1996 till:01/10/1996 color:C3 text: \\"Isidore\\" from:04/10/1996 till:08/10/1996 color:TS text: \\"Josephine\\" from:11/10/1996 till:12/10/1996 color:TS text: \\"Kyle\\" from:14/10/1996 till:27/10/1996 color:C3 text: \\"Lili\\" barset:break from:16/11/1996 till:24/11/1996 color:C1 text: \\"Marco\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1996 till:01/07/1996 text:June from:01/07/1996 till:01/08/1996 text:July from:01/08/1996 till:01/09/1996 text:August from:01/09/1996 till:01/10/1996 text:September from:01/10/1996 till:01/11/1996 text:October from:01/11/1996 till:01/12/1996 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale)\\" ===June=== ;June 1 :*12:00 am EDT (0400 UTC) – The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins. ;June 17 Tropical Storm Arthur near landfall in North Carolina on June 19 :*2:00 pm EDT (1600 UTC) – Tropical depression One forms near eastern Grand Bahama. ;June 18 :*8:00 pm EDT (0000 UTC June 19) – Tropical depression One strengthens into Tropical Storm Arthur. ;June 19 :*8:00 pm EDT (0000 UTC June 20) – Tropical Storm Arthur makes landfall near Cape Lookout on the North Carolina Outer Banks with 40 mph (65 km/h)The figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5 units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following the convention used in the National Hurricane Center's operational products for each storm.

The words are by poet and playwright Edmond Rostand. It was written as a 'house-warming' gift for Jules \\"Tergis\\" Griset, industrialist and keen cellist (member of the famous Geloso Quartet with Albert Géloso, Pierre Monteux and Bloch), to whom it is dedicated ('to inaugurate the house of a friend'). It was first performed in November 1890 at Griset's house (then Place de Laborde, now 12 Place Henri-Bergson, Paris) by the Société Chorale d'Amateurs Guillot de Sainbris with Chabrier at the piano. The first public performance was on 23 March 1891 with Mme Rachel-Pascaline Leroux-RibeyreWife of the composer Xavier Leroux and the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Édouard Colonne at the Théâtre du Châtelet. It was also performed at the Concerts du Conservatoire on the 22 and 29 January 1893 with Éléonore Blanc (who would create the role of Briséïs four years later) as soloist, conducted by Paul Taffanel. The orchestral manuscript is now in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. The music (marked Andantino, molto con affetto) is in Chabrier's tenderest, most lyrical vein, entirely free from any suggestion of eccentricity or pseudo-Wagnerian grandiloquence. Myers points out bold touches, such as when the altos, over a pedal f# in the orchestra reiterate for four long 9/8 bars the words 'musique adorable' on the same note, while the soloist and other voices weave round them an expressive melodic figure starting on G natural. He adds \\"its limpid and mellifluous accents are completely innocent of any of those undercurrents of irony, bravura or humorous exaggeration which have come to be accepted as the hallmarks of his very idiosyncratic style\\". À la musique was a favourite piece of Claude Debussy and was chosen by Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht to open the concert he conducted to inaugurate the new Théâtre des Champs-Élysées on 2 April 1913.Inghelbrecht D-É. Mouvement Contraire (Chapter XV, 1912-13). Editions Domat, Paris, 1947. Present at the rehearsal for this concert, Debussy asked the conductor to play it again – just for the pleasure of hearing it.In his book Comment on ne doit pas interpréter Carmen, Faust et Pelléas, (Paris, Heugel, 1933), Inghelbrecht closes his commentary by quoting a verse from À la musique. À la musique is scored for an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 B flat clarinets, 2 bassoons; 4 horns in F, 2 trumpets in F, 3 trombones; timpani, triangle; 2 harps, violins, violas, cellos and double basses. ==References== Delage R.

A sub-niche is small group of individuals removed from mainstream marketplace. A niche market may become so large that it may seem that it is part of a mainstream group when actuality it is still a niche. It can then be divided into a smaller group of individuals within the niche itself. ==Etymology== The term \\"sub-niche\\" was first used by internet marketers to describe people or products in the market who are in very small niches. When used in business a sub-niche is targeted for selling products or services that are more suited for these individuals than the larger niche. ==Marketing for and in sub-niche markets== Sub-Niche Marketing is the process of finding niche markets where the individuals can be broken down into smaller subsets of the niche itself. Usually this occurs in larger niche markets where the niche may no longer be targeted enough to satisfy the entire population of that niche. While the product and/or services provided by that particular niche serve to fulfill a need it may not to so to the highest degree. In this case a sub- niche would serve this purpose. ==Online sub-niche marketing== This technique is often used by affiliate marketers. The sub-niche is a more profitable group based in the internet market as opposed to a tangible marketplace because of the specificity required in targeting such a market. Online business has little start up cost and can afford and even target multiple sub-niche markets to create a steady form of revenue. The technique of sub-niche marketing is duplicated in multiple markets to achieve the desired amount of income. ==References== Category:Market segmentation ","title":"Sub-niche market"},{"id":"20419869","text":"Thiago Alves is one of eight Brazilian players to have won the singles event in seventeen editions Janko Tipsarević, then representing Serbia and Montenegro took the singles title in 2004Eventual World No. 1 in doubles Nenad Zimonjić, competing for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, won the singles event in 2000 The BH Tennis Open International Cup is a professional tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts.

He also appeared at List A level for Staffordshire and Minor Counties. Webster played briefly for Derbyshire's Second XI in 1979, but he made his first-class debut for Worcestershire against Kent at Canterbury at the very end of the 1981 season. In a weather-affected match he bowled six wicketless overs and scored 6. In 1982 Webster began the year in the seconds, but made his way into the first team by mid-season, and once there retained his place for most of the rest of the summer. His best performance came against Hampshire in August, when he took his career-best of 5/87 in the first innings, then (batting at ten) stayed with number 11 Stephen Perryman as the two added 6 to complete a one-wicket victory. However, he was unable to match this feat, and by the end of the year was back in the Second XI, where he never returned, due to spinal injury. After another game for Derbyshire II, in 1985 he joined Staffordshire to play minor counties cricket, and stayed with them until the end of the 1980s, also playing six times for the Minor Counties representative side in the Benson & Hedges Cup. With Staffordshire he obtained his best List A figures, 4/38 against Nottinghamshire in the NatWest Trophy in 1985. In 1989 he was part of the Old Hill side which narrowly lost the Cockspur Cup final to Teddington. ==NotesReferences== * * Category:English cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Staffordshire cricketers Category:Minor Counties cricketers Category:1959 births Category:Living people ","title":"Andrew Webster (cricketer)"},{"id":"20419882","text":"The London Pensions Fund Authority (LPFA) is a leading local government pension fund fund administrator. It was formed in 1989 to fill the gap left by the 1986 dissolution of the Greater London Council (GLC) in administering that body's Pension Fund. It has taken on residual responsibilities for the employees of several other defunct organisations, including the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) and the London Residuary Body (LRB). In 2016 LPFA created the Local Pensions Partnership (LPP) in collaboration with Lancashire County Pension Fund to pool resources and improve management for the benefit of their members and employers. The LPP was set up to be open to other Local Government Pension Scheme and public sector funds in the UK. As of June 2017, the LPFA itself had around £4.6 billion of assets under management on behalf of around 18,000 current employees and around 34,000 pensioners who mainly worked for the Greater London Council and Inner London Education Authority. Throughout its existence as a well known public sector pension scheme, the LPFA has been a key figure in influencing the Local Government Pension Scheme for local government employees and others across the United Kingdom and is described by Bloomberg, as among \\"the world's biggest investors\\" It contributes to debates on issues related to the world economy and has a public commitment to responsible investment, In 2008, it was an active part of a major global coalition of large institutional investors highlighting concerns about the economic impacts of global climate change. ==See also== * UK labour law * Shareholders in the United Kingdom ==References * London Pensions Fund Authority * Local Government Pension Scheme Category:Investment in the United Kingdom Category:Public pension funds in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations established in 1989 ","title":"London Pensions Fund Authority"},{"id":"20419888","text":"The Amsterdamse Bos (English: Amsterdam Forest) is an English park or landscape park in the municipalities of Amstelveen and Amsterdam. Although most of the park is located in Amstelveen, the owner of the park is the City of Amsterdam. The park was mainly built in the early 1930s, mostly by the unemployment relief. Because of World War II interrupting the building process, the last tree was not planted until the 1970s. Annually, almost 4.5 million people visit the park, which has a size of and is approximately three times the size of Central Park in New York City. It houses a number of animal parks, sporting clubs, rowing courses, gardens and remembrance monuments. Throughout the decades, the location has seen different gatherings, political manifestations and (i.a., free) concerts. These often took place on the so- called Vietnam Meadow. Despite extensive protests, this part was turned into a tennis venue in 1994. The park is bisected (but can not be reached by) the A9 motorway. == Amenities  Bosbaan === An important part of the park is the rowing course called de Bosbaan (\\"Forest course\\"), which was opened in 1937. The course was an alternative for rowing on the Amstel river, or on the canal surrounding the polder of the Haarlemmermeer, which were the two traditional locations for rowing competition. It is the world's oldest artificial rowing course. In 1977 it hosted the World Rowing championships. In order to meet international competition regulation, the Bosbaan was widened to 118 meters (8 lanes for competition and an additional preparation lane). In 2014 the Bosbaan hosted the World Rowing Championship for a second time. === Recreational areas === There are several open areas and meadows within the forest. Some of which are located along an artificial beach along ponds and have sanitary, food and children's play facilities for summertime recreation. One of the open areas is bordered by a man-made hill. The area of the park called Zonneweide is an area designated for naturist recreation. === Swimming === There are several ponds and streams that can be used for swimming. There is a sand beach along a part of Grote Vijver pond. Weather conditions permitting, the water in the Groot Kinderbad children's paddling pool is activated from May until September. === Farms === Geitenboerderij Riddammerhoeve is a goat farm. Next to offering simple food dishes and making goat milk-based dairy products on site, it offers a petting zoo with goats, a playground and a maze. Boerderij Meerzicht features a pancake restaurant and deer watching. === Open air theatre === In the open air Amsterdamse Bos Theater paid concerts and plays are held during the Summer period. === Scottish Highlanders === To combat the forestation in some areas, Scottish Highland cattle have been placed in the park. Locked in the area by cattle grids, they make sure the meadow doesn't grow to become a forest while remaining a natural look that could not be achieved by mowing. === Rental facilities === Canoes, kayaks and bicycles can be rented at several locations. === Camping === At the Day Camping people can put up a tent for a day. For longer stays there is Camping Amsterdamse Bos, a campsite that rents out sites for tents, caravans, campervans and has campsite facilities. It is not permitted to stay the night and sleep anywhere else in the forest. ==Image gallery== File:Buitenveldert West, Amsterdamse Bos - panoramio.jpgBlossom Park in Amstelveen File:Bosbaan.jpgBosbaan rowing course File:Amsterdamse Bos - panoramio.jpgThe forest in November File:De Heuvel in Bosplan, Bestanddeelnr 919-4863.jpgThe Hill in 1966 File:Bootjes op de Bosbaan, Bestanddeelnr 912-4208.jpgBoat race in 1961 ==References * *Live weather in Amsterdamse Bos Category:Forests of the Netherlands Category:Parks in Amsterdam Category:Nude beaches ","title":"Amsterdamse Bos"},{"id":"20419909","text":"Parkhurst is a historic home at Harwood, Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

BBC was a House of Lords case on the extent to which matters of good taste and decency are sufficient to justify the censorship of a party political broadcast. The ProLife Alliance had submitted a video that showed the results of an abortion. The video was held to violate statutory regulations requiring public broadcasts to be decent. After extensive legal proceedings, the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the ProLife Alliance. However, the decision was overturned by the House of Lords. ==Facts== The ProLife Alliance is an advocacy group, and until 2004 a political party, that campaigns for \\"absolute respect for innocent human life from fertilisation until natural death and therefore opposes abortion, euthanasia, destructive embryo research and human cloning.\\" (Paragraph 2 of the Court of Appeal judgment) In 1997, the ProLife Alliance had enough support to be granted a Public Election Broadcast (PEB), subject to rules set out by the BBC, Independent Television Commission (ITC) and the Electoral Commission. The ProLife Alliance submitted a video that was graphic in nature. The video, the HL said, showed \\"the products of a suction abortion: tiny limbs, bloodied and dismembered, a separated head, their human shape and form plainly recognisable. There are some pictures showing the results of the procedures undertaken to procure an abortion at later stages... They are, I think, certainly disturbing to any person of ordinary sensibilities.\\" The broadcasters declined to show the video, on the grounds that it could have been offensive or disturbing to a large number of viewers.

This operation was regarded by both Cyprus and Greece as a necessary interdiction against a threat by Turkish Cypriot militia, who were using Kokkina as a beachhead by which to land supplies and weapons shipped from Turkey. The Cyprus National Guard forces were under the command of General George Grivas, with the blessing of Athens. A combined land and sea attack was launched against Kokkina using two Cyprus Navy R-151 Group patrol boats, the Phaethon (commander - Second Leuthenant Dimitrios Mitsatsos) and the Arion, manned by Greek navy personnel./ Unknown bombardment of Patrol boat \\"Phaethon\\" in Cyprus 1964, in Greek Firing 40mm and 20mm shells, the two patrol boats bombarded the enclave for a period of time, in conjunction with land-based 25-pounder artillery.Cyprus, 1955-1973 By Tom Cooper, www.acig.org The battle was well underway on 8 August, when the Turkish Air Force commenced its own attack with fighter aircraft, making numerous strafing passes of Greek Cypriot positions. The vessel Phaethon was struck by rocket fire and burst into flames, forcing the crew to deliberately run it aground near Xeros Harbour. Seven of the crewmembers on Phaethon were killed and several wounded in the attack, and the ship was unsalvageable and later stricken.Cyprus 100 Years Alex Efthyvoulou, Laiki Cultural Bank Archive The second R-151 Group patrol boat, Arion, was attacked by the same Turkish fighter jet formations, and was reportedly struck several times by strafing fire, but escaped to Paphos. During the attack on the Arion, a Turkish F-100 Super Sabre, piloted by Captain Cengiz Topel, was struck by 40mm anti-aircraft fire and shot down. The pilot ejected over land but was promptly captured and lynched by members of the Cyprus National Guard. ===Naval organization in 1970=== MTB's flotilla: * First squadron; base - Boghazi; boats: T-4, T-5, T-6 * Second squadron; base - Kyrenia; boats: T-1, T-2, T-3 * Patrol Boats squadron; base - Boghazi; boats: Leventis, Dedalos * Four radar stations (range of detection 45 nautical miles) * Naval stations at Famagusta, Xylophagos, Limassol, Paphos * Underwater Demolitions Unit (Boghazi naval base) ===Cypriot naval vessels from 1964 to 1974=== {  border=\\"1\\" - !

Makarios escaped an initial attempt to capture him at the Archbishiporic in Nicosia, and fled to Paphos. A naval patrol vessel, Leventis (pennant number 15) was quickly dispatched to Paphos to begin shelling a radio station there which was being operated by pro- Makarios elements.Cyprus 1974 - The Greek coup and the Turkish invasion, Makarios Drousiotis, Hellenic Distribution Agency On 20 July 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus in a surprise-attack, without issuing a declaration of war. A naval force of Turkish vessels was detected by coastal radar at Apostolos Andreas approaching the coast, and a second force of naval vessels was sighted off the coast of Kyrenia during the early hours. The Cyprus National Guard Naval Command quickly ordered its two motor torpedo boats, T-1 (commander - Lieutenant Junior Grade Nicolaos Verikios) and T-3 (commander - Lieutenant Elefterios Tsomakis), (based at Kyrenia) to attack the Turkish flotilla directly. Both vessels were promptly sunk by combined air and sea attack. The rest of the Cyprus Navy vessels were sunk by their own crews at Naval base \\"Chrysulis\\" in Boghazi (14.08.1974). After the conflict, two boats were refloated by Turkish troops and transferred to Golcuk Naval Museum, Turkey (on display with pennant numbers 11 and 12).http://www.turkishnavy.info/thumbnails.php?album=12 ===Developments from 1975 to 2008=== In 1983, the Navy acquired a single Type 32L Esterel fast patrol craft from France.Jane's Fighting Ships 2004-2005; ; p.167 The vessel has been upgraded, and has heavy armament, including two 2-round Mistral- SIMBAD air-defence missile launchers, 1 40mm .70cal OTO-Breda-Bofors AA cannon and 1 20mm .90cal Rheinmetall AA cannon.The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World: Their Ships, Aircraft, and Systems By Eric Wertheim Published by Naval Institute Press, 2007 , 9781591149552 Later (circa 2006-2008) 40mm .70cal OTO-Breda-Bofors AA cannon was replaced by 20mm .70cal Oerlikon Mk10 AA cannon. In 1994, Cyprus acquired 24 Aerospatiale MM40 Exocet Block-II anti-ship missiles (reportedly initially intended for Iran) from France, along with 3 coastal defence batteries. In 2000, the Cyprus Navy received the ex-Hellenic Navy patrol boat \\"Knossos\\", which was renamed \\"Kyrenia\\", designated P02 and formed the Kyrenia class./ Greek Embassy Website This vessel was Greek made, of the Dilos-class, previously designated P269. This vessel is armed with one single 20mm .70cal Oerlikon Mk10 AA cannon and one 2-round Mistral-SIMBAD air-defence missile launcher. In 2002, the Cyprus Navy acquired two Rodman 55 fast assault boats for the purpose of serving her Special Forces units. These fast craft are named \\"Agathos\\" and \\"Panagos\\".Original research from photos posted on www.militaryphotos.net, accessed 07/12/08 During 2004-2006, Cyprus took delivery of four FPB 30M type fast patrol craft from manufacturer Cantierre Navale Vittoria of Italy, of which two were intended for the Navy, and two intended for the Marine Police. These vessels were fitted with single 25mm .80cal KBA OTO-Melara automatic cannons and two single 12.7mm machine guns, equipped with radars and Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIRs). The Navy pair were issued the pennant numbers P03 and P04. ===2011 base disaster=== On 11 July 2011, the Evangelos Florakis Naval Base explosion resulted in the destruction of much of the infrastructure of the nation's main naval port and loss of the Commander of Cypriot Navy Captain Andreas Ioannides. Reconstruction began immediately on the strength of domestic contracts for buildings and structures. ===Acquisition of new warships=== Following various media reports in 2012 that Cyprus was entertaining offers by Israel and Greece to supply two heavy Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs), being far larger and more capable than anything previously operated, it was extensively reported in January 2013 that Cyprus has signed an agreement with France to purchase two large, stealthy and well-armed vessels based upon the GOWIND corvette design. This frenzy of media speculation was bolstered by the otherwise sudden and unexplained visit to Cyprus by the L'Adroit, which some sources interpreted as a demonstration of the ship design, to be held at Limassol port from 24 to 26 January 2013.http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/french-navy-ship-due-thursday/20130122 .

It was part of the Royal Omani Navy fleet, but was decommissioned and refitted for use in the waters off Cyprus the ship was renamed Alasia. On 15 January 2018 the Cyprus Navy commissioned the Commodore Andreas Ioannides P 61, the ship was built by Israel Shipyards Limited and is based on the Saar 4.5 FAC.

The community of Tatlayoko Lake, British Columbia is located at its northern end. ==History== Tatlayoko Lake is part of the land claim of the Tsilhqot'in People of Xeni (aka Xeni Gwet'in First Nation or the Nemaia Valley Indian Band) and is called by them Talhiqox Biny (\\"biny\\"-\\"lake\\"). One of their number, Klattasine or Klatsassan, led a party of warriors to attack a crew building a gold-rush era route known as Waddington's Road in the Homathko's canyons, which was the opening round of the Chilcotin War of 1864. Relief troops, including the governor of the colony's own party and escort, came to the Chilcotin via Tatlayoko Lake.

It is situated along the Midland Railway Line between Craigieburn and Staircase. There are no permanent residents, but it once supported a small number of railway staff. == Mount Torlesse Coal Company== This company operated coal mines in the adjacent Broken River Valley between ca. 1917 and ca. 1928. It operated a 70 cm horse and steam hauled tramway from an approx. 700-metre-long inclined plane that hauled coal up out of the Broken River valley, thence 2.7 kilometers along a high hill-side to another inclined plane that lowered coal approx 600 meters to bins at Avoca railway station. Coal was then distributed throughout Canterbury. The opening of the Otira Railway Tunnel in 1923 giving access to cheaper coal from Westland probably contributed significantly to the company's demise. The old mine manager’s house is now used by the Conservation Department as a field staff training facility.Rails Magazine 7/2001: Quail New Zealand Railway Atlas, 4th Ed.

The family formerly included almost all the corticioid (patch- or crust-forming) fungi, whether they were related or not, and as such was highly artificial. In its current sense, however, the name Corticiaceae is restricted to a comparatively small group of mainly corticioid genera within the Corticiales, though the family is as yet not well defined. ==TaxonomyHistory=== The German mycologist Wilhelm Gustav Franz Herter first published the Corticiaceae in 1910 to accommodate species of hymenomycetes that produced basidiocarps (fruit bodies) which were effused (spread out and patch-like) and had a more or less smooth hymenophore (spore-bearing surface). Since this definition was vague, superficial, and covered a large range of unrelated fungi, the Corticiaceae, though widely adopted, were also widely recognized as an unnatural grouping. Indeed, in a 1964 survey of families, Donk considered the Corticiaceae to be \\"a nice example of how extremely artificial taxa can be\\". In this wide sense, the boundaries of the Corticiaceae were never clearly defined. It was sometimes separated from the Stereaceae, a family in which fruitbodies had a tendency to form pilei (caps or brackets), but often these two artificial families were united. In this united sense, the Corticiaceae certainly included the genera and species treated in the standard, 8-volume reference work The Corticiaceae of North Europe (1972-1987), where it was acknowledged that the family was \\"not a natural taxon but an assemblage of species with similar habitat.\\" With the addition of non-European species, this meant that the Corticiaceae eventually expanded to include over 200 genera worldwide. The name \\"Corticiaceae\\" is still occasionally used in this wide sense (sensu lato), but it has generally been replaced by the term \\"corticioid fungi\\". Earlier family names for the Corticiaceae s.l. are the Cyphellaceae, Peniophoraceae, and Vuilleminiaceae, as noted by Donk in 1964. Since the name Corticiaceae was so commonly used, it was officially conserved against these earlier names under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. This only applies, however, if the suppressed names are considered to be synonyms, rather than distinct families separate from the Corticiaceae. ===Current status=== Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has limited the Corticiaceae in its strict sense (sensu stricto) to a comparatively small group of genera within the Corticiales. The family, however, remains undefined. Larsson, in 2007, treated it as synonymous with the order, but the resurrection of the Punctulariaceae and Vuilleminiaceae within the Corticiales now leaves the Corticiaceae as a \\"dustbin taxon\\" for the leftover genera. As such, the family contains some 27 genera and over 100 species. ==Description== Though now based on molecular phylogenetics, the Corticiaceae s.s. have certain features partly in common. Basidiocarps, for example, have a tendency to be pink or orange, as in the type species of Corticium, (C. roseum), and species in genera such as Erythricium, Laetisaria, Limonomyces, and Marchandiobasidium. Several of the Corticiaceae also produce sclerotia, bulbils, or other anamorphic (asexual) propagules, including species in the genera Corticium, Laetisaria, Marchandiobasidium, and Waitea. Species in the genus Marchandiomyces are entirely anamorphic. Finally, many of the Corticiaceae s.s. are obligate or facultative pathogens, such as Marchandiobasidium aurantiacum and Marchandiomyces corallinus on lichens and Erythricium salmonicolor, Laetisaria spp, Limonomyces spp, and Waitea circinata on grasses and other plants. ==Habitat and distribution== The majority of species in the Corticiaceae are wood-rotting saprotrophs, typically forming corticioid basidiocarps on the undersides of dead, attached branches, less commonly on fallen wood. Several species are parasites of lichens, grasses, or other plants. Giulia tenuis is a pycnidial anamorph growing on bamboo. The anomalous agaric species, Marchandiomphalina foliacea, is lichenized. Collectively, they have a cosmopolitan distribution. ==Economic importance== Several species within the Corticiaceae are commercially important pathogens of crops or turf grass. Erythricium salmonicolor attacks woody commercial crops (citrus, coffee, rubber, etc.) in the tropics, causing \\"pink disease\\". Waitea circinata is also a pathogen, causing diseases of cereal crops, including \\"sheath spot\\" of rice. The same fungus also causes \\"brown ring patch\\" in turf grasses. Laetisaria fuciformis is the cause of \\"red thread\\" disease in turf grass, whilst Limonomyces roseipellis is the cause of \\"pink patch\\" disease. ==References== Category:Corticiales Category:Basidiomycota families Category:Fungi described in 1910 ","title":"Corticiaceae"},{"id":"20420005","text":"Vonray is the debut major label (Elektra Records) studio album by American rock band Vonray, released on April 8, 2003. This was Vonray's last released album. Vonray yielded the band's only success: the single \\"Inside Out\\". ==Production and marketing== After three independent studio album releases and opening for many high-profile bands such as Third Eye Blind, Seven Mary Three and Creed, the band Vonray was signed to Elektra Records in late 2002. The band began working on an album which was produced by Marc Tanner, who worked with the likes of The Calling and Nelson. Promotion for the band was backed up by the band Creed and the album Vonray released in early 2003. ===Singles=== The first single released from Vonray was \\"Inside Out\\" in late 2002. The song received exposure due to being featured on the soundtrack album to the hit TV series Smallville. Two bandmembers appeared on the show itself performing the song acoustically. \\"Inside Out\\" experienced mild success in the United States and peaked at #32 on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart and at #31 on Billboard's Top 40 Mainstream chart. The second single released for the album was \\"I'll Show You\\" around June 2003. The single received little promotion from the label and failed to chart. Due to the Elektra Records/Atlantic Records merger, promotion for the band all but ceased, and the band was dropped from the label soon after. Thus no more singles were released. ===Music videos=== A music video was produced for the single \\"Inside Out\\" and was directed by Kevin Lang and Hector Lopez. It was released on April 8, 2003. The video is a compilation of two live performances of \\"Inside Out\\".

Both the order and the family were described by Walter Jülich in 1981. According to a 2008 estimate, the family contains 20 genera and approximately 100 species. However, many genera formerly considered to belong in the Atheliaceae have since been moved to other families, including Amylocorticiaceae, Albatrellaceae, and Hygrophoraceae. Despite being a relatively small group with inconspicuous forms, Atheliaceae members show great diversity in life strategies and are widespread in distribution. Additionally, being a group strictly composed of corticioid fungi, they may also provide insights on the evolution of fruiting body forms in basidiomycetes. ==History, taxonomy, and classification== Traditionally, the classification of basidiomycetes placed significant emphasis on readily observable features, such as the construction of the basidiocarp or the hymenophore. Initially, all members of the presently known Atheliaceae had been grouped together with the other corticioid basidiomycetes in an artificial group called Corticiaceae by Marinus Anton Donk in 1964. Following this, most currently known Atheliaceae species were once included in the broadly defined genus Athelia, which were then subsequently distributed over several genera by Walter Jülich in 1972 in his monograph of “Atheliae”. In 1981, Jülich introduced the family Atheliaceae among other new families and orders, in an attempt to classify the higher order of basidiomycetes. Since then, several members of the family have been incorporated in a number of molecular phylogenetic studies. In a 2004 phylogenetic study based on molecular and morphological characters, representatives of Atheliaceae genera Piloderma, Athelia, Tylospora, Byssocorticium, Athelopsis, and Amphinema formed a monophyletic clade. Subsequently, the monotypic order Atheliales was found to be closely related to the Agaricales and Boletales, forming the monophyletic group known as the subclass Agaricomycetidae (class Agaricomycotina) in a 2007 study. ==Description== Atheliaceae consists of strictly corticioid fungi which resemble thin crusts with soft basidiocarps that are loosely attached to the substrate. Basidiocarps are thin with well- developed subiculum (wool- or crust-like growth of mycelium underneath the basidiocarp). The hymenal surface is smooth when dry, without any warts or papillae and may appear wrinkled when fresh. The colour is mostly whitish, sometimes greenish-bluish and rarely brownish. Their hyphal system is strictly monomitic, with transparent hyphae that have smooth surface or sometimes covered with granules or crystals. On the hypha, clamps may be present, rare, or absent. Cystidia are rarely observed in most species, and if observed are usually little differentiated. Mature basidia are club-shaped, arranged at typical clusters, bearing 2-6 sterigmata. Spores are non-amyloid with smooth surface and are normally spherical to ellipsoid, except in Tylospora where it is angular and warted. ==Distribution and ecology== Despite its morphological simplicity, members of Atheliaceae vary widely in terms of ecological strategies. A number of species are known to be saprotrophs of needle and leaf litter, while some species of Amphinema, Byssocorticium, Piloderma, and Tylospora are ectomycorrhizal symbionts. They sometimes constitute a major component of the mycorrhizal communities. Subsequently, parasitism has been observed in Athelia arachnoidea, which targets lichens. Lichen formation has been suggested to occur in Athelia epiphylla, which is also associated with the white rot of Populus tremuloides. A species of Athelia also engaged in a symbiotic relationship with termites of the genus Reticulitermes, in which the fungus forms sclerotia that mimic termite eggs and worker termites handling the sclerotia as if they were eggs. The presence of the sclerotia in the nest appears to enhance egg viability, while the fungus might be dispersed to new substrates. Atheliaceae members are also quite widespread, with most of the discovered species occurring throughout the northern temperate regions. They are mostly found in moist environments, on substrates such as soil, humus, leaf litter, and wood. One species, Digitatispora marina, has been found to prefer salt water habitats by growing on marine-submerged woods. ==Genera== List of genera and number of species based on the 10th edition of Ainsworth & Bisby's \\"Dictionary of the Fungi\\": *Amphinema P.

It was later published validly by Erast Parmasto in 1986, and raised to familial status by Swiss mycologist Walter Jülich in 1982. The type genus is Phanerochaete. In 2007, Karl-Henrik Larsson proposed using the name Phanerochaetaceae to refer to the clade of crust fungi clustered near Phanerochaete. In 2013, a more extensive molecular analysis showed that the Phanerochaetaceae were a subclade of the large phlebioid clade, which also contains members of the families Meruliaceae and Irpicaceae. The generic limits of Phanerochaete were revised in 2015, and new genera were added in 2016. , Index Fungorum accepts 30 genera and 367 species in the family. ==Description== Most Phanerochaetaceae species are crust-like. Their hyphal system is monomitic (containing only generative hyphae), and these hyphae lack clamp connections. Their spores are thin-walled, smooth, and hyaline (translucent). Cystidia are often present in the hymenium. Although rare, some species have a polyporoid form, a dimitic hyphal system, and clamp connections. Phanerochaetaceae fungi produce a white rot. ==Genera== Ceriporia spissa Terana caerulea *Amethicium Hjortstam (1983); 1 species *Australicium Hjortstam & Ryvarden (2002); 2 species *Australohydnum Jülich (1978); 2 species *Byssomerulius Parmasto (1967); 12 species *Candelabrochaete Boidin (1970); 12 species *Ceriporia Donk (1933); 49 species *Ceriporiopsis Domański (1963); 34 species *Climacodon P.Karst.

It includes crust-like, toothed, and poroid species that cause a white rot in dead wood. ==Taxonomy== The family was circumscribed by Czech mycologist Erast Parmasto in 1968. Parmasto's original concept included species that are today classified in the Agaricales, Hymenochaetales, Polyporales, and Russulales. A large-scale molecular study published in 2012 by Otto Miettinen and colleagues redefined the limits of the Steccherinaceae to include most species of the poroid and hydnoid genera Antrodiella, Junghuhnia, and Steccherinum, as well as members of 12 other hydnoid and poroid genera. These genera were traditionally classified in the families Phanerochaetaceae, Polyporaceae, and Meruliaceae. They commented: \\"we see the need for at least 30 monophyletic, morphologically distinguishable genera. These include no fewer than 15 new genera for both polypores and hydnoid fungi, and revival of several unused genus names.\\" In a subsequent 2016 publication coauthored with Leif Ryvarden, Miettinen circumscribed several new genera—Antella, Austeria, Butyrea, Citripora, and Trulla. In a 2017 phylogenetic overview of the Polyporales, Alfredo Justo and colleagues have noted \\"The extreme morphological variation within the Steccherinaceae makes it very difficult to characterize the family by means other than phylogeny and a certain predominance of morphological characters.\\" Walter Jülich created the family Mycorrhaphiaceae to contain the type genus Mycorrhaphium. This family is now placed in synonymy with Steccherinaceae. ==Phylogenetics== The genus Xanthoporus and the Loweomyces clade occupy a basal position of the Steccherinaceae phylogenetic tree. The genus Antrodiella was found to be polyphyletic, containing species spread throughout 10 distinct clades in the Steccherinaceae. Although it is not known with certainty what the closest relatives of the Steccherinaceae are, the genera Climacocystis, Hypochnicium, Meripilus, Podoscypha, and Pouzaroporia consistently appear close regardless of the gene used for phylogenetic analysis. Species in the core Antrodiella clade are very close genetically, even between species with a rather different spore shape, suggesting that these taxa may be undergoing ongoing rapid speciation. In some cases, DNA evidence shows that two morphologically nearly identical Antrodiella species are more distantly related than species that have larger phenotypic differences. ==Description== Most genera of the Steccherinaceae contain poroid or hydnoid fungi; Steccherinum contains both types. Steccherinaceae spores are usually broadly cylindrical or ellipsoid in shape. Characters useful for genus-level classification include fruit body colour and type, detailed hyphal structure, presence of cystidia, the strength of cyanophilic reactions of hyphae or spores, and the thickness of the spore walls. All species cause a white rot, and most grow on wood. Most of the species considered have a dimitic hyphal structure (containing both generative and skeletal hyphae), and most have clamps at the primary septa. ==Genera== Nigroporus vinosus Antrodiella pallasii Flabellophora sp.

On the second half of the North American tour, Hinder, Papa Roach, and Saving Abel were in support. Black Stone Cherry were the support act for the European tour of the UK in May 2009. During the tour, Ryan Peake sang for a cover of \\"Use Somebody\\" by Kings of Leon during an encore. During the UK leg of the tour, they sang a cover of \\"Highway to Hell\\" by AC/DC with Chris Robertson of Black Stone Cherry on vocals, just before the T-shirt cannons. A similar format was applied during the rest of the tour, however they sang a cover of \\"Hey Man, Nice Shot\\" by Filter with Shaun Morgan of Seether on vocals. In some of the early shows, \\"This Afternoon\\" was played instead of \\"If Today Was Your Last Day\\". During the summer leg of the tour the band sang \\"Highway to Hell\\" with Austin Winkler of Hinder and Jacoby Shaddix of Papa Roach. On some stops they played \\"Friends In Low Places\\" by Garth Brooks and \\"Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off\\" by Joe Nichols acoustically.

It is a 2-story, center-passage plan, frame building. The main block was constructed in 1754, with the two wings added and enlarged about 1852. Also on the property are the remains of a large circular ice house and several frame outbuildings. Portland Manor was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. The Portland Manor timber frame manor house is sited on a fenced 3.8-acre portion of an original 2000-acre parcel granted to Jerome White Esq. by the 2nd Lord Baltimore in 1687. Although subdivided numerous times since then, the 3.8-acre remnant remains surrounded on three sides by unspoiled farmland and has been carefully maintained and restored over a fifteen-year period, beginning in 1997, by an owner/architect. In 2001, Portland Manor was recipient of the Anne Arundel County Orlando Ridout Prize for historic preservation. Living spaces on the first floor include a 19’ x 22’ living room, a 14’x 19’ dining room, a sitting room, an office/library, a powder room, and a large country kitchen . The second floor, accessed by the original central staircase and two secondary stairs, includes four large bedrooms, three full baths and a laundry/storage room (equipped with a front- loading washer and dryer and an upright freezer). A large L-shaped porch off the kitchen on the east side overlooks a fence-enclosed perennial and herb garden and pond; a screened porch on the west side is oriented to views of rolling farmland and dramatic sunsets. There is a partial basement measuring approximately 19’ x 22’. The grounds include a variety of mature trees, a boxwood garden and two outbuildings; a 10’ x 20’ smokehouse, currently used as a garden shop, and a 20’ x 30’ barn that has been completely restored for use as a workshop/pottery studio and for yard equipment storage. Future archeological investigations may confirm suspected locations for an icehouse and various outbuildings and may add to the various artifacts found by the current owners that are included in a historic display at the second floor hallway. In 1997, a dendrochronology study concluded that the original construction of Portland Manor occurred in 1754. ==References *, including photo from 1993, at Maryland Historical Trust Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Houses in Anne Arundel County, Maryland Category:Houses completed in 1725 Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Maryland Category:1725 establishments in Maryland Category:National Register of Historic Places in Anne Arundel County, Maryland ","title":"Portland Manor"},{"id":"20420210","text":"Gerrit Mannoury, 1911 Gerrit Mannoury (17 May 1867 - 30 January 1956) was a Dutch philosopher and mathematician, professor at the University of Amsterdam and communist, known as the central figure in the signific circle, a Dutch counterpart of the Vienna circle.Jan Siegenbeek van Heukelom & Gerard Alberts (2000).

On 8 August 1907 he married Elizabeth Maria Berkelbach van der Sprenkel, with whom he had three daughters and a son, Jan Mannoury. His father Gerrit Mannoury, a sea-captain, had died in China when he was three years old.Ger Harmsen, Gerrit Voerman (1998). \\"Gerrit Mannoury\\". In: Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme. p. 137-141. He attended the Hogere Burgerschool (HBS) in Amsterdam, where he graduated in 1885. The same year he received a Teacher's Degree in Accounting and in Mechanics. In 1902 he also received a Teacher's Degree in Mathematics. Mannoury was a self-educated mathematician. Because he was a teacher he couldn't attend lessons at the University of Amsterdam. He did receive private lessons from Diederik Korteweg. He was awarded a PhD in Mathematics late in life, in 1946, with L.E.J. Brouwer as his promotores. Gerrit Mannourij, Album Academicum, Universiteit van Amsterdam. Accessed 27 Nov 2008. Mannoury started working in primary education in Amsterdam, Bloemendaal and Helmond. In 1910 he started teaching at the Hoogere Burger School (HBS) at Vlissingen. In 1902 he had been appointed privaatdocent at the University of Amsterdam and in 1917 he was made professor there. He retired in 1937). He lectured on the philosophy of mathematics, and on mechanics, analytics and descriptive and projective geometry.Erik Heijerman (1988) \\"Relativism and significs: Gerrit Mannoury of the foundations of mathematics\\".

Mannoury was, with Diederik Korteweg, one of the most important teachers of Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer at Amsterdam University, Mannoury especially philosophically. The first appearance of the names \\"formalism\\" and \\"intuitionism\\" in Brouwer's writings, were in a review of Gerrit Mannoury's book Methodologisches und Philosophisches zur Elementar-Mathematik (Methodological and philosophical remarks on elementary mathematics) from 1909.\\"Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer\\" Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2003-2005. Two other Dutch scientists he inspired were philosopher and logician Evert W. Beth and psychologist Adriaan de Groot. He died in Amsterdam. == Work == Mannoury's main inspirations were G. W. F. Hegel, G.J.P.J. Bolland and F. H. Bradley. He was also inspired by the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Baruch Spinoza, the French mathematician philosopher of science Henri Poincaré and the English positivism of Bertrand Russell. Mannoury combined a logical-mathematical way of thinking with a deep insight into the human soul. == Publications == Mannoury was a prolific and polymathic writer who published books, articles, reviews, and pamphlets.Pieter Wisse Mannoury's significs, or a philosophy of communal individualism * 1903.

Lowell is the fourth-largest city in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is county seat of Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Raymond Kelly Richardson, a 30-year veteran of the department is the current superintendent of police. The department is a member of the North Eastern Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council, which provides specialized units throughout the region. ==History== {  style=\\"float:right;\\" +Superintendents of Police - Hugh Downey  1925–1935 - Michael Winn  1935–1949 - John Sayers  1950–1955 - Francis O'Loughlin  1956–1963 - Peter Gouduras  1964–1971 - Leonard O.MacPhail  1972–1981 - John Sheehan  1982–1995 - Edward F.

This brought an influx of immigrants in search of employment, increasing the city's population dramatically. In the late 1990s, Edward F. Davis implemented innovative \\"community policing\\" strategies, which reduced Lowell's crime rate faster than any other American city with over 100,000 residents. In 2006, he left Lowell to become the commissioner of the Boston Police Department. Kenneth Lavallee succeeded him, continuing the community policing approach and reaching out to community and youth groups. In 2013, Deborah Friedl, although appointed temporarily, became the first woman chosen as police superintendent in the department's history. ==Community Policing Philosophy== The Lowell Police Department serves its community in the following ways:Community Policing Philosophy * Providing emergency responses to crime * Working with neighborhoods and businesses to identify and solve problems * Sponsoring comprehensive recreational and educational programs for youth, including the in-school SRO program, the Student Police Academy Summer camp, and other collective efforts with community organizations * Developing specialized responses to crimes such as Family Services Unit domestic violence Neighborhood Action Unit neighborhood issues and Gang Unit gang activity * Ongoing training of police personnel to best address community needs * Community-based policing, with neighborhood precinct stations, immersing police into the neighborhoods to most effectively interact with residents * Specialized foot, bike, segway and boat patrols to improve visibility of officers * Use of technology to enhance the delivery of public safety services ===Mission statement=== The mission of the Lowell Police Department is to continue building and maintaining strong partnerships with the diverse communities of Lowell. We strive to work with our community to reduce the incidence and fear of crime, and to ensure public safety. We will do this while working to improve the quality of life for the citizens of Lowell. The Lowell Police Department is committed to the ideals of Community Policing. Those ideals are evident in programs such as Student Police Academy, the Police Volunteer Program and the Community Relations Council. The department's core values are integrity, respect, accountability, community, sanctity of life and knowledge. ==Training Academy== Training Division station The Lowell Police Department's Training Division has been in operation since 1996 and has conducted in-service training for police officers from 48 cities and towns. The Lowell Police Academy consists 50 classes over the course of 21 weeks. Student officers receive basic police training and must meet the standards established by the Massachusetts Police Training Committee (MPTC) to become a police officer. In 2010, the LPD moved its Training Division from the CrossPoint Towers to 99 Middlesex Street.The director of the Training Division is Captain James Hodgdon. ==Operations== The Lowell Police Department is made up of 175 Police Officers, 30 Sergeants, 13 Lieutenants, 9 Captains, 2 Deputy Superintendent, and a Superintendent. Making a total of 230 sworn officers.Number of Officers in Each Position ===Rank Structure=== :Superintendent (1) :Deputy Superintendent (2) :Captain (9) :Lieutenant (13) :Sergeant (30) :Police Officer (184) ===Geographic responsibility=== Through a strategic planning process known as Geographic Responsibility, as well as input from the people of Lowell, it was determined that Crime and Disorder could be most effectively fought with the presence of a constant officer in neighborhoods. This method also seemed to be the most logical thing for supervision and accountability of each officer. There was frustration experienced by both officers and residents regarding the ability of officers to investigate neighborhood crimes. It was determined that officers who have the knowledge of a specific area and a relationship with the residents were to be assigned there, where they could best police the area. With this assignment method it is hoped that officers and residents will become more readily acquainted and will be more helpful to each other. Geographic assignment, the final phase of the Reorganization of the LPD, commenced on 17 January 1999. The city has been divided into three sectors which is each commanded by a Captain who has overall responsibility for the administration, neighborhood problems and concerns, as well as the success of his/her sector.LPD Operational Philosophy ==Patrol Shifts== Platoon 1 Headquarters Late Nights Platoon 2 Day Shift Platoon 3 Early Nights ===Sectors === Alpha Acre, Centralville, Downtown, Pawtucketville Bravo Belvidere, Back Central, Highlands, Lower Highlands, Sacred Heard / South Lowell ==K9 Unit== The Lowell Police Department currently has 3 K9 teams: Lt. Steven Gendreau and his Bloodhound named Hope; Officer Chris Hanson and his German Shepherd named Bossi; Officer Michael Bergeron and his German Shepherd Randy. These K9's perform vital functions for the LPD such as: tracking, searching, and apprehension of criminal suspects, searching for missing persons and children, assisting patrol officers with the detection of various types of illegal drugs or contraband in vehicles, luggage, or packages, assisting other officers in crowd control, responding to assist police departments from area communities when they are in need of a K9, as well as many other functions. ==Line of duty deaths== Christos G. Rouses memorial statue in Lowell's JFK Civic Center Since its inception, the Lowell Police Department has lost four police officers in the line of duty. In 1978, Officer Christos Rouses, was shot and killed while responding to a silent alarm at a local pharmacy. In 1980, there was a memorial depicting an officer with his hand on the right shoulder of a young child placed in his honor directly in front of Department headquarters at JFK Plaza. The memorial, which sits in the center of a fountain has the names of: :* Officer George F. A. Pearsall, killed by gunfire on 24 April 1957 :* Officer Christos G. Rouses, killed by gunfire on 17 November 1978 :* Officer Patrick F. Leavitt, died after a heart attack on 18 December 1941 :* Officer John J.

Shot in and around Lowell, Sergeant Mickey O'Keefe played himself in the film. * Multiple episodes of the Fox show Cops follow Lowell police officers while on duty. ==See also== * List of law enforcement agencies in Massachusetts ==References * Lowell Police Department Category:Lowell, Massachusetts Category:Municipal police departments of Massachusetts Category:1830 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Lowell Police Department"},{"id":"20420214","text":"Reanimation may refer to: * Reanimation (facial surgery) * Reanimation (science fiction), reanimation of the dead, as in Frankenstein * Reanimation (Linkin Park album), 2002 * Reanimation (Lights & Motion album), 2013 * Reanimatsioon, or Reanimation, a 1995 album by Singer Vinger * Night of the Living Dead 3D: Re-Animation, a 2012 horror film prequel to the 2006 film, Night of the Living Dead 3D ==See also== * Reanimator (disambiguation) * Re- Animated, a 2006 live-action/animated TV movie * Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) * Advanced life support * Reanimation after nerve damage * Resurrection (disambiguation) ","title":"Reanimation"},{"id":"20420236","text":"In data management, semantic warehousing is a methodology of digitalized text data using similar functions to Data warehousing (DW), such as ETL(Extract, transform, load), ODS(Operational data store), and MODEL. Key value operation is less useful for the digitalized text. Semantic warehousing is different from DW in that semantic information base from text(semantic) data. Semantic warehousing is different from search engine in that semantic information base from text data is stored in the database.(DBMS) Though data is most important word in computing era, it can not explain human knowledge well yet. Data(numeric data) is key element of computing systems for certain organization (especially companies, enterprises), but no performance oriented organization needs something to gather and use knowledge or human feeling. Semantic warehousing will be equally or more important than data warehousing in the future. ==Definition== Semantic warehousing is a conceptual and functional term meaning to gather from a source, semantically defining and providing information from digitalized text type data. ==Background== Data warehousing (DW) is popular these days. Gathering data from systems that generate transactions, data warehouses become a base of information. Key of data warehouse is a model (called datamart) and that model is made up of dimensions(key) and measures(value). Users get information from the models by doing certain operations. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is most the important operation for the users to get information from the DW models. Handling dimensions with pivoting, drilling, slice & dice operations users get numeric values like sales amounts, growth rates, etc. Various areas of this world defined and appeared on the World Wide Web (Internet), eager to present their contents in a semantic way. Briefly speaking, semantic warehousing has datawarehousing body and search head and ontology features. Data warehousing contributed to companies' business values and many solutions and tools are commercially successful. Analysis of internal data delivers a certain level of business values, on the contrary to this Semantic warehousing environment has not yet matured. Capacity of social data is increasing rapidly and various efforts of finding value from that data are made widely known as Big data, etc. Semantic warehousing can be the mainstream of treat data and intelligence of social world in the future though it is defined with other keywords. At the Big data era, semantic processing is going to become major IT process. Semantic warehousing is digital infra of Intelligence. == Practices == ▣ Medical area (Clinical Information) Some hospital implement semantic warehousing for clinical information (SWCI). Medical information is now knowledge network level. UMLS define semantic knowledge network of medical language. Currently medical information stored in database and not fully used for clinic. Semantic warehousing is next stage of digitalized medical information. SWCI is a name of conceptual system of clinical information.

Bruton Jr. Centennial Professor of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. His primary areas of research are quantum computing and computational complexity theory. ==Early life and education== Aaronson grew up in the United States, though he spent a year in Asia when his father—a science writer turned public-relations executive—was posted to Hong Kong. He enrolled in a school there that permitted him to skip ahead several years in math, but upon returning to the US, he found his education restrictive, getting bad grades and having run-ins with teachers. He enrolled in The Clarkson School, a program for gifted youngsters run by Clarkson University, which enabled Aaronson to apply for colleges while only in his freshman year of high school. He was accepted into Cornell University, where he obtained his BSc in computer science in 2000,CV from Aaronson's web site and where he resided at the Telluride House. He then attended the University of California, Berkeley, for his PhD, which he got in 2004 under the supervision of Umesh Vazirani. Aaronson had shown ability in mathematics from an early age, teaching himself calculus at the age of 11, provoked by symbols in a babysitter's textbook. He discovered computer programming at age 11, and felt he lagged behind peers, who had already been coding for years. In part due to Aaronson getting into advanced mathematics before getting into computer programming, he felt drawn to theoretical computing, particularly computational complexity theory. At Cornell, he became interested in quantum computing and devoted himself to computational complexity and quantum computing. ==Career== After postdoctorates at the Institute for Advanced Study and the University of Waterloo, he took a faculty position at MIT in 2007. His primary area of research is quantum computing and computational complexity theory more generally. In the summer of 2016 he moved from MIT to the University of Texas at Austin as David J. Bruton Jr. Centennial Professor of Computer Science and as the founding director of UT Austin's new Quantum Information Center.Shetl-Optimized, \\"From Boston to Austin\\", February 28th, 2016. ===Awards=== *Aaronson is one of two winners of the 2012 Alan T.

The latter work, widely distributed in academic computer science, uses the concept of Busy Beaver Numbers as described by Tibor Radó to illustrate the limits of computability in a pedagogic environment. He has also taught a graduate-level survey course, Quantum Computing Since Democritus, for which notes are available online, and have been published as a book by Cambridge University Press. It weaves together disparate topics into a cohesive whole, including quantum mechanics, complexity, free will, time travel, the anthropic principle and more. Many of these interdisciplinary applications of computational complexity were later fleshed out in his article, \\"Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity\\". Since then, Aaronson published a book entitled Quantum Computing Since Democritus based on the course. An article of Aaronson's, \\"The Limits of Quantum Computers\\", was published in Scientific American, and he was a guest speaker at the 2007 Foundational Questions in Science Institute conference. Aaronson is frequently cited in the non-academic press, such as Science News, The Age, ZDNet, Slashdot, New Scientist, The New York Times, and Forbes magazine. == Love Communications plagiarism == Aaronson was the subject of media attention in October 2007, when he accused Australian advertising agency Love Communications of plagiarizing a lecture he wrote on quantum mechanics in an advertisement of theirs. He alleged that a commercial for Ricoh Australia by Sydney-based agency Love Communications appropriated content almost verbatim from the lecture. Aaronson received an email from the agency claiming to have sought legal advice and saying they did not believe that they were in violation of his copyright. Dissatisfied, Aaronson pursued the matter, and the agency settled the dispute without admitting wrongdoing by making a charitable contribution to two science organizations of his choice. Concerning this matter, Aaronson stated, \\"Someone suggested [on my blog] a cameo with the models but if it was between that and a free printer, I think I'd take the printer.\\" ==Personal life== Aaronson is married to computer scientist Dana Moshkovitz. ==References * *Aaronson's blog *Aaronson homepage *UT Austin Quantum Information Center homepage Category:American people of Jewish descent Category:Jewish scientists Category:Cornell University alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty Category:Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars Category:Theoretical computer scientists Category:Science bloggers Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriates in Hong Kong Category:Simons Investigator Category:University of Texas at Austin faculty Category:Quantum information scientists Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery ","title":"Scott Aaronson"},{"id":"20420246","text":"Seal Bay may refer to: ;Antarctica * Seal Bay (Antarctica) ;Australia *Seal Bay (South Australia), a bay on Kangaroo Island ** Seal Bay Aquatic Reserve, a marine protected area on the south coast of Kangaroo Island ** Seal Bay Conservation Park, a protected area on Kangaroo Island ** Seal Bay, South Australia, a locality on Kangaroo Island in Australia ;Falkland Islands * Seal Bay, Falkland Islands ;United States * Seal Bay Seaplane Base, Alaska ","title":"Seal Bay"},{"id":"20420265","text":"Richland is a historic home at Harwood, Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

Cities in North America are beginning to recognize these units as a vital source of housing in urban areas and legally define them as an Accessory Dwelling Unit or \\"ADU\\". Rent in basement apartments is usually much lower than it is in above-ground units, due to a number of deficiencies common to basement apartments. The apartments are usually cramped, and tend to be noisy, both from uninsulated building noises and from traffic on the adjacent street.David W. Chen, Be It Ever So Low, the Basement Is Often Home, The New York Times (February 25, 2004). They are also particularly vulnerable to burglary, especially those with windows at sidewalk level. In some instances, residential use of below-ground space is illegal, but is done anyway in order for the building owner to generate extra income. Homeowners will typically rent out basement apartments to tenants as a way to earn additional income so as to offset living expenses. Owning a home with a basement apartment can be an investment. Tenants will provide income to the home owner, reducing expenses, and equity will grow as the value of the property increases. __NOTOC__ ==Health risks to tenants== Some health risks to people who live in basements have been noted, for example mold, radon, and risk of injury/death due to fire. It has been suggested that a basement suite is the last type of dwelling a tenant should look for because of the risk of mold. However, due to demand for affordable housing, basement suites are often the only available housing for some low-income families and individuals. Airborne spores can cause mold to grow in damp and unventilated areas, such as basements. Presence of mold can lead to \\"respiratory symptoms, respiratory infections, allergic rhinitis and asthma\\", as well as personal belongings being contaminated by mold. Basement suite tenants are more likely to be injured or die due to a fire in the house. Many landlords do not follow fire code regulations, and often such regulations are not enforced by governments. ==Notable people== A number of noted artistic achievements have occurred in basement apartments occupied by struggling authors, painters, and musicians. Andy Warhol made one of his earliest films, Mrs. Warhol (black-and-white, 66 minutes), in the basement apartment of his house, where his mother (Julia Warhola) lived. Ruth McKenney based a series of stories in The New Yorker, later republished in the book My Sister Eileen, on her experiences living with her sister in a moldy, one-room basement apartment, directly adjoining the Christopher Street subway station on the , at 14 Gay Street, in Greenwich Village for which she paid $45 a month ().My Sister Eileen, pg. 197. The apartment was burgled within the first week during the six months they lived there. ==See also== * English basement * Penthouse apartment ==References== Category:Apartment types ","title":"Basement apartment"},{"id":"20420293","text":"Real Aranjuez Club de Fútbol is a Spanish football team based in Aranjuez, in the autonomous community of Madrid. Founded in 1948 it plays in Tercera División – Group 7, holding home matches at Estadio El Deleite, with a capacity of 8,000 seats. ==History== Aranjuez spent the vast majority of its years in the fourth division, with a four-year stint in the third level (1992–93, 1994–97). From 2005–07 it suffered consecutive relegations, which left the club in Primera Aficionados (sixth division).

There he became a large California rancho landowner and one of the region's wealthiest citizens.James Miller Guinn \\"A History of California and an Extended History of Los Angeles and Environs\\", Vol. II, 1915 ==Biography== Jonathan Temple was born in Reading, Massachusetts, to Jonathan Temple (Sr.) and Lucinda Pratt. From at least 1823, Temple was a merchant living in the Hawaiian Islands. In 1827 he migrated to the Pueblo de San Diego in Mexican Alta California, where he was baptized a Roman Catholic. In 1827 Temple moved north to the Pueblo de Los Ángeles, where he opened the pueblo's first store, a business he operated for almost thirty years. His younger brother. Francisco P. Temple. joined him there later. Jonathan Temple married Rafaela Cota (1812-1887) in 1830, and they had one daughter, Francisca Temple (1831-1893). Jonathan Temple ancestry In 1836, Temple hosted the first vigilance committee to form in California at his Los Ángeles residence. The committee later executed two lovers accused of the murder of the woman's husband, thereby committing the first lynching in California. ==Rancho Los Cerritos== In 1843, he purchased Rancho Los Cerritos from his wife's relatives, the Cota family. His 1844 adobe survives as part of the Los Cerritos Ranch House National Historic Landmark site. Both Temple and his ranch house played roles in the Mexican-American War. Temple created a thriving cattle ranch and prospered, becoming after Abel Stearns, the wealthiest man in post-statehood Los Angeles County. During the 1840s, Temple was active in ship-bound trade throughout the coasts of Alta California and central Mexico, and owned extensive lands between Acapulco and Mazatlán. In 1856, by providing, through his son-in-law, Gregorio de Ajuria (1819-1861), the funds to finance the Plan of Ayutla removing Antonio López de Santa Anna as Mexico's president/dictator, he became the lessor of the Mexican national mint, a concession held by him and his daughter until 1893, when the mint was nationalized by Porfirio Díaz. ==Post- statehood== Temple was also one of Los Angeles’ first developers, constructing such landmarks as the original Temple Block and the Market House, which later served as city and county administrative headquarters, contained the county courthouse, and featured the first true theater in southern California. He also served as the first alcalde (or mayor) of Los Angeles after capture of the pueblo by the United States during the Mexican-American War and served on the first American-period common (city) council. In 1849, after Los Angeles was ordered by California's military governor to conduct a survey, but couldn't pay for the work, Temple paid for the Ord Survey out of his own funds, and then was repaid by the sale of lots created in the survey. Temple Street (Los Angeles) was developed by him as a modest one-block dirt lane in the 1850s. The ill-fated timing of his construction projects in late 1850s Los Angeles, which was in an economic downturn, was exacerbated by a flood in 1861-62 and drought from 1862-65 that almost destroyed the cattle industry, then the backbone of the local economy. ==San Francisco== Temple moved to San Francisco. Jonathan Temple lived his last years in San Francisco where he died in 1866, two months after selling Rancho Los Cerritos to Flint, Bixby & Co for $20,000, or less than a dollar an acre, during a prolonged depressed real estate market. Rafaela Cota de Temple moved to Paris to join her widowed daughter (Gregorio de Ajuria having died insane in Paris in 1861), and died there in the 1887. ==See also== *Workman and Temple Family **Pliny Fisk Temple (Francisco P.

This is different from and more difficult than the traditional classification problem, which tries to distinguish between two or more classes with the training set containing objects from all the classes. Examples include the monitoring of helicopter gearboxes, motor failure prediction, or the operational status of a nuclear plant as 'normal': In this scenario, there are few, if any, examples of catastrophic system states; only the statistics of normal operation are known. While many of the above approaches focus on the case of removing a small number of outliers or anomalies, one can also learn the other extreme, where the single class covers a small coherent subset of the data, using an information bottleneck approach. ==Overview== The term one-class classification (OCC) was coined by Moya & Hush (1996) and many applications can be found in scientific literature, for example outlier detection, anomaly detection, novelty detection. A feature of OCC is that it uses only sample points from the assigned class, so that a representative sampling is not strictly required for non-target classes. == Introduction == The hypersphere containing the target data having center a and radius R. Objects on the boundary are support vectors, and two objects lie outside the boundary having slack greater than 0. SVM based one-class classification (OCC) relies on identifying the smallest hypersphere (with radius r, and center c) consisting of all the data points. This method is called Support Vector Data Description (SVDD). Formally, the problem can be defined in the following constrained optimization form, \\\\min_{r,c} r^2 \\\\text{ subject to, } \\\\Phi(x_i) - c^2 \\\\le r^2 \\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall i = 1, 2, ..., n However, the above formulation is highly restrictive, and is sensitive to the presence of outliers. Therefore, a flexible formulation, that allow for the presence of outliers is formulated as shown below, \\\\min_{r,c,\\\\zeta} r^2 + \\\\frac{1}{ u n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\zeta_i \\\\text{subject to, } \\\\Phi(x_i) - c^2 \\\\le r^2 + \\\\zeta_i \\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall i = 1, 2, ..., n From Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions, we get c = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\alpha_i\\\\Phi(x_i), where the \\\\alpha_i's are the solution to the following optimization problem: \\\\max_\\\\alpha \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\alpha_i\\\\kappa(x_i, x_i) - \\\\sum_{i, j = 1}^{n}\\\\alpha_i\\\\alpha_j\\\\kappa(x_i, x_j) subject to, \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\alpha_i = 1 \\\\text{ and } 0 \\\\le \\\\alpha_i \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{ u n} \\\\text{for all } i = 1,2,...,n. The introduction of kernel function provide additional flexibility to the One- class SVM (OSVM) algorithm. === PU learning === A similar problem is PU learning, in which a binary classifier is learned in a semi-supervised way from only positive and unlabeled sample points. In PU learning, two sets of examples are assumed to be available for training: the positive set P and a mixed set U, which is assumed to contain both positive and negative samples, but without these being labeled as such. This contrasts with other forms of semisupervised learning, where it is assumed that a labeled set containing examples of both classes is available in addition to unlabeled samples. A variety of techniques exist to adapt supervised classifiers to the PU learning setting, including variants of the EM algorithm. PU learning has been successfully applied to text, time series, bioinformatics tasks, and Remote- Sensing Data. == Approaches == Several approaches have been proposed to solve one-class classification (OCC). The approaches can be distinguished into three main categories, density estimation, boundary methods, and reconstruction methods. === Density estimation methods === Density estimation methods rely on estimating the density of the data points, and set the threshold. These methods rely on assuming distributions, such as Gaussian, or a Poisson distribution. Following which discordancy tests can be used to test the new objects. These methods are robust to scale variance. Gaussian model is one the simplest method to create one-class classifiers. Due to Central Limit Theorem (CLT), these methods work best when large number of samples are present, and they are perturbed by small independent error values. The probability distribution for a d-dimensional object is given by: p_{\\\\mathcal{N}}(x;\\\\mu;\\\\Sigma) = \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^{\\\\frac{d}{2}} \\\\Sigma^\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\exp\\\\\\\\{-\\\\frac{1}{2}(z-\\\\mu)^T \\\\Sigma^{-1} (z - \\\\mu) \\\\\\\\} Where, \\\\mu is the mean and \\\\Sigma is the covariance matrix. Computing the inverse of covariance matrix (\\\\Sigma^{-1}) is the costliest operation, and in the cases where the data is not scaled properly, or data has singular directions pseudo-inverse \\\\Sigma^+is used to approximate the inverse, and is calculated as \\\\Sigma^T(\\\\Sigma \\\\Sigma^T)^{-1}. === Boundary methods === Boundary methods focus on setting boundaries around a few set of points, called target points. These methods attempt to optimize the volume. Boundary methods rely on distances, and hence are not robust to scale variance. K-centers method, NN-d, and SVDD are some of the key examples. K-centers In K-center algorithm, k small balls with equal radius are placed to minimize the maximum distance of all minimum distances between training objects and the centers. Formally, the following error is minimized, \\\\varepsilon_{k-center} = \\\\max_i ( \\\\min_k  x_i - \\\\mu_k ^2 ) The algorithm uses forward search method with random initialization, where the radius is determined by the maximum distance of the object, any given ball should capture. After the centers are determined, for any given test object z the distance can be calculated as, d_{k-centr}(z) = \\\\min_k  z - \\\\mu_k ^2 === Reconstruction methods === Reconstruction methods use prior knowledge and generating process to build a generating model that best fits the data. New objects can be described in terms of a state of the generating model. Some examples of reconstruction methods for OCC are, k-means clustering, learning vector quantization, self- organizing maps, etc. == Applications  Document classification === The basic Support Vector Machine (SVM) paradigm is trained using both positive and negative examples, however studies have shown there are many valid reasons for using only positive examples. When the SVM algorithm is modified to only use positive examples, the process is considered one-class classification. One situation where this type of classification might prove useful to the SVM paradigm is in trying to identify a web browser’s sites of interest based only off of the user’s browsing history. === Biomedical studies === One-class classification can be particularly useful in biomedical studies where often data from other classes can be difficult or impossible to obtain. In studying biomedical data it can be difficult and/or expensive to obtain the set of labeled data from the second class that would be necessary to perform a two- class classification. A study from The Scientific World Journal found that the typicality approach is the most useful in analysing biomedical data because it can be applied to any type of dataset (continuous, discrete, or nominal). The typicality approach is based on the clustering of data by examining data and placing it into new or existing clusters. To apply typicality to one-class classification for biomedical studies, each new observation, y_0 , is compared to the target class, C, and identified as an outlier or a member of the target class. == See also == *Multiclass classification *Anomaly detection *Supervised learning == References == Category:Statistical classification Category:Classification algorithms ","title":"One-class classification"},{"id":"20420406","text":"William L.

He lost all three starts as a pitcher that season, and appeared in two others as a outfielder, getting just two hits in nine at bats for a paltry .222 batting average. During the 1897 season, he also played briefly for the Peoria Blackbirds as well. He made it to the majors with the Chicago Orphans in 1900, appearing in a handful of games as a pitcher and in the outfield. After the brief cup of coffee, Harvey returned to the minors before he split his time in the American League between the Chicago White Sox and Cleveland Indians. Harvey hit five homers for Cleveland in 1901. He appeared in twelve games for Cleveland in 1902, making his final MLB appearance on May 4th, 1902. Had Harvey had enough plate appearances in 1901, he would have qualified for the batting title, as he finished the season with a 353 batting average. Cleveland liked Harvey's talents enough that they signed him for the 1902 season, but with one condition: his days on the mound were over and he was going to be strictly an outfielder. Through 12 games in 1902, Harvey was batting .348 and had one stolen base to his credit. However, Harvey had been suffering from various stomach ailments, and after what would be his final appearance in the majors in May of 1902, Harvey left the Indians and sought medical treatment for his stomach by going to the hot springs of West Baden Illinois, a popular destination for those who sought refuge from various ailments. Harvey thought he had improved but the issues flared up when he was home in California. He attempted a comeback after sitting out the 1903 season, but was just too ill.

They also wanted to retain a physical claim to the territory. While the fort is generally described as being at today's Gloucester City, New Jersey History of Fort Nassau analysis places it on the peninsula in the cove, now Brooklawn Family Search.com: Map of Delaware Valley in 17th century showing forts & settlements with date of founding or possibly on the south side of the creek's cove, at today's Westville Initially the fort was occupied intermittently, and on occasion used by the local population in seasonal migrations. In 1635, colonists from Virginia Colony occupied the fort. The governor of New Netherland at the time, Wouter van Twiller, sent a force and was successful in retaking the fort. This was the first of conflicts between the English and Dutch in the New World. While thereafter the fort was continuously manned, the location was ill-suited to trade, as the richest fur- trapping areas were on the west side of the Delaware River. From 1638–1655 the Delaware Valley was part of New Sweden. It was established by Peter Minuit, former Director of New Netherland who had purchased the island of Manhattan. In 1651, Petrus Stuyvesant, Director-General of New Netherland, had his local representative Andries Hudde partially dismantle the fort, relocating its armaments and other equipment to a position on the other side of the river. He wanted to menace the Swedish and re-assert jurisdiction of the region; he renamed the structure as Fort Casimir. On Trinity Sunday in 1654, Johan Risingh, Commissary and Councilor to New Sweden Governor Lt. Col. Johan Printz, officially assumed his duties. He tried to expel the Dutch from the Delaware Valley and sent forces against Fort Casimir; the garrison surrendered. He renamed it as Fort Trinity (in Swedish Fort Trefaldighet). The Swedes now completely controlled their colony. On June 21, 1654, local bands of the Lenape met with the Swedes to reaffirm their ownership. Peter Stuyvesant led a Dutch force which retook the fort on September 11, 1655. He renamed it as New Amstel (in Dutch Nieuw Amstel). Subsequently, Fort Christina also fell to the Dutch on September 15 and all New Sweden came under their control.

It continues for some 25 kilometres before the river emerges into the upper valley of the Clutha River close to the settlement of Ripponvale.

Florizel von Reuter (21 January 1890 – 10 May 1985) was an American-born violinist and composer, a child prodigy who went on to an adult career, mainly in Germany, as distinguished soloist and teacher of violin. He was also a psychic and medium and the author of several books on his alleged mediumistic communications with deceased musicians, and other works. == Early life == Born on 21 January 1890, Florizel Reuter at Davenport, Iowa, U.S., he was the son of Jacob and Grace Reuter. His father was a musician and minor composer. Florizel had his first violin lessons with his mother. He showed extraordinary talent at a very young age, and went to London to study in 1899. He was taught by Max Bendix, Emile Sauret (who had also taught his father Jacob), César Thomson and Henri Marteau. In 1901 he graduated from the Geneva Conservatory, where there was a debate as to whether he should be allowed to graduate (presumably owing to his age). Several teachers refused to graduate any other pupils unless he was approved, and so the matter was settled. Chickering Hall, USA, 1902 His first professional concert was at La Chaux-de-Fonds in Switzerland in 1900. After giving 30 concerts in that country he began to tour in America, where he was introduced as a protégé of Joseph Joachim's.New York Times (describing Mischa Elman's tour, refers to von Reuter), see 29 November 1908). However, much of his early career was spent performing and teaching in Europe. == Young adulthood == The name \\"von Reuter\\" was adopted in connection with his European career, as a significator of German aristocracy. In c 1916–1917 he became Director of the Zurich Music Academy. He retained his U.S. citizenship despite spending much of the following two decades in Europe. He published a useful introduction to the study and analysis of solo violin music, Führer durch die solo-Violinmusik, eine Skizze ihrer Entstehung und Entwicklung mit kritischer Betrachtung ihrer Hauptwerke (M. Hesse, 1926). === Psychic messages === During the 1920s his mother, Grace Reuter, developed apparent psychic powers by receiving supposed spirit messages through automatic writing. Florizel became closely involved with this and acted as a medium and as recorder of the findings, which were first described in The Psychic Experiences of a Musician (in Search of Truth) (1928) — with a foreword by writer Arthur Conan Doyle — and in its sequel The Consoling Angel (1930). These in particular described conversations with famous deceased musicians. His first important claimed contacts were Paganini and Pablo de Sarasate, and also the late Professor Heinrich Barth of Berlin. Messages were delivered through a type of planchette called an \\"Additor\\", used originally by his mother, and many of them were spelled out backwards. He contributed an essay on \\"Nature Spirits\\" to the 1928 revised edition of Arthur Conan Doyle's The Coming of the Fairies, p. 156–157, and was associated with Baron von Schrenck-Notzing in a series of experiments with the Schneider brothers.Lewis Spence, Encyclopedia of occultism and Parapsychology, Part 2 (Kessinger Publishing, 2003), 776.

His philosophical exchanges with the spirits are described in his book A Musician's Talks with Unseen Friends (London, Rider 1931). === Performance, teaching and recordings === From 1931 to 1933 he was professor of violin at the Vienna Music Academy. Through the 1930s he maintained a teaching and performance career, mainly in Germany and principally at Munich. He made various solo recordings for Polydor Records, and also chamber ensemble works (in 1935–1936) with Elly Ney, Max Strub (violin), Walter Trampler (viola), Ludwig Hoelscher (cello), (the second manifestation of the Strub String QuartetR. Stowell (Ed.), The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet (CUP 2003), p. 71.) and under the direction of Willem van Hoogstraten, husband of Elly Ney. (Ney, Hoelscher and Strub had formed the Elly Ney Trio in 1932.) It was in this period, at Munich, that he taught the young Walter Barylli, whom (aged 15) he invited into his own home as a resident guest so that he could afford to receive violin instruction.Otto Biba, \\"Lebensfülle: Walter Barylli erinnert sich\\", in Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Wien, Sept/Okt 2006 edition, see . Von Reuter also composed more than 50 original works of music, including scores, tone poems, and four operas. == Later career == Von Reuter remained in Germany during the War and until the late 1940s, when he returned to the U.S. He settled in Waukesha, Wisconsin and became Concertmaster of the Waukesha Symphony Orchestra, still teaching into the early 1980s. During the 1970s and 1980s he gave many \\"farewell performances.\\" Von Reuter died in his sleep on May 10, 1985.http://histclo.com/act/music/pro/pro-vr.html Costumes of Boy Musical Prodigies: Florizel von Reuter (1890–1985) ==Publications== He wrote the books: *The Psychic Experiences of a Musician (1928) *The Consoling Angel (1928) *A Musician Talks With Unseen Friends (Rider, 1931) *Great People I Have Known (Freeman Printing, 1961) *The Twilight of the Gods (Hitler's Berlin: A Novel, by an American Who Experienced It (Cultural Press, 1962) *Maiden Worlds Unconquered, Eleven Fiction Tales of Love Through the Ages (Cultural Press, 1967) *The Master From Afar: A Flight into the Past as it Might Have Been (Carlton Press, 1972) == Selected compositions == * Chanson triste for Violin and Piano (1909) * Danses roumaines for Violin and Orchestra, Op.2 No.1 (1909) * Suite after Caprices of Pietro Locatelli for Violin Solo (1925) * Variations on a Funeral March (Original Theme) for Violin Solo (1925) * A Portrait Gallery, for violin and orchestra (1926) * Old American Negro Songs for Violin and Piano (1931) * Symphonic Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (completion of the unfinished last composition Andante und Rondo capriccioso by Max Reger) (1932) * Violin concerto No.1 (1933) * Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (1940) * Violin concerto No.2 (1958) * Concerto grosso for 2 violins and orchestra (1966) * Scottish rhapsody for violin and orchestra == Documents == * Letters by Florizel von Reuter in the State Archives in Leipzig, company archives of the Music Publishing House C.F.Peters (Leipzig). * Scores of both Violin concertos, the Concerto grosso and the Symphonic Rhapsody are freely accessible via the publication project of Tobias Bröker.https://www.tobias-broeker.de/rare-manuscripts/m-r/reuter- florizel-von/ == References and notes  External links == * Costumes of Boy Musical Prodigies: Floriel von Reuter (1890–1985) Category:1890 births Category:1985 deaths Category:20th-century American composers Category:20th- century violinists Category:American male composers Category:American psychics Category:American spiritual mediums Category:American violinists Category:American male violinists Category:Composers for violin Category:People from Davenport, Iowa Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Florizel von Reuter"},{"id":"20420557","text":"Wendell W.

He was consul ordinarius for the year 61 as the colleague of Publius Petronius Turpilianus.Paul A. Gallivan, \\"Some Comments on the Fasti for the Reign of Nero\\", Classical Quarterly, 24 (1974), pp. 291, 316 Judith Ginsburg notes this made him the first novus homo to reach the ordinary consulship since Quintus Veranius 12 years before.Ginsburg, \\"Nero's Consular Policy\\", American Journal of ancient History, 6 (1981), p. 54 ==Early life== Paetus, also known as \\"Caesennius Paetus\\" in a number of sources, was possibly the son of Publius Caesennius Paetus, an Etruscan from Tarquinia; the \\"Lucius Junius\\" suggests he was adopted by a Lucius Junius.Olli Salomies, Adoptive and Polyonymous Nomenclature in the Roman Empire (Helsinki: Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1992), p. 87 He may also be the great-grandson of Lucius Caesennius Lento. ==Career under Nero== Paetus served as a politician and general during the reigns of the emperors Nero (54-68) and Vespasian (69-79). Ginsburg surmises that Paetus achieved the consulship through the influence of a group of senators that included the families of the Vitellii and Flavii.Ginsburg, \\"Nero's Consular Policy\\", p 55 After he stepped down from the consulate in June, Paetus departed Rome to assume the governorship of the imperial province of Cappadocia. During his governorship, the general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo conducted Rome’s war with Parthia over Armenia. In successive campaigns, Corbulo had established Roman rule over the country, and Paetus was placed in charge of defending it from Parthian counterstrokes. Paetus resented Corbulo’s talent as a general. In 62 however, Paetus, at the head of an army that included the legions XII Fulminata and IV Scythica, suffered a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Rhandeia against the Parthian and Armenian forces of King Tiridates I of Armenia. Although relief forces headed by Corbulo were only 50 miles away, Paetus surrendered his fortified camp. He and his legions were shamed by passing under the yoke and were allowed to retreat from Armenia. After his defeat, Paetus' weak character and his incapability to command were revealed, and his military command was entrusted again to Corbulo. Charged with both incompetence and cowardice, Paetus was quickly pardoned by Nero, who dismissively commented that suspense would be harmful to someone of such timidity. ==Career under Vespasian== In 72, Paetus, Governor of Syria since 70, had sent letters addressed to Vespasian accusing King Antiochus IV of the client Kingdom of Commagene, together with his sons Gaius Julius Archelaus Antiochus Epiphanes and Callinicus, of planning to revolt against Rome and allying themselves with the King of Parthia. It is not known whether these accusations were true or false. After reading the letters, Vespasian felt that he could no longer trust the family of Antiochus IV with the protection of the strategic crossings of the Euphrates River at Samosata, and thus resolved to directly annex Commagene. Paetus invaded the Kingdom of Commagene at the head of Legio VI Ferrata. The client Kings Aristobulus of Chalcis and Sohaemus of Emesa also supplied troops to Paetus. The two armies encamped opposite each other, but no battle occurred, as the Commagenians were loath to confront the Roman army. Antiochus Epiphanes, his family, and Callinicus fled to Parthia, while their father, Antiochus IV, fled to Cilicia. There is, however, a possibility that Epiphanes and Callinicus made a short- lived attempt to resist invasion before fleeing to Parthia. Antiochus IV and his family had never wanted war with Rome and they wanted to rebut these accusations. Antiochus Epiphanes, with his family and Callinicus, were brought back to Rome with an honor guard, and lived out their lives there. Paetus' subsequent career and date of death are unknown. ==Personal life== Paetus married Flavia Sabina, born c. 30, the daughter of Titus Flavius Sabinus and Arrecina Clementina and paternal niece of Vespasian. Their children included two sons: the oldest was named Lucius Junius Caesennius Paetus, consul in 79; the younger Lucius Caesennius Sospes, consul in 114.Ronald Syme, \\"The Enigmatic Sospes\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 67 (1977), p. 45 ==References== Category:1st-century Romans Category:1st-century Roman governors of Syria Category:Flavian dynasty Category:Imperial Roman consuls Category:Ancient Roman generals Category:People of the Roman–Parthian Wars Category:Roman governors of Syria Category:Roman governors of Cappadocia Caesennius Paetus, Lucius Paetus, Lucius Junius Category:20s births Category:70s deaths Category:Generals of Nero Category:Generals of Vespasian ","title":"Lucius Caesennius Paetus"},{"id":"20420606","text":"Michael J.

This design, created by Roger Rossmeisl, was manufactured between 1961 and 1981, when it was replaced by an updated version dubbed the Rickenbacker 4003.T. Bacon & B. Moorhouse. The Bass Book. Backbeat Books. 1995. Variant models of the 4001 include the 4001S, 4001LH, 1999 (European model), 4001V63 (reissue), 4001CS (a limited edition series based on Chris Squire's 1965 British model RM1999) and the 4001C64S C Series, a recreation of Paul McCartney's left-handed 4001S with a reversed headstock. There are also Al Cisneros (4003 AC) and Lemmy Kilmister (4004 LK) signature versions of the instrument. ==Construction== The 4001 model features a neck-through construction, a full-wood body, fretboard with metal strings (originally flat- wound, though many players replaced them with round-wounds), twin truss rods, triangle inlays, two pickups, two volume and two tone dials, selector switch, and wiring for Rick-O-Sound (standard after 1971). Rickenbacker also produced six-string and 12 string guitars and a short-scale bass, the 3000 model. The bridge system is a relatively unusual design, both in aesthetics and in function, featuring removable saddles, as well as a compartment designed to hold a foam mute. 272x272px The 4001S (and 1999) model varies in its use of dot inlays, and unbound neck construction. The Rickenbacker 4003, which replaced the 4001, differs in the truss rod design and introduces a fret wire that better withstands the wear from round-wound strings (fast fret wear was a common complaint for many years, and Rickenbacker strived to address the issue). The pickups are also higher in output, and the bridge pickup, a so- called \\"horseshoe\\" pickup, was entirely remodelled, featuring a more conventional design, although the \\"horseshoe\\" is still part of the construction, albeit removable. More recent 4003 models also feature a push- pull switch on one of the tone knobs, which diminishes the output of the pickups, to more closely resemble the original 4001 tone. Other features remained similar to its forebear. Rickenbacker has in recent years also produced a five-string model, featuring a more conventional bridge system, smaller Schaller machine heads and distinctive, asymmetrical pickups. It retains the Rickenbacker's signature 33\\" scale length, an unusual design for a five-string instrument. Between the years 1993 and 2018 Rickenbacker also manufactured a streamlined model, named the 4004, that used the 4001's trademark shape but featured smaller pickups, a simplified control layout, a more conventional bridge system and eschewed the use of aesthetic details such as binding or a pickguard. ==Notable players== *Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead * Stu Cook of Creedence Clearwater Revival, with a 4001 featured prominently on the Bayou Country album's cover photograph *John BentleyJohn can be seen playing the Ric in the official video for of Squeeze *Audun Laading of Her's * Martin Turner of Wishbone Ash *Geezer Butler of Black Sabbath *Jon Camp of Renaissance *Peter Cetera of Chicago *Al Cisneros of Sleep and OM *Paul D'Amour of Tool *John Deacon of Queen *John Entwistle of The Who *Bruce Foxton of The Jam *Simon Gallup of The Cure *Ken McNaughton of High and Outside *Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees *Roger Glover *Martin Gordon of Sparks and Radio Stars *Paul Gray of The Damned, Eddie & The Hot Rods and UFO *Bob Hardy of Franz Ferdinand *Glenn Hughes of Deep Purple, Trapeze, and Black Country Communion *Rick James *Inge Johansson of Against Me! * *Prakash John *Simon Johns of Stereolab *Jesse F.

Allen's life was the inspiration for the 2013 film The Butler. ==Life== Allen was born in Buckingham County, Virginia and raised on Shirland Farm near Scottsville. He worked as a waiter for many years, in \\"whites-only resorts and country clubs\\", including The Homestead resort in Hot Springs, Virginia, and a club in Washington. He started in the White House in 1952 as a \\"pantry man\\", a job which involved basic tasks such as dish washing, stocking and cleaning silverware. Over the years Allen rose in his position, becoming the butler to the president. Allen was particularly affected by the murder of President Kennedy in 1963. According to his son, \\"My father came home late on the day that President Kennedy had been shot. But then he got up and put his coat back on. He said, 'I've got to go back to work.' But in the hallway, he fell against the wall and started crying. That was the first time in my life I had ever seen my father cry.\\"\\"White House butler Eugene Allen's humility recalled at funeral\\", Washington Post, April 9, 2010. He was invited to the funeral, but chose to stay at work to prepare for the reception, because \\"Someone had to be at the White House to serve everyone after they came from the funeral.\\" Allen never missed a day of work in 34 years. Allen finally attained the most prestigious rank of butlers serving in the White House, Maître d'hôtel, in 1981, during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Reagan invited Allen and his wife Helene to a state dinner in honor of Helmut Kohl at the White House. Allen was the first White House butler ever to be invited as a guest to a state dinner. He retired in 1986. Allen was married to his wife, Helene, for 65 years. They met at a birthday party in Washington in 1942, and married a year later in 1943. The couple had one son, Charles Allen. He and his wife had intended to vote for Barack Obama in 2008, but she died the day before the election, on November 3.The Man at the Door. The Washington Post (August 12, 2013). Retrieved on August 31, 2013. Allen died of kidney failure at the Washington Adventist Hospital in Takoma Park, Maryland on March 31, 2010. ==Public reputation== Allen came to public attention when a 2008 article about him and his wife, by journalist Wil Haygood, entitled \\"A Butler Well Served by This Election\\", was published in The Washington Post shortly after the 2008 presidential election. It placed Allen's life in the context of changing race relations and the personalities of the presidents he'd served. It ended with the story of how the couple intended to vote for Obama together but Helene died just before the election, > They talked about praying to help Barack Obama get to the White House. > They’d go vote together. She’d lean on her cane with one hand, and on him > with the other, while walking down to the precinct. And she’d get supper > going afterward...On Monday Helene had a doctor’s appointment. Gene woke and > nudged her once, then again. He shuffled around to her side of the bed. He > nudged Helene again. He was all alone. “I woke up and my wife didn’t,” he > said later. The story had an immediate impact. Columbia Pictures bought the film rights to Allen's life story, and he was invited to the new president's inauguration, where he commented, \\"That's the man...Whew, I'm telling you, it's something to see. Seeing him standing there, it's been worth it all.\\" Allen and other workers who served presidents were featured in a 32-minute documentary, Workers at the White House, directed by Marjorie Hunt and released on a 2009 DVD, White House Workers: Traditions and Memories by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings. Allen's life was the inspiration for the 2013 film The Butler. Danny Strong's screenplay was inspired by the 2008 Washington Post article. The film departs from the facts of Allen's life. The central character, \\"Cecil Gaines\\", is only loosely based on the real Allen. ==References *The Independent: Eugene Allen: White House butler who worked for eight US presidents * Category:1919 births Category:2010 deaths Category:African-American people Category:American butlers Category:White House staff Category:Deaths from kidney failure Category:People from Scottsville, Virginia Category:Restaurant staff Category:People from Buckingham County, Virginia ","title":"Eugene Allen"},{"id":"20420897","text":"Gymnopilus luteoviridis is a widely distributed mushroom of the Eastern United States that contains the hallucinogens psilocybin and psilocin. ==Description== *Pileus: 2.5– 4 cm in diameter, moderately thick (4 – 5 mm), convex to subconic with an incurved margin when young, becoming nearly flat.

He is also the husband and close collaborator of Council of Economic Advisers former Chairwoman Christina Romer. ==Education and early career== After graduating from Amherst Regional High School in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1976, he obtained his bachelor's degree in economics from Princeton University in 1980 and graduated as the valedictorian of his class. Romer completed a 138-page long senior thesis \\"A Study of the Effects of Population on Development, with Applications to Japan.\\" Romer worked as a Junior Staff Economist at the Council of Economic Advisers from 1980 to 1981 before beginning his Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which he completed in 1985. A reduced version of his undergraduate thesis research was published in the Review of Economics and Statistics. Upon completion of his doctorate, he started working as an assistant professor at Princeton University. In 1988 he moved to University of California, Berkeley and was promoted to full professor in 1993. ==Research== Romer's early research made him one of the leaders of the New Keynesian economics. Specifically, an influential paper with Laurence Ball, published in 1989, established that real rigidities (that is, stickiness in relative prices) can exacerbate nominal rigidities (that is, stickiness in nominal prices).http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~lchrist/papers/restud.pdf Romer's most widely cited paper is \\"A Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth,\\" coauthored with Gregory Mankiw and David Weil and published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1992. The paper argues that the Solow growth model, once augmented to include a role for human capital, does a reasonably good job of explaining international differences in standards of living. According to Google Scholar, it has been cited more than 15,000 times, making it one of the most cited articles in the field of economics. In more recent work, Romer has worked with Christina Romer on fiscal and monetary policy from the 1950s to the present, using notes from the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the materials prepared by Fed staff to study how the Federal Reserve makes its decisions. His work suggests that some of the credit for the relatively stable economic growth in the 1950s should lie with good policy made by the Federal Reserve,http://emlab.berkeley.edu/~dromer/papers/aer_v92.pdf and that the members of the FOMC could at times have made better decisions by relying more closely on forecasts made by the Fed professional staff.http://www.econ.berkeley.edu/~dromer/papers/aer_98_2.pdf Most recently, the Romers have focused on the impact of tax policy on government and general economic growth. This work looks at the historical record of US tax changes from 1945–2007, excluding \\"endogenous\\" tax changes made to fight recessions or offset the cost of new government spending. It finds that such \\"exogenous\\" tax increases, made for example to reduce inherited budget deficits, reduce economic growth (though by smaller amounts after 1980 than before). Romer and Romer also find \\"no support for the hypothesis that tax cuts restrain government spending; indeed ... tax cuts may increase spending. The results also indicate that the main effect of tax cuts on the government budget is to induce subsequent legislated tax increases.\\" He has also written papers on some unusual subjects for a macroeconomist, such as “Do Students Go to Class?

It stars Tony Franciosa, Michael Sarrazin and Jacqueline Bisset in an early starring role. The film also features Bob Denver in the role of Choo-Choo, a Beatnik piano-playing draft dodger. Sarrazin and Bisset were nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer, Male and Female respectively. The Sweet Ride was directed by Harvey Hart and written by Tom Mankiewicz, based on a 1967 novel of the same name by William Murray, a native of New York City, who had moved to southern California in 1966. ==Plot== The story, told in flashbacks, concerns a middle-aged tennis bum (Franciosa) who shares a beach house with Sarrazin and Denver. Their carefree life becomes complicated, and later turns tragic, after they become involved with a mysterious young woman (Bisset) and a biker gang. The San Francisco rock and roll band Moby Grape contributed to the soundtrack, and appeared, credited, in the film, performing the song \\"Never Again\\" in a Sunset Strip nightclub called the Tarantula.

However, although this is her only songwriting credit to appear on an ABBA album, she also co-wrote a song that ABBA performed in concert, \\"I'm Still Alive\\"; recordings of this often appears in bootlegs. The song itself is a folk-pop based ballad somewhat similar to her pre-ABBA solo work. The track has \\"sparse instrumentation\\", and the song has no harmonies from other ABBA members.

During the ceremony, Sizomu stressed the viability of the Jewish faith for sub-Saharan Africans by noting, “The relationship between God and the Jews in the Torah resonates for many spiritual seekers. It is important that Africans and others know that they can choose Judaism as a spiritual path and that we are open to them.\\" ==Political activities== Rabbi Sizomu was a candidate to represent Uganda's Bungokho North District in Parliament in the 2011 election, held on February 18, 2011.\\"Rabbi Runs for Parliament\\" He lost that election, but ran again in 2016 and was elected to Parliament in a close race.

It was built by early Clarke County pioneers as protection during the Creek War and was attacked in 1813 by Creek warriors. A marker was erected at the site by Clarke County school children in 1931 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 1974. ==History== At the time of the Creek War, originally a civil war within the Creek nation, Clarke was a newly formed county in the Mississippi Territory. The Creek were divided between traditionalists in the Upper Towns and those who had adopted more European- American customs in the Lower Towns. Chiefs of the towns disagreed about the uses of communal land and other issues. The first hostilities of the war that involved Americans occurred nearby during the Battle of Burnt Corn, where white militia attacked the Red Sticks on July 27, 1813. The next month, the Red Sticks on August 30, 1813 attacked Fort Mims, garrisoned by the Tensaw Creek. The Red Sticks believed the Tensaw had left behind core Creek values. They killed most of the several hundred people assembled inside Fort Mims, who included Lower Town Creek, intermarried whites and slaves, and other settlers, in an event that became known as the Fort Mims massacre. Fort Sinquefield was used as a refuge by several pioneer families and friendly Lower Creek after the attack on Fort Mims. On September 1, 1813, Red Stick warriors led by Josiah Francis, a.k.a. Francis the Prophet, attacked the Ransom Kimbell and Abner James families, who had left the crowded fort for Kimbell's cabin nearby. Most of the men escaped back to the fort, but twelve women and children were killed and scalped in what became known as the Kimbell-James Massacre. The bodies were retrieved for burial outside the fort the next day. The Red Sticks attacked a second time that day, catching several woman who were washing clothes at a spring away from the fort. They attempted to cut the women off from the fort, but were thwarted by settlers who released their 60 dogs from the fort. The Creek killed one woman, Sarah Phillips. The other settlers gained the fort, from where they fired at the Red Sticks. Casualties of the conflict included several warriors as well as the settler Stephen Lacey. The attack lasted two hours before the Red Sticks retreated. The survivors abandoned Sinquefield soon after, moving to the larger Fort Madison, several miles to the south. ==See also== *Choctaw Corner ==References *Power Point presentation on Fort Sinquefield, Official website Category:National Register of Historic Places in Clarke County, Alabama Sinquefield Category:Battles of the Creek War Category:Pre-statehood history of Alabama Sinquefield Sinquefield Category:Military installations established in 1813 Category:1813 establishments in Mississippi Territory ","title":"Fort Sinquefield"},{"id":"20421349","text":"KNMQ-LD, virtual and UHF digital channel 20, is a low-powered television station licensed to Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States and transmitting from Sandia Crest. Owned by RJ Enterprises, it is a translator of Santa Fe- licensed religious independent station KCHF (channel 11, owned by Son Broadcasting), providing easier reception in areas of Albuquerque where a quality signal from KCHF's main transmitter near Los Alamos is not available. KNMQ-LD's parent station maintains studios on 4th Street in northwestern Albuquerque. ==History== This station was originally K45DL broadcasting on UHF channel 45 beginning sometime in 1995. It was an America's Store affiliate until 2005. The broadcast on channel 45 ended in 2002 to make way for the digital broadcast for KASY-TV. It moved to channel 43 in early 2003 and changed the callsign to K43HW. By 2008, K43HW would not broadcast any programming over the next few years: the station was silent displaying the color bars. Later, it would shut down its transmitter entirely. On March 28, 2011, it was granted a construction permit to flash cut to digital broadcasting. The station was sold to RJ Enterprises by Joseph W. Shaffer in late 2011. An FCC application states that the new owners are planning to move the station's transmitter site and possibly move to a different channel position. On June 6, 2012, it was granted a permit modification to move its transmitter to Sandia Crest, where most of the area's television stations broadcast from. On December 19, 2012, the station began broadcasting its digital signal, airing only audio from KDAZ radio, which was also heard at the time on KYNM-LD channel 30.730. The channel went back off the air in mid- January 2013. On January 23, 2013, the station changed its call sign to K43HW-D. On February 21, 2013, the call sign again changed to KNMQ-LD. On May 24, 2013 the station had applied to the FCC to remain silent while the broadcast tower was undergoing modifications.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101556506&formid;=910&fac;_num=32280 In early May 2014, the station went back on the air, relaying KCHF programming. ==Digital televisionDigital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {  - !

He has produced over 83 works, primarily films along with some video games. He produced The Boondock Saints (1999), Battlefield Earth (2000) and Spartan (2004). Samaha built his reputation in Hollywood first as the owner of Celebrity Cleaners and then with his nightclub on Sunset Strip, the Roxbury. Parlaying the Hollywood friendships he formed through his clubs, Samaha was able in 1999 to lock up a distribution deal with Warner Bros. Pictures. ==Early life== Samaha was born in Zahlé, Lebanon. ==Career== Samaha also was a co-owner/founder of the dry cleaner chain Celebrity Cleaners and co-owner of the Roxbury nightclub in Los Angeles. Between 1998 and 2004, Samaha produced films under the Franchise Pictures studio title, which included films such as The Boondock Saints , Mercy, Battlefield Earth, The Whole Nine Yards, Get Carter, Angel Eyes and Driven. Samaha specialized in rescuing stars' pet projects. Franchise Pictures sought out stars whose projects were stalled at the major studios, bringing them aboard at reduced salaries. Samaha approach was to produce star vehicles more cheaply than the larger studios. His unorthodox deals raised eyebrows and the entertainment industry magazine Variety commented that they were \\"often so complex and variable as to leave outsiders scratching their heads\\". As Samaha put it during an interview about Battlefield Earth, \\"I said, 'If John [Travolta] wants to make this movie, what does he want to get paid?' ... Because I do not pay anybody what they make. That is not my business plan.\\" He is currently the President of Take 3 Productions, which produced Breaking Brooklyn (2016), a dance film starring Louis Gossett Jr., Nathan Kress and Colin Critchley. In 2000, Samaha was sued by Intertainment Pictures, his business partners on a number of films. Intertainment won a $70 million judgment against Samaha for fraudulently overcharging them for production costs on the films. ==Personal life== Samaha was married to Diane Shammas from 1980 to 1988. He was married to actress Tia Carrere from 1992 to 2000. ==Films== All films, he was producer unless otherwise noted. ===Film=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" ! B0C4DE;\\"  Year ! B0C4DE;\\"  Film !

Established in 1926, the institute is one of Australia's oldest medical research organisations with an historical focus on cardiovascular disease. In 2008, it became the country's first medical research institute to target diabetes, heart disease, obesity and their complications at the basic, clinical and population health levels. The Institute is located adjacent to The Alfred Hospital within the Alfred Research Alliance Precinct. The Institute also has a national Aboriginal Health program, with a research facility in Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. ==Research== The Institute's research agenda is based on the notion of a disease continuum from birth to death, with the aim of treating, managing and preventing the progression of disease at any stage. The Baker Institute's work ranges from cellular and molecular biology research in the laboratory to clinical-based research through to lifestyle and behavioural research that aims to inform prevention strategies. The Institute's science strategy and organisation structure contains programs to encourage broad-based, multidisciplinary research to focus on peaks of scientific excellence, and domains to accommodate funding and line management. The present five programs focus on specific questions that form the basis for the Institute's work. Baker Institute's teams comprising medical specialists, scientists and public health experts are focussed on bringing their knowledge and expertise to bear on these areas: * Atherothrombosis: How can vulnerable plaque be identified and treated? * Bioinformatics and Validation: Using big data approaches to inform our science. * Diabetic Complications: How to prevent the progression of diabetes to complications affecting arteries, the heart, the kidneys and the eyes? * Hypertension and Cardiac Disease: How to reverse chronic heart disease, and prevent and repair structural damage to the heart from hypertension, heart disease and associated rhythm disturbances? * Immunometabolism: Maintaining overall health, no system in the human body is more important than our immune system * Obesity and Lipids: Alterations in how we metabolise fats (lipids) underpins many chronic diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and age-related dementia. * Physical Activity: What physical activity, diet and other behavioural patterns are optimal at different life stages in preventing diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and how can behavioural and generational change best be addressed? The Institute's domains are based around seven themes. * The Prevention domain seeks to slow ageing and prevent progression of these conditions by research informing primary prevention through physical activity, more accurate risk assessment and early-intervention strategies to limit/reverse disease progression. * The Cardiometabolic Risk domain aim is to understand diabetes and obesity at the clinical and population levels, and to build the evidence to support specific policy or practice approaches. * Aboriginal Health is a national program of research to improve the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, with a particular focus on the residents of Central Australia. This domain leads research projects in close collaboration with community stakeholders across remote, regional and urban settings. * The Clinical Research domain provides a focal point for the Institute's interests in human research and clinical-service provision, including governance and planning of clinical trials, clinical-service delivery through the Baker Specialist Clinics, and an increasing interest in diagnostic imaging – including MRI, cardiac echo and ultrasound. * The Diabetes domain incorporates basic, translational and clinical research in the field of diabetes, with a particular interest in diabetic complications. The focus is on developing and retesting novel pharmacological approaches to reduce the disease burden. * The Vascular Disease domain encompasses teams focused on understanding vascular disease pathologies from pre-symptomatic through to overt disease. * The Heart Disease and Neuroscience domain encompasses disorders including heart failure, coronary-artery disease, myocardial infarctions and arrhythmias. ===Research outcomes and achievements=== * Baker scientists have developed a One-Hour mitral valve (the heart's largest valve) repair device. It is implanted in a one-hour day surgery procedure which previously required open-heart surgery. Baker Institute scientist, Dr David Kaye, and his team have invented a device that fixes a leaking valve in the heart. The mitral valve controls the blood flow from the lungs back into the left side of the heart, to be pumped back out through the rest of the body. This valve often leaks in patients with heart failure, so-called mitral regurgitation. When the heart enlarges, which is a characteristic feature of heart failure, the left ventricle enlarges and makes this valve function abnormally. Blood goes back into the lungs and that in fact is one of the causes of the symptoms of breathlessness and waking up in the night short of breath. It contributes to heart failure being a progressive disease, one in which the heart continually gets worse. The device is placed in the heart using a catheter-based system. A thin metal wire made of a special medical-grade alloy tightens up this valve, putting a little ring around it from the outside, which improves the function of the mitral valve and reduces regurgitation. * The Institute is the coordinating centre for the Australian National Blood Pressure trial. * Baker scientists have performed research underpinning international guidelines for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including the first studies demonstrating that regular exercise reduces blood pressure and improves insulin sensitivity. * Baker IDI scientists published the first study showing the benefits of walking. * The Baker IDI has also published widely in nutrition, dietary supplements, and metabolism based research. * The Baker IDI has shown that some anti-diabetes drugs (ACE inhibitors) also have an anti-ageing effect. * Baker research proved that mental stress and cigarette smoking both provide selective and potentially harmful stimulation of the nerves of the heart. * The Baker demonstrated the exercise can lower blood pressure.Diabetes Care The study was a collaboration between the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, and the University of Melbourne and University of Queensland. * Baker IDI scientists have proved for the first time that damage done by unhealthy eating is \\"remembered\\" in genetic controls – epigenetics – and turns off good genes needed to prevent diabetes, heart disease and other complications. Lead researcher Assoc Prof Assam El-Osta, from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute team, said this meant that eating a chocolate would not only go straight to your hips, but also sit on your DNA. Epub 2008 Sep 22. Erratum in: J Exp Med. 2008 Oct 27;205(11):2683. * A world-first test to identify people who will suffer heart disease years before they die of a heart attack is being developed by Baker IDI. The test has the potential to screen for heart disease long before any symptoms strike by pinpointing patterns in proteins contained in urine, which were discovered by researchers at Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute. There are no tests to screen for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease – which is responsible for 80 per cent of heart conditions – and the first sign of illness for many people is a fatal or near-fatal heart attack. The Melbourne team led by Prof Karlheinz Peter developed a urine test with the German biotech company Mosaiques and the University of Freiburg, which has already proved 84 per cent accurate in early trials. * Described an assay for glutamic acid decarboxylase to discriminate major types of diabetes mellitus * The plasma protein which led to the distinction between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes was discovered by Baker scientists * Sir James Officer Brown researched and tested open heart surgery on animals with the support of the Baker Medical Research Institute, and went on to supervise the first successful open heart surgery in Australia in 1957. Other Baker Institute colleagues such as Kenneth N Morris and George Stirling performed the first coronary bypass and the first heart transplant whilst associated with the Institute. ==History== The Baker Medical Research Institute was the creation of Dr. John F. Mackeddie, a clinical doctor and researcher, who had the idea of improving the laboratory facilities at The Alfred Hospital to keep up with advances in research. Mackeddie persuaded his friend, the photography industry pioneer and philanthropist Thomas Baker and his wife, Alice and sister-in-law, Eleanor Shaw, to assume financial responsibility. They decided the Institute should not only provide a better laboratory service for the hospital but should also have facilities for medical research. Dr. William J. Penfold, who was internationally renowned in bacteriology and preventative medicine and was prominent in establishing the Australian Medical Research Council, was the first director of the Baker from 1926 until 1938. He was followed by Dr. Arthur B. Corkill, who first came to the Institute as a biochemist. Corkill described the methods of diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus at The Alfred Hospital in 1927. Twenty years later, in 1947, a young biochemist called Joe Bornstein was introduced to Corkill. Their work together resulted in the discovery of the two forms of diabetes—insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). This discovery in 1949 \\"... literally changed the concepts, research and treatment of diabetes\\". From 1949 until 1974, Dr. Thomas E. Lowe was the Institute's director. With a team of notable investigators, Lowe developed the Baker into a major research organisation with world-class facilities. The team included: * Paul Fantl identified key parts of the clotting cascade * Alf Barnett a pioneer of the treatment of hypertension and vascular disease * Priscilla Kincaid-Smith identified analgesics as a cause of kidney failure * Winifred Nayler helped define calcium channel physiology * Austin Doyle had a profound impact on hypertension research and founded the High Blood Pressure Research Council of Australia It was during this time that cardiovascular research became the major focus. Research included the further development of cardiovascular surgery; new techniques of ECG and phonocardiography; treatment of congestive cardiac failure and of arterial hypertension. Sir James Officer Brown researched and tested open heart surgery in pre-clinical trials with the support of the Baker Institute, paving the way for Australia's first successful open heart operation at The Alfred Hospital in 1957 which was undertaken by Kenneth Morris. Morris went on to make major contributions to cardiac and thoracic surgery, alongside George Stirling (Director of the Cardiothoracic Surgery Unit at The Alfred Hospital from 1971 to 1988), with strong support from the Baker Institute in trialling and developing new cardiothoracic techniques. Professor Paul Korner , a cardiac physiologist noted for his contributions to the understanding of hypertension, took on the role of director in 1975 and by this time, the sole focus of the Institute was cardiovascular disease research. Significant advancements during this time included new strategies for hypertension; greater understanding of the role of the autonomic nervous system; insight into the role of cholesterol in atherogenesis and triglycerides as an independent risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis. Notable investigators included Paul Nestel (nutrition, CVD, atherosclerosis and lipid metabolism), Murray Esler (causes and treatment of high blood pressure and heart failure, and effects of stress on the cardiovascular system) and Garry Jennings (causes, prevention and treatment of CVD, and relationship between exercise, blood pressure, sympathetic nervous system activity and glucose metabolism). Other notable investigators whose work would come to have a significant bearing on the Institute included Paul Zimmet, who pioneered Australia's first institute dedicated exclusively to diabetes. His research in Australian, Pacific, and Indian Ocean populations has highlighted the rise of diabetes worldwide, providing new insights into the genetic and environmental determinants of type 2 diabetes. Professor John Funder was appointed Director in 1990 and bought his work on cardiovascular endocrinology, especially aldosterone action to the Institute. Funder rewrote the pathophysiolology of adrenal steroid action in the cardiovascular system, reshaping what we believe about aldosterone, cortisol and mineralcorticol receptors. He was recognised for his contributions to public policy across primary health issues. In 2001, cardiologist-researcher Professor Garry Jennings AO became the Institute's sixth Director. Under Jennings’ leadership, the Institute grew substantially and by 2002, the Institute had its own purpose-built facilities adjacent to The Alfred Hospital. By 2007, a national Aboriginal Health research program was established to help address the profound health disadvantage experienced by Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. Jennings also oversaw one of the most significant changes in the Institute's history, the merger in 2008 of the Baker Heart Research Institute with the International Diabetes Institute, which was founded and led by Zimmet. This created Australia's first multidisciplinary medical research institute dedicated to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and their complications, such as kidney disease. ===The Baker Heart Research Institute=== J. F. Mackeddie, a pathologist originally from Scotland, but who practised in Melbourne in the early 20th century, became a close friend of Thomas Baker through being neighbours on land south of the city. Mackeddie was “concerned with the science of diseases and the need to apply the advancing knowledge of biological science to human illness…” After convincing Baker to donate funds, firstly to the Alfred Hospital and then for research, he went on to become one of the founding Trustees of the Baker Medical Research Institute. Mackeddie recruited A. B. (Basil) Corkill as a biochemist for the new Institute. The salary was paid by Thomas Baker. The initial project dealt with new techniques for diagnosing diseases of the nervous system, in particular, the changes in cell content and chemistry of cerebro-spinal fluid in various diseases. Other projects in the early days involved bacteriology, at the time the Institute was started, the advancing edge of scientific medicine, and its application to the management of infectious disease in man. In the 1930s microbiology was a focus, with many of those projects reliant upon blood cultures and the techniques developed were published in a monograph – \\"Blood Cultures and their Significance\\" by H Butler in 1937. The Monograph Series lasted until 1974 – with 9 published. They covered anaesthesia, tumours, the cardiovascular system and scleroderma. Basil Corkill described the methods of diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus at the Alfred Hospital in 1927. Twenty years later, in 1947, Joe Bornstein a young biochemist was introduced to Basil Corkill, who by then was Director of the Baker Institute. Their work together resulted in the discovery of the 2 forms of diabetes – insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). This discovery in 1949 “..literally changed the concepts, research and treatment of diabetes”. In their collection of memoirs of Baker Medical Research Institute Alumni, Andrew and Barnett describe the work of the Baker Institute to have “..always been in the interface between scientific medicine and the practice of medicine, a field engendered and enhanced by its association with Alfred Hospital.” They remark that from its earliest days, the staff were involved in communicating the outputs of research to the clinical community and the community in general. An example being the statewide tours of Victoria that Basil Corkill and Ewen Downe made to introduce the new insulin treatment of diabetes mellitus. In 1940, Paul Fantl became interested in blood clotting. At the time, synthetic Vitamin K was being produced and was often in short supply. Using very simple equipment – test tubes, water bath, stop watches and a centrifuge – he was “in the forefront of a revolutionary concept that led to the recognition of Factors V, VII, and X”, and with Miss Nance, internationally credited with the discovery of Factor V. He went on to become a member of the International Committee for the Standardisation of the Nomenclature of Blood Clotting Factors in 1956. In 1963 he was honoured when the Fantl-Koller Schema was declared. Other areas of research up to 1949 included asthma, eye disease, immunoproteins, scleroderma and surgery. The research on surgery lead to the development of cardiac surgery at the Alfred Hospital. In the 1950s Tom Lowe decided to make a study of congestive heart failure. He concluded “that the body's fluid system was an 'open system' with an intake and output and divisions of the contents under control of various factors”. He was also interested in electrocardiography, especially vector cardiography and had machines constructed to show the three-dimensional view. Between 1949 and 1974, staff at the Baker Medical Research Institute also devoted a significant amount of time and energy to equipment construction to meet the needs of their researchers, this included some early, crude versions of heart-lung machines to aid in cardiac surgery. Some research on the alimentary canal also was undertaken, however this work ceased in 1968. In 1949, cardiovascular research was one of the major growth edges of medicine was cardiology. At the time, it represented two thirds of the total research in the Baker Medical Research Institute. Cardiology research included: * Further development of cardiovascular surgery * New techniques of ECG and phonocardiography * Introduction of cardiac catheterisation to record blood flow and pressure in circulation and introducing diagnostic materials * Development of plethysmography to measure blood flow in limbs * Clinical pharmacology of various cardioactive drugs * Treatment of congestive cardiac failure and of arterial hypertension ===The International Diabetes Institute (1984–2008)=== The International Diabetes Institute was started in Melbourne in 1984 by Professor Paul Zimmet a number of years after his appointment to the Royal Southern Memorial Hospital. “The research of Paul and his team in Pacific and Indian Ocean populations has provided new insights into the genetic contribution of NIDDM as well as the role of obesity, physical activity, nutrition and sociocultural change in the aetiology of this disorder.” In 1980 Zimmet was asked by the Council of the Australian Diabetes Society to prepare a submission, along with colleague Dr Ian Martin, titled 'Diabetes in Australia'. The submission was to the Federal Minister of Health. The submission highlighted the impact of diabetes in the community and what government needed to invest to find a cure or treatment and to support people with diabetes. At the same time, with Drv Matthew Cohen, Zimmet was the first to report their experience with home glucose monitoring and its acceptance in the diabetic population. They found better control, less hypoglycaemia and 95% acceptance. One of the most significant contributions of the International Diabetes Institute has been the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab). In 2000 it was the first national study to provide estimates of the number of people with diabetes (based on blood tests) and its public health and societal impact. It is now considered an integral component of the National Diabetes Strategy to tackle the mounting problem of diabetes and its complications in Australia. In addition to research, the IDI operated diabetes clinics in Melbourne from the site of the Caulfield Hospital. The diabetes clinics are the largest in Victoria, with more than 8000 patients per year and continue to be operated by Baker IDI from the organisation's site in Prahran in Melbourne's inner south-east. ===Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute (2008–2016)=== In 2008 the Baker Heart Research Institute, as it was then known, merged with the International Diabetes Institute which had operated in Melbourne for over 25 years.

International projects in heart disease and diabetes are currently conducted in Mauritius, South Africa, Fiji, India and Vietnam. ===Funding=== The Baker Heart Research Institute is funded from a diverse range of Government and private sources including the corporate sector, trusts and foundations and individual donors. In 2007 the Baker IDI Concise Financial Report showed receipts from granting bodies of $32.6million. A further $7.4 million came from donations and bequests and $20.27 million from commercial income.Baker IDI 2008 Research Update, Baker IDI, Melbourne p31 === Collaborative partners === The Institute was a founding partner of the Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct in 2002, which also includes Alfred Health, Monash University, Burnet Institute, La Trobe University and Deakin University. The Baker Institute is also a partner of Monash Partners Academic Health Science Centre, an Australian health industry, research and educational collaboration. In March 2015, Monash Partners was recognised by the National Health and Medical Research Council as one of four Advanced Health Research and Translation Centres in Australia. Baker Institute's longest partnership has been with The Alfred Hospital, which dates back to the Institute's inception in 1926 on the hospital site. One of the significant developments of this partnership has been the Alfred Baker Medical Unit, which was established in 1949 and is the hub of joint research and clinical activity between the two institutions. === Subsidiaries === * Osprey * V-Kardia Pty Ltd * Elacor Pty Ltd ==See also== *Health in Australia *Cardiovascular disease in Australia *Diabetes in Australia == References  External links == * The Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute * Nucleus Network * Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct * Alfred Health * Monash Partners Academic Health Science Centre Baker Institute Category:Heart disease organizations Category:Diabetes organizations Category:Research institutes established in 1926 Category:1926 establishments in Australia Category:Monash University Category:La Trobe University Category:Deakin University ","title":"Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute"},{"id":"20421559","text":"The Fengjiahe Formation is a geological formation in China.

Over one million people in the United States and an estimated 5 million people globally suffer from Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease that impacts motor activity, and its prevalence is increasing with the aging of the population. Based on the IMPACT Registry Study and the results of Cynapsus' Global 500 Neurologists Survey, it is estimated that between 25 percent and 50 percent of patients experience \\"off\\" episodes in which they have impaired movement or speaking capabilities. Current medications only control the disease's symptoms, and most drugs become less effective over time as the disease progresses. Cynapsus' lead drug candidate, APL-130277, is an easy-to- administer, fast-acting and oral reformulation of an approved drug, apomorphine, used to rescue patients from \\"off\\" episodes. Cynapsus is focused on rapidly maximizing the value of APL-130277 by completing pivotal studies in advance of a New Drug Application expected to be submitted in 2015. Cynapsus anticipates out-licensing to an appropriate pharmaceutical partner before such an application is submitted. ==ProductsAPL-130277=== APL-130277 is a reformulation of an approved Parkinson's drug. APL-130277 is a novel oral formulation of an approved drug for Parkinson's patients designed to deliver significant clinical benefits over the current marketed treatment. The drug will treat patients with moderate to severe PD and address a significant unmet clinical need as expressed by clinicians and patients. The drug is expected to undergo accelerated approval through 505(b)(2) FDA regulatory pathway with the US FDA and a similar pathway with other international regulatory agencies. This well developed regulatory path could result in a New Drug Approval application being submitted in late 2014 or early 2015. APL-130277 has the potential to address a significant underserved portion of $3 Billion+ Parkinson's Disease market. Cynapsus has entered into an agreement with Adagio Pharmaceuticals Ltd. granting Cynapsus the option to execute a proposed exclusive, worldwide agreement to license all intellectual property relating to and issued from continuing development APL-130277. ==External links== * * BioFinance - Company Overview == References == Category:Pharmaceutical companies of Canada Category:Companies based in Toronto Category:Companies formerly listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange ","title":"Cynapsus Therapeutics"},{"id":"20421681","text":"__NOTOC__ Yongning ( unless otherwise noted) may refer to: ==Places in China== *Yongning County, Ningxia *Yongning District (邕宁区), Nanning, Guangxi ===Subdistricts=== *Yongning Subdistrict, Guangzhou, in Zengcheng District, Guangzhou, Guangdong *Yongning Subdistrict, Nanjing, in Pukou District, Nanjing, Jiangsu *Yongning Subdistrict, Yitong County, in Yitong County, Jilin *Yongning Subdistrict, Luzhou, in Naxi District, Luzhou, Sichuan ===Towns=== *Yongning, Beijing, in Yanqing District, Beijing *Yongning, Fujian, in Shishi, Fujian *Yongning, Hui County, in Hui County, Gansu *Yongning, Zhuanglang County, in Zhuanglang County, Gansu *Yongning, Yangchun, in Yangchun, Guangdong *Yongning, Guizhou, in Guanling Buyei and Miao Autonomous County, Guizhou *Yongning, Jiangxi, in Tonggu County, Jiangxi *Yongning, Liaoning, in Wafangdian, Liaoning *Yongning, Shaanxi, in Zhidan County, Shaanxi *Yongning, Cangxi County, in Cangxi County, Sichuan *Yongning, Wenjiang District, in Wenjiang District, Chengdu, Sichuan *Yongning, Xinjiang, in Yanqi Hui Autonomous County, Xinjiang ===Townships=== *Yongning Township, Chengdu, in Jianyang, Sichuan *Yongning Township, Wanyuan, in Wanyuan, Sichuan *Yongning Township, Honghe Prefecture, in Luxi County, Yunnan *Yongning Township, Ninglang County, in Ninglang Yi Autonomous County, Yunnan ==Historical eras== *Yongning (120–121), era name used by Emperor An of Han *Yongning (301–302), era name used by Emperor Hui of Jin *Yongning (350–351), era name used by Shi Zhi, emperor of Later Zhao ==See also== *Yongning Station, a station on the Tucheng Line of the Taipei Rapid Transit System in Taipei, Taiwan ","title":"Yongning"},{"id":"20421684","text":"The Musée de l'Œuvre Notre-Dame (or Frauenhausmuseum in German) is the city of Strasbourg's museum for Upper Rhenish fine arts and decorative arts, dating from the early Middle Ages until 1681. The museum is famous for its collection of original sculptures, glass windows, architectural fragments, as well as the building plans of Strasbourg Cathedral. It has a considerable collection of works by Peter Hemmel von Andlau, Niclas Gerhaert van Leyden, Nikolaus Hagenauer, Ivo Strigel, Konrad Witz, Hans Baldung and Sebastian Stoskopff. ==Purpose== The Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame was created in order to merge, under a single roof, four thematically-related but differently focussed, collections of all types of Upper Rhenish art created prior to 1681. It is located in the half-Gothic, half-Renaissance core building of the Fondation de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame, and in several early Baroque timber-framed houses which surround it. ==Origins== The first documentary evidence of the Strasbourg Fondation de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame, dates back to 1281, and it is still responsible for the maintenance of the cathedral. In addition to the building plans, which have been preserved from the very beginning, they also conserve architectural artifacts such as fragments of the choir screen, which was destroyed in 1681 and the originals of the sculptures which were removed or knocked down during the French Revolution and were later replaced by copies. The Société pour la conservation des monuments historiques d’Alsace (Society for the Conservation of the Historical Monuments of Alsace), endeavored to rescue the most valuable components and decorations (altars, statues, vessels, tapestries) from churches, cloisters and chapels which had been abandoned to destruction or decay throughout Alsace. The painting collection of the city, restored by Wilhelm von Bode around 1890, exhibited a primary focus on regional masters, as noted by the donation of the \\"Portrait of the canon Ambrosius Volmar Keller\\", a masterpiece of Hans Baldung from the private collection of Wilhelm II. ==Museum== Finally, in the new museum of decorative arts of the city, the \\"Hohenlohe Museum\\", works of decorative art from the Middle Ages, Renaissance and Early Baroque were also exhibited. These collections, which had been housed in various locations, were united in 1931 in the newly founded Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame. In 1956, after the repair of the damage caused by the bombing of Strasbourg during the war in 1944, the museum was re-opened, featuring its expanded collextion. In addition to the cathedral sculptures, glass windows, etc., the collection also features valuable artifacts salvaged from other Strasbourg churches, such as the Temple Neuf, which was destroyed in 1870, the Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Church, renovated in 1867, and the Église Sainte-Madeleine, destroyed by fire in 1904. The romanesque components (cloister, baptismal font) from St Trophimus' Church, Eschau and the stained glass windows from St. Peter and St. Paul's Church, Wissembourg and Mutzig are noteworthy. Included in the collection are many late gothic altars assigned to anonymous masters of the Schongauer School. ==Gallery== File:Christ de Wissembourg.JPGRomanesque stained glass window \\"Head of Christ\\" from Wissembourg (11th or 12th century) File:Grande verrière avec Calvaire, Saint-Pierre, Saint-Maurice et la Vierge à l'Enfant Ancienne église Saint-Maurice de Mutzig, Bas-Rhin Vers 1300-1310.jpgGothic stained glass window \\"Calvary\\" from Mutzig (early 14th century) File:Le Christ en croix ( MOND ).jpgGothic stained glass window \\"Christ on the Cross\\" from Strasbourg (early 15th century) File:Musee-de-l-Oeuvre-Notre-Dame-Strasbourg- IMG 1453.jpgA romanesque relief capital on display at the museum File:StrasbourgMuséeOeuvre NotreDameArtRoman (2).JPGRomanesque baptismal font by the Master of Eschau File:Circoncision-Chartreuse-Musée de l'Œuvre Notre- Dame (1).jpgGothic wooden relief \\"Circumcision of Christ\\", from Strasbourg (late 15th century) File:Musee-de-l-Oeuvre-Notre-Dame-Strasbourg-IMG 4015.jpgStatues from Notre-Dame de Strasbourg File:StrasbourgMuséeOeuvreNotreDameStatuesCathédrale (10).JPGStatues from Notre-Dame de Strasbourg File:Statues 'L'Église' et 'La Synagogue' de la Cathédrale de Strasbourg, original gothique conservé au Musée de l'Oeuvre Notre-Dame-2.jpgEcclesia and Synagoga from Notre-Dame de Strasbourg File:Nicolaus von Leyden, Self-portrait3.JPGSelf-portrait of Nikolaus Gerhaert File:Nicolas de Haguenau-Buste d'homme accoudé 2-Musée de l'Œuvre Notre-Dame (2).jpg\\"Leaning Man\\" by Nikolaus Hagenauer File:Strasbourg, Musée de l’Oeuvre Notre-Dame 07.JPGAltar by Ivo Strigel File:Strasbourg, Musée de l’Oeuvre Notre-Dame 11.JPG\\"Holy Monk\\" by Hans Wydyz File:Vierge_au_jardinet,_Maître_rhénan_anonyme,_Musée_de_l'Oeuvre_Notre- Dame.jpgAnonymous master: \\"Madonna in a Garden\\" File:Konrad Witz 007.jpgKonrad Witz: \\"Sts Catherine and Mary Magdalene\\" File:Baldung Vierge treille mba mb.jpgHans Baldung: \\"Madonna in the Vine Arbour\\" File:Lucas Cranach d.

Jeremiah Leavitt had been born at Grantham, New Hampshire, in 1797, and married Sarah Sturdevant of Grafton County, New Hampshire, on March 6, 1817 in Vermont. Shortly after their marriage, the couple departed for Hatley, only from the Canada–Vermont border, where farmer Jeremiah Leavitt was attracted by the rich soil and plentiful timber. At the time of his immigration to Canada, the area around Hatley was fresh from control of Iroquois Native American tribes. Leavitt cleared his new acreage, on which he built a log cabin, and began raising an eventual family of 10 children. In subsequent years, Jeremiah Leavitt and his wife Sarah joined the Latter-day Saints (Mormons) led by Joseph Smith. Thomas Rowell Leavitt was 16 months old when his parents pulled up stakes to follow Franklin Chamberlain, a Mormon convert who had married Lydia, the oldest child in the Leavitt family. The family returned to the United States, having been converted by Mormon missionaries who swept across eastern Canada on orders of Smith. The Leavitt family remained only briefly in New England, before launching themselves in 1835 towards Kirtland, Ohio, the gathering place of increasing crowds of Mormon converts. In September 1835, the extended Leavitt family came face-to- face with the man who had converted them long distance: Joseph Smith. No diary exists to describe what they made of their leader, but shortly afterwards the family departed with other recent converts to Smith's religion for Nauvoo, Illinois, the next jumping-off point on the Mormons' westward journey. Along the way, Jeremiah Leavitt's elderly mother, Sarah (Shannon) Leavitt, died of exposure. Having arrived in Nauvoo, the Leavitts bought a farm seven miles (11 km) outside town, where they began planting wheat. Anti-Mormon sentiment reached a crescendo shortly afterwards, and in 1844 rioters set upon Smith, killing the church prophet and his brother Hyrum, and setting fire to Mormon properties. On August 8, 1844, church elders voted to replace their fallen prophet with Brigham Young, who shortly afterwards announced his intention to found a Mormon sanctuary safe from persecution. Young's decision was prompted by Illinois's move to expel the settlers from its territory. In 1846, the Leavitt family set out as part of Young's trek, with father Jeremiah dying along the way. Ultimately the family got as far as Council Bluffs, Iowa, where what remained of the family built a house overlooking the Missouri River at Trade Point, where they remained three years. By 1850, the worn-out Leavitt family departed for Utah Territory, where they were told that a successful settlement had been made. ==Westward== The year 1850 was the highpoint of the California Gold Rush, as well as the Mormon migration westward. On June 1, 1850, a group of Latter-day Saints in 51 wagons, including the Leavitt family, crossed the Mississippi River behind Capt. Milo Andrus. Shortly afterwards, the company reached Salt Lake City. The Leavitt family subsequently moved to northern Utah, where Thomas Rowell Leavitt settled at Wellsville in Cache Valley, where he became constable,Tullidge's Histories, Vol. II, Containing the History of All the Northern, Eastern and Western Counties of Utah, Edward W. Tullidge, The Press of the Juvenile Instructor, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1889 marshal and ultimately sheriff, as well as a rancher, and where he built a large one-room log house on his farm outside Wellsville.Conquerors of the West: Stalwart Mormon Pioneers, Vol. II, Florence C. Youngberg, National Society, Sons of Utah Pioneers, Agreka Books, 1998 But by the 1880s, the United States government's toleration of the Mormon practice of polygamy came to an end. The government began cracking down, arresting polygamists. Some hid, others crossed the border into Mexico and Canada. Among the first to leave was Charles Ora Card, who traveled to modern-day Cardston, Alberta, named for the Mormon settler, to escape the crackdown and founding the first Mormon town in Alberta in 1887. ==Refuge in Canada== Jeremiah Leavitt had never been a polygamist, but his sons followed the subsequent dictum that church members should take multiple wives.Some Mormon historians have asserted that only three men were known to have brought more than one wife to Canada: John Lye Gibb, Thomas Rowell Leavitt and Franklin Dewey Leavitt. Thomas Rowell Leavitt had 26 children with his three wives. Shortly after Card's departure from Utah, former lawman Leavitt followed suit. In early spring 1887 Leavitt left Wellsville with other Mormon polygamists in a large wagon train—the last recorded in the Old West. After an arduous six-week, trek, Leavitt's party reached Lee Creek, Alberta, on May 25, 1887. Leavitt had traveled with his wife Harriet Martha Dowdle and several children by all three wives. He left wife Ann Eliza Jenkins behind on his Wellsville ranch.Once Upon a Wedding: Stories of Weddings in Western Canada, Nancy Millar, Bayeux Arts, 2000 By 1897, the rest of the family had followed, including Leavitt's son Alfred, who subsequently helped dig, with his brother, the irrigation canals that Charles Ora Card had promised the Canadian government in exchange for more land grants to fellow Mormons hard-pressed by the U.S. government crackdown. Leavitt lived out his days in the tiny hamlet he founded in Alberta, known as Buffalo Flats on his arrival, and subsequently christened Leavitt, Alberta, in honor of the pioneer fugitive. Leavitt died there in 1891, leaving a legacy of scores of disciples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints named Leavitt, many of whom remain in the region today, ranching and living in the bucolic area in the shadow of Chief Mountain. ==References * Sarah Sturdevant Leavitt, 1798-1878, History of Sarah Sturdevant Leavitt, Juanita L.

Alkaline Trio formed in 1996 with an initial lineup of Matt Skiba (guitar, lead vocals), Rob Doran (bass), and Glenn Porter (drums). This lineup released the band's demo tape and the 1997 single \\"Sundials\\" on Chicago record label Johann's Face Records, after which Doran left the band and was replaced by Dan Andriano. The group then signed to Asian Man Records and released their debut EP For Your Lungs Only and album Goddamnit in 1998. A second EP, I Lied My Face Off, followed in 1999 and resulted in their first music video, for the song \\"Goodbye Forever\\". In 2000 Asian Man released the band's second album, Maybe I'll Catch Fire, as well as the compilation album Alkaline Trio, collecting most of their previously released early material. Porter then left and was replaced by Mike Felumlee. The band next moved to Vagrant Records, releasing From Here to Infirmary in 2001. It was their first album to reach the Billboard charts, reaching #199 on the Billboard 200 and #9 amongst independent albums. Its two singles, \\"Stupid Kid\\" and \\"Private Eye\\", both charted on the UK Singles Chart. Felumlee then left and Derek Grant became the band's new permanent drummer. A split EP with Hot Water Music was released in 2002 through Jade Tree. The band's fourth album, Good Mourning, was released in 2003 on Vagrant, reaching #1 on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart and #20 on the Billboard 200. \\"We've Had Enough\\" and \\"All on Black\\" were released as singles from this album, the former becoming the band's first song to chart in the United States. A DVD titled Halloween at the Metro was released later that year as an installment of Kung Fu Films' The Show Must Go Off! series. In 2004 the band participated in the BYO Split Series by releasing a split album with One Man Army. Alkaline Trio's fifth album, Crimson, was released in 2005 through Vagrant. It did not fare as well on the charts as Good Mourning, though its three singles, \\"Time to Waste\\", \\"Mercy Me\\", and \\"Burn\\", became the band's highest-charting singles in the United Kingdom. In 2007 Vagrant released Remains, a compilation album of B-sides, compilation and EP tracks, and live material. Alkaline Trio then moved to major label Epic Records for 2008's Agony & Irony, which charted higher on the Billboard charts than any of their previous releases. It also spawned their highest-charting single in \\"Help Me\\", which reached #14 on Modern Rock Tracks. 2010's This Addiction was released through the band's newly formed label Heart & Skull, in partnership with Epitaph Records. It became the highest-charting album of their career, reaching #11 on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the Rock, Independent, and Alternative Albums charts. Damnesia, followed in 2011, consisting of \\"semi-unplugged\\" versions of songs from their past releases as well as three new tracks. The band's eighth studio album, My Shame Is True, was released on April 2, 2013. Alkaline Trio is releasing their ninth studio album, Is This Thing Cursed? , on August 31, 2018, through Epitaph and Heart & Skull.

Hitchcock also made several phonograph recordings, many of which survive. In 1907, Hitchcock was charged with the sexual abuse of two adolescent girls together with New York magnate William A. Chanler.\\"WARRANT ISSUED FOR W.R. HEARST: William Astor Chanler Accuses the Editor of Criminal Libel,\\" Oct 23, 1907; The New York Times, p. 7.

Prior to that, she served as the White House Director of Intergovernmental Affairs for three years. Before working for the White House, she was Senior Vice President for the Office of Research, Advocacy and Legislation at the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), the largest Latino advocacy organization in the United States. At NCLR, she supervised all legislative and advocacy activities conducted by NCLR policy staff. She was also the Chair of the Board of the Center for Community Change and served on the U.S. Programs Board of the Open Society Institute and on the boards of directors of the Atlantic Philanthropies and the National Immigration Forum. In 2000, she was named a MacArthur Fellow for her work on civil rights and immigration. She was featured in several episodes of the documentary series How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories, and she contributed a chapter to West Wingers: Stories from the Dream Chasers, Change Makers, and Hope Creators Inside the Obama White House discussing her experiences in the Obama White House. ==Early life and education== Muñoz was born in Detroit, Michigan the youngest of four children. Her parents had moved to the United States from La Paz, Bolivia, so that her father, an automotive engineer, could attend the University of Michigan. When she was three, the family moved to Livonia, Michigan, a middle-class, predominantly white Detroit suburb. Muñoz attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. As a volunteer, she worked as a tutor to Hispanic American inmates at the state prison in nearby Jackson, Michigan. She earned undergraduate degrees in English and Latin American studies in 1984. Following graduation, Muñoz continued her education at the University of California at Berkeley, where she earned a master's degree, also in Latin American Studies. ==Career== As Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, Muñoz was the Obama Administration's main liaison with state, local and tribal governments, including the Big Seven organizations that represent most state and local officials, including the Council of State Governments, the National Governors Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures. She co-chaired the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico's Political Status, where her work made several politicians from both sides celebrate her designation as head of the Domestic Policy Council. She was featured in the documentary film Last Best Chance, story twelve of the series How Democracy Works Now, from filmmakers Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini. A cut of the film premiered on HBO in March 2010, under the title The Senator's Bargain. Muñoz appeared in Mountains and Clouds, story two in the series How Democracy Works Now, where she and Frank Sharry discuss being at a potential \\"watershed moment\\" for comprehensive immigration reform, in 2001. Additionally, she was featured in Ain't the AFL for Nothin', story seven in the series where she is shown working on a proposal for immigration, in 2003. In 2020, Muñoz authored More than Ready, an autobiography about her life and tenure in the White House. Muñoz works at the New America, a left-leaning public policy think-tank based in Washington, D.C. ==Personal life== Muñoz is married to Amit Pandya, a human rights lawyer.

The gallery is housed in the town's former Carnegie library building, which was built in 1909 (extended in 2003). The gallery is located at 14 Hokonui Drive, the northern end of Gore's main street, close to the town clocktower and public library. Though principally a provincial gallery, the Eastern Southland Gallery is important due to two of its major permanent exhibits, the Ralph Hotere Gallery and the John Money Collection. The gallery also hosts regular shows in two separate wings. ==Ralph Hotere Gallery== The Ralph Hotere Gallery contains a significant number of works by arguably New Zealand's most prominent contemporary artist, Ralph Hotere. This series of works was created in collaboration with poet Hone Tuwhare, and comprises one of the largest and most important collections of work by both Hotere and Tuwhare. ==John Money Collection== The John Money Collection is a substantial collection of artworks, most of which are either ethnological artefacts or modern art drawing on tribal art for its inspiration (including several notable works by Theo Schoon). It has been housed in a specially-built extension to the gallery since December 2003. The collection was the passion of noted sexologist John Money, who donated much of his collection to the gallery in 2002, and was built up over several decades from the 1940s on. Money had become friends with Schoon in Christchurch in the 1940s, and also with many other members of New Zealand's art elite, including Rita Angus and Douglas Lilburn. Schoon's interest in Maori art led to an awakening in similar interests in Money, and from 1947 (when Money moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) he became a patron of Schoon and Angus and also an avid collector of tribal art, including works from Australia, Africa, and the Americas. The Collection as presented in the Eastern Southland Gallery is dominated by a series of large sculptural figures from West Africa, alongside which sit modern art from the United States and New Zealand and Aboriginal art from Australia. ==References *Gorenz.com ESG page *Review of the John Money Collection Category:Museums in Southland, New Zealand Category:Art museums and galleries in New Zealand Category:Gore, New Zealand Category:1910s architecture in New Zealand Gore ","title":"Eastern Southland Gallery"},{"id":"20422684","text":"The 1983 Philadelphia Eagles season was their 51st in the National Football League (NFL).

The Baháʼís of Chad elected their first National Spiritual Assembly in 1971. Through succeeding decades Baháʼís have been active in a number of ways and by some counts have become the third largest international religion in Chad with over 80,300 members by 2000 and 96,800 in 2005. ==Early phase== Before independence the region of Chad was part of the French Equatorial Africa (as well as modern day Congo, Central Africa, and Gabon.) The first pioneers in the region were Max Kinyerezi who settled in what was then French Equatorial Africa (specifically in the area later part of Republic of the Congo), and Samson Mungono in the Belgian Congo (some other parts of which later became part of Chad); both arrived in 1953 from expansion of the Baháʼí Faith in Uganda in the same trip that delivered Enoch Olinga to British Cameroon. The Baháʼís organized these and neighboring areas into the regional National Spiritual Assembly of central and eastern Africa in 1956 - including Uganda, Tanganyika, Kenya, Belgian Congo, Ruanda-Urundi, French Equatorial Africa, Zanzibar, Comoro Is, Seychelles and Chagos Archipelago. However once Chad was politically independent none of the territory specific to Chad had a Baha'i in it until 1961. The first Baháʼí in Chad was Cleophas K. Vava in what was then called Fort Lamy, the capital. About November 1962 the national spiritual assembly of Central and West Africa was claiming over 14,000 people almost all of whom were not in Chad. The situation changed little when the regional assembly associations were changed in 1963 to align Chad with Uganda and other central African countries. Early pioneers were Dempsey and Adrienne Morgan arrived in December 1967. The first native Chadian Baháʼí, Ernest Nbouba, converted early in 1968. By Ridván 1968 there were 7 Chadian Baháʼís and two pioneers so a local assembly was elected. By 1969 the community had jumped to almost 1200 Baháʼís and thirteen assemblies among 63 localities Baháʼís were to be found in. There are anecdotes of a student returning home from Cameroon where he had heard of the religion and converted in Chad at the beginning of summer 1970. When he moved to Bongor in October to continue his studies he successfully spread his new religion among his fellow students and the growth extended into the city to become an area of six assemblies and over 125 Baháʼís by April 1971. ==Growth== Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected Universal House of Justice was head of the religion and began to re- organized the Baháʼí communities of Africa by splitting off regional national communities to form their own National Assemblies from 1967 though the 1990s. The Baháʼí community was much stimulated by the arrival of the first Hand of the Cause to visit Chad, Rúhíyyih Khanum who had been crossing Africa from east to west visiting many country's communities including Chad. She arrived by way of Bangui in February 1970, on the tenth anniversary of Chad's independence, to Fort Lamy and visited there and in the villages of Gassi and Djari. During the two weeks visit she met with mostly individuals and institutions of the religion. In Gassi she helped dedicate the Baháʼí center being built. From Chad Khanum traveled into Cameroon. Two developments following her trip were the participation of Chad Baháʼís in the first regional national convention of central Africa held in Bangui (Uganda splitting off its own national assembly in 1970) and second, the Baháʼís of Chad attempted to be registered with the federal government but it turned out the government had no procedure to register a new religion organizing in the country. Chad delegates to the regional convention arrived in time for pre- convention classes and saw Hand of the Cause Abu'l-Qásim Faizi who represented the Universal House of Justice. Consultation at the convention noted the fast growth of the religion in Chad and Faizi appointed Adrienne Morgan as an Auxiliary Board Member. Back in Chad and the pursuit of official recognition from the government, Dr. Aziz Navidi, a lawyer and pioneer, representing the Universal House of Justice, assisted by sharing information about the worldwide character of the religion to the authorities while appeals were processed by the community and government which was finally brought to the attention of then President, François Tombalbaye. Following this success in February the community gather in convention for the election of its first National Spiritual Assembly in April 1971 which was attended by Enoch Olinga who was himself then appointed as a Hand of the Cause. The convention was held in Gassi outside of Fort Lamy in part because a village chief had joined the religion and provided a large meeting space for the convention. An anecdote told by Olinga at the convention captured the need for the fast-growing community's need to study their new religion and understand it personally. He compared the need for daily prayer with the need for daily food. We don't wait for someone else to eat for us, nor should be wait for someone else to pray for us. The community of the religion in Fort Lamy was then counted at over one thousand while the community across Chad was characterized as being ninety-six local spiritual assemblies among the 300 localities with Baháʼís who had swollen to more than 8000. The second national convention held two days of classes for the delegates to understand the process and purpose of convention, of the national assembly, and their role as delegates and those of officers of the convention (which they too elect.) The Baháʼís of Gassi had already formed a children's Baháʼí school while land for nine Baháʼí centers was donated at the convention and the consultation of the delegates focused on the need to French-speaking pioneers who understood the religion especially in outlying areas. In December 1971 bus loads and cars of youth came from Chad and the Central African Republic to Cameroon who hosted the first regional African youth conference. Map of Chad In 1972 (and again in 1974) the Baháʼís of Chad celebrated the first United Nations Day of Chad. The public meeting held at the national Baháʼí center with the cooperation of United Nations Development Program Resident Representative featured an assistant of the UN Representative who spoke and offered literature while a Baháʼí spoke of the Baháʼí teachings - the event was covered by print and radio media in Chad and 50 people attended the meeting. The third national convention was held in Sarh in southern Chad where the mayor had donate use of the city's municipal center. In 1974 prayers were published translated into Massa, Ngambay and Kanuri languages. In October 1976 the Baháʼís held a national conference on the progress of the religion as part of a wave of such conferences across the world. Following the conference waves of traveling Baháʼís, some from Iran, brought the religion to villages as well as offering institutes to promote understanding of the religion and classes for children. In January 1977 the Baháʼís in Sahr held a conference for women at which only 12 of the 40 participants were Baháʼís following which a wave of conversions included half women. Other conferences continued through summer 1977. The community of Chad avoided being banned as part of a sweep across several Sub-Saharan countries. Chad was one of the countries Baháʼí organized a series of events in honor of the International Year of the Child, 1979. A Baháʼí consultant traveled western Africa including Chad assisting communities in their efforts. Though the consultant took ill in Chad, the program developed was the most successful in the region. A children's committee organized institutes for 125 villages and themselves conducted the meetings and produced a set of lesson plans in both French and English that was distributed to other West African communities. In 1981 the national convention was held in Moïssala In 1982 sixty of the local assemblies of Chad were designated as leaders in their regions to help nearby communities organize their religious meetings while at the same time a regional permanent institute was finished in Manda. In 1983 crowd surpassing the seats allotted turns out for a film describing Baháʼí pilgrimage in Moïssala. ===Activities of a growing community=== Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Baháʼís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Baháʼí teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Baháʼí socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. There is evidence of activities of the Baháʼí community through from the '80s through 2008 and some by invitation with third parties. Baháʼí youth have mobilized for a number of purposes over the years. Baháʼís have also been cooperative agents with various agencies and the Baháʼís started a non-governmental organization devoted to solving local ecological and developmental challenges. See details below. The overall process of advancing development projects gained the a diploma of Participation from the Trade Chamber at the fourth International Fair of Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (later renamed the Economic Community of Central African States). *Since the United Nations established the International Youth Year (IYY) in 1979 and in successive years plans have evolved for promoting the constructive action of youth. In 1985 Baháʼí youth in Chad mobilized to alleviate the suffering of thousands afflicted by famine by visiting the sick and elderly, preparing food and collected and distributed clothing. A regional youth conference was organized in Sarh with attendance of 200 youth from surrounding localities and planted three hectares of trees in Makiling in support of IYY. To encourage all youth clubs in Chad and their sponsoring local assemblies to undertake activities for IYY, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís of Chad printed and distributed in large quantities of the official Youth Year emblem for all local communities. And Bahá´ís have continued to host United Nations Day as well as adding World Religion Day observances. *In conjunction with the Chadian Ministry of Education, the Baháʼí community sponsored a program with a guest speaker for the International Literacy Year (see International Literacy Day) which was televised on 24 October 1989. After that the Baháʼí Faith was mentioned on local television in Mongo in 1996. *Begun in Bongor and then moved to Sarh, the APRODEPIT, an acronym for Action pour la Promotion des Ressources des Organisations de Défense de l'Environnement et de la Pisciculture integrée au Tchad (Action for the Promotion of Resources for Organizations Defending the Environment and Integrated Pisciculture in Chad) is a Baháʼí-inspired non-governmental organization, stressing participation and consultation in an effort to promote conservation and community development along the Chari River since 1992. *The US Embassy in Chad reported in 2008 that it had hosted an iftar dinner inviting representatives of the Muslim, Christian, and Baháʼí communities. ==Modern community== Long term pioneers are in Chad - some of many years stay and others of a short stay. There are Ruhi Institute Study Circles. There are weekly prayer meetings in French held on Saturday afternoons at the Baháʼí Center in N'Djamena. The religion continues to grow through the 1980s establishing schools, libraries, a pharmacy and exhibits on Baháʼí marriage in the name of the religion. Sometimes more people came than could take classes while some of these institutions became self-sustaining. ===Demographics=== The World Christian Encyclopedia estimates the Baháʼí population in 2000 to be over 80300, 96845 in 2005 and is the third largest internationally organized religion after Islam and Christianity in the country. ==See also== *Religion in Chad *History of Chad ==References *Chad Baháʼí National Community *Sarandi Tchakreo - a profile from Chad Category:Religion in Chad Chad Chad ","title":"Baháʼí Faith in Chad"},{"id":"20422700","text":"Helan County () is a county of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China, it is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Yinchuan, the capital of Ningxia, and borders Inner Mongolia to the northwest.

Photograph of Konrad Maurer Bust of Konrad Maurer by the sculptor Joseph Echteler (1888), today in the National and University Library of Iceland Konrad Maurer's grave in Munich Konrad Maurer, since 1876 Konrad von Maurer (April 29, 1823 – September 16, 1902) was a German legal historian. He was the son of legal historian and statesman Georg Ludwig von Maurer (1790–1872). Maurer is considered one of the most significant researchers of Nordic legal and constitutional history. == Biography == Konrad Heinrich Maurer was born in 1823 in Frankenthal (Palatinate), as the only son of Georg Ludwig von Maurer und Friederike Maurer née Heydweiller. In 1826 the family moved to Munich (Bavaria), where his father was appointed professor of German legal history. Here, Konrad Maurer's mother died when he was seven. His father never remarried. Konrad Maurer spent two years of his childhood in Greece where his father was appointed a member of the council of regency of king Otto of Greece. Afterwards the family returned to Munich. Bowing to his father's wish, Konrad Maurer studied law at the Universities of Munich, Leipzig and Berlin, earning his doctorate in 1845. In 1847 he became an associate professor, and in 1855 a full professor of legal history at the University of Munich. Maurer was a leading authority of Germanic/Nordic legal and constitutional history. He had a special interest in Icelandic literature, history, language and culture and was an outspoken advocate for Icelandic political independence from Danish rule, supporting Jón Sigurðsson in his cause. In 1858, Maurer undertook a personal travel to Iceland. Inspired by his contacts to Jacob Grimm (from the Brothers Grimm), he used the opportunity to collect Icelandic folk tales and published them after his return under the title Isländische Volkssagen der Gegenwart. This was the first detailed publication of Icelandic folk tales in German. Maurer read lectures in Munich, Oslo, and Kopenhagen. In 1865, he was appointed a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and in 1876 he was awarded (nonhereditary) knighthood of the Merit Order of the Bavarian Crown. By this he was officially given the title \\"(Ritter) von Maurer\\"; however he did not like the title and always preferred to be called just Maurer. In the same year, Maurer was offered his own chair at the University of Christiania, which he declined. Throughout his life Maurer was a close friend to the Icelandic scholar Guðbrandur Vigfússon, the Norwegian folklorist Peter Christen Asbjørnsen, playwright Henrik Ibsen and writer Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. He retired in 1888 and died 1902 in Munich, where he was buried in Alter Südfriedhof. His considerable library, which he had inherited from his father and expanded to over 9000 volumes, was sold in 1904, for the major part to Harvard University and the rest to the bar association of New York. A part of it is today in the libraries of Yale Law School and George Washington University Law School. Maurer had eight children. His eldest son Ludwig Maurer became a mathematician. == Awards == * 1865 member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities * 1876 knight of the Merit Order of the Bavarian Crown * 1876 honorary doctor of University of Christiania * 1882 honorary doctor of University of Edinburgh * 1882 honorary doctor of University of Würzburg * Knight 1st Class of the Order of St. Michael * Knight of the Bayerischer Maximiliansorden für Wissenschaft und Kunst * Honorary Cross of the Ludwigsorden (Bavaria) * Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav (Norway) * Commander First Class of the Order of the Polar Star (Sweden) * Commander First Class of the Order of the Dannebrog (Denmark) == Selected publications == * Ueber das Wesen des ältesten Adels der deutschen Stämme in seinem Verhältniß zur gemeinen Freiheit, 1846. * Die Bekehrung des Norwegischen Stammes zum Christenthume, in ihrem geschichtlichen Verlaufe quellenmäßig geschildert, 1855/56. * Die Gull-Þóris Saga oder Þorskfirðínga Saga, 1858. * Isländische Volkssagen der Gegenwart.

Feinstein (December 4, 1925 – October 25, 2001) was a clinician, a researcher and an epidemiologist who made significant impact on clinical investigation, especially on the field of clinical epidemiology that he helped define. He is regarded as one of the fathers of modern clinical epidemiology. He died at the age of 75 in Toronto on 25 October 2001 and is survived by his wife and two children.O'Connor A. Dr. Alvan Feinstein, 75, Innovator in Diagnoses, Dies. October 29, 2001 New York Times. Born in Philadelphia, Feinstein received his bachelor's degree (BSc 1947) and master's degree (MSc, 1948) at the University of Chicago. Feinstein received his medical degree (MD, 1952) at the University of Chicago School of Medicine. He completed his residency training in Internal Medicine at Rockefeller Institute. He was Board Certified in Internal Medicine in 1955 and became the medical director of Irvington House Institute (which later became part of New York University Langone Medical Center). While there, he studied patients with rheumatic fever and challenged the belief that proper treatment after an early diagnosis kept those patients from developing severe heart disease later in life. He demonstrated that the disease had different forms including one which causes joint pain and seldom progresses to heart disease. The other, which does result in heart disease, has no symptoms to evoke early detection. Thus, diagnosis of the disease at an early stage leads to a favorable outcome not because of early treatment but because those patients tend to have a less- virulent form. In 1962, Feinstein joined the Yale University School of Medicine faculty and became the founding director of its Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program in 1974. Under his direction, the program became recognized as one of the leading centers for training in clinical research methods. He was widely known for his incredible gifts for mentoring bringing a passion to academic medicine and the art of becoming an academic. He published his first paper as a medical student in 1951 and more than 400 throughout his career. He wrote six major textbooks, two of which, Clinical Judgment (1967) and Clinical Epidemiology (1985) are among the most widely referenced books in clinical epidemiology. He completed the last one, Principles of medical statistics (2002), just before his death. At the time of his death he was the Sterling Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology, the Yale School of Medicine's most prestigious academic position.http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2001/10/31/alvan-feinstein-dies-at- age-75/ His editorial work included that of the Journal of Chronic Diseases (1982–1988) and he founded and was editor of the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology (1988–2001). ==Awards== During his career, Feinstein garnered numerous recognitions and awards; including the Francis Gilman Blake Award as outstanding teacher to Yale medical students (1969), Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Foundation Award from the American College of Physicians (1982), Robert J. Glaser Annual Award from the Society for General Internal Medicine (1987), J. Allyn Taylor International Prize in Medicine (1987), Gairdner Foundation International Award (1993), and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from McGill University (1997). In 1991, Feinstein was named the Sterling Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology, Yale University's most prestigious academic honor. ==Relationship with the tobacco industry== In his later years, controversy marred his career with claims that he may have helped the tobacco industry by publishing articles minimizing the deleterious effects of smoking. A review of Feinstein's publications in 2002 concluded that \\"perhaps in hindsight Feinstein could be criticized for not having clearly indicated the sponsorship of the tobacco industry behind these publications, of which he was fully aware. However, this does not suffice to infer that he was the tobacco industry's man. Feinstein's attitude in matters of publication appears balanced\\". However, this review, an invited article written soon after Feinstein's death and published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, may not be unbiased. For the fourteen years preceding his death, Feinstein was Editor in Chief of this journal, which was the publication outlet for numerous articles and opinion pieces by Feinstein and his colleagues that aimed to debunk the research on tobacco, for which role the journal was subsequently criticized. ==References== Category:Canadian public health doctors Category:Health informaticians Category:2001 deaths Category:1925 births Category:Pritzker School of Medicine alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni ","title":"Alvan Feinstein"},{"id":"20422936","text":"The 1983 St. Louis Cardinals season was the 64th season the team was in the National Football League.

He was of Russian- Jewish origin.Res Musica He was trained as a violinist at the National Conservatory of Music in Paris, winning a first prize in 1926,The Golden Age of Light Music but moved to conducting in 1931 after support from Reynaldo Hahn. He conducted the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra and worked for French Radiodiffusion, then for the Ballets Russes and Roland Petit’s ballet. From the mid-1920s he was musical director of Gaumont Newsreel, for which he composed a great deal of varied background music to suit all kinds of documentary moods and themes.

Diener (born 1946) is an American psychologist, professor, and author. Diener is a professor of psychology at the University of Utah and the University of Virginia, and Joseph R. Smiley Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Illinois, as well as a senior scientist for the Gallup Organization. He is noted for his research over the past thirty years on happiness, including work on temperament and personality influences on well- being, theories of well-being, income and well-being, cultural influences on well-being, and the measurement of well-being. As shown on Google Scholar as of March 2020, Diener's publications have been cited over 220,000 times. For his fundamental research on the subject, Diener is nicknamed Dr. Happiness. Researchers he has worked with include Daniel Kahneman and Martin Seligman. == Background == Diener was born in 1946 in Glendale, California and grew up on a farm in the San Joaquin Valley of California. He attended San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fresno and subsequently received his BA in Psychology in 1968 from California State University at Fresno. He received his doctorate at the University of Washington in 1974 and was a faculty member at the University of Illinois for 34 years, retiring from active teaching in 2008. He held the Smiley chair as the Joseph R. Smiley Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of Illinois. In 2010 he received honorary doctorates from the Free University of Berlin and Eureka College. He has won the distinguished scientist award from the International Society of Quality of Life Studies, as well as the Jack Block award for outstanding contributions to personality psychology. In 2015 he resumed teaching, beginning as a professor of psychology at both the University of Virginia and at the University of Utah. Diener's wife Carol is a forensic psychologist (both a clinical psychologist and attorney), his daughters Marissa and Mary Beth are psychologists, as is his son, Robert. ==Happiness research== Diener, also known as Dr. Happiness, is one of the lead researchers in the field of subjective well-being. Subjective well-being (SWB), as Diener et al. define it, is how people evaluate their lives – both at the moment and for longer periods such as for the past year. These evaluations include people's emotional reactions to events, their moods, and judgments they form about their life satisfaction, fulfilment, and satisfaction with domains such as marriage and work. In 2002, Diener conducted a study at the University of Illinois with Martin Seligman, finding that \\"the most salient characteristics shared by the 10% of students with the highest levels of happiness and the fewest signs of depression were their strong ties to friends and family and commitment to spending time with them.\\" Diener has said \\"It is important to work on social skills, close interpersonal ties and social support in order to be happy.\\" ===Temperament and personality influences on SWB=== Diener has found that the correlations between SWB and extraversion and neuroticism are stronger than the correlations with any demographic predictor or major life circumstance that has thus been studied. One aspect of individual differences in well-being that his research on personality and SWB has been focused on is emotional reactivity/ reward theory. Diener discovered that there are reasons for greater SWB among extraverts beyond the fact that they spend more time with others, a hypothesis popularized by other researchers. He found that the more active reward system in extraverts is a greater influence than the social or nonsocial aspect of a situation. This is evident in his research that shows that the pleasantness of a situation is a more important factor than the social or nonsocial aspect in determining extraverts' enjoyment. His longitudinal studies also reveal that extraverts are happier whether living solitarily or with others, working in social or nonsocial job environments, and living in large cities or rural areas. ===Objective benefits of SWB=== Diener proposes that happiness has benefits beyond \\"feeling good\\". In a paper published in 2011, Diener and Chan reviewed eight types of evidences that support a causal relationship from SWB to health and longevity. After examining results from longitudinal studies, meta-analysis, animal experiments, human experiments and natural quasi-experiments, Diener and Chan concluded that the evidences overwhelmingly support the argument that high SWB causes better health and longevity (Diener & Chan, 2011). Diener also summarized the pathways, through which happiness affects health and longevity. Among which are SWB's influence on physiological processes underlying health and disease, on practice of good health behaviors, and on fulfilling social relationships. Meanwhile, Diener and his colleagues showed that higher SWB leads to higher income, better job performance, more creativity and productivity. They also illustrated that happiness brings about greater self- control, more pro-social behaviors and higher-quality social relationships (DeNeve, Diener, Tay, & Xuereb, 2013). DeNeve, J-E., Diener, E., Tay, L., & Xuereb, C. (2013). The objective benefits of subjective well-being. In J. F. Helliwell, R. Layard, & J. Sachs (Eds.), World happiness report 2013. Volume 2. (pp. 54–79). New York: UN Sustainable Network Development Solutions Network. In short, happiness is functional. ===Optimum level of SWB=== Despite the advantages of happiness for functioning, one line of Diener's research concerns with the question “can people be too happy”. Using large survey data and longitudinal data, Diener and his colleagues showed that too much happiness could be detrimental to one's income, education and political participation (Oishi, Diener,& Lucas, 2007). The most successful people in terms of these three variables are those who experience moderate to high levels of happiness, but not extremely high happiness. However, the very happiest people are most successful in terms of close relationships and volunteer work. ===Limits to adaptation of well-being and set point change=== The traditional adaption theory of Well-Being suggests that people have a pre- determined set point for happiness (Brickman & Campbell, 1971).Brickman, P., & Campbell, D. T. (1971). Hedonic relativism and planning the good society. In M. H. Appley (Ed.), Adaptation level theory: A symposium (pp. 287–302). New York: Academic Press. Any life event, positive or negative, can only have transitory influences on SWB. Diener's research challenged the theory by showing that people do not adapt completely to all events. Some powerful events or circumstances can change people's emotional set points (Diener, Lucas, & Scollon, 2006). In particular, people who lose their spouses or jobs cannot fully recover many years after the events (Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, & Diener, 2004). The discovery has profound implications. First, it explains the enormous differences of SWB between nations across the globe (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013). Second, it sheds light on the possibility for interventions, both at the individual-level and the societal level, to produce lasting boosts in happiness. Diener and his colleagues also discovered individual differences in adaptation. For instance, some people adapt quickly to the joy of marriage, while others experience a long-lasting effect on their SWB. ===Income and SWB=== Using longitudinal data from over 100 countries, Diener and his colleagues showed that rich countries are in general happier than poor countries (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013). Also, life satisfaction for most countries goes up as they become wealthier over time. Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people's evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).Diener, E., Kahneman, D., Tov, W., & Arora, R. (2010). Income’s association with judgments of life versus feelings. In E. Diener, J. Helliwell, & D. Kahneman (Eds.), International differences in well-being. New York: Oxford University Press. The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity. ===Culture influences on SWB=== In recent years, Diener has conducted major studies looking at the role of culture in explaining the international differences of SWB. One important finding is that predictors of SWB may differ across cultures (Tov & Diener, 2007).Tov, W., & Diener, E.. (2007). Culture and subjective well-being. In S. Kitayama & D. Cohen (Eds.), Handbook of cultural psychology. (691–713). New York: Guilford. For example, the association between self-esteem and life satisfaction is much stronger in individualist culture than in collectivistic culture (Diener & Diener, 1995; Oishi, Diener, Lucas, & Suh, 1999). Diener and his colleagues also discovered a cultural congruence effect such that people are happier if their characteristics match the cultural norms (Fulmer et al., 2010). For instance, religious people are much happier than nonreligious people in very religious nations or regions, but such a difference disappears in nonreligious nations or regions (Diener, Tay, & Myers, 2011). Finally, Diener investigated the differences of SWB among affluent countries. He compared the SWB scores of Denmark and the United States and discovered the “Danish Effect”: people in Denmark are in general happier than those in the USA despite of similar income because the poorest citizens in Denmark are more satisfied with their lives than the poorest ones in the US (Biswas-Diener, Vitterso, & Diener, 2010). ===Measurement of SWB=== Together with his colleagues, Diener has developed three scales that help scientists to assess Well-Being. The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) measures global cognitive judgments of satisfaction with one's life (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985). The original article has been cited for over 7,400 times and the SWLS has become the most widely used scale for evaluating life satisfaction. The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE) assess one's frequency of experiencing a variety of positive and negative emotions. The Flourishing Scale (FS) measures one's self-perceived success in important areas of life, such as relationship, self- esteem, and optimism (Diener et al., 2009). ==Accomplishments== In 2012, Diener was awarded the Distinguished Scientist Lifetime Career Award by the American Psychological Association. In 2013, Diener became the recipient of the William James Lifetime Achievement Award by the Association for Psychological Science. Diener founded a new journal, Perspectives on Psychological Science, which has become one of the most acclaimed and widely read journals in the field. He is also one of the founding editors of the Journal of Happiness Studies. Diener has over 110,179 citations in Google Scholar (September 26, 2015). Diener has published 340 books and articles. He has several Psychological Bulletin articles, several American Psychologist papers, 12 publications in Psychological Science, and over 57 publications in JPSP. He has authored three books and edited seven more. Working with the Gallup survey organization, Diener conducted the first poll of the world ever conducted, including 155 nations and representing 99 percent of the population of the globe. More than any other scientist, Diener has studied the poorest people in the world, including groups such as the homeless and those living in slums such as in Calcutta. In this research he has discovered how some individuals can achieve positive well-being in dire circumstances, for example through their relationships and spirituality. In recognition of his scientific contributions, Ed Diener holds an endowed chair at his university, the Joseph R. Smiley Distinguished Professorship of Psychology. He has received the Distinguished Scientist Award from both the American Psychological Association and the International Society of Quality of Life Studies, and the outstanding personality psychologist award (the “Jack Block Award”) from Division 8 of APA, the Society of Personality and Social Psychology. Diener has several honorary doctorates to his name, is a fellow of five scientific societies, and he has been the focus of many popular media articles, from Newsweek to the Wall Street Journal to Reader's Digest. In March 2017, the Emir of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum named Diener the inaugural chair the Council of Personal Happiness, a subcommittee of the World Happiness Council. ==National accounts of SWB== Diener proposed that nations collect data on the subjective and psychological well-being of citizens to help in policy discussions. In 2004 Diener authored with Martin Seligman an influential article, Beyond Money: Toward an Economy of Well-being, arguing that the well- being indicators would supplement economic, educational, and other national measures to provide policy makers and leaders with important information. The idea is that because subjective well-being is affected by many aspects of quality of life in societies, the subjective well-being measures could be used to examine who and in what regions of nations people were flourishing versus suffering. The finding that subjective well-being is beneficial to outcomes such as health, longevity, social relationships, and work productivity, added force to the proposal. The idea of national accounts of well-being has met with some success. The United Kingdom adopted well-being measures based on a directive from David Cameron, the Prime Minister. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development issued guidelines in 2013 for national accounts of subjective well-being, and a number of nations are now collecting such data. ==The Enhance intervention to raise well-being== The Dieners and their colleagues have developed a program to raise well-being, a 10-week psychosocial skills course called Enhance. The program includes several types of skills, for example, positive sociability, values and strengths understanding, sleep and exercise, and coping with stress and difficult events. Randomized controlled trial studies using college students, adult volunteers, and seniors, have shown that Enhance raises well-being – for example, life satisfaction, self-esteem, feelings of meaning and purposes, and lower chronic feelings of ill-being. It also has been found to decrease sick days, raise physical activity levels, and enhance cognitive functioning. The program can be delivered in several ways: by website, by app, or written in a paper-and-pencil format. The program is easy to deliver, relatively inexpensive, requires only short training for leaders to deliver it, and includes diverse psychosocial skills such as Mindfulness, positive social interactions, and getting adequate restful sleep. Enhance can be used either by individuals or in groups (e.g., in clubs, dormitories, business units, and so forth). ==Philanthropy== In 2013, Diener and his wife Carol (also a psychologist) launched the Noba Project. Supported by their Diener Education Fund, the project aimed to reduce financial costs to psychology students by providing freely available online textbook alternatives. The Dieners recruited their friends and colleagues (such as Elizabeth Loftus, Ap Dijksterhuis, and Roy Baumeister) to write chapters on their areas of expertise, and the project compiled these into a set of multimedia textbooks that are freely available and customizable by instructors. Eventually, the project began offering print versions of both curated and customized textbooks. ==Partial bibliography== *Happiness: Unlocking the Mysteries of Psychological Wealth, with his son, Robert Biswas-Diener. *Well-being and Public Policy (2009) with John Helliwell, Richard Lucas, Ulrich Schimmack *International Differences in Well- Being (2010) with Daniel Kahneman and John Helliwell. ==See also== * Positive psychology ==References * Ed Diener, Positive Psychology, University of Illinois site. * on Psychological Science * Ed Diener's Publications * , International Positive Psychology Association (IPPA) * , Ed Diener's \\"One Happy Autobiography\\" Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:American psychologists Category:Positive psychologists Category:20th- century psychologists Category:21st-century psychologists Category:University of Utah faculty Category:University of Virginia faculty Category:University of Illinois faculty Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ","title":"Ed Diener"},{"id":"20423182","text":"Denis Bernard (born December 6, 1957) is a Genie Award-winning Canadian film, television and theater actor and producer. ==Biography== Born in Lac-Etchemin, Quebec, Bernard graduated from the Conservatoire d'art dramatique de Québec in 1980.

It was settled in August 1622 by between fifty and sixty colonists who were ill-prepared for colonial life. The colony was settled without adequate provisions, and was dissolved in late March 1623 after harming relations with local Indians. Surviving colonists joined Plymouth Colony or returned to England. It was the second settlement in Massachusetts, predating the Massachusetts Bay Colony by six years.Chartier, Craig S. (March 2011), An Investigation into Weston's Colony at Wessagussett, Weymouth, Massachusetts, Plymouth Archaeological Rediscovery Project (PARP), http://www.plymoutharch.com Historian Charles Francis Adams Jr. referred to the colony as \\"ill-conceived, ill-executed, ill-fated\\". It is best remembered for the battle there between Plymouth troops led by Myles Standish and an Indian force led by Pecksuot. This battle scarred relations between the Plymouth colonists and the Indians and was fictionalized two centuries later in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1858 poem The Courtship of Miles Standish. In September 1623, a second colony was created on the abandoned site at Wessagusset, led by Governor-General Robert Gorges. This colony was rechristened as Weymouth and was also unsuccessful, and Governor Gorges returned to England the following year. Despite that, some settlers remained in the village and it was absorbed into the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. ==Origin== The colony was coordinated by Thomas Weston, a London merchant and ironmonger. He was associated with the Plymouth Council for New England which had funded the short-lived Popham Colony in Maine 15 years earlier. During the period when the Pilgrims were in the Netherlands, Weston helped to arrange their passage to the New World with help from the Merchant Adventurers. Historian Charles Francis Adams, Jr. glowingly called him a \\"sixteenth century adventurer\\" in the mold of John Smith and Walter Raleigh, adding that his \\"brain teemed with schemes for deriving sudden gain from the settlement of the new continent\\". In later years, Plymouth Governor William Bradford called him \\"a bitter enemy unto Plymouth upon all occasions\\". Turning a profit was the primary purpose of Weston's new colony, rather than the religious reasons of the Pilgrims who established Plymouth, and this dictated how the colony would be assembled. Weston believed that families were a detriment to a well-run plantation, so he selected able-bodied men only—but not men experienced in colonial life. In total, there were several advance scouts and 50 or 60 other colonists.. Quoting with annotations from Edward Winslow's Good News from New England The final complement also included one surgeon and one lawyer. The party was outfitted with enough supplies to last the winter. ==First Wessagusset colony== An advance team of 60 settlers arrived at the Plymouth Colony in May 1622. They had voyaged to the New World on board the Sparrow, an English fishing vessel which was sailing to the coast of Maine. The team traveled the final down the New England coast in a shallop with three members of the Sparrow's crew. These colonists stayed only briefly in Plymouth before scouting the coast in their shallop to find a site for their colony. After finding one, they negotiated for the land with Chief Aberdecest and returned to Plymouth, sending the shallop back to the Sparrow and awaiting the remainder of the colonists. Flag of Weymouth depicting its founding in 1622 as Wessagusset The main body of colonists set off from London in April 1622 aboard the Charity and the Swan. Richard Greene, Thomas Weston's brother-in- law, was the initial leader of the group. The group arrived in Plymouth in late June and moved into their settlement the following month. By the end of September, the colony was established, the Swan was moored in Weymouth Fore River, and the Charity returned to England. Relations were initially cordial between the two colonies, and the men of the Wessagusset assisted Plymouth with their harvest, but the people of Plymouth accused them of stealing.. Quoting with annotations from Edward Winslow's Good News from New England Indians soon complained to Plymouth that the Wessagusset colonists were stealing their corn, but Plymouth had no authority over the new colony and could only send them a \\"rebuke\\". Wessagusset was consuming food too quickly because of the disorder of the colony, as reported by Plymouth's Governor Bradford, and it became apparent that they would run out before the end of the winter. In addition, Plymouth was also low on supplies due to spending additional time during the growing season building fortifications, rather than growing crops. To prevent hunger for both colonies, Plymouth and Wessagusset colonists organized a joint trading mission to the Indians with goods brought by the Wessagusset colonists. That trading mission was somewhat successful and the two colonies split the proceeds. In November, Greene died and John Sanders was made governor of the colony. By January, the colonists continued to trade with the Indians for food, but at a severe disadvantage. This drove up the barter-price of corn and they were forced to trade their clothes and other needed supplies. Some colonists entered a form of servitude, building canoes and performing other labors for the Indians in exchange for food, and ten colonists died. The Indians caught one Wessagusset man stealing, so the other Wessagusset colonists hanged him in their view as a show of good faith. However, sources disagree whether the man hanged was the culprit or an older, possibly dying man. The legend that the Wessagusset colonists hanged an innocent man was later popularized by a satirical depiction of this event in Samuel Butler's 1660s poem Hudibras. In February, Sanders petitioned Plymouth for a joint attack on the Indians, but Governor Bradford refused. Much of the story of the first Wessagusset colony is detailed in a 1662 account by company member Phineas Pratt. ===Killings at Wessagusset=== Miles Standish, circa 1630 Tensions continued to build throughout the winter between the settlers and the Indians, and there was at least one instance where an Indian was caught stealing from Plymouth. Near the end of the winter, the Indians near Wessagusset moved some of their huts to a swamp near the colony, and the colonists felt that they were under siege. One colonist at Wessagusset saw these signs and other indications of hostility, and fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack, pursued by Indians during his flight. He arrived at Plymouth on March 24 and met with Governor Bradford and town councilmen. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the tipping point or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a pre-emptive attack. Edward Winslow had saved the life of Wampanoag chief Massasoit, and Massasoit now warned him of a conspiracy among several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes were led by the Massachusetts but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Capawack, and Agawam tribes from as far away as Martha's Vineyard.. Quoting with annotations from Edward Winslow's Good News from New England Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset, and they arrived on March 26. Standish called all of the Wessagusset colonists into the stockade for defense. The following day, several Indians were at Wessagusset, including chief Pecksuot. Historical sources give different accounts of the killings, but four of the Indians were in the same room as Standish and several of his men. One source from the 1880s suggests that it was the Indians who arranged to be alone with Standish in order to attack him. Others sources state that Standish had invited them into the situation on peaceful pretenses. Regardless, Standish gave the order to strike, quickly killing Chief Pecksuot with his own knife. Several other Indians in the village were attacked next, and only one escaped to raise the alarm. As many as five colonists were also killed in the brief battle; one Indian's head was cut off and displayed in Plymouth as a warning to others, which was a common practice in Europe at the time.. Quoting with annotations from Edward Winslow's Good News from New England In 1858, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow included a fictionalized depiction of the killings in his poem The Courtship of Miles Standish. In his version, the Indians are depicted as begging for weapons to use against other tribes, and Standish responds by offering them Bibles. The Indians begin to boast and taunt him, so Standish attacks first: ===Aftermath=== Following the brief conflict, Standish offered to leave several soldiers to defend the colony, but the colonists declined. Instead, they divided, some returning to England in the Swan, including John Sanders, others remaining behind to join the Plymouth colony. By spring of 1623, the village was empty and the colony was dissolved. Thomas Weston arrived in Maine several months later, seeking to join his colony, only to discover that it was already failed. Some of his former settlers apparently had gone north to Maine and were living on House Island in Casco Bay in a home built by explorer Capt. Christopher Levett, who had been granted land to found an English colony.George Cleeve of Casco Bay: 1630-1667, with Collateral Documents, James Phinney Baxter, Printed for the Gorges Society, Portland, Me., 1885 (Levett's settlement also failed, and the fate of Weston's men is uncertain.) Due to the fighting at Wessagusset, Plymouth's trade with the Indians was devastated for years. Local tribes which had previously been favorable to Plymouth began to forge bonds with other tribes in defense against the colonists. Historians differ on whether the conflict could have been avoided or the colony saved. Some historians see the preemptive strike as a necessary one, \\"saving the lives of hundreds\\", while others see it as a sad misunderstanding. Historian Charles Francis Adams summarizes the Wessagusset experience as \\"ill-conceived, ill-executed, ill-fated\\". ==Second Wessagusset colony== The Plymouth Council for New England gave Robert Gorges a patent for a settlement covering northeast of Boston Bay. He was an English captain and son of Sir Ferdinando Gorges.Gorges was named as Governor-General of the new colony, to be assisted by Capt. Francis West, recently appointed Admiral to New England, and Capt. Christopher Levett, an English explorer slated to act as the fledgling colony's chief judicial officer. This settlement was intended to be a spiritual and civic capital of the council's New England colonies. Gorges was commissioned as Governor-General with authority over Plymouth and presumably future colonies. His government was also to consist of a leadership council, of which Plymouth's Governor Bradford would be a member. Weston had brought only working men, whereas Gorges brought entire families who would form a permanent settlement. He also brought two Anglican clergymen who would oversee the spiritual health of the region. Gorges arrived in Massachusetts in September 1623, only four months after Weston's colony collapsed. Instead of founding his colony at the location described in the patent, he chose the abandoned settlement at Wessagusset. It was rechristened Weymouth after Weymouth, Dorset, the town where the expedition began. Over the following weeks, he visited Plymouth and ordered the arrest of Thomas Weston who had arrived in that colony in the Swan. This was his only official act as Governor-General. Weston was charged with neglect of his colony and with selling weapons to the Indians which were supposed to have been used for the defense of the colony. Weston denied the first charge but confessed to the second. After consideration, Gorges released him on his word, and he eventually settled as a politician in Virginia and Maryland. After a winter in Weymouth, Gorges abandoned his new colony in the spring of 1624 due to financial difficulties. Most of his settlers returned to England, but some remained as colonists in Weymouth, Plymouth, or Virginia, and William Blaxton settled in Boston. The remaining Weymouth settlers were supported by Plymouth until they were made part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop visited the settlement in 1632. In time, the location of the original settlement was lost to history and development. The location of the original fort was not rediscovered until 1891. ==NotesReferences== * Dempsey, Jack, ed., \\"Good News from New England and Other Writings on the Killings at Weymouth Colony.\\" Scituate MA: Digital Scanning 2002 * Category:Colonial settlements in North America Category:Former English colonies Category:Pre-statehood history of Massachusetts Category:History of the Thirteen Colonies Category:Populated places established in 1622 Category:1622 establishments in Massachusetts Category:1623 disestablishments in the Thirteen Colonies Category:States and territories established in 1622 Category:Former populated places in Massachusetts ","title":"Wessagusset Colony"},{"id":"20423479","text":"NGC 27 is a spiral galaxy located in the Andromeda constellation.

A small team was formed to be the first Australian community and in January 1882, they were given a farewell dinner before they set sail; Cardinal Manning arrived with good wishes. The next day the group boarded the liner Sorata bound for Australia, bringing with them an icon of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, blessed by Pope Leo XIII. Eight weeks later, on their arrival in Sydney, the then Archbishop Roger Bede Vaughan, welcomed them.Boland, S.J., \\"Vaughan, Edmund (1827–1908)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National UniversityRedeptorists, Province of Oceania The leader of the group was Fr Edmund Vaughan, C.Ss.R. He was born in 1827 and was now 53 years of age. On their arrival in Sydney, the then Archbishop was Fr Vaughan's nephew, the Benedictine, Roger Bede Vaughan, who welcomed them with largesse.Boland S. J., \\"Vaughan, Edmund (1827–1908)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography On board with Fr Vaughan were two Irishmen, Fr Thomas O’Farrell and Fr James Hegarty, who would eventually take the Redemptorists to the Philippines. The Redemptorists set up their first house in Singleton, New South Wales where the hot climate forced them to conduct summer missions in the cooler climate of New Zealand's Dioceses. The Order soon took up residence in a new monastery at Mount St Alphonsus, Waratah, in Newcastle. In the first year at Waratah the community conducted 45 missions in ten dioceses through New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The Redemptorists soon opened another Monastery in Ballarat 1888, serving as a base for missions in the southern states. With the Ballarat community taking caring for the south of Australia, the community at Waratah began to look the north. In 1889, the first missions were preached in Queensland. Missions began in Brisbane and its surrounding area, with their success convincing the Archbishop to extend the programme to the far flung country parishes. Once the Redemptorists were firmly established in Australia, permanent communities were founded in New Zealand. A Redemptorist mission in Canterbury scaled its operations down in the 1880s, leaving just two priests in Lyttleton.Redemptorist Mission at Lyttelton, New Zealand Tablet, Volume XII, Issue 47, 13 March 1885, Page 16. Online version by Papers Past, National Library of New Zealand. In 1898 the Redemptorists began operating from a homestead in Wellington where they worked for over 80 years. A church was built there in 1908, and expanded to form St Gerard's Monastery in 1931-1932. In 1898 the houses in Ireland and Australia, hitherto subject to the English province, were constituted an Irish province, and Australia, a vice-province, as its dependency.Wuest, Joseph. \\"Redemptorists.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 16 February 2019 In October 1898 the Redemptorists conducted a month-long mission in Perth. The mission was so well received that requests for further missions followed. This led to the construction of the monastery in North Perth which was blessed and opened in September 1903. One of the first Superiors was Dr. Patrick Clune, born in Clare, Ireland, 1863, who had been ordained in the Diocese of Goulburn in 1886 and had previously been rector of the Redemptorist monastery in Wellington, New Zealand. He would later become the first bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese of Perth. A Novitiate and House of Studies were built at Pennant Hills in Sydney, New South Wales, in 1924 to cater for the increased numbers of men wanting to join the Redemptorists. The Novitiate later moved to Galong, also in New South Wales. In 1935 a second Victorian house was opened at Kew, Melbourne. A new house was created in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1945, followed by other foundations in Auckland and Dunedin In 1927, The Redemptorist leaders in Rome created the Province of Australasia to include the houses of Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand became an independent Province in 1970. Post-war Redemptorist activities include the development of the vice-provinces in the Philippines and in Singapore/Malaysia, the creation of several new houses on the east coast of Australia. The Redemptorists also became active as professors at Yarra Theological college. The Redemptorists still are engaged in missionary activity in Australia and New Zealand. Redemptorists are actively involved in parish missions, preaching, retreats, adult education, teaching in universities, social justice work, counselling, accompaniment of indigenous communities, chaplaincies, devotions to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, working with people on the margins of society and promoting the family through the Majellan magazine.Majellan Publications On January 1, 2015 the Redemptorists of Oceania living in New Zealand, Australia and Samoa became the new Redemptorist Province of Oceania with two vice provinces of Manila (Philippines) and Ipoh (Singapore/Malaysia) which both started as missions from Australia and New Zealand in the twentieth century.\\"News\\", Redemptorist website (retrieved 18 April 2018) ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== *Redemptorists of Australia and New Zealand Category:Catholic Church in Australia Category:Catholic Church in New Zealand ","title":"Redemptorists of Australia and New Zealand"},{"id":"20423579","text":"Adolphus Ypey Adolphus Ypey or Adolphus Ypeus or Adolf Ypey (4 June 1749, Franeker - 27 February 1822, Leiden), was a Dutch botanist and Doctor of Philosophy and Medicine who graduated at the University of Franeker and stayed on to lecture in botany.

A historical event can be defined as any occurrence from the past regardless of significance, with the term \\"history\\" an umbrella term relating to past events and any associated memories, discoveries, collections, organizations, presentations, and/or interpretations of them. This differs from a historic event which is often less inclusive, and stands out as having made a significant impact on history itself. The following is a list of notable people documented as the last living individuals to have witnessed, survived or participated in significant historical events or whom were the last living members of a historic group that directly contributed to such an event (e.g. Manhattan Project scientists). Excluded from this list are last living survivors of wars, speakers of languages, and others who are already recorded on pages representing more narrow categories. ==Before 1701== { - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 200px;\\"  Name ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 225px;\\"  Death !Distinction ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 150px;\\"  Date ended - Narmer c. 3100 BC Last king of Upper Egypt and First pharaoh of Unified Egypt 3150 BC - Lucius Tarquinius Superbus c. 495 BC Last King of Rome 509 BC - Seleucus I Nicator c.

It is a Hindu temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu. This temple is located along the Falgu River, marked by a footprint of Lord Vishnu known as Dharmasila, incised into a block of basalt. Atop the structure is a 50-kilo gold flag, donated by a devotee, Gayapal Panda Bal Govind Sen. The Brahma mythy Brahmans were the traditional priest of the temple in ancient time. Now the Brahamkalpit Brahman who are known as Gayawal Tirth Purohit or Panda are the priests. Several legendary saints as Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Ramakrishna have visited this shrine. ==Legend== Vishnu- Pad (Vishnu feet) print inside the Vishnupada Mandir, the 40 cm long footprint of Lord Vishnu is imprinted in solid rock and surrounded by a silver-plated basin. Once a demon known as Gayasura, did a heavy penance and sought a boon that whoever sees him should attain salvation (Moksham). Since salvation is achieved through being righteous in one's lifetime, people started obtaining it easily. To prevent immoral people from attaining salvation Lord Vishnu asked Gayasura to go beneath the earth and did so by placing his right foot on asura's head. After pushing Gayasura below the surface of earth, Lord Vishnu's foot print remained on the surface that we see even today. The footprint consists of nine different symbols including Shankam, Chakram and Gadham. These are believed to be weapons of the lord. Gayasura now pushed into earth pleaded for food. Lord Vishnu gave him a boon that every day, someone will offer him food. Whoever does so, their souls will reach heaven. The day Gayasura doesn't get food, it is believed that he will come out. Every day, one or the other from different parts of India will pray for welfare of his departed and offer food, feeding Gayasura. ==History and location== Vishnupad Mandir in 1885 The construction date of temple is unknown and it is believed that Rama along with Sita had visited this place. The present day structure was rebuilt by Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar, the ruler of Indore, in 1787, on the banks of the Falgu river. A flight of 1000 stone steps leads to the top of the Brahmajuni hill, 1 km southwest of the Vishnupad mandir. Visitors prefer to go to the top of Brahmajuni hill see the view of temple from top. There are many small temples near this temple. According to the local tales Ahilya Bai Holkar had crafted the temple. She sent her officers to inspect the best stone for the temple in whole region, and they found munger black stone, the best choice. But there was no proper road and the mountains was very far from gaya. so the officers found another mountain where they can carve and easily bring the stone to gaya the place was near Bathani (a small part of Gaya District}. The officers found the stone, now they have to find the craftsmen, the craftsmen was brought from Rajasthan. They were gour brahmins. They started carving the temple in Patthatkatti (current village of Bihar, it is also a tourist place). The final temple was assembled in Vishnupad temple. when the temple was completed the many of the craftsmen returned to their native place, and some settled in Pattharkatti. You can still find the generations of craftsmen and the mountain in Pattatkatti. Bihar government has marked this place a Tourist spots of Bihar. Pattharkatti is located on Gaya to Rajgir Road, Approx. 30 km from Gaya. ==Architecture== This is believed that the temple was built with the footprints of Lord Vishnu in the centre. In Hinduism, this footprint marks the act of Lord Vishnu subduing Gayasur by placing his foot on his chest. Inside the Vishnupad Mandir, the 40 cm long footprint of Lord Vishnu is imprinted in solid rock and surrounded by a silver plated basin. The height of this temple is 30 meters and it a has 8 rows of beautifully carved pillars which support the pavilion. The temple is built of large gray granite blocks jointed with iron clamps. The octagonal shrine faces east. Its pyramidal tower rises up a 100 feet. The tower has sloping sides with alternately indented and plain sections. The sections are set at an angle to create a series of peaks joined at the top. Within the temple stands the immortal banyan tree Akshayabat where the final rituals for the dead takes place. On top of the temple is a gold flag weighing approximately 51 kg.

KISS FM went to the 107.1 FM frequency. And then classic rock moved from the 96.7 FM frequency to the 105.9 FM frequency as Classic Rock 105.9 WXRG. ===Go-FM/Classic Rock 105.9/Bob 105-9=== On September 21, 2006, after a day of stunting with a loop of Fleetwood Mac's Go Your Own Way, WXRG dropped classic rock for classic hits as \\"105.9 GO-FM\\" and adopting the WHGO call letters. In 2009, the station gradually leaned back to a true Classic Rock format and rebranded as \\"Classic Rock 105.9\\". On October 4, 2010, WHGO went off the air and was replaced by a Microsoft Sam voice reciting a countdown of the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until October 8, while interspersing a random movie quote or song lyric a few times each minute. This affected both the station's normal over-the-air frequency as well as its online stream. On October 8, 2010 at 3 pm, WHGO relaunched as an automated Variety Hits station, branded as \\"Bob 105.9\\" with a new call sign of WQBB. The station was programmed by local radio vet, \\"Weerd Wayne\\" Watkins. In July 2014, station owner, Triad Broadcasting was sold to Alpha Media along with sister stations, WCPR, WGBL, WXYK and WTNI ===105.9 The Monkey=== In December 2018, it was announced Alpha Media would be selling its Gulf Coast cluster to local Mississippi broadcast company, Telesouth Communications Inc, who already owned WOSM, the SuperTalk Mississippi in the Biloxi market. The FCC approved the sale on February 12, 2019, and closed on March 1, 2019. On that day at midnight, after playing \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" by Led Zeppelin, WQBB dropped its Variety Hits format and assumed the programming of 107-1 The Monkey, which was spun off to another local company, Port Broadcasting as part of the sale to Telesouth. The first song on \\"105.9 The Monkey\\" was \\"7 Rings\\" by Ariana Grande. This move returned the CHR format and WXYK calls to the frequency after a 22-year absence. ==On-air programming== The current lineup (as of February 28, 2019) is as follows *Morning Show (6am-10am): The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show *Afternoon Drive (3pm-7pm): Lucas Lloyd *Station Voices: Damen Oaks/Jamie Frye *Program Director/Music Director: Lucas Lloyd ==References== The Monkey Displaces Bob in Biloxi Radioinsight - February 28, 2019 ==External links== * XYK (FM) Category:Contemporary hit radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1976 Category:1976 establishments in Mississippi ","title":"WXYK (FM)"},{"id":"20424288","text":"Calliostoma swinneni is a species of marine gastropod mollusc in the family Calliostomatidae.WoRMS (2010).

ISSD occurs when sialic acid is unable to be transported out of the lysosomal membrane and instead accumulates in the tissue, causing free sialic acid to be excreted in the urine. Mutations in the SLC17A5 (solute carrier family 17 (anion/sugar transporter), member 50) gene cause all forms of sialic acid storage disease. The SLC17A5 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 6 between positions 14 and 15. This gene provides instructions for producing a protein called sialin that is located mainly on the membranes of lysosomes, compartments in the cell that digest and recycle materials. ISSD is the most severe form of the sialic acid storage diseases. Babies with this condition have severe developmental delay, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They may have unusual facial features that are often described as \\"coarse,\\" seizures, bone malformations, enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly). ISSD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder and affects 1 in 528,000 live births worldwide. ==Symptoms and signs== Symptoms present by eight months of age and are marked by developmental delay followed by neurological complications such as seizures, involuntary eye movements, and ataxia, involuntary muscle movements and failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Babies with this condition also have and enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) and enlarged heart (cardiomegaly). ==CauseDiagnosis== A diagnosis can be made by measuring cultured tissue samples for increased levels of free sialic acid. Prenatal testing is also available for known carriers of this disorder ==Treatment== There is no treatment for ISSD.

It is accessible by a road from Stahovica. In the hamlet of Kraljev Hrib there is a cable car to the Big Pasture Plateau. ==Name== The settlement takes its name from the Kamnik Bistrica River (), the source of which lies in the central part of the settlement's territory. The epithet Kamniški differentiates the river from many other rivers named Bistrica. The name Bistrica refers to a swiftly flowing river and is derived from the Slavic adjective *bystrъ 'swiftly flowing, rushing'.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Založba ZRC, p. 61. ==History== Big Predoselj Gorge In the 16th century, the area was used for hunting by nobility and a table was set up in the Predoselj Gorge, where they would dine while on hunting expeditions. In 1826, draft evaders threw the table into the Kamnik Bistrica River, as a result of which the microtoponym Pri firštovi mizi ('At the Prince's Table') became established for the location. There was also a blast furnace in Kamniška Bistrica in the 16th century; it was recorded as owned by Jožef Žigan in 1739. In 1832, a queen mating station was established in the hamlet of Kopišča. The Bistrica Lodge at the head of the valley was built in 1902. The road into the valley was laid out in 1934. During the Second World War, Partisans used the area as a refuge. They operated an underground print shop near Kopišča and set up a field hospital below Orličje Falls, which was active from the fall of 1943 to the fall of 1944. A bunker near the quarry at the south end of the valley was set up as a slaughterhouse and meat-processing facility. ===Mass graves=== Kamniška Bistrica is the site of six known mass graves from the period immediately after the Second World War. All of the graves are located along the road from Stahovica to Kamniška Bistrica. Some of the graves probably contain the remains of a truckload of wounded Croatian soldiers that were transported to the area on 10 May 1945. The Macesnovec Mass Grave () lies a few dozen meters east of a tourism sign. It was a clearly visible mound containing the remains of many prisoners of war, primarily Croatians but also Slovenes.

Commonly known as the \\"shotgun fungus\\" or \\"cannonball fungus\\", species discharge their spores with explosive force. Discharged spore sacs are sticky and have a tendency to strongly adhere to whatever surface they encounter, making them a nuisance to homeowners, pressure washing contractors, landscape mulch producers and insurance companies. ==Taxonomy and classification== The generic name is derived from the Greek words sphaer, meaning \\"sphere\\", and obolus, meaning \\"to throw\\". Sphaerobolus was first described by the Italian priest and biologist Pier Antonio Micheli (as Carpobolus) in 1729.Micheli PA. (1729). in Nova Plantarum Genera. Florence, Italy. Formerly, the genus was placed either in its own family, the Sphaerobolaceae, in the order Sclerodermatales, or, more commonly, in the order Nidulariales. Currently, the genus is placed in the family Geastraceae. Recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that Sphaerobolus should be placed in the gomphoid-phalloid clade along with related genera like Geastrum, Phallus, Pseudocolus, Ramaria, Clavariadelphus, Gomphus and Gautieria. Within the genus, three highly supported clades may be discerned, corresponding to S. stellatus, S. iowensis, and the recently described taxon S. ingoldii. ==Description== Fruiting bodies, which grow in groups, are 1-3 mm in diameter, roughly spherical or ovoid in shape, and white to buff in color. The peridium (outer wall) consists of several layers, including a gelatinous layer. At maturity, the exoperidium (outermost layer) splits into several lobes to expose the dark brown, single peridiole (spore casing). The peridiole is forcibly ejected (sometimes up to several feet), leaving an evaginated endoperidium. Spores are typically 6-10 x 4-6 μm, elliptical to oblong in shape, thick-walled, and hyaline. Species have a cosmopolitan distribution, and are usually found on dung, decaying wood (such as landscaping mulch), or vegetative litter. ==Mechanism of spore discharge== The peridium, which consists of six distinct layers, forms two \\"cups\\" at maturity.Buller AHR. (1933). Researches on Fungi, vol. 5. Longmans, Green and Co., London. Three layers form the outer cup, two form the inner cup, and one layer dissolves to create the fluid that bathes the gleba. After splitting of the peridal layers to expose the gleba, enzymatic conversion of glycogen to glucose increases the internal osmotic pressure and the turgidity of palisade cells in the inner peridial cup. Analysis of the glebal carbohydrates revealed an increase in glucose, mannitol, and trehalose prior to glebal discharge, which would account for the increase in osmotic pressure. Glebal discharge typically occurs 5-6 hours after the apex has split. In S. stellatus, the gleba may be thrown up to 6 meters horizontally. This species is phototropic, and the nearest source of direct or reflected light will be the target for glebal discharge. ==Species== *Sphaerobolus ingoldii *Sphaerobolus iowensis *Sphaerobolus stellatus *Sphaerobolus jaysukhianus ==External links== *Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month, July 2005 *Sphaerobolus stellatus--The Artillery Fungus * Category:Geastraceae ","title":"Sphaerobolus"},{"id":"20424606","text":"The Jesenice Mosque (, ) is a Sunni mosque located in the town of Jesenice, Municipality of Jesenice, Slovenia, on Viktor Kejžar street, no 19.

In ten-pin bowling, a Dutch 200 is a game in which the bowler records a score of 200 by getting strikes and spares in alternation throughout the game. Strikes, when thrown in the even-numbered frames, require six spares (strike then spare in the 10th frame). For strikes in the odd-numbered frames, five spares are needed, with a strike on the last shot of the game. When bowled in certified play, the certifying body may issue a patch or other award commemorating the feat. The term is thought to originate from the phrase \\"Dutch treat\\" which is when two individuals share the cost of a date.Bowl.com FAQ Traditionally, a Dutch 200 is one of the hardest games to bowl due to the alternation of the spares and strikes which gives each frame a score of 20.

For the first nine frames, the bowler will score 57 (29 + 19 + 9) every three frames, for 171, with 29 more in the 10th frame to total 200. ==References== Category:Ten-pin bowling ","title":"Dutch 200"},{"id":"20425129","text":"Kostanj () is a small village in the Municipality of Kamnik in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. ==Church== The local church is dedicated to Saint Dorothea. ==Notable people== Notable people that were born or lived in Kostanj include: *Pavel Pestotnik (1879–1955), politician and organizer of the Sokol movementPogačnik, Frido. 1956. \\"Dr. Pavel Pestotnik.\\" Zbornik Svobodne Slovenije 8: 281. \\"Pavel Pestotnik.\\" Slovenska biografija.\\"Nekaj opomb k vpisom.\\" 1963.

It consists of marine limestones, shales, marls and clays. Lias is a Middle English term for hard limestone, used in this specific sense by geologists since 1833.Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. \\"lias\\". In the past, geologists used Lias not only for the sequence of rock layers, but also for the timespan during which they were formed. It was thus an alternative name for the Early Jurassic epoch of the geologic timescale. It is now more specifically known that the Lias is Rhaetian to Toarcian in age (over a period of 20 million years between ) and thus also includes a part of the Triassic. The use of the name \\"Lias\\" for a unit of time is therefore slowly disappearing. ==Subdivisions== In southern England, the Lias Group is often divided into Lower, Middle and Upper subgroups. In Southern England the Lias is divided into the following formations (from top to base): * Bridport Sand * Beacon Limestone * Dyrham Formation * Charmouth Mudstone * Blue Lias In the East Midlands Shelf the Lias is divided into the following formations (from top to base): * Whitby Mudstone * Marlstone Rock * Charmouth Mudstone * Scunthorpe Mudstone In the Cleveland Basin in Yorkshire the Lias is divided into the following formations (from top to base): * Whitby Mudstone * Cleveland Ironstone * Staithes Sandstone * Redcar Mudstone It is underlain by the Late Triassic Penarth Group,Somerset Geological TimeLine, fossilgalore.com and overlain, after a stratigraphic hiatus, by the Early Cretaceous Upper Greensand Formation. In Wales only the Blue Lias is present. There are restricted outcrops of Lias rocks on the west coast of Scotland where, in the Sea of the Hebrides depositional basin on Skye, Raasay and Mull, the Broadford Beds Formation, Pabay Shale Formation and overlying Scalpay Sandstone Formation are assigned to the Lias Group. In Dutch lithostratigraphy, the name Lias has no official status, however, it is often used for the lower part of the Altena Group in the subsurface of the Netherlands and the southern North Sea.See for example Wong (2007) In northern Germany, the Lias Group consists of nine formations (from top to base):Deutsche Stratigraphische Kommission (eds.): Stratigraphische Tabelle von Deutschland 2002 (stratigraphic tables of the German commission on stratigraphy), Potsdam 2002, (PDF: 6.57 MB) * Opalinuston * Dörnten-Formation * Posidonia Shale * Amaltheenton * Capricornu-Formation * Raricostaten- Formation * Arieten Sandstone * Liassicus Sandstone * Psilonoten Sandstone ==See also== *Blue Lias * White lias ==ReferencesNotes=Literature=== * (2007): Jurassic, in: (eds.): Geology of the Netherlands, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, pp. 107–125.

It was led by Acting Wing Commander, later Group Captain, George Westlake of the Royal Air Force. By early 1945, northern Italy's rail and road network had undergone severe damage, forcing the Germans to resort to shipping goods into Venice and then moving them from there along rivers and canals. An attack on the city's harbour was thus deemed necessary by the Allied command, although the risk of damage to the city's architectural and artistic treasures was high, as it had always been in other battles of the Italian campaign, such as Battle of Monte Cassino. The operation was planned to be extremely precise to avoid any such damage and was named Operation Bowler by Air Vice-Marshal Robert Foster, as a reminder to those involved that they would be \\"bowler hatted\\" (returned to civilian life) or worse should Venice itself be damaged. Having assessed the weather, Westlake led the attack in a Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk from No. 250 Squadron RAF, part of No. 239 Wing RAF, which was composed of Kittyhawk and Mustang squadrons and specialised in dive-bombing operations.

Historian David Hackett Fischer identified it as the belief that significant facts of history are necessarily sinister, and that \\"history itself is a story of causes mostly insidious and results mostly invidious.\\" It is more than a conspiracy theory in that it does not merely consider the possibility of hidden motives and deeds, but insists on them. In its extreme form, the fallacy represents general paranoia. Fischer identifies several examples of the fallacy, particularly the works of Charles A. Beard. In each case, Fischer shows that historians provided detailed portrayals of historical figures involved in off-record meetings and exhibiting low morals, based on little or no evidence. He notes that the furtive fallacy does not necessarily imply deliberate falsification of history; it can follow from a sincere (but misguided) belief that nothing happens by accident or mistake. Richard Hofstadter discussed the fallacy before Fischer, although not by name. In reviewing histories from the Progressive Era, Hofstadter noted that the progressive historians tended to assume that reality was always hidden and ignored, being determined by bribes, rebates, and secret business deals. A modification of the furtive fallacy holds that when the historical record provides no evidence explaining a particular set of events, this is itself evidence of a furtive cause. The idea of the furtive fallacy was criticized by Jeffrey M. Bale, author of the book The Darkest Sides of Politics, who cited the risk of historians underestimating the influence of political secret societies, vanguard parties, and intelligence agencies. ==See also== * Conspiracy theory ==NotesFurther reading== * Category:Informal fallacies Category:Conspiracy theories ","title":"Furtive fallacy"},{"id":"20425568","text":"Sinte Gleska University (SGU) is a private American Indian tribal college in Mission, South Dakota, on the Rosebud Indian Reservation.

The exact date is not certain; records suggest various birth dates between 1828 and 1835. He may be the William Gentles born September 30, 1828, the son of Robert and Sarah Gentles.Josephine Masterson, Ireland: 1841/1851 Census Abstracts (Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc.) p. 33. William Gentles immigrated to the United States in 1850, arriving in New York City where he worked as a laborer for several years. ==Utah War== On April 2, 1856, Gentles went into the recruiting station in New York City and enlisted in the U.S. Army. He was described in his enlistment record as 5 foot 8½ inches tall, with grey eyes, brown hair and a ruddy complexion. Private Gentles was assigned to Company K Tenth Infantry and sent to Fort Ridgely, Minnesota where he was stationed for the next year.Register of Enlistments, U.S. Army; Regimental Returns, 10th Infantry, National Archives. The perception of a brewing rebellion in Utah Territory prompted President Buchanan to order a large military force be sent west, including the entire Tenth Infantry, as part of the Utah Expedition. Private Gentles departed Fort Ridgely, Minnesota, with his company on June 9, 1857 and arrived at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, two weeks later. They commenced marching west along the Overland Trail in July, finally reaching Fort Bridger in November. The loss of a supply train to Mormon raiders promised hardships for the soldiers as they settled into winter quarters at Smith's Fork nearby. Captain Randolph B. Marcy was ordered to make a dangerous trek south to Fort Massachusetts to obtain additional supplies and horses. When volunteers were called for, Private William Gentles was one of those who stepped forward. They struggled through deep snow in the mountains and finally reached Fort Massachusetts in January 1858, and returned to Fort Bridger two months later. Private Gentles was with his company in July 1858 when they moved through Salt Lake City and established Camp Floyd further south. The following month, they were transferred back to Fort Bridger where Gentles remained for the next two years. In June 1860, the company was transferred to Fort Laramie where Gentles completed his first enlistment and was discharged on April 1, 1861. ==Civil War and Reconstruction== As a civilian, William Gentles apparently settled in St. Joseph, Missouri. But with the Civil War engulfing the nation, Gentles again enlisted, this time in the 25th Regular Missouri Volunteers, which later became the 1st Regiment of Missouri Engineers. He was wounded in the hand at the Battle of Pilot Knob on September 27, 1862. Gentles completed his enlistment in 1864 and re-enlisted as a veteran volunteer. He was mustered out on July 22, 1865 in Louisville, Kentucky. After the Civil War, Gentles returned to civilian life for two years, apparently in Missouri. Then on June 10, 1867, he enlisted in the Regular Army again. He was sent initially to the recruit depot at Newport Barracks, Kentucky and within days was assigned to Company F 45th Infantry and shipped to Tennessee where the regiment served on Reconstruction duty. In 1869, while stationed in Louisville, Kentucky, the army consolidated a number of regiments and Gentles's company became Company F 14th Infantry. ==Back in the West== In the spring of 1870 the 14th Infantry was transferred to the Department of Dakota, with Private Gentles's company assigned to Fort Randall. Two weeks later, the company was sent up the Missouri to Fort Thompson near the Crow Creek Agency. On June 10, 1870, while camped near the agency, Private Gentles re-enlisted for his third enlistment. In August 1870, the regiment was transferred to the Department of the Platte. Traveling on the steamboat The Far West, famous six years later for evacuating the wounded from the Battle of the Little Big Horn, Company F arrived at Omaha Barracks, Nebraska, where they were stationed for the winter. Gentles and Company F transferred to Fort Fetterman, Wyoming, where they served from March 1871 to September 1873 and then to Fort Sanders, Wyoming, until February 1874. In early 1874, with trouble brewing with the Oglala Lakotas at the Red Cloud Agency in northwestern Nebraska after the killing of an agency clerk, the army dispatched a large contingent of troops to establish military posts near Red Cloud and nearby Spotted Tail Agencies. On February 15, 1874, Private Gentles and Company F entrained to Cheyenne and marched north to Fort Laramie. There they were met by other companies that then marched to Red Cloud Agency, where they encamped for the next four months. Shortly after returning to Fort Sanders, Private Gentles and Company F were transferred to Camp Douglas, Utah Territory, arriving on September 5, 1874. Camp Douglas was named regimental headquarters for the 14th Infantry, under the command of Colonel John E. Smith. Most of the original log and adobe buildings at the post were in the process of being torn down and replaced by new red sandstone structures, and for the next two years soldiers at the camp, including Private Gentles, were engaged in quarrying and hauling stone as well as other garrison duties. Gentles re-enlisted for his fourth enlistment on June 10, 1875 while at Camp Douglas. ==The Great Sioux War of 1876-77== In May 1876 Brigadier General George Crook led an expedition into Montana to engage traditionalist bands of Lakotas and Northern Cheyennes who refused reservation life. After his near near defeat in the Battle of the Rosebud, Crook called for reinforcements and encamped for much of the summer in the lee of the Big Horn Mountains, awaiting their arrival. Meanwhile, an ever growing village of Lakotas and Cheyennes defeated Custer's command at the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25. Orders detailed Companies B and F, Fourteenth Infantry, at Camp Douglas to join Crook in the field. Traveling by train to Cheyenne, Private Gentles and his company marched north to Fort Fetterman, where in turn they departed on July 4, 1876 for General Crook's camp. Crook resumed the campaign trail in August, following various Indians trails but failing to find any sizable village as the traditionalists began to scatter. Exhausting its supplies, Crook's column made a desperate turn south to the Black Hills in what became famous as the \\"Starvation March.\\" Crook closed his campaign that fall and Gentles's Company F 14th Infantry was assigned to duty at Camp Robinson, Nebraska. Through the fall and winter the camp's garrison patrolled the Sidney-Deadwood trail and engaged in normal post activities. During the spring of 1877 Camp Robinson's soldiers witnessed the surrender of large bands of Northern Cheyennes and Lakotas at the nearby Red Cloud Agency, culminating with the surrender of Crazy Horse on May 5, 1877. Private Gentles's name appears in the post records but once, when in August 1877 he was tried by garrison court martial and sentenced to twenty days in the post guardhouse. ==The Death of Crazy Horse== On the late afternoon of September 5, 1877, Crazy Horse was brought to Camp Robinson. While attempting to place him in the guardhouse, he struggled and the famed Oglala war leader was fatally bayoneted. At the time, there was considerable confusion as to how Crazy Horse had been wounded but a member of the guard detail that evening, Private Edwin D. Wood, wrote plainly of seeing a soldier bayonet Crazy Horse. Nearly all later eye witness accounts collected by various historians confirm that a soldier was responsible. The identity of that individual, however, remained unknown for decades. No official army records note the name. In 1903, a former sergeant of the 14th Infantry, giving his name as William F. Kelly, told a Washington Post reporter what he had seen that evening at Camp Robinson. \\"It was an exciting moment, when no one knew just what to do,\\" Kelly explained, recalling the struggle outside the guardhouse door between Crazy Horse and Little Big Man. \\"Suddenly, as the men surged forward in the direction of where I was standing, I saw Wm. Gentles, an old soldier and a veteran of the Mormon campaign of 1857, give Crazy Horse a thrust with his bayonet. The thrust was delivered with lightning-like rapidity, and in the next instant, he had his gun at carry, as though nothing had happened. Crazy Horse gave a deep groan, staggered forward and dropped his knife and fell.\\" The article was widely reprinted in newspapers that year, including the Denver Post and Crawford Tribune. Most writers have since accepted Sergeant Kelly's claim without question. Classic works on Crazy Horse by E. A. Brininstool, David Humphreys Miller, and Mari Sandoz repeated Gentles' name as the soldier directly complicit in the stabbing. Custer scholar John Carroll, in his introduction to Richard Hardorff's book on the genealogy of Crazy Horse, provided a brief biography of the man. Later day Crazy Horse biographers, Kingsley Bray and Thomas Powers, both acknowledge Gentles even while nagging issues associated with the identification plagued the story, as did the occasional surfacing of other names of individuals who may have been on the scene and wielded the bayonet. The matter was investigated carefully in 1996 by historian Ephriam Dickson, who directly challenged the identification of Gentles as the soldier responsible, questioning but never resolving issues surrounding the identity of William F. Kelly, the man who put forward Gentles's name in 1903. Dickson concluded that enough uncertainty clouded Kelly's own identity that one should doubt, in turn, his naming Gentles as the man who stabbed the chief. More recently, historian Paul L. Hedren, working closely with Dickson, investigated the case more carefully, and for the first time settled the questionable identity of William Kelly, which in turn settled the issues surrounding the identity of William Gentles. No longer is there any doubt that the soldier at the Camp Robinson guardhouse door, Private William Gentles, stabbed Crazy Horse. Paul L. Hedren, \\"Who Killed Crazy Horse: A Historiographical Review and Affirmation,\\" Nebraska History 101 (Spring 2020): 2-17. ==Death== Company F 14th Infantry departed Camp Robinson on November 4, 1877. Private William Gentles remained behind for several weeks, perhaps packing company baggage, but soon joined his company at Camp Douglas, Utah. In May 1878 suffering from asthma, Private Gentles was admitted to the post hospital at Camp Douglas, where he died on May 20, 1878. Gentles was buried several days later in the post cemetery. ==References== Category:1830s births Category:1932 deaths Category:United States Army soldiers Category:Union Army soldiers ","title":"William Gentles"},{"id":"20425790","text":"Lowermoor Water Treatment Works, on the right The Lowermoor Water Treatment Works supplies drinking water to the north Cornwall water distribution network.

The link between the game and the shooting is regarded as an \\"easy out for society\\" by then IGDA executive director Jason Della Rocca. The final section of the film documents the 2007 controversy at the Slamdance Film Festival in which the Columbine videogame was pulled from the Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition by festival director Peter Baxter. In response, University of Southern California pulled its sponsorship of the competition and half of the other game developers pulled their projects out of the festival. The Slamdance documentary jury attempted to award the game a special jury prize but Baxter prevented the award from being given. Eventually, the game screened at other events such as Living Game Worlds in Gijon, Spain and a gallery installation at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. ==Slamdance Festival rejection== The film was rejected from the 2008 Slamdance Film Festival – which the film notes during the end credits. Ian Bogost at Water Cooler Games observed that \\"It's certainly no surprise that those 'subjective decisions' would include the rejection of the film, which is openly critical of the festival.\\"Water Cooler Games: \\"Playing Columbine Screening, Rejection\\" ==Release== Playing Columbine premiered at AFI Fest'Playing Columbine' set for AFI FestHollywood Reporter in Los Angeles, California on November 7, 2008.preview of AFI screening at The Screening Log It has also screened at Artfutura,screening at Artfutura the Bradford Animation Festival,screening at Bradford Animation Festival the Denver Film Festival,screening at Starz Denver Film Festival and the Santa Fe Film Festival.screening at Santa Fe Film Festival It has been screened in academic venues such as University of Texas at Dallas, Emerson College and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

A founding member of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), he was part of the Young Turks and had positions in government after the constitution was re- established. In the beginning of the Republican period, he was executed for alleged involvement in an assassination attempt against Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.Andrew Mango, Atatürk, PUBLISHER?, 1999, pp. 448-453 ==Early years and career== Cavit was born in the Salonica Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (modern day Thessaloniki). He spoke Greek and French, attending the progressive Şemsi Efendi School, the same school as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. He attended Mülkiye academy in Istanbul for civil servants, and upon graduation he secured employment with a state bank, and at the same time taught economics and worked within the Ministry of Education.Dawn: Turkey in the Age of Atatürk by Ryan Gingeras His father was Naim, a merchant, and his mother was Pakize; they were cousins.

Having returned to Salonica, Cavit Bey joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). After the proclamation of the Second Constitution in 1908, he was elected deputy of Salonica and Kale-i Sultaniye (Çanakkale) into the parliament in Constantinople. Following the 31 March Incident in 1909, Cavit Bey was appointed minister of finance in the cabinet of Grand Vizier Tevfik Pasha. Following the orchestrated Black Sea Raid on Russian ports in 1914, Cavit resigned. He remained an influential figure in the Empire's dealings with Germany until he returned to his post in February 1917. Up to the Armistice of Mudros in 1918 following the World War I, Cavit Bey played an important role in the CUP. Cavit Bey represented the Ottoman Empire in postwar financial negotiations in London and Berlin. ==Committee of Union and Progress== As fears of collapse grew in Salonika amidst the spreading insurrections and violence of the Balkans and the autocratic rule and inaction of Abdülhamid II, foreign influence over the Ottoman state also grew (along with the nation's debt). Cavid and other supporters of the Ottoman nation came to believe that the sultan had to step aside for the good of the empire. This core group founded the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), called the Young Turks by foreign press.Dawn: Turkey in the Age of Atatürk by Ryan Gingeras ==Republican period== Mehmet Cavit Bey in 1926 In 1921, Mehmet Cavit Bey married Aliye Nazlı, the divorced wife of a prince. In 1924, their son Osman Şiar was born. After Cavit Bey's execution, his son was raised by his close friend Hüseyin Cahit Yalçın. Following the enactment of the Surname Law in 1934, Osman Şiar adopted the surname Yalçın. In the early period of the Republican era, Mehmet Cavit Bey was charged with involvement in the assassination attempt in Izmir against Mustafa Kemal Pasha. After a widespread government investigation, Cavit Bey was convicted and later executed by hanging on August 26, 1926 in Ankara. Thirteen others, including other CUP members Ahmed Şükrü and İsmail Canbulat, were found guilty of treason and hanged.Touraj Atabaki, Erik Jan Zürcher, 2004, Men of Order: Authoritarian Modernization under Ataturk and Reza Shah, I.B.Tauris, , page 207 The letters which Cavit Bey wrote to his wife Aliye Nazlı during his imprisonment were given to her only after his execution. She had the letters published later as a book entitled, Zindandan Mektuplar (\\"Letters from the Dungeon\\").

It was initially named as Holland's Hills for Francis Holland, who bought the land in 1665. Richard Harrison, a Quaker planter and shipowner, bought the land and built a home on it. Harrison owned about 6,000 acres total. It was originally a primitive, two-room, -story frame dwelling constructed in the fall or winter of 1698. An addition was made in 1713, and , the entire structure was encased in brick and another addition was constructed. The house is an example of Medieval Transitional architecture built in Maryland during the mid—seventeenth century. It was a quarter plantation of Richard Harrison, who likely built the original structure for his son, Samuel Harrison (1679–1733). The inventory of Samuel Harrison's estate (1733) lists thirteen rooms, including a kitchen as well as a library of 195 books. Harrison's \\"store\\" or storeroom contained abundant supplies of everything from cooper's tools to tobacco boxes to India silk. Interesting features of the house include original brick vaulting in the cellar, fine paneling and moldings, ancient glass panes, batten doors with original hardware, a wall of rare marbleized paneling; and three eighteenth—century paintings on wood. In 1825, the will of Benjamin Harrison bequeathed half of the household furniture and three African-American slaves to his daughter Ann Tongue. Historic American Buildings Survey. By John O.

Conceptualized by a group of comic book creators from different parts of the country (and some based overseas) as a collaboration to revitalize the local Comics industry. As per the message posted in their official blog: > Sacred Mountain Publications has gathered in this issue more than a dozen > upbeat and talented creators along with their independent studios in one > gigantic effort to encourage friendly cooperation and make it possible for > these artists to turn their imaginations into reality. Bayan Knights is considered a benchmark in Philippine comics history as the first title to feature the characters of individual creators while retaining the individual rights to them. An article in the Philippine Daily Inquirer Sunday edition printed on November 26, 2008 was the first to provide media recognition to the project. A second major article was published months after the comics' debut and was reviewed in the February 2009 issue of FHM Philippines. Bayan Knights was officially created and launched on September 2008 through their Deviantart page and their blog. A teaser trailer was also posted at YouTube. The Issue #1 premiered during the Komikon 2008 held at the UP Bahay ng Alumni on November 22, 2008. ==Fictional team history== After a bloody encounter with powerful underworld forces that left his elite team virtually wiped out, Sarhento Sagrado confiscates the highly advanced facility that they raided. Worried about the safety of his family and determined to bring the masterminds to justice, Sagrado fakes his own death and destroys all traces of the existence of the facility, vowing to use the very resources his nemeses accumulated in the cause of their downfall. Through the database compiled in the facility, Sagrado determined that the so-called superheroes were key figures in the grand scheme. Needing allies in his 'war' against the underworld, Sagrado sought out and recruited them one by one. Although successful with the 'street-level' heroes, he found it increasingly difficult to locate, let alone convince, the virtual demigods. Enter the enigmatic Council. Effortlessly bypassing the security protocols of the facility, Council confronted and offered his assistance to Sagrado. Although claiming not to be one of them, Council convinces Sagrado to allow him to recruit the ones he needed. As the days progressed, Sagrado intercepts information on a vital part of the masterminds' schemes. Still waiting on the response from Council, Sagrado assembles his 'Core' Team to investigate. Once there, they find stasis containment units. Opening one of the units reveals it contained an unidentified female. Before they could determine the vile purpose of the stasis units, they are ambushed by Sipaka, preternatural watchdogs who are sworn enemies of one of their own, Salakay. Managing to fight their way out, they are shocked to discover several hundred more Sipaka awaiting them. As things turn bleak for the heroes, Sagrado attempts one final time to contact Council. The latter responds, moments before the Powerhouse Team, composed of the most powerful superheroes on earth, descends from the heavens. In issue #2 the army of Sipakas are easily beaten back by the combined Core/Powerhouse teams. But no sooner as one battle ends the 2 teams become embroiled in separate adventures. Meanwhile, another team is assembled, the Gilas Team to deal with the assault of demonic entities in the metropolis. Behind all this, another mysterious group makes its moves against the growing Bayan Knights membership. At the end of the issue, Sagrado is confronted with the daunting task of unifying the disparate superheroes into a cohesive force. However, his planning is disrupted by the awakening and rampage of the rescued Liberty Girl. In issue #3 the berserk Liberty Girl causes catastrophic destruction in the Facility with a number of heroes falling to her unbridled fury. Phantom Cat and Luzviminda manage to fight her to a standstill until the young god Servant ends the confrontation. Elsewhere, Maskarado and Kalayaan are ambushed as theBangis(a conglomerate of super-villains in direct opposition to the Bayan Knights)make their presence known led by a super powerful enslaved superhero Maso. In issue #4 the Core Team along with a number of Lagalag team up to counter the attack of the Bangis and manage to free the enslaved hero Maso. As Council continues to make his own moves (recruiting members of the TronIX team) the Gilas team assaults the gates of Hell on a mission to locate the entity Gabriel Black. In issue #5, even as the heroes of the Gilas and Halaw Teams succeed in their missions, and members of the Powerhouse Division foil an invasion of The Facility, the plans of the Bangis fall into place, planting a traitor among the heroes' ranks who successfully breaks out the captured villains and assault The Facility. The story is ongoing. ==Membership== Bayan Knights is unique in its organization as it has designated \\"divisions\\" but is flexible enough that members can be swapped out depending on the mission specifics. ==Core== leftthumb150pxCore Team From the cover of Bayan Knights#1.

He was recruited by Sarhento Sagrado of the Bayan Knights to be the Nursery's mentor and guardian after he was liberated from Dilim's \\"contract\\" that turned him into a super villain for a brief period of time. Though he has not tapped the full potential of his abilities, he possesses immense strength, invulnerability, super speed, the ability to increase his powers ten-fold and increase his size, weight and mass. He uses a pair of Regulator Gloves to help him control his powers. Created by:Ramil A.

He has volunteered his assistance and asks nothing in return, claiming to be no more than an 'admirer' of superheroes but his agenda remains an enigma. He has displayed extensive (bordering on encyclopedic) knowledge on the background of super-powered individuals and either possesses superhuman speed or teleportation.Bayan Knights #1 ==References * Bayan Knights article from the Philippine Sunday Inquirer * 2nd Bayan Knights article from the Philippine Daily Inquirer - Feb 21, 2009 * Bayan Knights Deviantart.com page * Gio Paredes' Kalayaan Comics Official Site * Servant Webcomics official site Category:Fictional Filipino people Category:Superhero teams ","title":"Bayan Knights"},{"id":"20426081","text":"Clairaut's relation, named after Alexis Claude de Clairaut, is a formula in classical differential geometry.

The competition is organised by the Centre for Human Rights, based at the University of Pretoria Faculty of Law in South Africa. Each year, the competition is hosted by a Law Faculty from a different African country. Since its inception in 1992, the competition has had 845 participant teams originating from 125 universities from 45 African countries. The competition is tri-lingual and preliminary rounds are argued in English, French and Portuguese. Students argue a hypothetical human rights case and base their arguments on the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. The final round is argued by two teams made up of the best three Anglophone teams, two Francophone teams and one Lusophone team. The final round is judged by prominent African and international jurists. ==Recognition== The African Human Rights Moot Court has been described as the largest gathering of law students and lecturers on the African continent. The Centre for Human Rights was awarded the UNESCO Prize for Human Rights Education in 2006 and the African Human Rights Moot Court received a special mention as it is one of the flagship programmes of the Centre. ==Historical overview== {  - !

Phase II clinical trials have completed for several indications, and the company is preparing for phase III trials. Paclitaxel trevatide is a paclitaxel-Angiopep-2 conjugate. Various Angiopep vectors have been composed and differ by their anti-cancer moieties. This has then been shown to be a prospective cancer therapy drug that can not only be conjugated to paclitaxel but also peptides, monoclonal antibodies, siRNA and many other biological materials. Paclitaxel trevatide has the potential to treat a variety of CNS diseases including glioma. Research has shown reduction in tumor growth in mice and rats with glioblastoma. ==Mechanism of action== This drug was specifically designed to treat brain tumors. Because of the blood brain barrier (BBB), many cancer therapy drugs are prevented from passing through the brain capillaries into the parenchyma. Paclitaxel is generally prevented from reaching its target in the cell due to the presence of the efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at the barrier. This is known as a multidrug resistant-associated protein (MRP1) that causes resistance amongst many organic drugs that are not conjugated to acidic ligands. This receptor is an ATP-driven transporter that will pump drugs, drug metabolites, and endogenous metabolites out of the cell. Paclitaxel trevatide contains paclitaxel, which stabilizes microtubule polymer formation. Microtubules are composed of polymers consisting of the protein tubulin. Therefore, paclitaxel binds at the site of β-tubulin and induces polymerization, thus protecting the microtubule from disassembling during mitosis. This blocks the progression of mitosis due to a prolonged activation of the microtubule in the mitotic checkpoint, resulting in cell apoptosis or reversion to the G0 phase. However, paclitaxel trevatide will effectively transport across the BBB with approximately a 100-fold higher transport rate compared to a free paclitaxel. Paclitaxel trevatide will cross the capillary medium via receptor mediated transcytosis of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) which is upregulated in some cancers. Ester hydrolyzing enzymes (esterases) then catalyze a highly stereospecific reaction that results in hydrolysis of the paclitaxel trevatide ester to carboxylic acids. This results in the intracellular release of paclitaxel and subsequent action on tubulin. Concentration has been found to play a key role paclitaxel trevatide's administration. Studies show that a high concentration will suppress microtubule detachment which is necessary for mitosis to occur. The microenvironment of cells may also differ from that of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. This is generally more oxygen deficient and acidic. These conditions will then result in a selective pressure towards cancer cell proliferation. It has been shown that cancer cell lines exposed to this hypoxic or serum-deprived condition will upregulate LPR1 expression, thus leading to an increased uptake of paclitaxel trevatide. However, these receptors are also present in non-cancerous cells, thus presenting a challenge due to non-specific targeting. It is then believed that because these receptors are overexposed in tumors, that receptor binding may be in favor of the cancer cells. ANG1005mechanism ==Clinical trials== In 2008, two phase I clinical trials of paclitaxel trevatide were started; one in patients with advanced cancer and brain metastases, and another in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Favorable initial tolerability results in brain cancer were reported in March 2009. and more in October 2009 and updated in June 2010. (paid subscription required) In 2014, paclitaxel trevatide received orphan drug designation from FDA for the treatment of glioblastoma multiform As of January 2016, Angiochem has conducted phase II trials for the treatment of breast cancer with brain metastasis, glioblastoma, and high-grade glioma. Results from the phase II trial in patients with breast cancer and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, a fatal form of brain metastasis, were presented at ASCO in 2016. ==References* Category:Experimental cancer drugs Category:Taxanes ","title":"Paclitaxel trevatide"},{"id":"20426267","text":"Harish Manwani (born 1953) was the global Chief operating officer of Unilever.

When he was three his father, Valentino, emigrated to Canada where he died in a mining accident in 1913 when aged 29. Cassin left school at the age of 12 to work for a blacksmith. In 1926, when 17, he moved to Lecco where he found employment at a steel plant. His first love was boxing, but he soon became fascinated by the mountains that tower over Lake Como and Lake Garda.Riccardo Cassin . The Telegraph. 10 August 2009.

In 1934, he made the first ascent of the Piccolissima of the Tre Cime di Lavaredo. In 1935, after having repeated Emilio Comici's route on the north-west face of the Civetta, he climbed the south-eastern ridge of the Trieste Tower and, with Vittorio Ratti, established a new route on the north face of Cima Ovest di Lavaredo.Claire Engel (1971) Mountaineering in the Alps, London: George Allen and Unwin, p. 247 In 1937, Cassin made his first climb on the granite of the Western Alps. Over the course of three days, 14–16 July, he made the first ascent of the north-east face of Piz Badile in the Val Bregaglia (Bergell), Switzerland, accompanied by Ratti and Gino Esposito after they teamed up with M. Molteni and G. Valsecchi, the latter two of whom died of exhaustion and exposure on the descent.Robin G. Collomb, Bregaglia West, Goring: West Col Productions, 1984, p. 98. In 1987 the 78-year-old Cassin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of his first ascent by again ascending the north-east face. This route is known today as the Cassin Route or the Via Cassin. He confirmed his extraordinary mountaineering skills 50 years later by climbing this route again at the age of 78. The north face of the Grandes Jorasses. The Walker Spur is the buttress (centre left) leading to the highest summit. Perhaps his most celebrated first ascent was of the Walker Spur on the north face of the Grandes Jorasses in the Mont Blanc massif on 4–6 August 1938 with Esposito and Ugo Tizzoni.

Burkhardt (1994) The High Mountains of the Alps, London: Diadem, p. 190, According to Claire Engel: In 1939, together with Tizzoni, Cassin made the first ascent of a steep line on the north face of the Aiguille de Leschaux. Cassin was one of the leading mountaineers of the inter-war period. In all, Cassin made a total of 2,500 ascents, of which over 100 were first ascents.Cassin 100th birthday celebrations.

On 26 April 1945, when he was chief partisan, both he and Ratti (who had accompanied him on several first ascents) attempted to stop a group of German soldiers from escaping to the Valtellina and St Moritz, and Ratti was shot dead. Cassin was decorated for his actions in the partisan campaign during the years 1943–45. ==Expedition leader== Gasherbrum IV Cassin was supposed to have been on the Italian expedition that made the first ascent of K2 in the Karakoram in 1954, but Ardito Desio, the chief expedition leader for the Italian Alpine Club, preferred not to have Cassin participate. According to Cassin himself: Following this experience, Cassin concentrated on organizing and leading expeditions himself, including the first ascent of Gasherbrum IV in the Karakorum Range by Walter Bonatti and Carlo Mauri on 6 August 1958 and an expedition that climbed Jirishanca in the Andes in 1969. In 1961, Cassin was both leader of and a successful ascentionist on the expedition that made the first ascent of the eponymous Cassin Ridge on Mount McKinley in Alaska, at that date the most technical route on the mountain. After this ascent, President Kennedy sent Cassin a telegram of congratulations and, had the Bay of Pigs crisis not intervened, he was scheduled to meet Cassin. In 1975, Cassin led an expedition to the then-unclimbed south face of Lhotse in the Himalaya, but this attempt was unsuccessful as a result of bad weather. 50-cm Cassin ice hammer ==Mountaineering equipment== Cassin began designing and producing mountaineering equipment in Lecco in 1947 when he produced his first rock pitons.

It is the final volume in Howells's \\"Altrurian trilogy,\\" following A Traveler from Altruria (1894) and Letters of an Altrurian Traveler (1904).William Dean Howells, The Altrurian Romances, Clara Kirk and Rudolf Kirk, eds.; Bloomington, IN, Indiana University Press, 1968. Like the second book in the trilogy, Howells casts the third and final book in the form of an epistolary novel — a form favored by some other Utopian and dystopian writers. (For examples, see: The Republic of the Future; Caesar's Column.) In the final book, Aristides Homos, Howells's Altrurian protagonist, writes a series of letters home to his friend Cyril. Homos is now located in the densely urban environment of New York City, where he confronts the contrasts between America c. 1900 and his own pastoral and agrarian Utopianism in their most extreme forms. The dramatic center of the book is the love affair between Homos and Evelith Strange, a wealthy widow of the American plutocracy. Evelith has chosen the life of a socialite because she is frustrated by the limited effects of \\"good works\\" — though her routine of idleness conflicts with her Christian values and her conscience. Evelith must decide whether to abandon her social position and her fortune to follow Homos back to Altruria. Eventually, Evelith marries Homos, and both she and her mother return with him to Altruria. Curiously, the mother-in-law finds the adjustment relatively easy, since she realizes that she has returned to the simpler life she knew in her youth. Howells gives the moral writings of Leo Tolstoy an important role in the bookJean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America 1886-1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh University Press, 1984; pp. 64-9. — though not with naive acceptance. At one point, Evelith tells Homos that \\"Tolstoy himself doesn't destroy his money, though he wants other people to do it. His wife keeps it and supports the family.\\" The story also includes Homos's travels abroad, and his commentaries on the societies he visits. ==References External links == * Through the Eye of the Needle at Project Gutenberg Category:Utopian novels Category:1907 American novels Category:1907 science fiction novels Category:Epistolary novels Category:Works by William Dean Howells Category:Harper & Brothers books ","title":"Through the Eye of the Needle"},{"id":"20426398","text":"Number Ten is the tenth studio album released by Guy Manning. == Track listing == # Ships (05:34) # The Final Chapter (07:44) # An Ordinary Day (06:03) # Bloody Holiday!

The contrast of white and black (light and darkness, day and night) has a long tradition of metaphorical usage, traceable to the Ancient Near East, and explicitly in the Pythagorean Table of Opposites. In Western culture as well as in Confucianism, the contrast symbolizes the moral dichotomy of good and evil. == Description == Day, light, and good are often linked together, in opposition to night, darkness, and evil. These contrasting metaphors may go back as far as human history, and appear in many cultures, including both the ancient Chinese and the ancient Persians. The philosophy of neoplatonism is strongly imbued with the metaphor of goodness as light.Rudolf Arnheim. (1974). Art and visual perception. Univ of California Press. \\"The Symbolism of Light\\" (pp. 324-5) == Examples  Religion and mythology === * The Genesis creation narrative has God \\"separate light from darkness\\" on the First Day. *The Bible associates light with God, truth, and virtue; darkness is associated with sin and the Devil. Painters such as Rembrandt portrayed divine light illuminating an otherwise dark world. *War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness, part of the Dead Sea Scrolls. *The underworld (Hades, Tartarus) was imagined as a chthonic place of darkness, contrasting with the celestial realm of the gods. Christian notions of heaven and hell inherit this conception, as do the \\"dark angels\\" vs. the unfallen angels, often with aureola (halos), in Christian mythology. *Day and night are personified as deities in various mythologies (e.g. Norse Dagr and Nótt, Greek Hemera and Nyx, et cetera). === Dress === * White often represents purity or innocence in Western culture, particularly as white clothing or objects can be stained easily. In most Western countries white is the color worn by brides at weddings. Angels are typically depicted as clothed in white robes. **In many Hollywood Westerns, bad cowboys wear black hats while the good ones wear white. **Melodrama villains are dressed in black and heroines in white dresses. **This can be reversed as a deliberate play on conventions, by having the evil character dress in white, as a symbol of their hypocrisy or arrogance. For example, Don Fanucci in The Godfather, Part II is an evil character, but wears an expensive all-white suit as a sign of his esteem, power and prestige. Sometimes protagonists can wear black too, as in Return of the Jedi, wherein Luke Skywalker wears black during the final battle. This may symbolize the danger of Luke turning to the dark side, but once he has prevailed (in the scene where he removes Darth Vader's helmet), his jacket has opened up to reveal that it has a lighter color in the inside, as if to indicate that Luke \\"on the inside\\" was always good. Darth Vader himself, while still in the grip of the dark side, dresses all in black and may be regarded as a science fiction version of a Dark Knight. The chief antagonist of the Star Wars franchise, the evil Emperor Palpatine, wears a black cloak. **In computer security, a black hat is an attacker with evil intentions, while a white hat bears no such ill will. (This is derived from the Western movie convention.) === Magic === * Healing or \\"good\\" paranormal magic is called White magic. Black magic is a destructive or evil form of magic. ** A Treatise on White Magic is a book by Alice Bailey, a Theosophist.Bailey, Alice A. A Treatise on White Magic New York: 1934 Lucis Publishing Co. ** White witch. ** Evil witches are stereotypically dressed in black and good fairies in white. === In popular culture === * The topos of \\"light and darkness\\" is also reflected in numerous titles in popular culture, such as Heart of Darkness (1899), Light in My Darkness (1927), Darkness and the Light (1942), Creatures of Light and Darkness (1969), From Darkness to Light (1973), Darkness and Light (1989), The Lord of the Light and of the Darkness (1993), the Star Trek: Deep Space 9 episode \\"The Darkness and the Light\\" (1997), the Babylon 5 episode \\"Between the Darkness and the Light\\" (1997), and Out of the Darkness, Into the Light (1998). * In works of fantasy fiction, the main antagonist is often called a \\"Dark Lord\\", for example Sauron in The Lord of the Rings. * The space-opera franchise Star Wars also depicts Light and Dark aspects in the form of the fictional energy field called The Force where there are two sides, light side and dark side wherein the protagonists, the Jedi practice and propagate the use of the former and the antagonists, the Sith use the latter. * George Orwell makes a bitterly ironic use of the \\"light and darkness\\" topos in his Nineteen Eighty Four. In the early part of the book the protagonist gets a promise that \\"We will meet in the place where there is no darkness\\" – which he interprets as referring to a place where the oppressive totalitarian state does not rule. But the man who made the promise was in fact an agent of the Thought Police – and they eventually meet as prisoner and interrogator where there is indeed no darkness, in detention cells where the light remains on permanently, day and night, as an additional means of torturing detainees. * The Dark Crystal explains the two split halves of a balanced whole, reflecting the impossibility of acknowledging any metaphorical divine balance without the combination of both the light(the Mystics) and the dark(the Skesis). === Other examples === * The Dark Ages vs. the Age of Enlightenment. * \\"Black and white thinking\\" is the false dichotomy of assuming anything not good is evil and vice versa. * Freemasonry has a black-and-white checkerboard as a central symbol within the lodge and all rituals occur on or around this checkerboard. Also known as a Mosaic Pavement, it represents the floor of King Solomon's Temple and according to Shakespeare, represents man's natural duality. ==See also== * Black and white thinking * Dialectics of Nature * Fantasy tropes and conventions * Table of Opposites ==References== *Armin Lange, Eric M.

The book is about Mr and Mrs Nutmouse (the eponymous Tumtum and Nutmeg) who live in Nutmouse Hall, situated within the broom cupboard of Rose Cottage. It was first published in January 2008. The other books in the series include The Great Escape, The Pirates' Treasure, A Christmas Adventure, A Seaside Adventure, A Circus Adventure and Trouble at Rose Cottage. ==Tumtum and Nutmeg== Mr and Mrs Nutmouse (respectively: Tumtum and Nutmeg) live in Nutmouse Hall a grand house (for mice) secreted within the broom cupboard of Rose Cottage. Rose Cottage is the home of a human family: Mr Walter Mildew and his children, Arthur and Lucy. Mr Mildew is an inventor and is struggling to maintain the family while he develops his latest invention, a mechanical mouse that cleans. Due to their father's absent-mindedness and financial situation, Rose Cottage is in poor repair and Arthur and Lucy wear threadbare clothes and are frequently hungry. Nutmeg begins, with Tumtum's help, to help take care of the children. Using the cover of \\"Nutmeg, a Fairy of Sorts\\", Nutmeg cleans the attic in which the children sleep and mends their clothes while Tumtum makes repairs to both the room and the children's toys. The children repay Nutmeg's kindness by leaving treats for them in the doll's house. Things change when Aunt Ivy comes to stay while her home in Scotland is being fumigated for mice (which she hates). After a chance sighting of Tumtum and Nutmeg, Ivy poisons Tumtum (though not fatally) and makes plans to gas Nutmouse Hall. In desperation Nutmeg enlists the help of General Marchmouse, a recently retired member of the mouse army. Marchmouse, with much unacknowledged help from Nutmeg, formulates a plan to drive Ivy from the house via a massed charge of the village mice. ==Characters== *Tumtum (Mr Nutmouse) - A rotund mouse, owner of Nutmouse Hall.Official Egmont Character Profile *Nutmeg (Mrs Nutmouse) - Wife of Tumtum, Nutmeg secretly takes care of the Mildew children who think of her as a \\"Fairy of Sorts\\". *Walter Mildew - Owner of Rose Cottage.

Seymour's parents have split and are arguing over custody of him. After a drunken threat by Seymour's father to take him away interstate, his mother has Seymour relocated to Thelma's house on Victoria Road. Where Seymour is bored and lonely. During the day, while Thelma is at work, Seymour is not allowed to open the door, or leave the house, because of his mother's fear that his father might come and find him. However one morning Seymour decides to climb over the back gate and walk to the nearby shops. He goes to a park where a group of children tease him. Not knowing how to defend himself, Seymour runs away and is chased. In desperation he goes through a random gate and meets a young girl: Angie. Angie is described as in her late teens, and as a beautiful angel. Seymour is drawn to Angie because she treats him with the affection and friendliness that he lacks from his parents.

One day Seymour finds Angie in her flat looking sick and acting \\"peculiar\\". He calls her sister Lynne. Lynne comes over and after looking at Angie with disdain, rings her father who drives up and takes Angie away. Lynne advises Seymour to keep away from Angie and that he is wasting his time. Nonetheless Seymour resolves to go to Angie's flat and clean it for when she comes home. He discovers that it has already been cleaned and almost everything is packed away. Lynne finds Seymour in the flat and tells him that Angie won't be coming back, and that Angie has been taking drugs for nearly five years. Angie is going to Rankin House, a rehabilitation center temporarily, then to Lakeview. Seymour visits Angie to give her the doll that was left at the flat. After initially being hostile Angie pretends that she has been sick with pleurisy and will be back soon. They begin to fight, but Seymour, weary of her lying, returns the doll and leaves. Angie apologises to Seymour through a letter and writes about the rehab, and how when her baby is born they will go to live with her parents. In the postscript there is Seymour's reply. He describes Carrucan, where he and his mother have moved to, and that his father visited him and got a job as a truck driver. Seymour talks about how he has made a friend called Martin, is finally learning how to swim and that when Angie gets out of Lakeview they can go out to places together with her baby. ==Characters== Seymour Kerley is eleven years old and the self-conscious and reserved main character.

Excavations in the area represent one of the more sensitive areas of all archaeological excavations in Jerusalem. The first were undertaken by the British Royal Engineers in the 1860s in the Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem and subsequently the PEF Survey of Palestine. Since Israel took control of the Old City in 1967, archaeological excavations in the vicinity of the Mount have been undertaken by Israel and the Jordanian/Palestinian-led Jerusalem Islamic Waqf. Both excavations have been controversial and criticized. Israeli and Jewish groups have criticized excavations conducted by the Waqf, the Muslim authority in charge of the Al- Aqsa Mosque. ==History== Due to the extreme political sensitivity of the site, few archaeological excavations have been conducted on the Temple Mount itself. Protests commonly occur whenever archaeologists conduct projects on or near the Mount. Plan of The Noble Sanctuary (Haram al-Sharif) from \\"The survey of Western Palestine-Jerusalem\\" by Charles Warren Aside from visual observation of surface features, most other archaeological knowledge of the site comes from the 19th century survey carried out by Charles Wilson (Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem) and Charles Warren (PEF Survey of Palestine). Warren was one of the first to excavate this area, exemplifying a new era of Biblical archaeology in the 1870s. His exploration was under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund, a society with a relationship with the Corps of Royal Engineers. The group was conducting a study and survey of the Levant region, also known as Palestine.https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Archaeologists-reveal-shocking- stories-of-their-past-441958, ARCHAEOLOGISTS REVEAL SHOCKING STORIES OF THEIR PAST Warren and his team improved the topographic map of Jerusalem and discovered the ancient water systems that lay beneath the city of Jerusalem. They also made the first excavations of Tell es-Sultan, site of biblical city of Jericho. Between 1938–1942, R.W. Hamilton, director of the British Mandate Antiquities Department, carried out the only archaeological excavation ever undertaken at the Temple Mount's Aqsa Mosque by the British Mandate, the excavations show a Byzantine mosaic floor underneath the mosque that was likely the remains of a church or a monastery.LEFKOVITS, ETGAR. Was the Aksa Mosque built over the remains of a Byzantine church? The Jerusalem Post. November 2008. () In addition to the Byzantine mosaic, R.W. Hamilton also found a paving slab in the floor bearing the image of a centaur, dated to the 3rd century CE. It is believed this tile may be related to pagan religious construction on the Temple Mount during the Roman Period (135–325 CE). File:Roman_Centaur_Tile_of_Al-Aqsa_Mosque.jpg3rd-century Roman relief of a centaur reused as a paving stone inside Al-Aqsa Mosque. ==Post-1967== In 1967 the Religious Affairs Ministry began an unlicensed excavation. Starting at the Western Wall Plaza, workers dug northward, under the Old City's Muslim Quarter.The end of days, Gershom Gorenberg Beginning in 1968, Israeli archaeologists began excavations at the foot of the Temple Mount, immediately south of the al-Aqsa Mosque, uncovering Roman, Umayyad and Crusader remains.Jacqueline Schaalje, Special: The Temple Mount in Jerusalem . In 1970, Israeli authorities commenced intensive excavations to the south and west of the compound. Over the period 1970–1988, the Israeli authorities excavated a tunnel passing along the western wall of the Temple Mount, northwards from the prayer plaza of the Western Wall, that became known as the Western Wall Tunnel. They sometimes used mechanical excavators under the supervision of archaeologists. Palestinians claim that both of these have caused cracks and structural weakening of the buildings in the Muslim Quarter of the city above. Israelis confirmed this danger: :\\"The Moslem authorities were concerned about the ministry tunnel along the Temple Mount wall, and not without cause. Two incidents during the Mazar dig along the southern wall had sounded alarm bells. Technion engineers had already measured a slight movement in part of the southern wall during the excavations...There was no penetration of the Mount itself or danger to holy places, but midway in the tunnel's progress large cracks appeared in one of the residential buildings in the Moslem Quarter, 12 meters above the excavation. The dig was halted until steel buttresses secured the building.\\" In an article published in the Egyptian Al- Ahram Weekly in 2007, Palestinian journalist Khaled Amayreh listed Israeli encroachments on the Al-Aqsa Mosque: In 1977, digging continued and a large ancient tunnel was opened below the women's prayer area. A further tunnel was unearthed under the mosque, going from east to west, in 1979. In addition, in March 1984 the Archaeological Department of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque, endangering the Islamic \\"Majlis\\" or council building.Dan Izenberg, Jerusalem Post, July 19, 1991 Israeli archaeologist Israel Finkelstein, however, asserts that \\"Palestinian accusations ... that tunnels are being dug under the Al-Aqsa Mosque in order to undermine its foundations, are false. The closest excavation to the mosque is some 70 meters to its south\\". In 1981, Yehuda Meir Getz, rabbi of the Western Wall, had workmen clear the debris from the gateway of the ancient Warren's Gate. There were allegations the intention of this excavation was to access the innards of the Temple Mount itself from the Western Wall Tunnel. Arabs on the Mount heard banging from one of the more than two dozen cisterns on the Mount. Israeli Government officials, upon being notified of the unauthorized breach, immediately ordered Warren's Gate sealed. The 2,000-year-old stone gate was filled with cement, and remains cemented shut today.Abraham Rabinovich, Tunnel vision. Archaeologist Léon Pressouyre, a UNESCO envoy who visited the site in 1998 and claims to have been prevented from meeting Israeli officials (in his own words, \\"Mr Avi Shoket, Israel's permanent delegate to UNESCO, had repeatedly opposed my mission and, when I expressed the wish to meet with his successor, Uri Gabay, I was denied an appointment\\"),Omayma Abdel-Latif, \\"Revoking the death warrant\\" accuses the Israeli government of culpably neglecting to protect the Islamic period buildings uncovered in Israeli excavations. Later, Prof. Oleg Grabar of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton replaced Leon Pressouyre as the UNESCO envoy to investigate the Israeli allegations that antiquities are being destroyed by the Waqf on the Temple Mount. Initially, Grabar was denied access to the buildings by Israel for over a year, allegedly due to the threat of violence resulting from the al-Aqsa Intifada. His eventual conclusion was that the monuments are deteriorating largely because of conflicts over who is responsible for them, the Jordanian government, the local Palestinian Authority or the Israeli government. ==1990sWestern Wall Tunnel (1996)=== Concrete supports in the tunnel. After the Six-Day War, the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Israel began the excavations aimed at exposing the continuation of the Western Wall. The excavations lasted almost twenty years and revealed many previously unknown facts about the history and geography of the Temple Mount. The tunnel exposes a total length of 500 m (a third of a mile) of the wall, revealing the methods of construction and the various activities in the vicinity of the Temple Mount. The excavations included many archaeological finds along the way, including discoveries from the Herodian period (streets, monumental masonry), sections of a reconstruction of the Western Wall dating to the Umayyad period, and various structures dating to the Ayyubid, Mamluk, and Hasmonean periods constructed to support buildings in the vicinity of the Temple Mount. Warren's Gate lies about into the tunnel. At the northern portion of the Western Wall, remains of a water channel, which originally supplied water to the Temple Mount, were found. The exact source of the channel is unknown, though it passes through an underground pool known as the Strouthion Pool. The water channel was dated to the Hasmonean period and was accordingly dubbed the Hasmonean Channel. The biggest stone in the Western Wall often called the Western Stone is also revealed within the tunnel and ranks as one of the heaviest objects ever lifted by human beings without powered machinery. The stone has a length of 41 feet (12.5 meters) and an estimated width between 11.5–15 ft (3.5–4.5 meters) Estimates place its weight at 550 metric tons. In 1996, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu opened the Western Wall Tunnel near the site.Violent clashes at key Jerusalem mosque on 'day of anger', The Times, accessdate=May 5, 2009Mayor halts Temple Mount dig, BBC, accessdate=May 5, 2009 Fueled by the allegation that the tunnel would undermine the Temple Mount, Palestinians protested. Consequently, gun battles in the West Bank and Gaza Strip killed 54 Palestinians and 14 Israeli soldiers. ===Construction at Solomon's Stables (1996–1999)=== In 1996 the Waqf began unauthorized construction in the structures known since Crusader times as Solomon's Stables, and in the Eastern Hulda Gate passageway, allowed the area to be (re)opened as a prayer space called the Marwani Musalla capable of accommodating 7,000 individuals. In 1997, the Western Hulda Gate passageway was converted into another mosque. According to The New York Times, an emergency exit had been urged upon the Waqf by the Israeli police. In 1999, the Waqf agreed on its necessity, which was also acknowledged by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). But the IAA criticized the Waqf's use of bulldozers, and said that salvation archaeology needed to be performed first.Romey, Kristin M. Jerusalem's Temple Mount Flap, Archaeology, Volume 53 Number 2, March/April 2000 Gabriel Barkay, an Israeli professor, said the construction demolished structures dating to the Twelfth Century Crusades, and went on without archaeological supervision. He said the construction used ancient stones from early Jewish buildings and used them to make modern ones.Temple Mount destruction stirred archaeologist to action, February 8, 2005. Michael McCormack, Baptist Press Israel Finkelstein has described the project as \\"the greatest devastation to have recently been inflicted on Jerusalem's archaeological heritage\\". In 2000, an Israeli high court rejected a petition to halt construction, saying the matter should be left to the Israeli government. Ehud Olmert, then mayor of Jerusalem, also criticized the construction. He ordered a halt to the construction, on grounds of archaeological damage, defying an Israeli government decision to allow excavations at the site. The Waqf rejected that Israel had any right to halt the construction. Formally, the Waqf does not recognize Israeli authority, though it had cooperated with Israel until the 1996 opening of Western Wall tunnel (see above). The Temple Mount Sifting Project is an archaeological project established in 2005 and dedicated to recovering archaeological artifacts from the 300 truckloads of topsoil removed from the Temple Mount by the Waqf during the construction of the underground el-Marwani Mosque from 1996–1999.\\"Temple Mount relics saved from garbage,\\" Etgar Lefkovits, The Jerusalem Post, April 14, 2005 By 2006, the project had recovered numerous artifacts dating from the 8th to 7th centuries BCE from dirt removed in 1999 by the Islamic Religious Trust (Waqf) from the Solomon's Stables area of the Temple Mount. These include stone weights for weighing silver and a First Temple period bulla, or seal impression, containing ancient Hebrew writing, which may have belonged to a well-known family of priests mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah. ==2000s== In Autumn 2002 a bulge of about 27 inches (70 cm) was reported in the southern retaining wall part of the Temple Mount. Archaeologists suspected Waqf excavations for a new mosque, using industrial diggers and heavy machinery, had weakened the stability of the southern Wall. It was feared that part of the wall could seriously deteriorate or even collapse. The Waqf would not permit detailed Israeli inspection but came to an agreement with Israel that led to a team of Jordanian engineers inspecting the wall in October. They recommended repair work that involved replacing or resetting most of the stones in the affected area, which covers 2,000 square feet (200 m2) and is located 25 feet (8 m) from the top of the wall.Esther Hecht, Battle of the Bulge Repairs were completed before January 2004. The restoration of 250 square meters of wall cost 100,000 Jordanian dinars ($140,000). On February 11, 2004, the eastern wall of the Temple Mount was damaged by an earthquake. The damage threatens to topple sections of the wall into the area known as Solomon's Stables. It is believed that on February 14, 2004, days after the earthquake, a winter storm destroyed the stone walkway leading from the Western Wall plaza to the Mughrabi Gate on the Temple Mount. Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO) condemned the \\"excavations carried out by the Israeli occupying authorities under the Aqsa Mosque\\" which they claimed caused the collapse of the path. In March 2005, the word \\"Allah\\" in foot-tall Arabic script was found newly carved into the ancient stones, an act viewed by Jews and archaeologists as vandalism. The 'graffiti' on their Holiest site caused great offence to Jews. The carving was attributed to the team of Jordanian engineers and Palestinian laborers in charge of strengthening that section of the wall. ===Mughrabi Gate ramp replaced by a bridge (February 2007)=== After a landslide in 2004 left the earthen ramp leading to the politically sensitive access point known as the Mughrabi Gate unsafe and in danger of collapse, the Israel Antiquities Authority started work on the construction of a temporary wooden pedestrian pathway to the Temple Mount. Muslim officials accused Israel of designs on the foundations of Al Aqsa mosque. Ismail Haniya—then Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas leader—called on Palestinians to unite to protest the excavations, while Fatah said they would end their ceasefire with Israel. The excavations provoked anger throughout the Islamic world. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia called on the international community to stop the dig: \\"Israel's actions violate the mosque's sacred nature and risk destroying its religious and Islamic features.\\" Syria condemned Israel's excavations, saying they \\"pose a threat against the Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem.\\" Malaysia condemned Israel for the excavation works around and beneath the Al-Aqsa Mosque and for willfully destroying religious, cultural and heritage sites.Press Statement by the Honourable Dato' Seri Syed Hamid Albar, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Malaysia, February 9, 2007 King Abdullah II of Jordan \\"strongly condemned the Israeli actions against worshipers at Al Aqsa Mosque, stressing that Jordan would continue its contacts with the Arab and Islamic worlds and the international community to halt Israel's excavation work in the area\\". The secretary-general of the 57-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference, Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, expressed his anguish and dismay at the world's silence on Israel's \\"blatant moves to Judaize Jerusalem and change the holy city's historic character.\\" He said \\"the excavation work being carried out by Israel constituted the gravest threat ever to one of Islam's three holiest mosques\\" Israel denied all charges, calling them \\"ludicrous\\". As a result of the furor, Israeli authorities installed cameras to film excavation work being carried out near the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The footage was broadcast live on the Internet, in an attempt to ease widespread anger in the Muslim world. A March 2007 UNESCO report on the incident cleared the Israeli team of wrongdoing, saying that the excavations \\"concern areas external to the Western Wall and are limited to the surface of the pathway and its northern side ... [N]o work is being conducted inside the Haram es-Sharif, nor may the nature of the works underway be reported, at this stage, as constituting a threat to the stability of the Western Wall and the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The work area ends at approximately 10 metres distance from the Western Wall. It is conducted with light equipment, picks and shovels, and it is supervised and documented according to professional standards.\\" The report nonetheless advised the cessation of work, as the aims of gathering information had been met, and consultation with concerned parties. On March 20, 2007 the Turkish Government sent a technical team to inspect and report on the excavations to the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. ===Electrical cable replacement (July 2007)=== In July 2007 the Waqf began digging a 400-metre-long, 1.5-metre-deep trench from the northern side of the Temple Mount compound to the Dome of the Rock in order to replace 40-year-old electric cables in the area. The dig, carried out by the Jerusalem Electricity Company, was approved by the Israeli police, but the Israel Antiquities Authority declined to comment whether it had approved the excavations. Israeli archaeologists accused the Waqf of a deliberate act of cultural vandalism. The Committee for the Prevention of Destruction of Antiquities on the Temple Mount criticized the use of a tractor for excavation at the Temple Mount \\"without real, professional and careful archaeological supervision involving meticulous documentation\\". Archaeologist Eilat Mazar said: “There is disappointment at the turning of a blind eye and the ongoing contempt for the tremendous archaeological importance of the Temple Mount ...\\", \\"... Using heavy machinery and with little documentation, can damage ancient relics and erase evidence of the presence of the biblical structures. Any excavation, even if for technical reasons, must be documented, photographed and the dirt sifted for any remains of relics.\\" Dr. Gavriel Barkai slammed the way the excavations were being carried out stating that \\"They should be using a toothbrush, not a bulldozer\\". He maintains that \\"some man-worked stones have been found in the trench ... as well as remnants of a wall that, according to all our estimations, are from a structure in one of the outer courtyards in the Holy Temple.\\" Archaeologist Zachi Zweig said a tractor used to dig the trench damaged the foundation of a 7-yard-wide wall \\"that might have been a remnant of the Second Temple.\\" The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Muhammad Ahmad Hussein, rejected the Israeli charges. \\"We don't harm the antiquities, we are the ones who are taking care of the antiquities, unlike others who destroy them.\\" Yusuf Natsheh of the Islamic Waqf dismissed the claims, saying \\"the area has been dug many times\\" and argued that \\"remains unearthed would be from the 16th or 17th century Ottoman period\\". He said that the work was urgently needed to maintain the al-Aqsa compound as an important religious institution. \\"We regret some Israeli groups try to use archaeology to achieve political ends, but their rules of archaeology do not apply to the Haram; it is a living religious site in an occupied land.\\" In September 2007, the Orthodox Union condemned Waqf Excavations on the Temple Mount. The Anti- Defamation League's Abraham Foxman said work on the Temple Mount must stop immediately. \\"We are especially concerned because there is a history of Muslim religious leaders treating Israeli religious and cultural artifacts on the Temple Mount, not to mention the Jewish connection to Jerusalem, with contempt\\". ==Finds== In 2007, artifacts dating to the eighth to sixth centuries BCE were described as being possibly the first physical evidence of human activity at the Temple Mount during the First Temple period. The findings included animal bones; ceramic bowl rims, bases, and body sherds; the base of a juglet used to pour oil; the handle of a small juglet; and the rim of a storage jar.Milstein, Mati.

It flew visual and photographic reconnaissance missions to provide intelligence for ground and air units. It was again designated the 69th Reconnaissance Group in June 1945. The group returned to the United States in July and August 1945. There it trained with F-6 Mustangs and Douglas A-26 Invader aircraft. The group was inactivated on 29 July 1946.

It is a popular sandwich in the Western Cape province, with many fast food and take-out restaurants, stores and food stands purveying them. One large sandwich may be shared among several people. The Gatsby is also sometimes mistakenly referred to by the nickname AK47, which is a variant of the sandwich made in Johannesburg, in part due to how it can be held in one's arm in a similar manner to the firearm. It has been described as a \\"filling, budget meal\\", a standard menu item in Cape Town corner stores, and as a significant part of the heritage and a cultural symbol of Cape Flats, where it originated. Gatsby usually consist of long bread rolls cut lengthwise and opened up to form a sort of cradle which is filled with various fillings. While the choice of filling in a Gatsby varies widely depending on customer preference and vendor, one standard item is usually hot chips, i.e., French fries or slap chips (French fries with vinegar). Hot dog buns and roti flat bread are sometimes used, and it is typically prepared using a sauce, most commonly achar or piri piri. They are typically a large- sized sandwich, and have been described as suitable for sharing among several people. Different varieties of Gatsbys use meat ingredients such as chargrilled steak, masala steak, fresh or pickled fish, calamari, chicken, polony, curry, Vienna sausage, Russian sausage and eggs. ==History== Athlone celebrating the area as the \\"Home of the Gatsby\\". The Gatsby sandwich originated in the Cape Flats area of Cape Town, where Athlone shop owner Rashaad Pandy was renovating a new location. He wanted to serve a quick but filling meal to his hired help, so he put South-African-style French fries known colloquially as \\"slap chips,\\" polony and achaar in a large round of bread and cut this into wedges. One of the workers, a gentleman who went by the moniker Froggy, upon tasting a piece of this sandwich, called it a \\"Gatsby smash,\\" after the 1974 movie, The Great Gatsby, which had been shown recently at an Athlone cinema. The name stuck and Pandy subsequently offered the sandwich in the shop. It immediately became popular with locals. As the popularity grew, he contracted with a local bakery to provide a longer, French-style roll for the sandwich. This is ultimately the form which became hugely popular and eventually became one of South Africa's most well-known fast-foods. Though nowadays the Gatsby takes on all shapes, combinations and sizes ensuring that you stay filled for less with the most popular being a fresh foot long sandwich with French fries (also known as slap chips in Cape Town) with the choice of polony, Vienna, Russian, chicken, fish or steak. As the Gatsby is a large, filling and cheap meal this practice has carried on in modern times with the Gatsby purveyed in full, half and quarter sizes. This practice of combining various combinations of food in a singular meal became popular all around Cape Town and continues to grow in popularity even amongst the wealthier patrons.

Whilst on the phone he spots a woman shoplifting and meets her in the bathroom where they have sex and she steals his wallet. In an attempt to follow her to recover his belongings his car is shot at, and, when he pulls over to inspect the damage, a man with a rifle and dog appears and shoots him in the leg. He manages to get back into his car but he only gets so far until he discovers the road is blocked by a bulldozer and fallen tree. Leaving the car in an attempt to get a signal for his phone to call for help he hears a rumbling back at the road where he left his car and promptly drives back the way he came, only to run over his apparent pursuer. Shortly after his car breaks down and he leaves for the woods where he meets Bea, the woman from the petrol station, who seems to be lost as well and denies having stolen Quim's wallet. One of her car tires has suffered a puncture which Quim reveals was actually caused by a gunshot. They rush to repair the tire and Quim suddenly becomes panicked and they drive off. They drive past Quim's car and see that it has been severely vandalised. The two continue driving until they come across an abandoned roadside café. After they break in and search for supplies they are met by a pair of policemen who are highly suspicious and violently subdue and question them. They do not believe Quim but once he reveals he has run one of the attackers over they agree to take them back to the body to check on his story. After they reach the body Quim is handcuffed to the car and the police investigate the body. The two police officers are fired upon and seemingly killed. After a tense moment hiding in the car Bea manages to leave and find a key to unlock Quim's handcuffs. They leave and run through the forest but one of the police officers has survived with a minor gunshot wound to the shoulder. He is still highly suspicious of the two thinking that they had something to do with the snipers. The trio run away through the forest, but upon reaching a particularly hazardous river they are shot at once again and the other police officer is killed soon after. Quim and Bea take shelter for the night, with Quim making attempts to find out about Bea but she brushes him off, before being hunted once again in the morning by their pursuers. Bea takes a bullet to her shoulder and they both end up trapped in a large pit unable to climb out. With Bea's help Quim manages to get out but as he looks for a stick to help her he hears barking, panics and runs. After getting a fair distance away he changes his mind and begins to run back but before he gets back he hears a gunshot. As they make their way up a gulley and Quim, their pursuers drawing closer, chooses to abandon her to her fate. With Bea weeping and trapped in the gulley the hunters are finally revealed to be a pair of young boys who proceed to murder her. They are casual about it, with one remarking at how her blood splattered his companion's face and taking a picture of the body with a mobile phone. The film then switches to the viewpoint of the hunters as they track Quim through the forest. Quim flees alone, his hunters reveling in the sport. Eventually they come across a barn and stop for a break. When one of the boys starts adding points for a deer he had killed earlier the other becomes annoyed and accuses him of changing the rules to suit himself. They have an argument and it is revealed they are brothers, during this Quim manages to lock them in the barn and escape. Quim escapes to an abandoned village, the two brothers catch up with him and a tense game of cat-and-mouse ensues, but he manages to ambush and kill one of the boys by hiding in a pool of water, showing deep regret afterwards. The other brother approaches Quim, weeping and angry after his brothers death, and thrusts his gun at him, but Quim embraces him, only to have the boy struggle free and shoot himself off-camera. Quim weeps by the brother's bodies, thrusting his hands to the heavens as though in prayer, with the boy's dog that had allowed them to track Quim and his companions appearing soon afterwards and Quim putting a hand wearily to his head before the credits roll. ==Cast== *Leonardo Sbaraglia as Quim *María Valverde as Bea *Thomas Riordan as Hermano Menor *Andrés Juste as Hermano Mayor *Pablo Menasanch as Guardia Joven *Francisco Olmo as Guardia Mayor *Manuel Sánchez Ramos as Empleado Gasolinera *Michael De La Torre as Quim - English Language Dubbing ==Release== The film had its North America premiere on 8 September 2007 as part of the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival and was released as King of the Hill by the Weinstein Company.'The Mummy' Revived Over at Dimension as Low Budget Fare ==References External links == * Category:2007 films Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish-language films Category:2007 thriller films Category:Telecinco Cinema films Category:Films set in abandoned houses Category:Films shot in Spain Category:Spanish thriller films ","title":"The King of the Mountain (film)"},{"id":"20426870","text":"Estella Louisa Michaela Canziani (12 January 1887 – 23 August 1964) was a British portrait and landscape painter, an interior decorator and a travel writer and folklorist. == Life and works == Bookplate of Estella Canziani Born in London, Estella Canziani was the daughter of the painter Louisa Starr and Enrico Canziani (1848–1931), an Italian civil engineer.

On returning to the Netherlands when peace came in 1945, he found his four brothers had been killed by the Germans. ==Palmarès== ;1934 : 2nd Berlin six-day ;1936 :3rd Ronde van Valkenburg :1st Amsterdam six-day :2nd Ghent six-day :1st Copenhagen six-day ;1937 :1st Antwerp six-day :World hour record :1st Copenhagen six-day ;1938 :1st Ghent six-day :2nd Antwerp six-day ;1939 :1st Brussels six-day :3rd Copenhagen six-day ;1944 :1st Buenos Aires six-day ==References Category:1912 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Dutch male cyclists Category:Dutch track cyclists Category:People from Waalwijk Category:Sportspeople from North Brabant ","title":"Frans Slaats"},{"id":"20426949","text":"Zoé Kézako is a French animated television series, adapted from Véronique Saüquère's book series published by Frimousse. The first season was produced by Corinne Kouper at Sparkling; the second season was produced at TeamTO. Zoe Kezako aired on Nick Jr in the United States on March 3, 2006 and ended on February 21, 2014 This second season is currently airing in France on TF1 and Télétoon.

Zoé Kézako the TV series features the adventures of this irresistible little girl, with stacks of humor and piles of energy. The fruit of Véronique Saüquère's imagination. Just like all kids her age (7 and three quarters), Zoé asks herself many questions and is not always sure how to act in certain situations. Nothing could be more natural - after all, the one thing she doesn’t have is... experience! From one episode to the next, Zoé gains vital experience for daily life. Each individual story is a slice of livingness, a portion of knowledge we all need to get a grasp of the world and the people around us. The understanding that helps us grow up, just at the right speed. Until, one fine day, we suddenly realize that: Life is a big heap of fun! ==CharactersMain characters=== * Zoé Kézako: 7 ¾ years old, Zoé hates anything that gets in the way of her daily routine or that disturbs her countless capricious moods. Indeed, this is the age where anything that is not your own, doesn’t concern you or revolve around you should just not exist: her two best friends are now spending far too much time together, strangers walk in during her favourite television show, etc. And, unlike other children, Zoé expresses it! She is straightforward and without any hang-ups, right up there with the greats, such as Calvin (from Calvin and Hobbes), Zazie or Mafalda. She wants it all! Like many kids her age, Zoé is going through her “center of the world” phase. * Mariponpon Glutton: Mariponpon is more than just a “greedy piggy”! Mariponpon is as easy going and care free as Zoé is pestering. She isn’t very hard-to-please: she’ll go where it's bright and shiny (an ice-cream stand, a merry-go-round, etc.). She finds everything and everyone positively delightful. She is very reconciling, so much so that she doesn’t even know there's a problem in the first place. In fact, she has no opinion of her own. Everything's just “fine and dandy”, ALL the time! The only time she ever gets mad is if she's going along with Zoé, or because Zoé has pushed her over the edge. In other words, the rare times she loses it, she does so unwillingly. * Tony Dingo: Tony is the local clown; he also happens to be Zoé's neighbour. This kind-hearted loony who’ll do anything to annoy people (he tangles himself up in other people's jump-ropes on purpose, throws papier-mâché balls in class, etc.). Sometimes, even in his sleep, he happens to break stuff lying next to him. He's completely unruly. Tony's got a deep sway in his walk and he wears a hat and overalls filled with holes. He's always in good spirits and bursting with energy. Left to his own devices, he's insolent and a little edgy, bur deeply human. At times he can show signs of kindness and generosity, but he quickly finds himself back his craziness. In a word, Tony is totally going through “the dumb age”. * Super Duper: Born in a distant country populated with kangaroos, he is the new star of the school. He is constantly glued to his speaker tuned to his favourite radio station, and always saying hype expressions like “you crack me up, dude”. He's always got the latest clothes, the coolest gadgets, amazing roller-blades, not to mention his delicious British-sounding accent. Awesome! To make matters worse, he's often trailing Zoé. That's because he's CRRRazy about Melina (who, on the other hand, couldn’t give a damn about him), who spends every Wednesday afternoon at Zoé's house in account of the fact that her mom has asked Zoé's mom to give her extra French lessons! * Melina : All Melina ever thinks about is African dancing and setting the most sadistic of traps for everyone, in conjunction with Zoé!! And yet she is quite obviously the most gifted pupil in the class, which explains why everybody (parents, teachers and, basically, anyone in their right mind!) is convinced she is a future candidate for the most exclusive of universities. Melina is a mystery to everyone who knows her! Despite being extremely smart and first in class without lifting a single finger, Melina loooves picking her nose, sticking whoopee cushions on the teacher's chair or devising the craziest of traps, with the purpose of ridiculing anyone and everyone around her! Even Zoé sometimes thinks she goes too far! * Jeny : Tightly fitted up to the neck and over-accessorized, and overwhelmed by her adoration for the terrible singer Gino, Jeny walks around listening to her walkman and carrying her flashy notebooks. However, Jeny does not belong to Zoé's circle of friends because she never stops talking! She speaks about how popular she is and of her “best friends” all day long, but she really doesn’t have any. No one seems to want to be associated with her. Ironically, she has a huge crush in Tony Dingo who happens to be the most unapproachable boy of them all. Jeny is neither bitter, dumb or bent on revenge. She just wants people to pay attention to her. * Machine: Machine is the coolest baby sitter. Everyone loves her. Every time she picks up Zoé for school, it's a huge event! She's totally crazy and knows exactly how to make everyone laugh. She's always running around and making jokes. Her face is covered with pimples and she wears humongous braces. She dreams of becoming a Hollywood star! One day, she’ll break the piggy-bank and make the big trip! In the meantime, she spends a lot of time scanning audition magazines, hoping to find a role in a commercial, a sitcom or a movie. She even sometimes gets Zoé and Titi to help her rehearse scenes. * Dad and Mom: Zoé's parents are the only symbols of authority (“time for dinner!”, or “get dressed, we’re going to grandma’s!!”). Zoé's mom is a young, beautiful and gracious woman, fair, open- minded, a bit eccentric, very cool and always smiling. Dad, who loves his wife, is a little bit more down to earth. ===Secondary characters=== * Titi: Titi, Zoé's brother, is a little piece of sticky tape that won’t get off your fingers! He lives his life constantly stuck to Zoé, and making noise all around her, tearing apart her notebooks and chewing on her super-cool pens. He's Zoé's worst nightmare in diapers. * Mr. Bonbec: Mr. Bonbec sells candy in his colourful boutique. He is the children's great friend and never hesitates to give out candies, to be comforting and to give advice. The children seek him out like a true sage. * Miss Lardon: Being so delicate and sentimental, Miss Lardon is easily overwhelmed by her pupils. She also often finds amusing methods for explaining math or science. She loves romantic poetry and is easily moved when speaking of love. * Mrs. Glouton: Mariponpon's mother is a generous woman, in every sense of the word. She seems to create a wonderful living experience for her daughter, probably to compensate for her father's absence. A true garden of Eden, packed full of toys, games, meals, snacks, costumes, etc. ==EpisodesFirst season=== # Baby brother blues # Game over # Lola the park pin up # Splat the gnat # Bunch of traitors # Down with beets # Bronco baby sitter # Auntie Kissy # Shoe must go on # Almost famous # Spiting image # Simply the best # Big time secret # Crazy for the candy # Thingee and Thingamajic # Don’t let me down # Love birds # Blur zone # Night of the wusses # In with the boys # So grounded # No rush # Copycat # Whozatgirl # Lucky charm # Super powers ===Second season=== # Zoé to the power of two # King of the crackpots # The vanishing # Queen for a day # My best enemy # Starry-eyed # Inspector Zoé # Double zero # Good riddance ! # Boomerang # Alone at last # The invisible friend # Super secret # A right mix up # Wanted # Prepare for take off # Have a good trip ! # I'm the boss # The party # Charge ! # What an embarrassment ! # Super Dad # Uncle kissy # Friend for a day # Valentine superstars # Princess cosmonaut # Zoé Save the Day ==Awards== *International Animation Festival « Cartoons on the Bay » 2004: Pulcinella Award for the Best Children Series *International Animation Festival « Cartoons on the Bay » 2004: Pulcinella Award for the Best Character *Chicago International Animation Festival 2004 : Second prize for Best Animated Series (adult jury) *Chicago International Animation Festival 2004 : Excellence certificate (young jury) *Paris Audiovisual Club 2005 : Laurier of the Best Children Program *Festival du Film de Télévision de Luchon 2005 : Award of the 8-12 y.o. category *Nomination at the international Emmy Awards (New-York) 2005 ==Publishing== * Frimousse Publishing : ** Truc Machin est né ! ** L'anniversaire d'enfer ! ** Lola-Canon-du-Square ** Valentin mon Amoureux ** C'est meilleur chez Mariponpon Glouton ** « Super-Crâneur »,le nouveau de la classe ** Chez Ginette Couptif ** Machine, baby-sitter trop super ! ** M.

Thirty-six were built between 1880–1892, by Sharp, Stewart and Company and Nasmyth, Wilson and Company. They were the first locomotives owned by the LTSR, as previously all train services had been run by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) under contract. They were ostensibly designed by Thomas Whitelegg and were the first 4-4-2T locomotives to operate in Britain. However, documentation exists to suggest that the design was actually by William Adams, then working for the GER. A member of this class was recorded as having hauled a train of 240t at an average of 82.2 km/h to Southend with water taken during runs.http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno- plus?aid=lok&datum;=1914&page;=9&size;=45 ==Numbering== On the LTSR they were numbered 1–36 and named for places on or near their railway line. In 1912, the LTSR was absorbed by the Midland Railway and the locomotives were renumbered 2110–2145 and the names removed. At the grouping in 1923, all passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and at first retained their former MR numbers. However between 1923 and 1927 twenty-five were progressively renumbered—2110–2119 to 2200–2209 in 1923, 2120–2124 to 2210–2214 in 1925, and 2125–2134 to 2190–2199. In 1930, all 36 were renumbered in the 2056–2091 range. Retirements started in 1929, and by 1936, all had been withdrawn. None were preserved. ==Fleet details== {class=\\" sortable collapsible\\" - !

The ministry operated until 9 October 2000, when Carnell resigned as Chief Minister after being informed by key independent members, Paul Osborne and Dave Rugendyke, that they would no longer support her leadership due to her handling of the Bruce Stadium affair. Deputy Chief Minister Humphries was sworn in as her replacement, and Carnell subsequently left politics. The new ministry contained two major changes from the previous ministry: the second Chief Minister, Trevor Kaine (who subsequently quit the party), and a minister in the first Carnell Ministry was dumped in favour of Brendan Smyth, a member of the House of Representatives for the electorate of Canberra (from 1995 to 1996) and newly elected to the Assembly, and the consolidation of most ministries into a series of larger portfolios.

Moore continued to sit as an independent in the Assembly, despite serving as Health Minister in the Carnell Liberal government; an appointment that increased the number of ministers to five.

He was rejected by the Navy because he suffered from bunionsWisden 1998, p. 1432. but he was accepted by the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he studied from 1935 to 1937. He was commissioned into the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry in 1937. ==Cricket career== Harbottle was a left-handed batsman who bowled slow left-arm orthodox. He was a talented player at Marlborough, and captained the Sandhurst XI. He played a first-class cricket match for the Army in 1937 against Oxford University. He had considerable success in the match, scoring 156 runs in his only first-class innings, before being dismissed by Desmond Eagar. He also played for Dorset at a Minor counties level from 1937 to 1956, although infrequently due to his military commitments. He played cricket for the army until 1959 and captained the team in that year. He is the only English cricketer to score a century in his only first-class innings.Keith Walmsley, Brief Candles, ACS Publications, Cardiff, 2012, p. 63. ==Military career== He served in Italy during the Second World War as a company commander.

He retired from the army in 1968. He became chief security officer for a British-owned mining subsidiary of the Consolidated African Selection Trust in Sierra Leone.

The public were asked to choose between two new campers, Dean and Malandra. Whoever the public voted for would take part in the trial and enter the camp. The public voted for Phina to take part in the trial. She was allowed to choose the second person to take part. She chose Jason. Upset at the prospect of taking part in the Trial, Jan was allowed to take one campmate to the trial for support. She chose Jason. This was the first head to head trial.

In 2013, the club has merged with neighbours TSV Wandsbek-Jenfeld 81'(already having used their ground for a couple of years), renaming itself Wandsbeker TSV Concordia. ==HistoryEarly years=== The club was formed in 1907 as SC Concordia by a small group of seven enthusiastic cycle polo players, with football being only the second sport of the new association. However, cycle polo soon became unfashionable due to frequent crashes and football took over as the club's main interest.Die Gründung des S.C. Concordia SC Concordia website , accessed: 27 November 2008 The club's name Concordia originated by Walter Stautz who saw it engraved in a medal. In 1923, when Wandsbeck, as it was spelt at the time, was still a town in Schleswig-Holstein, the club merged with another local club, Germania, and from 1937, when the town became a part of Greater Hamburg, the press started referring to them as Concordia Hamburg although officially, it was just SC Concordia like before.Abseits guide to German soccer – SC Concordia accessed: 27 November 2008 (not checked again now, 30 December 2014, whether this link still applies) ===1921 to 1933=== The club did not reach the highest level of play in the city of Hamburg till after World War I. In 1921–22, it played in the Kreisliga Groß-Hamburg – Alsterkreis, one of the two highest divisions in the city at the time, reaching sixth place out of eight teams.Kreisliga Großhamburg Abschlußtabelle 1.Klasse 1921–22 , accessed: 27 November 2008 It repeated this performance in 1923 and 1924, but came last in its division in 1924–25.

Due to the outbreak of World War II, the league was split into two regional groups for 1939–40, but reunited the next season. Concordia suffered a last place finish in 1941 and was relegated from the Gauliga, unable to return to the league which was disbanded in 1945.Gauliga Nordmark / Gauliga Hamburg Das deutsche Fussball Archiv , accessed: 27 November 2008 ===1945 to 1963=== Historical chart of SC Concordia league performance after WWII Following the war, the club became one of thirteen clubs in the Stadtliga Hamburg, the highest league in the region until 1947. In 1946–47, Concordia came third in this league and, together with Hamburger SV, FC St Pauli and Victoria Hamburg, was admitted to the new Oberliga Nord (I). In Oberliga play, the club managed several mid-table finishes, with a sixth place in 1949–50 being its best performance. In 1953, it was relegated to the Amateurliga Hamburg (II) after coming 15th out of 16 teams. In three seasons in this league, the team won two championships and a runners-up spot and won promotion back to the Oberliga in 1956. With the exception of a sixth-place result in 1957–58, the club continually flirted with relegation, but survived managed to survive until 1963 when the Oberligen were disbanded in favor of the new nationwide first division Bundesliga. ===1963 to 1974=== Concordia qualified for the new second division Regionalliga Nord despite only coming 14th in 1963. In its first Regionalliga season, Cordi continued to struggle but improved somewhat after 1964. Another sixth-place finish in 1967 stands out as the club's best performance in this era, but by 1970 it was relegated once more, to the tier three Landesliga Hamburg. After three seasons, the team returned to the Regionalliga for what was the final season for the Regionalligen before they were replaced by the 2. Bundesliga in 1974. ===1974 to 2008=== A tenth place in 1974 was not enough to qualify for the new second division and Cordi became part of the newly recreated Oberliga Nord (III). It remained in this league for the next 17 seasons, without ever coming close to promotion, a fifth place in 1977 being its best result. In 1991, the club's luck finally run out and it lost its relegation battle, having to step down to the Verbandsliga Hamburg (IV). After an eighth place in its first season there, it earned two championships in the following campaigns, with their second title earning the team promotion to the new Regionalliga Nord (III). Concordia enjoyed three season there before falling to relegation again and having to return to the Oberliga. After three seasons in the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein, the club was relegated again, back to the Verbandsliga. A title in this league however moved the team straight back up and it enjoyed three excellent seasons in the Oberliga with two third places in 2003 and 2004 being the best results. Upon recreation of the Oberliga Nord in 2004, the club was immediately relegated to the Verbandsliga and has since spent its time there.

He played for the Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Wolverines, Kansas City Cowboys, Baltimore Orioles, and Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA). At the start of the 1882 season, clubs playing in the American Association had their players wear non-matching silk uniforms, with a different color and/or pattern corresponding to each position in the field.Nemec, David. \\"The Official Rules of Baseball Illustrated\\", Globe Pequot, 2006, p. 11. Accordingly, on Opening Day for the Red Stockings, Stearns wore an unusual candy-striped jersey. On September 11, 1882, Stearns was involved in a notable milestone, when pitcher Tony Mullane of the Louisville Eclipse pitched the first no-hit game in the history of the American Association against Stearns and his teammates on the Cincinnati Red Stockings, a 2–0 win by Louisville.Nemec, David. \\"The great encyclopedia of nineteenth century major league baseball\\", University of Alabama Press, 2006, p. 222. Stearns made the game's final out by bouncing into a fielder's choice that forced runner Pop Snyder at second base. The Red Stockings had the last laugh, however, ending the year as the AA's inaugural champions.Nemec, David, and Marc Rucker. \\"The Beer and Whisky League: The Illustrated History of the American Association--Baseball's Renegade Major League\\", Globe Pequot, 2004, p. 37. Unsatisfied with their first-base play in 1882, the Red Stockings signed Long John Reilly of the New York Metropolitans to replace Stearns prior to the 1883 season.Nemec and Rucker, p. 43 Stearns spent the 1887 season with the Topeka Golden Giants of the Western League, leading that league in hits. That team finished with a dominant record of 90–25, and is sometimes described as the strongest minor league baseball club of the 19th century.Nemec, \\"The great encyclopedia of nineteenth century major league baseball\\", p. 485. Stearns is also notable as one of the first Jews to play Major League Baseball.Levine, Peter. \\"Ellis Island to Ebbets Field: Sport and the American Jewish Experience\\", Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 103. His status as such made him popular with Jewish youths who were fans of the game.Cohen, Irwin J. \\"Jewish Detroit\\", Arcadia Publishing, 2002, p. 26. ==External linksReferences== Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:Buffalo Bisons (NL) players Category:Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA) players Category:Baltimore Orioles (AA) players Category:Kansas City Cowboys players Category:Detroit Wolverines players Category:19th-century baseball players Category:Baseball players from New York (state) Category:Binghamton Crickets (1880s) players Category:Macon (minor league baseball) players Category:Topeka (minor league baseball) players Category:Des Moines Hawkeyes players Category:Des Moines Prohibitionists players Category:Kansas City Blues (baseball) players Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Wilkes-Barre Coal Barons players Category:Scranton Coal Heavers players Category:1861 births Category:1944 deaths ","title":"Dan Stearns"},{"id":"20427287","text":"Jean-Claude Chermann is a French virologist who managed the research team which, by 1983, under the administrative supervision of Luc Montagnier, had discovered the virus associated with AIDS.

He was the starting shortstop, and with a .310 batting average the leading hitter, for the 1883 Athletics team that won the American Association pennant with a 66-32 record. ==Early years== Moynahan was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1856. ==Professional baseball player== Moynahan began his career as a professional baseball player in 1879 with the Davenport Brown Stockings of the Northwestern League.

He played five seasons of Major League Baseball, principally as a second baseman, for the Detroit Wolverines (1881–82), Providence Grays (1882), New York Gothams (1883), and the New York Metropolitans (1884-85). He appeared in 292 major league games, 257 of them as a second baseman, and compiled a .243 batting average with 42 doubles, 20 triples, four home runs and 51 runs batted in. After retiring from baseball, Troy operated the beer concession at the Polo Grounds in the 1890s and later opened a café in his old home neighborhood at Tenth Avenue and 39th Street in Manhattan. ==Early years== Troy was born in New York City in 1856. He was raised in the Tenth Avenue Gashouse District on the Lower West Side of Manhattan. ==Professional baseball careerMinor leagues=== Troy began his professional baseball career in 1877 with the New York Alaskas team in the League Alliance. He also played for three different clubs in the Eastern Championship Association during the 1881 season. ===Detroit and Providence=== In August 1881, Troy made his major league debut with the Detroit Wolverines of the National League. He appeared in 11 games at second and third base for the 1881 Wolverines and compiled a .341 batting average. Troy returned to the Wolverines at the start of the 1882 season and appeared in 42 games, mostly at shortstop and second base. His batting average dropped to .243 with the 1882 Wolverines. He finished the 1882 season playing in four games for the Providence Grays of the National League. ===New York=== Troy (front row, right) with the 1883 New York Gothams In 1883, Troy returned home to New York as a member of the newly-formed New York Gothams, later renamed the Giants. Troy appeared in 85 games for the 1883 Gothams, including 73 games at second base and 12 at shortstop. He compiled a .215 batting average with seven doubles, five triples and 20 RBIs with the Gothams. In 1884, Troy joined the New York Metropolitans of the American Association. The 1884 Metropolitans compiled a 75-32 record and won the American Association pennant. Troy was the team's starting second baseman, appearing in 104 games at the position in 1884. During New York's first championship season, Troy posted a .264 average with 80 runs scored, 111 hits, 22 doubles, 10 triples, and two home runs. Troy concluded his major league career as a member of the 1885 Metropolitans. He appeared in 45 games that year, including 42 at second base. His batting average dipped to .220 with three doubles, three triples, two home runs and 12 RBIs. Troy's last major league game was on July 9, 1885. ===Return to minors=== Troy continued playing professional baseball in the minor leagues through the 1888 season, including stints with the Scranton Indians (39 games, 1886), Binghamton Crickets (36 games, 1886), New Haven Blues (55 games, 1887), Manchester Farmers (37 games, 1887), and Troy Trojans (62 games, 1888). Troy was managed in 1888 by Ted Sullivan, who frowned on Troy's consumption of alcoholic beverages. Troy agreed voluntarily to abstain from drinking as a condition for playing on the manager's team, but was unhappy with the restriction. Finally, in a home game during the 1888 season, Troy promised that, if Sullivan went to the bar under the grandstand and brought him a beer, Troy would \\"clear the bases.\\" Sullivan complied, and Troy walked to the plate saying, \\"The 'Old Dash' is back.\\" Troy hit the ball off the center field fence for an inside-the-park home run to win the game. Sullivan later recalled, \\"After that I never stopped my old friend, John Troy, from taking his glass of beer.\\" Sullivan further recalled that no player impressed him more than Troy for the \\"natural way he picked up ground balls\\", as \\"a man of principle\\", and for his \\"originality, good humor and clean language in the style of coaching.\\" ==Later years== As a New York native who played for the Gothams/Giants in their first season in New York, Troy was fondly remembered by New Yorkers. From approximately 1889 to 1900, and with the exception of the 1894 season when he lost his license after an attack on a grandstand gatekeeper, Troy operated the beer concession, sometimes referenced as a saloon or bar, at the Polo Grounds in New York. According to one account published in 1893, patrons sometimes \\"paid more attention to 'Dasher' Troy's emporium than they did to the game.\\" In September 1900, he opened a café in his old home neighborhood at Tenth Avenue and Thirty-Ninth Street. Troy was married to Mary E. Flanagan in approximately 1890. By 1900, Troy was living with Mary in Manhattan and was employed as a liquor dealer. At that time, they had four children living with them: William (born July 1884), Margaret (born September 1888), Annie (born October 1889), and John Jr. (born November 1891).Census entry for John J.

It was serialised between 5 August 1957 and 10 December 1958 in the Hong Kong newspaper Sin Wun Pao. It is closely related to Qijian Xia Tianshan and Saiwai Qixia Zhuan. The novel has been adapted into films and television series, such as The Bride with White Hair (1993) and The Romance of the White Hair Maiden (1995), and The White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom (2014). The novel has been variously translated as Biography of the White-Haired Succuba and Romance of the White- Haired Maiden. ==Plot== The story begins in the Ming dynasty during the final years of the reign of the Wanli Emperor (). Lian Nichang, a female bandit leader nicknamed \\"Jade Rakshasa\\", is introduced as an impressive vigilante- heroine who uses her legendary swordplay skills to uphold justice and punish the wicked. Meanwhile, many government officials are implicated in a scandal to overthrow the crown prince, and they are either executed or imprisoned. Zhuo Yihang of the Wudang Sect helps the crown prince uncover the truth behind the case and succeeds in clearing the name of his father, who was wrongly put to death. On the journey home, Zhuo Yihang passes by Mount Hua, where he meets a beautiful young maiden and falls in love with her. The following night, Zhuo joins some martial artists in a duel against the \\"Jade Rakshasa\\". However, he is shocked when he sees that the woman he met earlier is actually the \\"Jade Rakshasa\\", Lian Nichang. He makes another startling discovery that the martial artists he is helping are actually spies working for the Manchus. Zhuo Yihang switches sides and helps Lian Nichang defeat the spies. They meet a formidable swordsman, Yue Mingke, who is serving as a military attaché under the general Xiong Tingbi. After a duel, Yue Mingke and Lian Nichang realise that their respective masters used to be a loving couple, but have separated due to a rivalry over achieving supremacy in swordplay. In the meantime, the Taichang Emperor dies after consuming the mysterious Red Pills, and is succeeded by the young Tianqi Emperor. The eunuch Wei Zhongxian and the emperor's wet nurse Madam Ke use the opportunity to deceive the naive ruler and usurp state power. Wei Zhongxian forms his own political clique and starts persecuting his opponents and those loyal to the emperor in order to consolidate power. Lian Nichang, Zhuo Yihang and Yue Mingke side with the loyalists and oppose Wei Zhongxian, playing key roles in disrupting Wei's evil plans in their respective adventures. At one point, Yue Mingke is devastated after his lover, Tie Shanhu, dies tragically at the hands of Wei Zhongxian's henchmen. He becomes disillusioned with human society and becomes a monk, renaming himself \\"Reverend Huiming\\". He settles in the Mount Heaven region and spends his time studying martial arts. During that time, Zhuo Yihang and Lian Nichang develop a romance and Zhuo is poised to become the new leader of Wudang. However, as Lian Nichang has a history of bad blood with Wudang, Zhuo Yihang's seniors and fellows strongly oppose his relationship with Lian. During a fight between Lian Nichang and Wudang's elders, Zhuo Yihang accidentally attacks Lian, causing her to misunderstand that he has betrayed her. Lian Nichang is heartbroken and her hair turns white after she awakes from a long sleep. Depressed by her new looks, she travels to Mount Heaven and leads a reclusive life there. Years later, Lian Nichang makes her name in the Mount Heaven region by slaying villains and defeating several martial arts experts. She is known to the locals as the \\"White Haired Demoness\\". Meanwhile, Zhuo Yihang suffers from an emotional breakdown after losing Lian Nichang, and he leaves Wudang in search of his lover. After a long journey, Zhuo Yihang finally meets Lian Nichang on Mount Heaven, but she remains cold and indifferent towards him, refusing to accept his apologies. Zhuo Yihang learns that there is a rare flower that can turn white hair black again, but the flower only blooms once every six decades. He finds it and waits, hoping that it will bloom one day and allow him to reunite with his lover. ==CharactersAdaptationsFilms=== {  width=75% ! width=5% Year !! width=15% Production !! width=25% Main cast !! width=30% Additional information -  1959  Emei Film Company (Hong Kong)  Law Yim-hing, Cheung Ying, Lin Chiao, Law Lan, Shih Kien  See Story of the White-Haired Demon Girl -  1980  Great Wall Movie Enterprises Ltd (Hong Kong)  Paw Hee-ching, Henry Fong, Leanne Liu, Chiang Ping  See White Hair Devil Lady -  rowspan=2 1993 rowspan=2 Hong Kong  Brigitte Lin, Leslie Cheung  See The Bride with White Hair -  Brigitte Lin, Leslie Cheung, Christy Chung, Sunny Chan, Joey Meng  See The Bride with White Hair 2 -  2014  Bona Film Group (China)  Fan Bingbing, Huang Xiaoming, Vincent Zhao  See The White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom - } ===Television=== {  width=75% ! width=5% Year !! width=15% Production !! width=25% Main cast !! width=30% Additional information -  1978  Commercial Television (Hong Kong)  Lily Li, Jason Pai  -  1986  ATV (Hong Kong)  Bonnie Ngai, Savio Tsang, Chen Kuan-tai, Wong Jo-see, Amy Yip  See The Romance of the White Hair Maiden (1986 TV series) -  1995  TVB (Hong Kong)  Ada Choi, Timmy Ho, Gary Chan, Joanna Chan, Jason Pai  See The Romance of the White Hair Maiden (1995 TV series) -  1999  Taiwan  Jiang Qinqin, Julian Cheung, Lin Fangbing, Chen Chun-sheng, Zhang Heng, Li Hui-ying  See Romance of the White Haired Maiden (TV series) -  2012  Phoenix Legend Films (China)  Nicky Wu, Ma Su, Louis Fan, Liu Sitong, Li Jie, Guo Zhenni, Dai Jiaoqian  See The Bride with White Hair (TV series) } ==References== Category:Wuxia novels Category:1958 novels Category:Novels set in the Ming dynasty Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:Works originally published in Hong Kong newspapers Category:Novels set in the 17th century Category:Shun dynasty ","title":"Baifa Monü Zhuan"},{"id":"20427470","text":"Joseph \\"Ed\\" Herr (March 4, 1865 in St. Louis, Missouri – August 1, 1936 in St. Louis, Missouri) was an American professional baseball infielder during –.

It was the winner of the 1986 World Fantasy Award. The story deals with an American intellectual who travels to Calcutta, where he becomes embroiled in mysterious and horrific events at the centre of which lies a cult of Kapalikas that worships Kali. ==Plot summary== Robert Luczak is sent by the American literary magazine Other Voices, where he works as an editor, to Calcutta to locate poetry alleged to have been recently authored by a legendary poet, M. Das. The literary world considers this development newsworthy because Das disappeared and is presumed to have died eight years ago. Robert's Indian wife, Amrita, and their infant child, Victoria, accompany him on his assignment. Upon arriving, he is met by a Mr. M. T. Krishna, a local intellectual who claims to have been asked to assist them by a mutual friend. The next day Robert meets with the local writers guild who were the source of the few bits of poetry that made their way to America. When he asks to meet Das, he is told this is impossible. Robert considers leaving Calcutta at this point, his duty done, but feels that he doesn't yet have enough material for an interesting article. The night before he and his family are to leave, Krishna returns and takes Robert to a man who can provide him with information relevant to his story. The man tells how he and a friend tried to join a religious secret society dedicated to Kali, the Hindu goddess associated with death and destruction. One of the prerequisites was for each initiate to bring a corpse to a secret temple, there to be laid at the feet of a statue of Kali. One of the corpses, bloated and decayed after being dredged from the river, is chosen by Kali, vivified by her, and reanimates; this corpse is said to be that of the poet, Das. Robert finds the man's tale too fantastical to believe, and still hopes to meet and interview the poet. While he is not granted an interview with Das, Robert receives an extensive manuscript collection of Das' poetry, which is very different from his earlier work, describing dark, mystical, grotesque, and apocalyptic happenings. Robert again insists that the writers guild allow him to see Das, and threatens to call them and the manuscript a fraud in his article. This time they agree. He is brought through the Calcutta slums by gangsters belonging to the cult of Kali, and taken to the poet. Shocked by the man’s appearance, Robert first takes him for a reanimated corpse, but then recognizes the symptoms as the advanced stages of leprosy. Das confirms that he is suffering from the affliction, but also insists that he really did return from death. Robert is unconvinced, feeling Das may be going along with the cult members who might be holding him captive. Das then asks him to bring him books of poetry, making a reference to a certain poem about a suicide to hint that he really wants the means to kill himself. Becoming concerned at the eerie and sometimes frightening events that he has experienced, Robert attempts to send his wife and child home, but they are unable to get a flight. Concealing a gun (given to him previously by Krishna) in one of the books he has bought for Das, he returns to the poet. Robert leaves the books and departs, but, as he exits the house, hears two gunshots. Das is dead. Robert is captured by guards and drugged. He awakens to find himself in a temple of Kali, where the statue of the goddess seems to come to life and attack him (though it is left deliberately ambiguous as to whether this actually happens, or is instead a hallucination). He is loaded into the back of a truck by the cultists to be taken somewhere, but manages to escape with Krishna's help. He returns to the hotel, only to find his wife informing the police that their daughter has been kidnapped. After a couple of days of dead-end leads, an Indian couple is caught at the airport trying to take someone resembling Victoria out of the country. Robert and Amrita go to identify their child, but find that she is already dead. With their child dead, and no hope of finding the perpetrators of the crime nor bringing them to justice, Robert and his wife return to America. Robert decides to destroy the poetry, and, gradually, the couple's relationship returns to something resembling normal. Robert still wrestles with the desire for revenge, and after training himself in the use of firearms he returns to Calcutta with a smuggled handgun, intending to track down any and kill everyone he considers responsible. At the last moment, however, he manages to resist what he believes to be the \\"Song of Kali\\" - the force of devastation, cruelty and madness that exists somewhere within every human heart. He returns to the US and successfully comes to terms with the events that have befallen him and his family. Whispers can still be heard, though, of the \\"Song of Kali\\", the condition of humanity dominated by hatred and violence, perfectly embodied, in the mind of the narrator, by the squalor and chaos of Calcutta. ==References * Song of Kali at Worlds Without End Category:1985 American novels Category:1985 fantasy novels Category:American horror novels Category:Debut fantasy novels Category:Novels by Dan Simmons Category:Novels set in Kolkata Category:World Fantasy Award for Best Novel-winning works Category:1985 debut novels ","title":"Song of Kali"},{"id":"20427920","text":"Roberto \\"Junior\\" Maldonado Vélez (born June 9, 1952) is a former member of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico who, in the United States territory's highly politicized environment, will serve under an opposing party's administration.

He played in Major League Baseball in 1883, splitting the season between the Detroit Wolverines and Philadelphia Athletics. With a strong showing in September 1883, he helped the Athletics win the American Association pennant by one game over the St. Louis Browns. Jones also led the Yale Bulldogs baseball team to two intercollegiate championships in the early 1880s. Jones became known as \\"Jumping Jack\\" Jones because of his distinctive pitching delivery which involved jumping some two feet in the air before throwing the ball. His delivery drew ridicule and laughter among spectators, caused confusion among batters and made Jones \\"the twirling marvel of his time.\\" Jones later received D.D.S. and M.D. degrees from Harvard Dental School and Yale Medical School and became a dentist in Connecticut. ==Early years== Jumping Jack was born in 1860 at Litchfield, Connecticut. His parents, Daniel Albion Jones, Sr., and Emeline (Roberts) Jones, were both dentists. His mother was reported to be \\"the first woman in America to establish herself in a regular dental practice.\\" Jones' father died in 1864, leaving his mother to support her children from her income as a dentist. ==Yale== Jumping Jack attended preparatory school at the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, Connecticut, before enrolling at Yale College. While attending Yale, he was a member of the Glee Club and was responsible for introducing whistling to the club's program. Jones also played on the Yale Bulldogs baseball team for four years, and his teammates there included Allen Hubbard. Hubbard was the catcher and Jones a pitcher on the 1882 and 1883 Yale teams that won Intercollegiate Baseball Association championships. Jones and Hubbard were part of a \\"coterie\\" at Yale that included a young Walter Camp, who later became known as the \\"Father of American Football.\\" Jones, Hubbard and Camp all played summer baseball for a local town ball team in Massachusetts known as the Westfield Firemen. Jones graduated from the Yale Academic School in 1884. ==Professional baseball\\"Jumping Jack\\"=== While playing major league baseball, Jones became known as \\"Jumping Jack\\" Jones, and was considered \\"the twirling marvel of his time.\\" The nickname was based on his distinctive pitching delivery which involved \\"a leap skywards to give further impetus to the ball.\\" On August 20, 1883, The Sporting News described the reaction to his delivery during a game in Cleveland: > He is a tall, good-looking, finely-built fellow, a thorough gentleman and > all that, but when he wants to add pace to his ball he jumps fully two feet > with every delivery. It is a very funny act, and last week, in Cleveland, as > he jumped the crowd hooted. It shook him up and he dropped the jump, except > at intervals. The Detroit Journal also noted that Jones's delivery caused \\"so much laughter\\" at Detroit's Recreation Park.(available through Library of Congress Chronicling America database) While Jones's delivery drew ridicule, it also caused confusion on the part of batters. A newspaper account in September 1883 noted that his \\"habit of jumping high in the air\\" caused batters to become confused, noting that he generally delivered the balls other ways \\"until two strikes are called, when he jumps up in the air and pitches the ball in various and curious curves.\\"(available through Library of Congress Chronicling America database) Another account, published in 1892, observed: \\"Jumping Jack Jones was the marvel of the age when a pitcher was allowed to indulge in a few jig steps before he delivered the ball. While he was engaged in the delightful occupation of unjointing himself the frightened batsman was not sure whether the ball or an arm or a leg was coming over the plate.\\" ===Toledo=== Even before graduating from Yale, Jones began playing professional baseball in 1883 for the Toledo Blue Stockings in the Northwestern League. The Toledo baseball club was racially integrated in 1883, having Moses Fleetwood Walker as one of its catchers. It is not known whether Jones pitched to Walker during the 1883 season. ===Detroit=== In July 1883, Jones made his major league baseball debut with the Detroit Wolverines of the National League. He started 12 games for the Wolverines, compiling a 6-5 win-loss record and a 3.50 earned run average (ERA) in 92-2/3 innings pitched. ===Philadelphia=== Jones from 1883 Philadelphia Athletics team composite In September 1883, Detroit released Jones, and he then signed with the Philadelphia Athletics agreeing to a salary of $500 for one month's work. Jones started seven games for Philadelphia and compiled a 5-2 record and 2.63 ERA in 65 innings pitched. Jones' contributions late in the season helped the Athletics edge the St. Louis Browns by one game in a close race for the 1883 American Association pennant. Jones appeared in his last major league game on September 28, 1883, at age 22. In early October, The Sporting Life reported that \\"Jumping Jack Jones will return to Yale College this week.\\" ===Connecticut=== Although his major league career began and ended in 1883, Jones continued to play minor league baseball in his home state of Connecticut. He played for a club in Meriden, Connecticut (Connecticut State League) in 1884 and for a club in Waterbury, Connecticut (Southern New England League) in 1885. Jones was also the manager of the Waterbury club and played right field when he was not pitching. ==Dentistry and family== Jones studied dentistry with his mother for three years and then attended Harvard Dental School, receiving a D.D.S. degree in 1889. He also received an M.D. degree from Yale Medical School in 1890. After receiving his degrees, he became a dentist and an officer in the Connecticut State Dental Society. Jones was married to Emma Aurelia Beadle in 1889. She died in December 1908. Jones stopped practicing dentistry in the 1920s and began \\"investigating and instructing voice training.\\" Jones lived at the Masonic Home in Wallingford, Connecticut, in his later years. He died in 1936 at age 75 in Wallingford, and was buried at East Lawn Cemetery in East Haven, Connecticut. ==References== Category:1860 births Category:1936 deaths Category:19th-century baseball players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Detroit Wolverines players Category:Philadelphia Athletics (AA) players Category:Toledo Blue Stockings (minor league) players Category:Meriden Maroons players Category:Waterbury Brassmen players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Baseball players from Connecticut Category:People from Litchfield, Connecticut Category:People from Wallingford, Connecticut Category:Harvard School of Dental Medicine alumni Category:Yale Bulldogs baseball players Category:Yale School of Medicine alumni Category:American dentists Category:Yale College alumni ","title":"Jumping Jack Jones"},{"id":"20428554","text":"Eva Karin Nyberg (born 8 February 1969 in Funbo, Uppsala) is a former Swedish Olympic freestyle swimmer.

The terms used in Germany make reference to the principal function of the building as a residence for aged farmers after turning over the farm to their heirs. ==Construction== Stöcklis were generally only built on larger farms. Often, they were created through the expansion of existing buildings such as oven sheds. If newly built, they were generally provided with large cellars to store the farm's produce in, replacing separate cellar houses or field cellars. The attic was often also used as storage space for grain, while the ground floor and upper floor (if any) were residential areas. Stöcklis in historically poorer areas tend to be simple, wooden constructions. In more prosperous areas, such as in the Swiss plateau near Bern, they were often prestigious buildings, imitating the architecture and style of aristocratic country estates or country inns. ==References== Category:Farms in Switzerland ","title":"Stöckli"},{"id":"20428695","text":"The Chief Scout's Advance Party Report was a publication produced in 1966 by The Boy Scout Association in the United Kingdom, intended to modernise the Scout Movement. The report was attempting to address falling numbers within the Movement. ==Advance Party== The Chief Scout's Advance Party was formed in January 1964, when 24 Scout Leaders under the age of 45 were invited to \\"study all apects of the future of Scouting and to make recommendations, after consultation with the Movement, to the Chief Scout as to the development of the Movement, both in the immediate future and for the 1970s.\\" The Advance Party met as a body for six weekends, with various sub-committees holding an additional 166 meetings and the chairmen of these committees meeting on three occasions. ===Members of the Chief Scout's Advance Party=== Chairman: The Chief Scout, Sir Charles Maclean Secretary: E.W.

Young; Assistant County Commissioner in Glasgow ==The Report== The final report to the Committee of the Council was 200,000 words long. This was reduced to 50,000 words in a published \\"Popular Edition\\" through summarising and omitting many of the arguments relating to the 409 recommendations. ==Key recommendations== 1 That the Boy Scouts Association be renamed as The Scout Association. 2 Wolf Cubs be renamed Cub Scouts. 3 That the Scout and Cub Scout Promise be the same, with the removal of the phrases \\"On my honour\\" and \\"at all times\\". 4 That the original Scout Law be re-written, becoming- :::* A Scout does his best to honour his promise. :::* A Scout is to be trusted. :::* A Scout is loyal. :::* A Scout is friendly and considerate. :::* A Scout is a brother to all Scouts. :::* A Scout has courage in all difficulties. :::* A Scout makes good use of his time and is careful of possessions and property. :::* A Scout has respect for himself and others. 5 That a new training and advancement scheme be introduced. 6 All Sections should use the same Scout salute. 7 That \\"Be Prepared\\" be the motto for the whole Scout Movement. 8 That the minimum age for entry into the Scout Movement be 8 years, with no pre-Cub training. 9 That the maximum age for membership of a Training Section of the Movement be 20 years. 10 That there be three Training Sections in the Movement; :::* Cub Scouts (ages 8 to 11) :::* Scouts (ages 11 to 16) :::* Venture Scouts (ages 16 to 20) 11 That Scout Troops of approximately 36 members be formed by amalgamation or pooling of resources of smaller troops. 12 That the registration of Lone Scouts be discontinued. 13 That a set of minimum standards be introduced, with Groups failing to meet these standards being closed; :::* Minimum number of young people (Cub Scouts: 12, Scout Troop: 12, Venture Scouts: 9) :::* Minimum number of leaders (At least 2 adults for each section) :::* Minimum level of progress made by members of each section :::* Appropriate programme being operated by each section 14 That a maximum age- limit for Scouters and Commissioners be introduced. 15 That there be an increase in the number of paid Scouters. 16 That shorts will only be worn as part of the uniform by members of the Cub Scout section. ==Implementation== Following the publication of the Report a further document called Design for Scouting was published, outlining which of the Advance Party's recommendations had been accepted by the Committee of the Council. Only a few of the proposals were amended. Notably, it was decided against the deletion of \\"On my honour\\" from the Scout Promise; this obviated the need for the first of the proposed eight Scout Laws, leaving only seven. The suggestion that the Wood Badge insignia (for adult leader training) be replaced by a cloth emblem was also not adopted.http://www.thedump.scoutscan.com/design.pdf The Chief Scout's Advance Party decisions (PDF) The first changes to be implemented were the adoption of the new Laws and Promises in October 1966 followed in May 1967 by the formal name change from The Boy Scouts' Association to The Scout Association. In October of that year, the new uniform was introduced along with the new training schemes, including the launch of the Venture Scout section. ==Outcomes== Front cover of the Boy Scout Black Paper Such radical change was not welcomed by all members and a reply, A Boy Scout Black Paper, was produced in 1970 by \\"The Scout Action Group\\". This provided some alternative proposals for the development of the Movement and asked for Groups that wished to continue to follow Baden-Powell's original scheme to be allowed to do so. The content of this paper was not accepted by The Scout Association, resulting in a split developing in the Movement and the formation of the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association.Baden-Powell Scouts' Association The front cover of the Black Paper featured a photograph of a Scout Group in South East London which, according to the foreword of the document, was forced to close under APR due to the leader being aged 65 despite no replacement leader being available. The Paper concludes with a copy of the letter from North and Central Lambeth Scout Council refusing to re-register and, therefore, forcing the closure of the Group. Following several years of reduction in overall numbers, the annual census of 31 March 1969 (18 months after the implementation of the Report) showed modest increases across two sections of the Association. The total of 531,011 included 249,561 Cub Scouts, 188,379 Scouts and 21,698 Venture Scouts in 11,704 Scout Groups. The total number of young people in the Association who were within the reduced Statutory Youth Service age range of 14 to 21 was over 81,000.The Scouter, Volume LXIII No 10, October 1969 (pp. 276−7) The Advance Party Report failed to recover the losses of older boys, with 55,206 Senior Scouts and Rover Scouts recorded in 1966 having been replaced by 21,698 Venture Scouts in the 1969 figures. The highest recorded membership of the Venture Scout section was 39,307 in 1989 (after the 1976 admission of girls into the Venture Scout section). By March 1978, a decade after implementation, the overall Scout Association total had risen to 636,148, including 308,152 Cub Scouts, 207,276 Scouts and 27,905 Venture Scouts (of whom, 2,218 were girls). The number of Scout Groups had fallen to 11,464, reflecting the policy of amalgamating smaller units which had been proposed by the Advance Party.Scouting Magazine, Volume LXXII No 9, September 1978 (p. 645) By 1998 the majority (68%) of members of The Scout Association were under 11 years old.The Crisis in The Scout Movement ==Further reviews== The training schemes of the Scout Association were reviewed several times in the succeeding decades. A new training scheme and progress awards for the Scout section were launched in April 1985,An Official History of Scouting (p. 183) Against the recommendations of APR, the Beaver Scout section for 6 and 7 year olds launched in April 1986 after a trial scheme and in February 1990, it was decided in principle that the Association would become fully co-educational.An Official History of Scouting, Hamlyn, 2006, (p.184) A new training scheme for Cub Scouts was launched in September 1990. In May 2000 a new report called simply The Programme Review was received by the Committee of the Council after extensive consultation with members of the Association and focus groups. A uniform review was conducted shortly afterwards. The new uniforms were launched during London Fashion Week in 2001 and implementation of the new training programmes began in 2002. This included splitting Ventures back into two sections, Explorer Scouts (14−18) and Scout Network (18−25); effectively restoring the pre-APR age boundaries by December 2003.An Official History of Scouting (p.185) ==See also == *Baden-Powell's Scout training scheme == References Bibliography== * * * The Advance Party Report viewable online * The Chief Scout's Advance Party decisions (PDF) Category:Baden-Powell Scouts' Association Category:The Scout Association ","title":"The Chief Scout's Advance Party Report"},{"id":"20428703","text":"Kevork Malikyan (born 2 June 1943) is an Armenian actor and teacher. He is known for his roles as Kazim in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), Max Papandrious in the television sitcom Mind Your Language (1977–1979) and Rady in the film Flight of the Phoenix (2004). ==Career== Malikyan made his first television appearance in an episode of the British Historical drama The Portrait of a Lady in 1968 playing the role of ‘servant’. Though out the last years of the 1960s Malikyan made other numerous television appearances including Doctor Who, The Saint, and The Avengers. Malikyan got his big break in the British film The Man Who Haunted Himself in 1970, staring Roger Moore, in which Malikyan played Luigi the butler of the Pelham family. Roger Moore went on to say of the film that it was his favourite role, “It was a film I actually got to act in.” In 1977 Malikyan embarked on his most notable role on British television, in the ITV sitcom Mind Your Language, which was about an Adult education centre and followed the story to the ‘English as a foreign language’ class. In the series Malikyan played Maximilian (Max) Papandrious, a Greek shipping worker from Athens. The show was very successful and at its height attacked 18 million viewers, Malikyan appeared in 29 episodes from 1977 to the series conclusion in 1979. Although the series was briefly revived in 1986 he did not make any appearances in it. Malikyans next big film role came in the 1978 with the prison film Midnight Express, in which he played the part of The Prosecutor. The film was directed by Alan Parker and stared Brad Davis, Irene Miracle and Bo Hopkins. The film was very popular and went on to win two Academy Awards. His performance did not go unnoticed, one director who especially noticed him was Steven Spielberg. Malikan tried to audition for the part of Sallah in Raiders of the Lost Ark, but was prevented from doing so by heavy traffic. In 1988 Spielberg cast Malikyan in the third in the Indiana Jones Series, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade in which he played Kazim, the leader of the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, an organization that protects the Holy Grail. Throughout the 1990s Malikyan appeared in various television programs including the sitcom Birds of a Feather, and The Final Cut. In 2002 he featured alongside Steven Seagal in the American Action film, Belly of the Beast but the film was not well reserved by the critics. Two years later Malikyan appeared in the 2004 re-make of the 1965 film of the same name, Flight of the Phoenix in which he played Rady. The film reserved mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box- office. During his career, Malikyan has performed in a number of Shakespeare play including Henry IV, Part 1 and Henry IV, Part 2 at the Shakespeare Globe Theatre in 2010. Malikyan also played in a number of roles in the Royal Shakespeare Company production, Arabian Nights (December 2009 – January 2010), at the Courtyard Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. Malikyan appeared as Inspector Durmaz in the 2012 action-thriller film Taken 2, which was a sequel of the highly successful 2008 film. Two years later Malikyan appeared in the epic biblical film Exodus: Gods and Kings in which he played Jethro. The film was based on the Book of Exodus and was directed by Ridley Scott. The same year he stared alongside Tahar Rahim and Simon Abkarian in the internationally co-produced drama film The Cut. In 2016 Malikyan featured in the historical drama The Promise which was set in the final years of the Ottoman Empire. ==Background== Malikyan was born to Armenian parents in Diyarbakır, Turkey. When he was 10 years old, an archbishop decided to open a religious seminary in Üsküdar, Istanbul, with the intention of taking in the poor children of Armenian parents from various parts of Turkey and bringing them up as priests. Malikyan was questioned by a priest who wanted to determine whether or not he was a good candidate for the priesthood. His father told him to go to the seminary because he could not afford to give him an education due to financial problems. Though Malikyan was worried because he had no friends in Istanbul and had to leave his parents behind, he went to the city to become a priest. Malikyan was sent to the Karagözyan Orphanage in Şişli where he spent two years before attending the religious seminary in Üsküdar. In the seminary, there was a small stage where the students acted in Turkish and Armenian. When he was 16, an Anglican priest was invited to the school to teach them English. He was an Oxford graduate who wrote history books. The man was also fond of acting and had prepared Richard III by Shakespeare in English, wherein Malikyan played Richard. The priest must have liked Malikyan's acting, because he told the headmaster of the school that Malikyan should become an actor rather than a priest. The patriarch asked Malikyan his opinion on the matter, but Malikyan was unsure because of financial concerns. Father Harding, a British priest, found him a scholarship in Britain. Malikyan graduated from the Surp Haç Armenian High SchoolThis students will out of school in Istanbul, then moved to London in 1963 for acting education. At the drama school Rose Bruford College,Back to Turkey after 50 years he received diplomas for acting and teaching. He now lives in Istanbul, where he also works as a teacher. ==Partial filmography== *The Man Who Haunted Himself (1970) – Luigi *Midnight Express (1978) – Prosecutor *Sphinx (1981) – Bell Boy *Trenchcoat (1983) – Arab *Half Moon Street (1986) – First Diplomat *Pascali's Island (1988) – Mardosian *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) – Kazim *Paparazzo (1995) – Mackenzie *The Commissioner (1998) – Greek commissioner *Belly of the Beast (2002) – Demetrio Altafini *Flight of the Phoenix (2004) – Rady *Renaissance (2006) – Nusrat Farfella (voice) *The Palace (2011) – Sergeant Karem Akalin *Taken 2 (2012) – Inspector Durmaz *Yozgat Blues (2013) – Sadettin Usta *Şarkı Söyleyen Kadınlar (2013) – Mesut *The Cut (2014) – Hagob Nakashian *Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) – Jethro *Niyazi Gül Dörtnala (2015) – Süleyman *The Promise (2016) – Vartan Boghossian ==Television== *Doctor Who Episode The Wheel in Space (1968) – Kemel Rudkin *Detective Series 3, Episode 3: Art Attack (1968) – Garcia *Who Pays the Ferryman?

After playing for Bota's futsal club, he joined the football team as a right winger, but was reconverted to full-back in the process.

It has, especially since about 1100, been strongly influenced by wider trends in European art. After World War II, the influence of the United States strengthened substantially. Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Norwegian art has a high production per capita. Though usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Norway has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the Norwegian Reformation, and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Norway has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings. One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in Viking art, and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times. The Reformation and the loss of a permanent royal court after the Kalmar Union of 1397 greatly disrupted Norwegian artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requirements of the small aristocratic class were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the 19th century that significant numbers of Norwegians were trained in contemporary styles. Norwegian art came into its own in the 19th century, especially with the early landscape painters. Until that time, the art scene in Norway had been dominated by imports from Germany and Holland and by the influence of Danish rule. Initially with landscape painting, later with Impressionism and Realism.Painting from Norway Cultural Profile. Retrieved 28 November 2008. Though for the rest of the world Edvard Munch (1863–1944) is certainly Norway's great artistic figure, there have been many other significant figures. ==The beginnings== Adolph Tidemand's Haugianerne (Haugeans). 1852 Johan Christian Dahl (1788–1857) is often said to be the \\"father of Norwegian landscape painting\\". After a period in Copenhagen, he joined the Dresden school to which he made an important contribution. He eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time. Another important early contributor was Johannes Flintoe (1787–1870), a Danish-Norwegian painter, known for his Norwegian landscapes and paintings of folk costumes. He taught at the School of Drawing (Tegneskolen) in Christiania from 1819 to 1851 where his students included budding romanticists such as Hans Gude and Johan F. Eckersberg. Adolph Tidemand (1814–1876) studied in Copenhagen, in Italy and finally in Düsseldorf where he settled. He often returned to Norway where he painted the old Norwegian farm culture. His best known painting is The bridal procession in Hardanger (together with Hans Gude, 1848) and Haugianerne (Haugeans) painted in 1852. Norway’s new-found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as Kitty Kielland, 1843–1914, an early female painter who studied under Gude and Harriet Backer, 1845–1932, another pioneer among female artists, influenced by impressionism. ==Impressionists and neo- romanticists== Christian Krohg, Albertine i politilægens venteværelse (Albertine at the Police Doctor's Waiting Room, 1885-87) Frits Thaulow, 1847–1906, an impressionist, was initially a student of Hans Gude. He was later influenced by the art scene in Paris where he developed impressionist talents. Returning to Norway in 1880, he became one of the leading figures on the Norwegian art scene, together with Christian Krohg and Erik Werenskiold. Christian Krohg, 1852–1925, a realist painter, was also influenced by the Paris scene. He is remembered for his paintings of prostitutes which caused something of a scandal.Norwegian Artists from ArtCyclopedia. Retrieved 25 November 2008. Thorolf Holmboe (1866–1935) studied under Hans Gude in Berlin between 1886 and 1887 and Fernand Cormon in Paris between 1889 and 1891. He was inspired by many different styles at different points in his career, including Naturalism, Neo-romanticism, Realism and Impressionism. Nikolai Astrup (1880–1928) grew up in Jølster in the west of Norway. After studying art in Oslo and spending some time in Paris and in Germany, he returned to Jølster where he specialised in painting expressionist landscapes with clear, strong colors. He is considered to be one of the greatest Norwegian artists from the early 20th century.Nikolai Astrup from nikolai-astrup.com. Retrieved 28 November 2008. Lars Hertervig (1830–1902) from Tysvær in south-western Norway painted semi-fantastical works inspired by the coastal landscape in Ryfylke. Hertervig completed a number of works on paper using aquarelles and often making the paper base himself from scrapes of discarded pieces of paper. The art museum under the main museum, Stavanger Museum, in Stavanger, Rogaland (previously Rogaland Museum of Fine Art) has the most significant collection of works by Hertervig in Norway. Harald Sohlberg, (1869–1935), a neo- romanticist, is remembered for his paintings of Røros, and the Norwegian \\"national painting\\" Winter's Night in Rondane. ==Edvard Munch== Norway's most famous artist is certainly Edvard Munch (1863–1944), a symbolist/expressionist who became world-famous for The Scream, one of the most recognizable paintings in all art. It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man.Eggum, 1984, p. 10 ==Other names == Gunnar Berg's From Svolvær harbour, c. 1890. Being one of \\"the young dead\\", Berg is considered one of the finest painters of northern Norwegian nature. Other noteworthy 19th century painters are: August Cappelen, Peder Balke, Peter Nicolai Arbo, Eilif Peterssen, Gustav Wentzel, Oscar Wergeland, Erik Werenskiold, Asta Nørregaard, Amaldus Nielsen, Oda Krohg, Fritz Thaulow, Carl Sundt-Hansen, Christian Skredsvig, Gunnar Berg, Halfdan Egedius, Theodor Kittelsen, Harald Sohlberg.

On 20 September 2008 Henderson captured his very first title, winning the 2008 British Open. He scored notable wins over Edwin Max and Dave Chisnall to earn a spot into the televised stages which were shown live on Setanta Sports. He then defeated Gary Robson in the quarter-finals and Mareno Michels in the semis before avenging his defeat over Anderson twelve months previously by beating him in the final to win the £3,000 top prize. The win also helped Henderson finish fourth in the BDO International Grand Prix, earning him another £2,750 for his efforts. He also shot up the world rankings as a result of the win, moving him into the WDF's top 20. He then captured the German Open in 2009, beating Stephen Bunting in the final which elevated Henderson to seven in the WDF rankings. ===2010–2011=== Henderson then qualified for the 2010 BDO World Championship, winning one of four places available from the Inter-Playoff Qualifiers in Bridlington. He was defeated in the second round by Scott Waites. Henderson failed to qualify for the 2011 tournament, but did qualify for the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts where he finished third in his group. After being defeated by Mervyn King he was accused of standing in front of the oche, however after watching the match again, King admitted that he had over- reacted and apologised to Henderson in a pre-match interview. On 15 January 2011, Henderson came through qualifying at the PDC Q-School event and has therefore left the British Darts Organisation. On joining the PDC he said \\"It means everything to me the first two days were hard and I felt a lot of pressure today but to qualify, so I'm delighted I did it.\\" In the 2011 Derby championships, Henderson hit a nine-darter in his second leg of the second round beating Andy Hamilton 6–5 and earning £800.Planet Darts  Latest News  Newsdesk  Newsdesk  Home Win For Caven .

He threw for the match in the third set but lost the leg and the set as Chisnall fought back to level the game.

The opening four sets in Henderson's first round 2015 World Championship match against Vincent van der Voort went with throw to send it into a deciding set. Van der Voort hit a crucial 157 finish with Henderson waiting on 80 for the match and from there the Dutchman won back-to-back 14 dart legs to knock him out. A pair of last 16 finishes helped Henderson enter the UK Open at the third round stage and he eliminated Steve Douglas 9–7 and then retained his composure when Daryl Gurney won five legs in a row to lead 8–7 by beating him 9–8.

Henderson then took advantage of a poor performance from Rowby-John Rodriguez in the second round to thrash him 10–2 and reach his first major quarter-final in over four years, where he lost 10–4 to Peter Wright. After taking the opening set in his first round match at the 2016 World Championship, Henderson went on to lose 3–1 against Darren Webster. One semi-final and a quarter-final appearance in the qualifiers helped him finish 17th on the Order of Merit for the UK Open.

His second semi- final of the year was at the 14th Players Championship event and he was knocked out 6–4 by Michael van Gerwen.

He won the opening two sets against Andrew Gilding in the first round of the 2017 World Championship, before it was levelled at 2–2. Henderson missed one match dart in the deciding set and it would eventually go to a sudden-death leg. Gilding won the bull to throw first and took the leg to eliminate Henderson. Following Gary Anderson's withdrawal from the 2019 Premier League, Henderson was selected as one of nine 'contenders' to replace him. He played a one-off match against No. 1 PDC- ranked Michael van Gerwen on night five in Aberdeen. The match resulted in a draw. Henderson returned to the Premier League in 2020 under the new tag of 'Challenger', once again in Aberdeen.

Marine diesel oil has been condemned for its nimiety of sulfur, so many countries and organizations established regulations and laws on MDO use. Due to its lower price compared to more refined fuel, MDO is favored particularly by shipping industry. ==Specification== ISO 8217 of the International Standards Organization (ISO) is the primary standard of MDO. Marine fuels range in viscosity from less than one centistoke (cSt) to about 700 cSt at 50°C (122°F). (1 cSt = 1 mm2/s.) And higher viscosity grades are preheated during use to bring their viscosity into the range suitable for fuel injection (8 to 27 cSt). But MDO does not need to be preheated before using. According to Chevron, MDO has a sulfur limit varies from 1 to 4.5 percent by mass for different grades and Sulfur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). ==Manufacturing procedure== MDO is made from a catalytic cracking and visbreaking refinery. The catalytic cracking operation breaks large molecules into small molecules. It happens in high temperature and with appropriate catalyst. Visbreaking is a process that turn the bottom product of the vacuum unit, which has extremely high viscosity, into lower viscosity, marketable product. In visbreaking, a relatively mild thermal cracking operation is performed. And the amount of cracking is limited by the overruling requirement to safeguard the heavy fuel stability. ==Use== The market of MDO is much smaller than on-highway diesel. According to the a 2004 U.S. Diesel Fuel Sales statistics from U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Marine shipping only takes 3.7% of total diesel market. On the other hand, On-highway diesel takes up 59.5% of diesel fuel sales. This small sales share of MDO is due to the high proportion of petroleum resid that made it can be used on large marine engines. According to Chevron, petroleum resid, or inorganic salts, in the fuel result in injector tip deposits that prevent the injector from creating the desired fuel spray pattern. But those low-speed, large marine diesel engines are appropriate for using fuel containing large amounts of petroleum resid. ==Regulations and restrictions== The International Maritime Organization (IMO) develops regulations for marine shipping. Among those regulations, MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) is the most widely adopted one. MARPOL is the main international convention covering the prevention of operational or accidental pollution of the marine environment by ships. Inside IMO, there is a committee called MEPC(Marine Environment Protection Committee). MEPC has meetings periodically and discuss resolutions to current marine pollution by adding amendments to its official documents. ==References== Category:Liquid fuels Category:Diesel fuel ","title":"Marine diesel oil"},{"id":"20429224","text":"Eva-Marie Gunilla Håkansson (born 7 October 1960 in Ljungby, Kronoberg) is a former Swedish Olympic swimmer.

He was born near Launceston, Cornwall, the son of Jordan of Trecarrel (died c. 1180). He studied in London under Master Henry of Northampton, a canon of St Paul's. He was received as an Augustinian canon sometime after 1170 at Holy Trinity, Aldgate. His first work was inspired by a synod in London where he heard the bishop of London, Gilbert Foliot, preach. This was the Pantheologus, a collection of biblical material assembled as a sourcebook for preachers, which he finally completed in 1189. He became prior of Holy Trinity in 1197 and remained in office until his death on 7 July 1221. In 1210 Peter was one of two intermediaries between King John of England and Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, during a series of negotiations which failed to achieve an end to the interdict. Peter dedicated his Liber disputationum contra Symonem Iudeum to the exiled Stephen Langton. Peter also compiled the Liber revelationum (Lambeth Palace Library, MS 51). This is a vast collection of visions relating to the next world, compiled between the years 1200 and 1206. The work includes several personal stories which provide much evidence for Peter's life and career, including the \\"Visions of Ailsi,\\" Peter's grandfather. It also includes two important otherworld visions relating to St. Patrick's Purgatory, the well-known Tractatus de Purgatorio Sancti Patricii, which is provisionally dated to between 1135 and 1154, and another work related directly to Peter by a monk from Mellifont Abbey, who heard second-hand of this other vision, which took place c. 1170. Peter was buried in the chapel of the Blessed Virgin at Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate. The priory was dissolved in 1532, and nothing of the buildings survive other than a few arches in an office building on the site. ==External References== * Lambeth Palace Library MS 51 ==References== Category:1221 deaths Category:12th-century Latin writers Category:13th-century Latin writers Category:12th-century English people Category:13th-century English people Category:Medieval Cornish people Category:People from Launceston, Cornwall Category:12th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:Augustinian canons Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:13th- century English writers ","title":"Peter of Cornwall"},{"id":"20429346","text":"Koinup is an image and video hosting service, web portal and online community for virtual world users. It is used both as a photo and video repository platform and as a tool to share virtual world screenshots, photographs and machinima. , it claims to host more than 100,000 items uploaded by its members and reaches about 100,000 visitors monthly. Centered on the concept of “Share your Virtual Life\\", Koinup offers a social networking platform for all virtual world inhabitants. ==History== Koinup was developed by Koinup Srl, a Brescia, Italy-based company founded in March 2007. The service was launched in September 2007, preceded by a four-month beta period. Initially, the two founders Pierluigi Casolari and Edoardo Turelli served respectively as chief executive officer and chief technical officer. Along with competitors such as gamerDNA, Koinup followed a trend in the social network scenery at that time by building a social network for online games. ==Features== Koinup is a free service, allowing members to upload up to 1.5 gigabytes of photo and video content. Currently, Koinup does not offer a paid premium plan. Uploaders can add tags to their entries and create photo or video galleries. Uploaded content can be shared either by embedding web widgets on websites, or by using a set of social media sharing tools. Koinup also features tools aimed at creating a bridge between virtual worlds and the website. These tools allow users to interact with their Koinup account while they are in virtual worlds. Particularly, members can send postcards directly from the clients to their Koinup galleries without leaving the virtual worlds. One of the most popular features on the website is the Koinup Places Section. Koinup Places allow users to geotag virtual world locations and upload them on Koinup. This feature creates a user-generated directory of the best places hosted in virtual worlds. According to a recent publication, more than 1,000 virtual places have already been suggested by the Koinup community. On April 22, 2010, Koinup expanded their service by launching a paid application on the Nokia Store featuring wallpapers of virtual world related image content. With the launch of Metaverse Wallpapers on March 11, 2011 on Apple's App Store, a similar application became available for iOS devices. ==Interoperability== One of the main challenges faced by Koinup is the issue of interoperability between virtual worlds. Right now, the virtual world scene is made up of numerous standalone walled gardens that do not communicate with each other. There are neither standardized tools for moving and sharing the avatar identity from one world to another nor ways to interact with multiple virtual worlds from a single dashboard. In response to this problem, one of Koinup's goals is to allow users to manage both the content and the friends they have in various virtual worlds with a single account. ==ReferencesCompany Information Category:Companies of Italy Category:Companies established in 2007 Category:Italian social networking websites Category:Virtual reality communities ","title":"Koinup"},{"id":"20429350","text":"European Council of Religious Leaders (ECRL) is a European interreligious council for cooperation between senior leaders of religious traditions represented in Europe (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Zoroastrianism). The ECRL is one out of five regional interreligious councils within the global movement, Religions for Peace. The Council held its inaugural meeting in Oslo in 2002. == Vision and work == Vision: The major religious communities in Europe cooperate effectively for peace and reconciliation, in Europe and beyond. This vision grows out of the shared commitment of faith traditions to human dignity and the right to live in peace. On this basis religious leaders have committed themselves to work together in order to prevent conflict, promote peaceful coexistence and encourage their communities to do the same. European Council of Religious Leaders works on the basis of mutual respect and appreciation for religious diversity. Based in the different religious traditions and Holy Books, the Council encourages a common moral responsibility for the prevention of conflict and the promotion of dialogue. Values that are deeply held and widely shared offer guidance to the work. In a continent where religion has often been seen as a source of conflict, the European Council of Religious Leaders seeks to be a resource for peace. The ECRL aims at promoting inter-religious cooperation in Europe and beyond. The work of the Council includes annual council meetings, participation in conferences, delegation visits to conflict areas and maintaining contacts across religious boundaries. The secretariat of the ECRL is situated in Oslo and the Moderator is Bishop Emeritus Gunnar Stålsett. === The European Council of Religious Leaders' Berlin Declaration on Interreligious Dialogue === As a guideline for the work of the Council and to spread knowledge of inter-religious dialogue, the ECRL, on its Council meeting in Berlin in 2008, issued a declaration: : Preamble : 2008 has been declared the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. In a pluralistic Europe dialogue across dividing lines – be they cultural, linguistic or religious – is of the greatest importance. All over Europe issues related to identity are hotly debated, and often religion is at the centre of discussions. Europe and Europeans are also constantly interacting with the rest of the world, experiencing the joys and the challenges of communicating across cultural and religious divides. : Sometimes religion is seen as an obstacle to peaceful coexistence and social cohesion. At the same time we know that some of the most pressing challenges in our time – climate change, poverty, migration, marginalisation of women, discrimination and terrorism – can only be solved if we unite resources across traditional dividing lines. : 3 to 5 March 2008 the European Council of Religious Leaders – Religions for Peace met in Berlin, a city which symbolises a history of division in Europe as well as reconciliation and new beginnings. As religious leaders we support initiatives to further dialogue in this continent. In order to promote bold, responsible and well-informed interreligious dialogue on all levels of European society, we hereby offer the Berlin Declaration on Interreligious Dialogue: : (1) Religion permeates Europe: Christianity, Islam and Judaism are part of European history. Today other great religious traditions have also found a place in the continent. In every town or village in Europe there is at least one house of worship: a Church, a Mosque or a Synagogue. To ensure a prosperous and harmonious future for Europe, people of different faiths must live peacefully together. : (2) Interreligious dialogue emphasises both our similarities and our differences: In interreligious dialogue we acknowledge that human beings of all faiths share certain experiences, needs and longings. We also acknowledge that we are different from each other in many respects and will remain different. Our religious traditions have formed different social rules and models which sometimes contradict each other. One aim of interreligious dialogue is to reduce false perceptions of difference and culture gaps, while we respect that something about our dialogue partner will necessarily remain other (or even alien) to us. : (3) Interreligious dialogue should promote respect for human rights: Interreligious dialogue should respect the shared values found within all great religious traditions and embodied within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Commitment to human rights does not preclude a variety of world views or ethical systems and interpretations. : (4) The invitation to the dialogue is open: The more we differ, the more we need dialogue. It is not a precondition for dialogue that we share a wide spectrum of values and ideas. Only clear breaches of respect for the most fundamental values, such as the right to life and the rule of law, should exclude people from being invited into dialogue. While the invitation is open, everyone must abide by the agreed rules of a particular dialoguing situation. Women and young people have important perspectives and contributions to offer and should have distinct voices in interreligious dialogue. : (5) Interreligious dialogue is a mode of relating to other faiths and has a transforming potential: Interreligious dialogue is a particular way of interacting with others through which all who are involved can be transformed. Dialogue on issues of faith and identity is not negotiations, because we do not seek agreement, it is not debates, because we do not seek to win over the other, and it is more than a discussion because we contribute not only rational arguments but personal and emotive stories and experiences and thus engage existentially with each other. : (6) Interreligious dialogue affirms the integrity of religious beliefs: In dialogue we come closer to each other without necessarily becoming more similar. All who engage in interreligious dialogue should do so with full integrity in their own religious tradition and without compromise to what they hold dear. In interreligious dialogue we do not aim at creating a new or shared religion. : (7) Interreligious dialogue addresses asymmetric power relationships with honesty: The power relationship between different religious groups is sometimes asymmetric. This can be caused by for example poverty/wealth, language, gender or numbers (minority/majority). Interreligious dialogue must not be used to obscure this. In dialogue the facts and experiences of asymmetric power should be addressed, and mechanisms should be found to give voice to those who struggle to be heard. : (8) Interreligious dialogue furthers stakeholdership and participation in society: Interreligious dialogue should address a wide spectrum of issues. It is important to explore shared values and address common concerns, but one should not shy away from addressing issues on which there are disagreement, uncertainty or even fear of the other. Some current trends, such as rapid development of new technology in biology, medicine and communication and changing understandings of family are closely linked to questions of values and identities. Religions do not agree on the responses to these questions, but should discuss these matters with openness and courage. Dialogue is not a means to a predefined end, but it is intrinsic to genuine dialogue that it furthers mutual understanding, respect for differences, and the participation and stakeholdership of all in society and thus strengthens social cohesion. : (9) Interreligious dialogue leads to common action: A full understanding of interreligious dialogue includes common action – diapraxis. The dignity of human life, to which all religions are committed, is challenged for example through poverty, violence, abuse of women and children, discrimination of migrants and dramatic changes in the natural environment. Different religions can address these issues together, although our ethics may draw on different resources. Interreligious dialogue should aim at mustering the resources of varying religious traditions to take up the challenges which Europe faces today. Through common action we learn to understand better ourselves, each other, and the world in which we live. : (10) Structures for interreligious cooperation are assets in times of crisis: Repeatedly religion plays a role in situations of conflict. Established and trustful structures for interreligious dialogue are a tremendous strength when relationships between communities deteriorate. Religious leaders must address dangerous and violent perversions of religion within their own communities. : (11) Knowledge and confidence in a tradition further interreligious understanding: Open and trustful interreligious dialogue is furthered by a secure knowledge of one’s own religious tradition as well as that of others. This knowledge should be taught in a spirit of peace and respect for the different traditions. Many religions make truth claims that are mutually exclusive. This is no more an impediment to dialogue and the full participation in society than the explicit or implicit truth claims of secular ideologies. Dialogue between religions, cultures and social groups is often dialogue across opposing truth claims and world views. : (12) Religion has a natural place also in the public sphere: Religion continues to have an important role to play in the public life of a Europe with many religions. This applies to minorities and majorities alike. The public display of religious symbols or celebration of religious festivals should neither be seen as offensive to other religions nor as a threat to social cohesion. Religious minorities in Europe generally do not feel offended by for example public Christmas or Easter celebrations in countries where this is a tradition as long as their own freedom of religion is respected. : (13) Religious leaders, religious people and the authorities share responsibility for interreligious dialogue: Convinced that interreligious dialogue is important for a peaceful and prosperous Europe we call on religious leaders of all religious traditions and in every corner of Europe to join in interreligious dialogue based on the principles outlined in this declaration. We call on all religious people in Europe to enter into the most important dialogue of all, “the dialogue of life”, in the local community, in families and workplaces with confidence and courage. We call on the authorities on local, national and European level to engage constructively with religious communities in mutual respect for each other’s different roles, and to create frameworks within which religious practices and interreligious dialogue based on the principles in this declaration may be further developed and prosper for the benefit of peaceful coexistence in Europe. ==Members== The council consists of senior religious leaders representing religions/denominations of longer history of presence in Europe, religious traditions with shorter presence in Europe and currently one ex officio member representing the Religions for Peace movement. ===Moderator, since 2018 President=== *2002-2012: Gunnar Stålsett *since 2012: Dr. Revd Thomas Wipf ===Council members=== Jewish *Rabbi Izhak Dayan, Switzerland *Charlotte Dunner, Great Britain *Rabbi René Gutman, France *Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister, Austria *Rabbi Awraham Soetendorp, Netherlands Muslim *Mufti Nedzad Grabus, Slovenia *Ms. Merhézia Labidi Maiza, France *Shaykh Ibrahim Mogra, Great Britain *M.A. Özlem Nas, Germany *Imam Yahya Pallavicini, Italy Christian: Orthodox *Rev Dr Andreas Andreopoulos, Great Britain *Metropolitan Emmanuel, France *Fr Heikki Huttunen, Finland Christian: Catholic *Mr. Etienna De Jonghe, Belgium *Bishop Bernt Eidsvig, Treasurer, Norway *Sister Madeleine Fredell, Sweden *Sister Clare Elisabeth Jardine, Italy *Bishop William Kenney, Great Britain *Dr habil.

The series is based on the Alloy Entertainment book How to Teach Filthy Rich Girls by best-selling author Zoey Dean.Shows A-Z from TheFutonCritic.com The series focuses mainly on the character of Megan Smith (JoAnna Garcia), a recent Yale graduate who has been hired to tutor two spoiled rich twins, Rose (Lucy Hale) and Sage Baker (Ashley Newbrough) in a wealthy area of Palm Beach, Florida. Other characters include friends and family members of Megan and the twins. ==Main characters== The following are characters who have led the plot, as listed in the order of the opening television credits of each episode. {  style=\\"width:98%; margin:auto; background-color:#FFFFFF\\" - ! style=\\"background-color: #A7B0C1;\\" Name ! style=\\"background-color: #A7B0C1;\\" Actor or actress ! style=\\"background-color: #A7B0C1;\\" Seasons ! style=\\"background-color: #A7B0C1;\\" Episode count - style=\\"background-color: #F2F2F2;\\"  Megan Smith  JoAnna Garcia  1  18 -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" sadvfsdavs A Yale graduate who grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Megan is a frustrated writer. In the first episode she leaves her job at a New York women's magazine, because career advancement within the magazine only gives her the option to write about subjects she considers banal, rather than opening her up to the freedom of topic she had been expecting. However, a stroke of networking luck means that her former boss can secure her a position as a tutor with a wealthy and well-respected family. Megan returns to South Florida to assume the role of tutor to the Baker twins, who happen to live on the rich side of her hometown. Megan's quirky and pro-knowledge nature is a stark contrast to the sophisticated and rich life that the twins live and makes it increasingly difficult for Megan to do her job. Despite moving back so near to home, the only local person Megan tells is her best friend Charlie. As a child, she was abandoned by her mother and she and her sister were left in the hands of their alcoholic father. Megan buried herself in school work and cut off contact with her family after she went to Yale. Megan has a rocky relationship with her sister Lily, and due to a tough family life, is very wary of getting back in touch with her father, even asking her sister to cover for her, once Lily discovers Megan back in town. Megan befriends her neighbour named Will, who initially appears to be a potential love-interest, until Lily starts dating him. Megan has been hurt in the past, and therefore projects her need for a family onto Sage and Rose, the twins she is tutoring, whilst idolising their Grandmother Laurel, hoping to write her biography. The main drama comes from Megan's misplaced need for affection, as she attempts to fix others problems instead of fixing exactly the same ones in her own life. -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" bgcolor=\\"#A7B0C1\\" - - style=\\"background-color: #F2F2F2;\\"  Rose Baker  Lucy Hale  1  18 -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" sadvfsdavs Rose is the meeker of the Baker twins and has big dreams of attending Duke University to honor her mother's memory. While Rose is more inclined to accept Megan's help and guidance, she feels obligated to follow her sister in what she wants to do. However, she's doing worse in school than Sage, and it becomes hard for her to do well in school and live up to social expectations. She was almost forced to repeat freshman year before Megan made a deal with the Dean. Rose begins as the quieter twin, but has a lot in common with Megan, as she also likes to try to make everyone happy, instead of thinking about her own problems. She attempts to fix things through lying, for example, after Lily appears to steal one of her tennis bracelets, and is accused in public by Megan, she lies and says she lent it to a friend named Precious and simply forgot about it, thinking that would cause Megan and Lily to make up. She looks up to her sister Sage to the extent that she has no true outside friends, as she thinks her relationship with her sister is all she needs in life. -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" bgcolor=\\"#A7B0C1\\" - - style=\\"background- color: #F2F2F2;\\"  Sage Baker  Ashley Newbrough  1  18 -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" sadvfsdavs Strong and opinionated, Sage is extremely protective of Rose, and also lets no-one else in between them. Sage instantly resents Megan for trying to rein her in and for stealing the attention of Rose. Sage is determined to become famous, in part to rub it in her \\"friends'\\" faces, and doesn't see school as a priority in her life. She takes the opposite road to Rose, in the sense that she is so focused on a career as a model/singer/whatever the publicist thinks she can do, rather than schoolwork. Sage manages to maintain \\"B\\"-level grades and doesn't think having Megan around is necessary. Sage doesn't realize how important school is to Rose, and that Rose is simply not as intelligent as her. Sage repeatedly tries to sabotage Megan, going so far as to bring her estranged and bitter sister back into her life. Sage thinks she has Rose's best interests at heart, and means well, but where Rose meddles to make things better for others, Sage meddles to make things better for herself, thinking that she knows best. She falls in love with a new cook named Luis. -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" bgcolor=\\"#A7B0C1\\" - - style=\\"background-color: #F2F2F2;\\"  Charlie Hogan  Michael Cassidy  1  14 -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" sadvfsdavs Charlie is a childhood friend of Megan's who stayed behind in Palm Beach after Megan went to Yale. He eventually dropped out of college and works as a waiter at a beach restaurant called The Crab Shack. Charlie harbors a secret crush for Megan, making him prone to doing her favors and helping her with situations that he otherwise doesn't care about. Megan uses him as someone to complain to, and he obliges. While Charlie thinks he is in love with Megan initially, when he meets Mandy, a girl who will talk straight instead of thinking about other's feelings too much, she helps him realize that he just uses Megan as an excuse not to move into new relationships. By idolizing Megan and never saying how he feels, he does not ever have to deal with the reality of a grownup relationship. He eventually accepts that Megan will never be with him, and tries unsuccessfully to push her out of his life.Privileged Interview - Michael Cassidy from YouTube -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" bgcolor=\\"#A7B0C1\\" - - style=\\"background-color: #F2F2F2;\\"  Marco Giordani  Allan Louis  1  17 -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" sadvfsdavs The talented personal chef of Laurel Limoges, who never appears to sleep, Marco is always on-hand to provide advice for Megan. He is the closest thing Megan has to a friend in her new environment. He aspires to open a glamorous restaurant one day and is continually praised by others for his excellent cooking skills. Unlike Charlie, Marco is brutally honest when helping Megan deal with her problems, though he finds the dramas in her life entertaining. Even though he is mildly irritated at her inability to understand that he is always working when she asks, and he has a life beyond the house, her dramas do keep him amusingly diverted. He is gay, but aside from that we never learn about his outside life. His kitchen is a primary setting in the series. -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" bgcolor=\\"#A7B0C1\\" - - style=\\"background-color: #F2F2F2;\\"  Will Davis  Brian Hallisay  1  16 -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" sadvfsdavs Will is the handsome and charming, not to mention wealthy, next door neighbor of Laurel Limoges. Megan had romantic feelings for him, but the situation became more complicated when her sister Lily hooked up with him after a party. He initially dates Lily, but once her character is compromised, and he cannot trust her, he begins to set his sights on Megan. He wants to be taken for more than the Son of a Billionaire, and so rather than get a job from his dad, he works as a runner for a top photographer. He is interested in a career as a sports photographer, but he feels he needs to work his way up in the industry like everyone else.Privileged Interview - Brian Hallisay from YouTube -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" bgcolor=\\"#A7B0C1\\" - - style=\\"background-color: #F2F2F2;\\"  Lily Smith  Kristina Apgar  1  10 -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" sadvfsdavs Lily is the estranged sister of Megan who reenters her life after her return to Palm Beach. Lily and Megan had a falling out after Megan came home from college to find Lily having sex with her boyfriend. Lily is the opposide of Megan. She reacted in a different way to Megan - where difficulties made Megan throw herself into work, Lily rebelled, seemingly waiting for someone to stop her. She is continually on the defensive, and like Megan, doesn't trust easily. Lily becomes romantically involved with Will, but is surprised to learn that Megan was interested in him. While Lily continually claims that she has changed, she still exhibits behaviors and qualities that make her appear jaded.Privileged CW website -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" bgcolor=\\"#A7B0C1\\" - - style=\\"background-color: #F2F2F2;\\"  Laurel Limoges  Anne Archer  1  10 -  colspan=\\"5\\" height=\\"5\\" sadvfsdavs Laurel is the grandmother of Rose and Sage Baker.

Outside Israel, it originally became known as \\"Ben-Gurion rice\\" (Hebrew: אורז בן-גוריון, órez Ben-Gurion), though it is mainly called \\"ptitim\\" nowadays. ==History== Original rice-shaped \\"Ben-Gurion rice\\" Ptitim was created in 1953, during the austerity period in Israel. Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, asked Eugen Proper, one of the founders of the Osem food company, to devise a wheat-based substitute for rice. The company took up the challenge and developed ptitim, which is made of hard wheat flour and toasted in an oven. Ptitim was initially produced with a rice-shape, but after its success Otem also began to produce a ball-shaped variety inspired by couscous. Consequently, ptitim is sometimes called \\"Ben-Gurion rice\\". ==Preparation== Ptitim is made by extruding dough through a round mold, before it is cut and toasted, giving it the uniform natural-grain-like shape and its unique nutty flavor. Unlike common types of pasta and couscous, ptitim was factory-made from the outset, and therefore is rarely seen home-made from scratch. The store-bought product is easy and quick to prepare. Ptitim is popular among Israeli children, who eat it plain, or mixed with fried onion and tomato paste. Ptitim is now produced in ring, star, and heart shapes for added appeal. For health-conscious consumers, whole wheat and spelt flour varieties are also available. While considered a children's food in Israel, ptitim is sometimes used in dishes even at the \\"trendiest restaurants\\" in other countries. In the United States, it can be found on the menus of contemporary American chefs, and can be bought in gourmet markets. Ptitim-style couscous prepared as a dish of the Israeli cuisine Ptitim can be used in many different types of dishes, both hot and cold. The grains retain their shape and texture even when reheated, and they do not clump together. Commonly, ptitim is prepared with sautéed onions or garlic (vegetables, meat, chicken or sausage can also be added). The ptitim grains may be fried for a short time before adding water. They can also be baked, go in soup, served in a pie, used for stuffing, or made as a risotto. Ptitim may also be used in other dishes as a substitute for pasta or rice. American chef Charlie Trotter has produced a number of recipes for ptitim-based gourmet dishes, even as a dessert. ==Similar products== Pearl-shaped ptitim is very similar to the Ashkenazi Jewish farfel, which was brought to Israel by Ashkenazi Jews from Europe beginning in the 1800s. Farfel was likely ptitim's predecessor, as the two are very similar and are often substituted for each other. Ptitim is also similar in shape to the Levantine and Maghrebi pearled couscous which pre-date it, known as maftoul or moghrabieh in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestinian territories and Syria. While the Levantine dish is a coated couscous, ptitim is an extruded paste, and the two are very different in terms of taste and preparation. Ptitim is also similar to the Berber berkoukes (aka abazine) and the Sardinian fregula, but these, too, unlike ptitim, are rolled and coated products. The ptitim variety may also resemble some products of the pastina family, in particular acini di pepe, orzo (\\"risoni\\") and stellini. However, unlike pastina, the ptitim grains are pre-baked/toasted to give them their chewy texture and nutty flavor. ==See also== * Levantine cuisine * Tarhonya ==References *How to Cook Israeli Couscous *Israeli Couscous Recipes Category:Israeli cuisine Category:Types of pasta Category:Middle Eastern cuisine Category:Israeli inventions ","title":"Ptitim"},{"id":"20429359","text":"Mothel () is a small village near the Comeragh Mountains in the northern part of County Waterford, Ireland.

(Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) The Orleans Collection was a very important collection of over 500 paintings formed by Philippe d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans, mostly acquired between about 1700 and his death in 1723.Louis-François Dubois de Saint-Gelais, 1727. Description des tableaux du Palais Royal avec la vie des peintres à la tête de leurs ouvrages, Preface. Reprinted 1737 and 1972 (Geneva). The descriptions are online at the Getty Provenance Index - choose Archival documents, and search with Orleans Collection in \\"Owner's name\\". Apart from the great royal- become-national collections of Europe it is arguably the greatest private collection of Western art, especially Italian, ever assembled, and probably the most famous,Watson, 202, and Penny, 461 and Reitlinger, 26 helped by the fact that most of the collection has been accessible to the public since it was formed, whether in Paris, or subsequently in London, Edinburgh and elsewhere. The core of the collection was formed by 123 paintings from the collection of Queen Christina of Sweden, which itself had a core assembled from the war booty of the sacks by Swedish troops of Munich in 1632 and Prague in 1648 during the Thirty Years War.Penny, 463 After the French Revolution the collection was sold by Louis Philippe d'Orléans, Philippe Égalité, and most of it acquired by an aristocratic English consortium led by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. Much of the collection has been dispersed, but significant groups remain intact, having passed by inheritance.Penny gives a concise history of the collection in a few thousand words, with special reference to the paintings in the National Gallery. Watson covers the history from Prague to London in 175 pages; his book is the history of the Frick Veronese. From their bibliographies, there do not appear to be any full listings in English of the collections of Rudolf, Christina or the Dukes of Orléans, still less ones with current locations. One such group is the Sutherland Loan or Bridgewater Loan, including sixteen works from the Orleans Collection,Penny, 466 in the National Gallery of Scotland, and another is at Castle Howard, Yorkshire. There are twenty-five paintings formerly in the collection now in the National Gallery, London, which have arrived there by a number of different routes.Penny, 461 lists 25, though for example the National Gallery catalogue for the Flemish School (Martin, 1970) lists other Orléans provenances that are not certain in the \\"Index of Previous Owners\\". There are also, in 2008, at least two further ex-Orleans paintings on loan to the National Gallery, a Guercino and the Gentileschi Finding of Moses, for which see below. The collection is of central interest for the history of collecting, and of public access to art. It figured in two of the periods when art collections were most subject to disruption and dispersal: the mid-17th century and the period after the French Revolution.Watson discusses both periods in \\"Interludes\\" at the end of his Parts 2 and 5. Reitlinger's Chapter 2 deals with the latter period. ==Rudolf and Christina== Allegory of Wisdom and Strength (c. 1580) by Veronese, originally painted for Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor, now in the Frick Collection, New York. The paintings looted from Prague Castle had mostly been amassed by the obsessive collector Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor (1552–1612), whose own bulk purchases had included the famous collection of Emperor Charles V's leading minister Cardinal Granvelle (1517–86), which he had forced Granvelle's nephew and heir to sell to him. Granvelle had been the \\"greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of Titian and Leoni and many other artists\\",Trevor-Roper, 112. One Granvelle painting that seems to have made the full Prague-Stockholm-Paris- London journey is a version of the Correggio variously called The School of Love, The Education of Cupid or Venus with Mercury and Cupid, of which the prime version is now in the National Gallery. The prime version was bought by Charles I, then by the King of Spain in 1650, returning to England only in 1815 via the collections of Manuel de Godoy and Joachim Murat. including his protégé Antonis Mor. The Swedes only skimmed the cream of the Habsburg collection, as the works now in Vienna, Madrid and Prague show.A stray Veronese of Rudolf's, overlooked since his time, turned up in the castle in 1962. Most of the booty remained in Sweden after Christina's departure for exile: she only took about 70 to 80 paintings with her, including about 25 portraits of her friends and family, and some 50 paintings, mostly Italian, from the Prague loot, as well as statues, jewels, 72 tapestries, and various other works of art. She was concerned that the royal collections would be claimed by her successor, and prudently sent them ahead to Antwerp in a ship before she abdicated.Watson, 127-9 Christina greatly expanded her collection during her exile in Rome, for example adding the five small Raphael predella panels from the Colonna Altarpiece, including the Agony in the Garden now reunited with the main panel in New York, which were bought from a convent near Rome.Watson, 158. The other panels are now in London: two at the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the other National Gallery; National Gallery page on the division of the Raphael altarpiece. She was apparently given Titian's Death of Actaeon by the greatest collector of the age, Archduke Leopold William of Austria, Viceroy in Brussels - she received many such gifts from Catholic royalty after her conversion,Penny, 255. It is clearly shown in one of the Tenier's views of Leopold's galleries. Leopold's collection is now part of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. and gave some generous gifts herself, notably Albrecht Dürer's panels of Adam and Eve to Philip IV of Spain (now Prado). On her death she left her collection to Cardinal Decio Azzolino, who himself died within a year, leaving the collection to his nephew, who sold it to Don Livio Odescalchi, commander of the Papal army,Watson,168-9; Odescalchi was the nephew of Pope Innocent XI, though in fact his money was inherited and his career greatly improved after his uncle's death. at which point it contained 275 paintings, 140 of them Italian.Watson, 170 The year after Odescalchi's death in 1713, his heirs began protracted negotiations with the great French connoisseur and collector Pierre Crozat, acting as intermediary for Philippe, duc d'Orléans. The sale was finally concluded and the paintings delivered in 1721.Penny, 462-3, and Metropolitan The French experts complained that Christina had cut down several paintings to fit her ceilings,Penny, 462 and had over-restored some of the best works, especially the Correggios, implicating Carlo Maratti.Watson, 196-7 ==Royal owners== File:Joseph_Heintz_d._Ä._002.jpgRudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, 1552–1612, deposed by his family after he turned into a recluse File:Swedish queen Drottning Kristina portrait by Sébastien Bourdon stor.jpgChristina of Sweden, 1626–1689, went into exile when she wanted to convert to Catholicism File:Philippe d'Orleans, regent, et Marie Madeleine de la Vieuville, Comtesse de Parabere (Jean-Baptiste Santerre).jpgPhilippe d'Orléans, 1674–1723, Regent of France, who assembled the Orleans Collection File:Philippe d'Orléans en grand-maitre du GOF.jpg\\"Philippe Égalité\\", Louis Philippe d'Orléans, 1747–1793, guillotined in the Reign of Terror ==Collection in Paris== The Raising of Lazarus by Sebastiano del Piombo, extracted by Phillippe from Narbonne Cathedral and later \\"NG1\\", the first entry in the National Gallery catalogue The Orleans collection was housed in the magnificent setting of the Palais-Royal, the Paris seat of the Dukes of Orléans. Only 15 paintings in the printed catalogue of 1727 had been inherited by Philippe II from his father, Philippe de France, Duke of Orléans, Monsieur (1640–1701); the \\"collection\\" as catalogued was by no means all the art owned by the Dukes, but recorded only that part kept together in the Palais-Royal for public viewing.Penny, 462 & 464, and Watson, 185-6, who says Phillippe inherited over 550 paintings (including miniatures) from his father in all. He also inherited small but high quality collections from Henrietta Anne Stuart, his father's first wife, in 1701 and his father's lover, the Chevalier de Lorraine in 1702.Watson, 185-6. According to Reitlinger, his most active phase of collecting began in about 1715,Reitlinger, 27, see also Watson, 185ff the year he became Regent on the death of his uncle Louis XIV, after which he no doubt acquired an extra edge in negotiations. He also began to be presented with many paintings, most notably the three of Titian's poesies, now in Boston and shared by Edinburgh and London, which were given by Philip V of Spain to the French ambassador, the Duc de Gramont, who in turn presented them to the Regent.Brigstocke, 181 for the two \\"Diana\\" subjects in Edinburgh/London. He also bought the damaged Perseus and Andromeda (Wallace Collection), once owned by van Dyck, in France. See Ingamells, 1985. Christina's collection only joined Philippe's shortly before the end of his life and most of the other works were bought in France, like the Sebastiano del Piombo Raising of Lazarus, with some from the Netherlands or Italy, like the Nicolas Poussin set of the Seven Sacraments, bought from a Dutch collection by Cardinal Dubois in 1716.Penny, 462 and Robert W. Berger, 1999. Public Access to Art in Paris, \\"The Galérie d'Orléans, Palais Royal\\", pp 201-08. Other sources included the heirs of Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin, and Cardinal Dubois, with an especially important group from Colbert's heir the Marquis de Seignelay, and others from the Dukes of Noailles, Gramont, Vendôme and other French collectors.Buchanan, Vol I, 14 and in his listings, Penny and Watson passim The paintings were housed in two suites of large rooms running side by side down the west or library wing of the palace, with the smaller Dutch and Flemish works in smaller rooms.Penny, 464 The gallery suites of rooms still retained much of their original furniture, porcelain and wall-decorations from their use by Phillippe's father as grand reception rooms and according to a visitor in 1765 it was \\"impossible to imagine anything more richly furnished or decorated with more art and taste\\". Rearrangements had been made to accommodate the paintings; connoisseurs particularly praised the Galerie à la Lanterne, with its even, sunless top light diffused from the cupola overhead.Penny, 462-5 has more details on the architectural setting For most of the 18th century it was easy to visit the collection, and very many people did so, helped by the printed catalogue of 1727, republished in 1737, Description des Tableaux du Palais Royal.Description des tableaux du Palais Royal avec la vie des peintres à la tête de leurs ouvrages, text by Louis- François Dubois de Saint-Gelais (1669-1737), who was later the secretary of the Académie royal de peinture et de sculpture; it was the first published catalogue of a French princely collection. This contained 495 paintings, though some continued to be added, and a few disposed of.Penny, 462. Buchanan lists several paintings from the catalogue that did not reach London. Paolo Veronese's Scorn, one of the four Allegories of Love, c. 1575. The series was first recorded in the collection of the Holy Roman Emperor in Prague in 1637, before passing via Sweden to the Orleans Collection. It was sold at auction in 1800 in London to the Earl of Darnley, whose heirs sold it to the National Gallery, London in 1890. Paintings were hung, not by 'schools' or by subject but in order to maximise their effects in juxtaposition, in the 'mixed school' manner espoused by Pierre Crozat for his grand private collection in his Parisian hôtel.The 'mixed school' method of hanging had been established in the late seventeenth-century writings of André Félibien and Roger de Piles (Berger 1999:200). The mixture on a wall of erotic and religious subjects was disapproved of by some visitors. The collection was most notable for Italian paintings of the High and Late Renaissance, especially Venetian works. The collection included no fewer than five of the poesies painted for Philip II of Spain, of which two are now shared between Edinburgh and London, two always in London (Wallace Collection and National Gallery), and one in Boston. A series of four mythological allegories by Veronese are now divided between the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, and the Frick Collection (with two, one illustrated above) and Metropolitan Museum in New York. Another Veronese series, the four Allegories of Love now in the National Gallery, hung as overdoors in the central salon, which also held the larger Veronese series, three of the Titian poesies and Correggios. The collection included (on the contemporary attributions) 28 Titians, most now regarded as workshop pieces but including several of his finest works,At least one work, The Holy Family with St John the Baptist now in the Sutherland Loan, has moved in the other direction, catalogued from 1727 until the 20th century as by Palma il Vecchio, but now seen as an early Titian. See Brigstocke, 171. For one old list of the Titians in the collection see A. Hume, 1827 12 Raphaels, 16 Guido Renis, 16 Veroneses, 12 Tintorettos, 25 paintings by Annibale Carracci and 7 by Lodovico Caracci, 3 major Correggios plus ten no longer accepted as by him,Reitlinger, 6-7, supplemented by Buchanan Vol I and 3 Caravaggios. Attributions no longer accepted, and probably regarded as dubious even then were 2 Michelangelos, and 3 Leonardos.Watson, 251-3, Buchanan lists There were few works from the 15th century, except for a Giovanni Bellini. The collection reflected the general contemporary confusion outside Spain as to what the works of the great Velázquez actually looked like; the works attributed to him were of high quality but by other artists such as Orazio Gentileschi.See the Finding of Moses discussed below. Rembrandt, The Mill, 1645–48, one of his most famous landscapes, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington. French works, of which the catalogued collection included relatively few, included a set of the Seven Sacraments and 5 other works by Poussin. There were paintings by Philippe de Champaigne now in the Wallace Collection and Metropolitan Museum, and a Eustache Le Sueur which turned up in 1997 over a door in the Naval & Military Club and is now in the National Gallery.Wine Humphrey, National Gallery Catalogues (new series): The Seventeenth Century French Paintings, 2001, p. 226, National Gallery Publications Ltd, National Gallery The Flemish works were dominated by Rubens with 19 paintings, including a group of 12 studies now widely dispersed, van Dyck with 10 works and David Teniers with 9.Numbers as sold in London: Buchanan, Vol I, pp. 167-9, 182-4 and 189ff respectively The Dutch paintings included 6 Rembrandts, 7 works by Caspar Netscher (one now Wallace Collection) and 3 by Frans van Mieris (one now National Gallery) that were more highly regarded then than they are now. There were 3 Gerrit Dous and 4 Wouwermans.Numbers as sold in London: Buchanan, Vol I, pp. 196ff Philippe's son Louis d'Orléans, religious and somewhat neurotic, attacked with a knife one of the most famous works, Correggio's Leda and the Swan, now in Berlin, and ordered the painter Charles-Antoine Coypel to cut up all three of the great Correggio mythological works in the presence of his chaplain, which Coypel did, but saving and repairing the pieces. The Leda went to Frederick the Great of Prussia, the Danäe to Venice, where it was stolen and eventually sold to the English consul at Leghorn, and Jupiter and Io went to the Imperial collection in Vienna.Reitlinger, 7 Some of the Flemish paintings were sold at auction in Paris, June 1727.Catalogue des tableaux flamands du cabinet de feu S.A.R. Mgr le duc d'Orléans, noted by Louis Courajod, Le livre-journal de Laurent Duvaux Paris, 1873, p, xx note. Beginning in 1785, a series of 352 engravings of the paintings were published on a subscription basis,Galerie du Palais royal, gravée d'après les Tableaux des differentes Ecoles qui la composent: avec un abrégé de la vie des peintres & une description historique de chaque tableau, par Mr. l'abbé de Fontenai Dediée à S. A. S. Monseigneur le duc d'Orléans, premier prince du sang, par J. Couché. 3 vols. Paris: Jacques Couché, 1786-1808. until the series was abandoned during the Terror, by which time the paintings themselves had been sold.Penny, 466. As was usual in French reproductive prints of the period, each plate was actually created in a mixture of etching and engraving. It was finally published in book form in 1806.Penny, 467 These prints have greatly reduced the uncertainty that accompanies the identity of works in most dispersed former collections. There had already been many prints of the collection; the Seven Sacraments were especially popular among the middle classes of Paris in the 1720s. ==Gonzagas and Charles I== Finding of Moses by Orazio Gentileschi, painted for Charles I Another famous collection whose history was entwined with the Orleans Collection was that assembled by the Gonzagas of Mantua, especially Francesco II (1466–1519) and his son Federico II (1500–1540). Their court artists included Mantegna and Giulio Romano, and they commissioned work directly from Titian, Raphael, Correggio and other artists, some of which were given as gifts to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, to whom Mantua was effectively a client state. The most important of these gifts were the mythological works by Correggio, later to be mutilated in Paris. By the early 17th century the dynasty was in terminal decline, and the bulk of their portable art collection was bought by the keen collector Charles I of England in 1625–27. Charles's other notable purchases included the Raphael Cartoons and volumes of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, and his own most notable commissions were from Rubens and van Dyck. By the time his collection of paintings was seized and sold after his execution in 1649 by the English Commonwealth it was one of the finest outside Italy.Whitaker and Clayton, 30 have a short account of the sale, and French buyers. See also Further Reading. Meanwhile, three years after the sale to Charles, Mantua was sacked by Imperial troops, who added much of what was left there to the Imperial collection in Prague, where they rejoined the diplomatic gifts of a century earlier. Some Mantuan paintings therefore passed from Prague via Christina to the Orleans Collection, while more were bought by French collectors in the London \\"Sale of the Late King's Goods\\" in 1650, and later found their way to the Palais-Royal. For example, an Infancy of Jupiter by Giulio Romano, bought from Mantua, left Charles' collection for France, passed to the Orleans Collection and the London sales, and after a spell back in France returned to England and was later bought by the National Gallery in 1859.Now called The Infant Jupiter guarded by the Corybantes on the Island of Crete, and attributed to Giulio's workshop only. National Gallery . Where this painting was between inventories of Charles in 1637 and the Palais-Royal catalogue of 1727 remains unclear - it was not apparently in the Royal Collection at Charles' death. See Gould, 119. Other paintings in the same series were recovered for the Royal Collection in 1660;Royal Collection Charles II was able to exert pressure on most English buyers of his father's collection, but those gone abroad were beyond his reach. One important Rubens of Charles', the Landscape with St George and the Dragon (of 1630 - St George has Charles's features, the rescued princess those of his Queen), which passed via the Ducs de Richelieu to the Palais-Royal and London, had always been recognised for what it was, and was bought back for the Royal Collection by George IV in 1814.Lloyd, 104 Royal Collection Another picture commissioned by Charles, The Finding of Moses by Gentileschi, painted for the Queen's House, Greenwich, was returned to Charles' widow Henrietta Maria in France in 1660. By the time it entered the Orleans Collection a half-century later, it was regarded as by Velázquez. It then was one of the Castle Howard paintings, and was only correctly identified after the existence of Gentileschi's second version in the Prado became known in England. After a sale in 1995 it is now on loan to the National Gallery from the current owner.National Gallery Press Release - though the picture in fact remains on loan in 2008.Image - National Gallery Phillippe's father's first wife, Henrietta Anne Stuart, was Charles I's daughter, and her small but select collection had been mostly given to her by her brother Charles II from the reclaimed royal collection on her marriage in 1661. On her death forty years later this was left to Phillippe.Watson, 186 ==Dispersal in London== The Origin of the Milky Way by Tintoretto, bought for 50 guineas in 1800. This had belonged to Rudolf but not Christina, reaching the Orleans collection via the Marquis de Seignelay.Penny, 160-161 In 1787 Louis Philippe d'Orléans, the Regent's great-grandson, whose huge income could not keep pace with his gambling habit,Penny 466, Watson, 225, Reitlinger, 27. The Duke had other large costs, but there seems a consensus that his gambling losses predominated had sold his equally famous collection of engraved gems to Catherine the Great of Russia, and in 1788 he was in serious negotiations with a syndicate organized by James Christie, founder of Christie's, the London auctioneer, for the sale of the paintings. Christie got as far as arranging that the collection should be made over to him upon the deposit of 100,000 guineas in the Bank of England, before the negotiations collapsed when the Prince of Wales having subscribed his name in the book for 7,000 guineas, and his brothers the dukes of York and Clarence for 5,000 each, no further subscribers were to be found. It was Dawson Turner's opinion that the failure was owing to the general sense that at the division of the spoils the lion's share would go to the royals.William T. Whitley, Artists and Their Friends in England 1700-1799, (London, 1928) vol. II, pp 179f. In 1792 Philippe Égalité impulsively sold the collection en bloc to a banker of Brussels who immediately sold it at a huge profitLouis Courajod , Le livre-journal de Lazare Duvaux, Paris, 1873:xx reported a purchase price of 750,000 livres and a sale price within days of 900,000 to Laborde. to the enlightened connoisseur Jean-Joseph de Laborde de Méréville, who set about adding a gallery to house it attached to his hôtel in rue d'Artois. Ruined by events, he was forced to sell it once more. The 147 German, Dutch and Flemish paintings were sold by Orléans to Thomas Moore Slade, a British dealer, in a syndicate with two London bankers and the 7th Lord Kinnaird, for 350,000 livres in 1792, and taken to London for sale. There were protests from the French artists and public, and from the Duke's creditors, and Slade found it prudent to tell the French the pictures were going overland to Calais, but actually to sneak them onto a barge by night, and ship them down the Seine to Le Havre.Slade's letter to Buchanan, quoted in Buchanan, Vol I, 163; Wheatley, op. cit. p. 180. These paintings were exhibited for sale in London's West End in April 1793 at 125 Pall Mall, where admissions at 1 shilling each reached two thousand a day, and sold to various buyers.Penny, 466. Buchanan's account, mainly a long letter from Slade, begins at Volume I, p. 159; £100 a day was taken in shillings at the door, according to Slade. Philippe Égalité, as he had renamed himself, was arrested in April 1793 and was guillotined 6 November, but in the meantime sale negotiations for the Italian and French paintings were renewed, and they were sold for 750,000 livres to Édouard Walkiers, a banker of Brussels, who soon after sold them on, unpacked, to his cousin, Count François-Louis-Joseph de Laborde-Méréville, who had hoped to use them to add to the French national collection. After the start of the Terror, and the execution of his father as well as the Duke of Orléans, Laborde-Méréville saw he had to escape France, and brought the collection to London in early 1793.Watson, 241-4; Penny, 466 7 note 69, p. 469. He died in London in 1802. The French and Italian paintings then spent five years in London with Laborde-Méréville, the subject of some complicated financial manoeuvres,See Penny, 466 including the failure of an attempt supported by King George III and the Prime Minister Pitt the Younger to buy them for the nation. They were finally bought in 1798 by a syndicate of the canal and coal-magnate Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, his nephew and heir, Earl Gower, later 1st Duke of Sutherland, and the Earl of Carlisle. Gower, who was perhaps the prime mover and must have known the collection well from his time as British ambassador in Paris, contributed 1/8 of the £43,500 price, Carlisle a quarter, and Bridgewater the remaining 5/8s.Penny, 466-7, though Reitlinger, 32 appears to be applying these fractions to the three promoters' purchases, and has £43,000 as the purchase price. Rubens' The Judgement of Paris, bought by Philippe in France, one of the Northern portion. The pictures were put on exhibition for seven months in 1798, with a view to selling at a least a part of them, in Bryan's Gallery in Pall Mall, with the larger ones at the Lyceum in the Strand; admission was 2/6d rather than the 1s. usual for such events. On first seeing the collection there, William Hazlitt wrote \\"I was staggered when I saw the works ... A new sense came upon me, a new heaven and a new Earth stood before me.\\"In On the Pleasure of Painting, 1820, quoted in Watson, 251. See also Penny, 467 In 1798, 1800 and 1802 there were auctions of those paintings not sold via the galleries, generally achieving rather low prices, but 94 out of 305 of the paintings were retained by the syndicate, as seems always to have been intended, and these largely remain in their families today.Penny, 467; Reitlinger, 32 However these paintings represented over half of the valuations placed on the whole portion bought by the syndicate. Even at the often low prices realized, the sales to others, and entry receipts to the exhibitions, realized a total of £42,500, so even allowing for the expenses of the exhibitions and auctions, the syndicate got their works very cheaply.Reitlinger, 32, but see also Penny, 467 and notes 81 & 84 on p. 470 for different figures. Castle Howard, home of the Earls of Carlisle, originally had fifteen works, now much reduced by sales, donations, and a fire,Castle Howard website but the Bridgewater/Sutherland group remain intact to a large degree. Diana and Actaeon by Titian, 1557–59, part of the Sutherland Loan until bought for the nation in 2009 (see below) The London market in these years was flooded by both other collections from France itself, and those dislodged by the French invasions of the Low Countries and Italy--by 1802 including Rome itself.Reitlinger, Chapter 2 and Watson, 254-66 As is often the case with old collectors, their choices of what to keep and what to sell seem in many cases very strange today: the two \\"Michelangelos\\" were only sold in the auctions, and for only 90 and 52 guineas. Many Titians were sold, but many Bolognese Baroque works, as well as most of the later (but not the earlier) Raphaels, were retained. The single Watteau went for only 11 gn, while one Carracci was valued at £4,000 for the galley sale, where all 33 Carraccis were sold, while works attributed to Giovanni Bellini and Caravaggio remained at the auction stage.Watson, 252-53. The current location of many of the pictures can no longer be traced, and many are now attributed to lesser artists or copyists. Overall the prices realized for the better pictures were high, and in some cases their level would not be reached again for a century or longer. As an extreme case, a Ludovico Carracci valued at 60gn in 1798 was auctioned by the Duke of Sutherland in 1913 raising 2gn.Reitlinger, footnote p. 26, for this example, and passim. He has much information on subsequent price movements. An example of a work now only known from a replica (in the Galleria Borghese in Rome) and studies is Aeneas and his Family Fleeing Troy, the only secular history painting by Federico Barocci. The prime version was given in 1586 by Francesco Maria II, the last Duke of Urbino, to Rudolph II in Prague, and was later looted by the Swedes. It was taken to Rome by Queen Christina, passed to the Orleans collection, and finally sold at auction in London for 14 guineas in 1800 (the price probably reflecting the poor condition some sources mention), since when its whereabouts are unknown. The Rome version was painted in 1598, presumably for Cardinal Scipio Borghese.Turner, 109;Image of the replica version in Rome; engraving in the Metropolitan Museum of Art The paintings of both portions of the collection were bought by a wide range of wealthy collectors, the great majority English, as the wars with France made travelling to London difficult for others. Major buyers included Thomas Hope, a Dutch banker (distantly of Scottish extraction) sheltering in London from the Napoleonic Wars, who with his brother (of Hope Diamond fame) bought the two large Veronese allegories now in the Frick, and works by \\"Michelangelo\\", \\"Velásquez\\" and Titian,Watson, 253. The \\"Velásquez\\" Discovery of Moses is now an Orazio Gentileschi (Penny, 463) and the Titian a rather dubious attribution John Julius Angerstein, a Russian-German banker whose collection later became the foundation of the National Gallery, the Earl of Darnley, the Earl of Harewood, who bought Titian's The Death of Actaeon, and Earl FitzWilliam, whose collection was to found the Fitzwilliam Museum. An analysis by Gerard Reitlinger of \\"most\\" of the buyers (of the Italian and French pictures) divides them as follows: *Nobility - 12, including the syndicate *Merchants - 10, including 4 Members of Parliament and 3 knights; mostly as speculators according to Reitlinger - their purchases were mostly resold within a few years *Dealers - 6, including Bryan, who handled matters for the syndicate *Bankers - Hope and Angerstein (both foreign) *Painters - 4: Walton, Udney, Cosway and Skipp *Gentleman Amateurs - 6, including William Beckford and the critic Samuel Rogers. \\\\- a breakdown he describes as \\"quite unlike anything in Europe and grotesquely unlike pre-revolutionary France\\", where the main collectors were the tax farmers.Reitlinger, 30, and 16 on the farmers Many of the same figures appear in the similar list of buyers of the Northern paintings.Buchanan, Vol I, 165 Much of our information about the sales comes from the Memoirs of Painting, with a Chronological History of the Importation of Pictures of Great Masters into England by the Great Artists since the French Revolution, by William Buchanan, published in 1824, of which the first 200 pages of Volume I are devoted to the Orleans sales, listing the works and most prices and buyers.Memoirs of Painting online text also republished in 2008 by Read Books Buchanan was himself involved in the import of art from 1802 onwards, and had his information from the dealers involved.As he describes in Vol II, he specialized in buying in Genoa, from where he obtained several very important Rubens and van Dycks, and Spain, where he bought the Rokeby Venus and other works. He presents his own \\"exertions\\", and those of others, in the area in a thoroughly patriotic light, by implication as a part of the great national struggle with the French.See, for example, Vol II, pp. 248-9 Nicholas Penny notes the \\"somewhat comic\\" disparity between Buchanan's \\"sonorous words\\" on the subject and the \\"coarse and mercenary business letters\\" he reprints--many by himself.Penny 467-8 ==Bridgewater collection== Titian's Diana and Callisto, long part of the Sutherland Loan to the National Gallery of Scotland, now sold and shared by them with the National Gallery. On Bridgewater's death five years after the purchase, he bequeathed his collection to Gower, who put it and his own paintings on at least semi-public display in Bridgewater House, Westminster; it has been on public display ever since. The collection contained over 300 paintings, including about 50 Orleans paintings,Victorian London-Bridgewater House and was known as the \\"Stafford Galley\\" in Cleveland House until the house was rebuilt and renamed as Bridgewater House in 1854, and then as the \\"Bridgewater Gallery\\". It was opened in 1803, and could be visited on Wednesday afternoons over four, later three, months in the summer by \\"acquaintances\\" of a member of the family (in practice tickets could mostly be obtained by writing and asking for them), or artists recommended by a member of the Royal Academy.Penny, 468 Angerstein's paintings were on display on similar terms in his house in Pall Mall, which from 1824 became the first home of the National Gallery. On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the collection was moved from London to Scotland. Since 1946 26 paintings, sixteen from the Orleans Collection, known collectively as \\"the Bridgewater loan\\" or \\"the Sutherland Loan\\"Brigstocke, 11 have been on loan to the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh, though up to 2008 five from this group had been bought by the Gallery.Brigstocke, 11, plus subsequently the Titian Venus Anadyomene in 2003 The collection has passed by descent to the 7th Duke of Sutherland, (most of whose wealth is contained in the paintings collection), but in late August 2008 the 7th Duke announced that he wished to sell some of the collection in order to diversify his assets.He had previously sold another Titian from the loan — the Venus Anadyomene — to the NGS in 2000. He at first offered Diana and Callisto and Diana and Acteon, two works by Titian as a pair to the British national galleries at £100 m (a third of their overall estimated market price) over a period. The National Gallery of Scotland and the National Gallery in London announced they would combine forces to raise the sum, initially in the form of £50 m to purchase Diana and Actaeon paid over three years in instalments and then £50 m for Diana and Callisto paid for similarly from 2013. The campaign gained press support, though it received some criticism for the Duke's motives or (from John Tusa and Nigel Carrington of the University of the Arts) for distracting from funding art students In 2009 it was announced that the first £50M for Diana and Actaeon had been raised - the painting will rotate every five years between Edinburgh (first) and London. The sale of Diana and Callisto for £45M was announced in 2012. ==Paintings with articles once in the collection== Raphael, Colonna Altarpiece, c. 1504, Metropolitan Museum of Art ===Titian=== Poesie for Philip II *Venus and Adonis, two versions, but not Philip's *Perseus and Andromeda *Diana and Callisto *Diana and Actaeon *The Rape of Europa *The Death of Actaeon Other *The Three Ages of Man *Venus Anadyomene *Venus and Cupid with a Lute-player (now Fitzwilliam Museum) ===Other artists=== * Colonna Altarpiece by Raphael *The Raising of Lazarus , by Sebastiano del Piombo *Jupiter and Io and Danaë by Correggio *Origin of the Milky Way , by Tintoretto *The Mill, by Rembrandt *Allegory of Virtue and Vice, Allegory of Wisdom and Strength and Venus and Mars by Paolo Veronese *Orléans Madonna by Raphael ==Current locations== *National Gallery, London - at least 25 works, plus two currently on loan there. *National Gallery of Scotland - sixteen works, including those on loan. *Wallace Collection, London - 6 worksIndices of Previous Owners in Catalogues by Ingamells, 4 vols, 1985-92 *Metropolitan Museum, New York - At least three works, the Raphael Colonna Altarpiece and a predella panel,Metropolitan a Philippe de Champaigne,Metropolitan - this one only entered the collection in about 1788, and though listed among those for despatch to England, was not in the end included in the bulk sale and a VeroneseMetropolitan *National Gallery of Art, Washington - four works by:NGA Provenance Index - Orleans Rembrandt, Ludovico Carracci, Sébastien Bourdon and ?Jan Cossiers (as well as two important works from other sources once in the collection of Earl GowerNGA Provenance Index - Gower ). *Frick Collection, New York - two Veroneses (see above), two portraits of Frans Snyders and his wife by van Dyck Other works are in: Berlin, Vienna, Dresden, Malibu, Paris, Rome, Boston (Titian The Rape of Europa), Tokyo, Kansas City, and many other cities. ==NotesReferences== *Brigstocke, Hugh; Italian and Spanish Paintings in the National Gallery of Scotland, 2nd Edn, 1993, National Galleries of Scotland, *Buchanan, William; Memoirs of Painting, with a Chronological History of the Importation of Pictures of Great Masters into England by the Great Artists since the French Revolution, 1824, Ackermann, London, published in 1824 (of which the first 200 pages of Volume I are devoted to the Orleans sales, listing the works and most prices and buyers) Memoirs of Painting online text also republished in 2008 by Read Books *Gould, Cecil, The Sixteenth Century Italian Schools, National Gallery Catalogues, London 1975, *Lloyd, Christopher, The Queen's Pictures, Royal Collectors through the centuries, National Gallery Publications, 1991, *Penny, Nicholas, National Gallery Catalogues (new series): The Sixteenth Century Italian Paintings, Volume II, Venice 1540-1600, 2008, National Gallery Publications Ltd, *Reitlinger, Gerald; The Economics of Taste, Vol I: The Rise and Fall of Picture Prices 1760-1960, Barrie and Rockliffe, London, 1961 *Trevor-Roper, Hugh; Princes and Artists, Patronage and Ideology at Four Habsburg Courts 1517-1633, Thames & Hudson, London, 1976 * Turner, Nicholas, Federico Barocci, 2000, Vilo *Watson, Peter; Wisdom and Strength, the Biography of a Renaissance Masterpiece, Hutchinson, 1990, ==Further reading== *Schmid, Vanessa I (ed), The Orleans Collection, 2018, D Giles Ltd, *Cristina di Svezia, Le Collezioni Reali (exhibition catalogue), Mondadori Electa, Milan, 2003, *Folliot, Franck, Forray, Anne, and Mardrus, Françoise; articles in Le Palais-Royal (exhibition catalogue), Musée Carnavalet, Paris 1988 *Macgregor, Arthur, ed.; The Late King's Goods.

The theme song, sharing the same name as the series, was composed and arranged by Joseph Koo, with lyrics provided by Tang Wai- hung, and was sung by Teresa Cheung. ==Plot== Ching Wai (Chow Yun-fat) is a fresh graduate from university, and is hired by a jewelry company called Yu- Fook, and he rises up the career ladder quickly, due to his superb performance, and he forges a relationship with the Director's daughter, Fong Hei-man (Carol Cheng). The story continues smoothly, until an incident occurs. To pay his mother's (Tang Pik-wan) gambling debts, he embezzles company funds and is reported by the cunning Yuen Kei-cheung (Lee Tao-hung). Ching is sent to prison, where he meets and befriends a gangster chief Lung Koon-sam (Shih Kien), who helps him both in and out of prison. Ching gets a job at another jewelry company, and collaborates with Lung to expose Yuen's wrongdoings. Eventually, Yuen is caught, and Ching proposes to Fong. Ching Chan (Liu Wai- hung), is also another main character. Known as Ah Chan, he is an idle immigrant from the Mainland. He is forced to care for the Chings when Ching Wai is sent to prison. Unfortunately, Ching Chan commits a crime and is jailed, but manages to forge a family with his love Cheung Mei-po (Kong Ho-oi) ==Impact on Vernacular Language== The show also left a lasting impact on Hong Kong vernacular vocabulary. The term Ah Chan (阿燦), which is a pejorative term for Mainland Chinese, traces its origins to this series, from the character Ching Chan. The term is used to describe new immigrants from the Mainland, seen as lazy, laid-back and idle, unable to adapt to the fast pace of Hong Kong life. The term only fell out of widespread usage after the 1997 handover. ==Cast== *Chow Yun-fat as Ching Wai (程緯) *Carol Cheng as Fong Hei-man (方希文) *Simon Yam as Ho Chun (賀雋) *Susanna Au-yeung as Au Hiu-wah (區曉華) *Liu Wai Hung as Ching Chan (程燦) *Lee Tao-hung as Yuen Kei-cheung (阮其昌) *Shih Kien as Lung Koon-sam (龍冠三) *Cora Miao as Ho Ying (賀縈) *Kong Ho-oi as Cheung Mei-po (張美寶) *Wong San as Ching Chiu (程照) *Tang Pik-wan as Ng Sau-ying (吳秀英) *Benz Hui as Chu Pak-keung (朱柏强) *Kwan Hoi-san as Fong Wai-ho (方維灝) *Lee Heung-kam as Yeung Hing-wan (楊慶雲) *Lun Chi-man as Ching Fun (程芬) ==References *Official website Category:1979 Hong Kong television series debuts Category:1979 Hong Kong television series endings Category:TVB dramas Category:Cantonese-language television shows ","title":"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1979 TV series)"},{"id":"20429460","text":"Charlie “Chili” Altemose (June 3, 1913 - January 26, 1995 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) was a U.S. soccer player who was a member of the U.S. soccer team at the 1936 Summer Olympics and 1956 Summer Olympics.

Nicolas Sarrabat or Sarabat (February 7, 1698 – April 27, 1739), also known as Nicolas Sarrabat de la Baisse, was an eighteenth-century French mathematician and scientist. He was born in Lyon, the son of the painter Daniel Sarrabat (1666–1748), and the nephew of engraver Isaac Sarrabat. The Sarrabats had been a prosperous Protestant bourgeois family of clock- and watchmakers, though Nicolas's father had converted to Catholicism. Sarrabat showed a love of learning from an early age. He was said to have started his studies without his parents' knowledge; they only became aware of them when Nicolas submitted and defended a thesis at the Lyon Collège de la Trinité in the presence of his father, who had been tricked into attending.Revue du Lyonnais, L. Boitel, 1845, p.27 He went on to enter the Jesuit order, and was employed as the Royal Professor of Mathematics at Marseille. ==Scientific papers== Sarrabat's scientific interests seem to have been very varied, and the Academie Royale des Belles-lettres, Sciences et Arts de Bordeaux awarded him several prizes for his work: one was for an essay on magnetism, the Nouvelle hypothèse sur les variations de l'aiguille aimantee, which argued that a spherical fire at the Earth's core was the driving force behind the expulsion of magnetic matter.Jonkers, A. Earth's Magnetism in the Age of Sail, JHU, 2003, p.110 In 1730, he published the Dissertation sur les causes et les variations des vents, which sought to explain wind patterns by the action of the Sun on the atmosphere. His most famous experiments involved immersing the roots of living plants in the red juice of Phytolacca berries in order to observe circulation.von Sachs, J. History of Botany (1530-1860), Read, 2007, p.483 As the Academy, mainly to stop Sarrabat's presence discouraging other authors, had ruled that an author could not win the same prize three times, he submitted this work, Sur la circulation de la sève des plantes, under the pseudonym \\"Monsieur de la Baisse\\", but eventually confessed his true identity.Baisse can translate as \\"decline\\" or \\"slump\\". The plant genus Baissea is named after him - or rather after his pseudonym - in honour of this work.Charters, M. 'South African Plant Names', accessed 28-11-08 In 1735-36 Sarrabat travelled with the Chevalier de Caylus - a ship's captain and the brother of the Comte de Caylus - through the Mediterranean on an archeological excursion to the island of Milos and to Malta, describing his experiences in a series of excited and spirited letters to the Marquis de Caumont.See Brucker, J. Excursion Archeologique de Deux Francais in the Jesuit review Études, v.102 (1905), pp.51-73. The article includes several long quotations from Sarrabat's (otherwise unpublished) letters. Though Caylus came from a famously Jansenist family, the Jesuit Sarrabat struck up a great friendship with him, describing him as \\"un très aimable homme\\".Brucker (1905), p.56 Caylus and Sarrabat walked into the interior of Milos, discovering and partly unearthing a series of ancient ruins very close to where the Venus de Milo was discovered many years later. ==Astronomy== Sarrabat also had an interest in astronomy, and is remembered in the field for having discovered an unusual comet, the Comet of 1729 (Comet Sarabat): it is thought to have been the largest, with the greatest absolute magnitude, on record.Lynn, W. T. 'Sarrabat and the comet of 1729', The Observatory, Vol. 19, p. 239-240 (1896). Sarrabat discovered the comet without the aid of a telescope, though he was initially unsure if it was in fact a detached part of the Milky Way.Kronk, G. W. Cometography: A Catalog of Comets, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p.394 In astronomical literature his name is often spelt \\"Sarabat\\", following the spelling used by Jacques Cassini, who made further observations of the same comet. A colleague remembered him as \\"tall, with a countenance that showed the passion of the loftiness of his thought, and with a very gentle manner\\".Revue du Lyonnais, L. Boitel, 1845, p.28 Sarrabat died in 1739 while visiting Paris on official business, or according to some sources, while seeking treatment for a liver ailment.Études, p.64 ==References== Category:1698 births Category:1739 deaths Category:18th-century French Jesuits Category:French scientists Category:French astronomers Category:Discoverers of comets Category:People from Lyon Category:French mathematicians ","title":"Nicolas Sarrabat"},{"id":"20429541","text":"Hardy Strickland (November 24, 1818 - January 24, 1884) was a prominent Confederate politician.

It is widely used in sport training as mental practice of action, neurological rehabilitation, and has also been employed as a research paradigm in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology to investigate the content and the structure of covert processes (i.e., unconscious) that precede the execution of action. In some medical, musical, and athletic contexts, when paired with physical rehearsal, mental rehearsal can be as effective as pure physical rehearsal (practice) of an action. ==Definition== Motor imagery can be defined as a dynamic state during which an individual mentally simulates a physical action. This type of phenomenal experience implies that the subject feels themselves performing the action. It corresponds to the so-called internal imagery (or first person perspective) of sport psychologists. ==Mental practice of action== Mental practice refers to use of visuo-motor imagery with the purpose of improving motor behavior. Visuo-motor imagery requires the use of one's imagination to simulate an action, without physical movement. It has come to the fore due to the relevance of imagery in enhancing sports and surgical performance. ===Sports=== Mental practice, when combined with physical practice, can be beneficial to beginners learning a sport, but even more helpful to professionals looking to enhance their skills. Physical practice generates the physical feedback necessary to improve, while mental practice creates a cognitive process physical practice cannot easily replicate. === Medicine === When surgeons and other medical practitioners mentally rehearse procedures along with their physical practice, it produces the same results as physical rehearsal, but costs much less. But unlike its use in sports, to improve a skill, mental practice is used in medicine as a form of stress reduction before operations. === Music === Mental practice is a technique used in music as well. Professional musicians may use mental practice when they are away from their instrument or unable to physically practice due to an injury. Studies show that a combination of physical and mental practice can provide improvement in mastering a piece equal to physical practice alone. This is because mental practice causes neuron growth that mirrors growth caused by physical practice. And there is precedent: Vladimir Horowitz and Arthur Rubinstein, among others, supplemented their physical practice with mental rehearsal. ===Motor deficits=== Mental practice has been used to rehabilitate motor deficits in a variety of neurological disorders. Mental practice of action seems to improve balance in individuals with multiple sclerosis and in elderly women. For instance, mental practice has been used with success in combination with actual practice to rehabilitate motor deficits in a patient with sub-acute stroke. Several studies have also shown improvement in strength, function, and use of both upper and lower extremities in chronic stroke. ==Functional equivalence to motor preparation== Converging empirical evidence indicates a functional equivalence between action execution and motor imagery. Motor imagery has been studied using the classical methods of introspection and mental chronometry. These methods have revealed that motor images retain many of the properties, in terms of temporal regularities, programming rules and biomechanical constraints, which are observed in the corresponding real action when it comes to execution. For instance, in an experiment participants were instructed to walk mentally through gates of a given apparent width positioned at different apparent distances. The gates were presented to the participants with a 3-D visual display (a virtual reality helmet) which involved no calibration with external cues and no possibility for the subject to refer to a known environment. Participants were asked to indicate the time they started walking and the time they passed through the gate. Mental walking time was found to increase with increasing gate distance and decreasing gate width. Thus, it took the participant longer to walk mentally through a narrow gate than to walk through a larger gate placed at the same distance. This finding led neurophysiologists Marc Jeannerod and Jean Decety to propose that there is a similarity in mental states between action simulation and execution. The functional equivalence between action and imagination goes beyond motor movements. For instance similar cortical networks mediate music performance and music imagery in pianists. ==Physiology== Activation in the motor cortex during motor imagery amounts about 30 % of the level observed during actual performance; Roth et al., 1996. A large number of functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that motor imagery is associated with the specific activation of the neural circuits involved in the early stage of motor control (i.e., motor programming). This circuits includes the supplementary motor area, the primary motor cortex, the inferior parietal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. Such physiological data gives strong support about common neural mechanisms of imagery and motor preparation. Measurements of cardiac and respiratory activity during motor imagery and during actual motor performance revealed a covariation of heart rate and pulmonary ventilation with the degree of imagined effort. Motor imagery activates motor pathways. Muscular activity often increases with respect to rest, during motor imagery. When this is the case, EMG activity is limited to those muscles that participate in the simulated action and tends to be proportional to the amount of imagined effort. ==Effects== Motor imagery is now widely used as a technique to enhance motor learning and to improve neurological rehabilitation in patients after stroke. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated in musicians. * On motor learning: Motor imagery is an accepted procedure in the preparation of athletes. Such practice usually covers a warming up period, relaxation and concentration, and then mental simulation of the specific movement. * In neurological rehabilitation: Since pioneering work by Dr. Stephen Page in 2000, there has been accumulating evidence suggesting that motor imagery provides additional benefits to conventional physiotherapy or occupational therapy. A recent review on four randomized controlled trials indicates that there is modest evidence supporting the additional benefit of motor imagery compared to only conventional physiotherapy in patients with stroke. These authors concluded that motor imagery appears to be an attractive treatment opinion, easy to learn and to apply and the intervention is neither physically exhausting nor harmful. Therefore, motor imagery may generate additional benefit for patients. * Motor imagery can act as a substitute for the imagined behavior, producing similar effects on cognition and behavior. The repeated simulated consumption of a food, for example, can reduce subsequent actual consumption of that food. ==Simulation and understanding mental states== Motor imagery is close to the notion of simulation used in cognitive and social neuroscience to account for different processes. An individual who is engaging in simulation may replay his own past experience in order to extract from it pleasurable, motivational or strictly informational properties. Such a view was clearly described by the Swedish physiologist Hesslow. For this author, the simulation hypothesis states that thinking consists of simulated interaction with the environment, and rests on the following three core assumptions: (1) Simulation of actions: we can activate motor structures of the brain in a way that resembles activity during a normal action but does not cause any overt movement; (2) Simulation of perception: imagining perceiving something is essentially the same as actually perceiving it, only the perceptual activity is generated by the brain itself rather than by external stimuli; (3) Anticipation: there exist associative mechanisms that enable both behavioral and perceptual activity to elicit other perceptual activity in the sensory areas of the brain. Most importantly, a simulated action can elicit perceptual activity that resembles the activity that would have occurred if the action had actually been performed. Mental simulation may also be a representational tool to understand the self and others. Philosophy of mind and developmental psychology also draw on simulation to explain our capacity to mentalize, i.e., to understand mental states (intentions, desires, feelings, and beliefs) of others (aka theory of mind). In this context, the basic idea of simulation is that the attributor attempts to mimic the mental activity of the target by using his own psychological resources. In order to understand the mental state of another when observing the other acting, the individual imagines herself/himself performing the same action, a covert simulation that does not lead to an overt behavior. One critical aspect of the simulation theory of mind is the idea that in trying to impute mental states to others, an attributor has to set aside her own current mental states, and substitutes those of the target. ==See also== * Common coding theory * Creative visualization * Empathy * Motor cognition * Motor planning ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * Category:Cognitive neuroscience Category:Neuropsychology Category:Neuroscience Category:Neurology Category:Cognitive science Category:Motor control Category:Motor cognition Category:Imagination ","title":"Motor imagery"},{"id":"20429583","text":"Ross Macfadyen is a Scottish media, broadcast and communications professional currently working in the charity sector. ==Career== Born in Glasgow, he started his professional broadcasting career with East End Radio, before joining Radio Clyde where he was an on-air presenter, and became Head of Music for Clyde 1, Programme Controller for Radio Clyde, and then Director of Programmes for Radio Clyde, Clyde 1 and Clyde 2.

The Kāśyapīyas were also called the Haimavatas.Warder, A.K.

Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 51 Xuanzang and Yijing note small fragments of the Kāśyapīya sect still in existence around the 7th century, suggesting that much of the sect may have adopted the Mahāyāna teachings by this time.Baruah, Bibhuti. Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 52 In the 7th century CE, Yijing grouped the Mahīśāsaka, Dharmaguptaka, and Kāśyapīya together as sub-sects of the Sarvāstivāda, and stated that these three groups were not prevalent in the \\"five parts of India,\\" but were located in the some parts of Oḍḍiyāna, Khotan, and Kucha.Yijing.

Three Mountains and Seven Rivers. 2004. p. 55 Another text translated at a later date, the Śāriputraparipṛcchā, contains a very similar passage corroborating this information.

Three Mountains and Seven Rivers. 2004. pp. 55–56 The relevant portion of the Mahāsāṃghika Śāriputraparipṛcchā reads, \\"The Kāśyapīya school are diligent and energetic in guarding sentient beings. They wear magnolia robes.\\" ==Doctrines== In Vasumitra's history Samayabhedoparacanacakra, the Haimavatas (Kāśyapīya sect) are described as an eclectic school upholding doctrines of both the Sthaviras and the Mahāsāṃghikas.Baruah, Bibhuti. Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 54 According to the Kathāvatthu commentary, the Kāśyapīyas believed that past events exist in the present in some form.Malalasekera (2003), p. 556, entry for \\"Kassapiyā, Kassapikā\\" (retrieved 27 Nov 2008 from \\"Google Books\\" at https://books.google.com/books?id=LEn9i9pnRHEC&pg;=PA556&lpg;=PA556&dq;=Kassapiya&source;=bl&ots;=5Yok7NZCEu&sig;=963iBUcouWirVo7UT4zgpWigqJc&hl;=en&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&resnum;=1&ct;=result#PPA556,M1). According to A.K. Warder, the Kāśyapīya school held the doctrine that arhats were fallible and imperfect, similar to the view of the Sarvāstivādins and the various Mahāsāṃghika sects. They held that arhats have not fully eliminated desires, that their \\"perfection\\" is incomplete, and that it is possible for them to relapse. ==Texts== Some tentatively attribute the Gāndhārī Dharmapada to the Kāśyapīya school.See, e.g., Brough (2001), pp. 44–45: :... We can with reasonable confidence say that the Gāndhārī text did not belong to the schools responsible for the Pali Dhammapada, the Udānavarga, and the Mahāvastu; and unless we are prepared to dispute the attribution of any of these, this excludes the Sarvāstivādins and the Lokottaravāda-Mahāsānghikas, as well as the Theravādins (and probably, in company with the last, the Mahīśāsakas). Among possible claimants, the Dharmaguptakas and Kāśyapīyas must be considered as eligible, but still other possibilities cannot be ruled out.

While the exact role and function of knowledge brokers are conceptualized and operationalized differently in various sectors and settings, a key feature appears to be the facilitation of knowledge exchange or sharing between and among various stakeholders, including researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. A knowledge broker may operate in multiple markets and technology domains. The concept of knowledge brokers is closely related to the concept of knowledge spillovers. In the fields of public health, applied health services research, and social sciences, knowledge brokers are often referred to as bridges or intermediaries that link producers of research evidence to users of research evidence as a means of facilitating collaboration to identify issues, solve problems , and promote evidence-informed decision making (EIDM), which is the process of critically appraising and incorporating the best available research evidence, along with evidence from multiple other sources into policy and practice decisions . Using a knowledge broker to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and the adoption of insights is one strategy in the broader field of Knowledge Management. == Function == Knowledge brokers facilitate the transfer and exchange of knowledge from where it is abundant to where it is needed, thereby supporting co-development and improving the innovative capability of organizations in their network. In the field of public health, knowledge brokers facilitate the appropriate use of the best available research evidence in decision making processes, enhancing individual and organizational capacity to participate effectively in evidence-informed decision making. In this setting, knowledge brokers promote research use. Knowledge brokers are typically involved in the following activities below: * Assessing barriers and establishing access to knowledge (i.e. screening and recognizing valuable knowledge across organizations and industries) * Learning (e.g. internalizing experiences from a diverse range of perspectives including those of industry, technology or health disciplines) * Linking of separate knowledge pools (e.g. through joint research, consulting services, and developing a mutual understanding of goals and cultures * Supporting knowledge and skill development * Facilitating individual/organizational capacity development for knowledge use (e.g., assessing current knowledge use, absorptive and receptive capacity, and readiness for change) * Implementing knowledge in new settings (e.g. combining existing knowledge in new ways) ==Expertise== Knowledge brokers provide a link between the producers and users of knowledge. To facilitate this knowledge exchange, knowledge brokers are required to build rapport with their target audiences and forge new connections across domains. Research into effective knowledge brokers, conducted by University of Oxford researchers, found that committed knowledge leadership is key to mobilizing research across organisational boundaries and embedding it in practice. In the longitudinal research funded by the National Institute of Health Research, the study found three variations of knowledge leadership, of transposing, appropriating and contending academic research.Fischer M.D. Dopson, S. Fitzgerald, L. Bennett, C. Ferlie, E. Ledger, J. & McGivern, G. (2015) \\"Knowledge leadership: Mobilizing management research by becoming the knowledge object\\" Human Relations, doi:10.1177/0018726715619686 A successful knowledge broker will possess: * Expertise in synthesizing and adapting information for use in different local contexts * A non-judgemental, respectful manner * Excellent written and oral communication skills * Strong interpersonal and networking skills * An understanding of the context, processes, and key influencers of both the producers and users of knowledge * Critical thinking skills * Critical reflection abilities and practices * Strategic planning skills and experience * An understanding of adult education principles and practices Knowledge brokers possess a portfolio of intellectual capital or expertise typically spanning the \\"specialized jargon, knowledge, and form(s) of reasoning\\" of multiple disciplines. Assuming that expertise lends itself to interdisciplinary exchange, the adequacy of a knowledge broker's understanding of a field can also be understood in terms of their possession of varieties of intellectual autonomy concerning the field, as suggested by Nguyen (2018):Nguyen, C. Thi. \\"Expertise and the Fragmentation of Intellectual Autonomy.\\" Philosophical Inquiries. vol. 6, no. 2: 2018. Retrieved from pre-print draft (https://philpapers.org/go.pl?id=NGUEAT&aid;=NGUEATv1), directing to original: https://philinq.it/index.php/philinq/article/view/224 * Direct autonomy is \\"where we seek to understand arguments and reasons for ourselves.\\" * Delegational autonomy is \\"where we seek to find others to invest with our intellectual trust when we cannot understand.\\" * Management autonomy, is \\"where we seek to encapsulate fields, in order to manage their overall structure and connectivity.\\" Nguyen (2018) responds to Elijah Millgram's The Great Endarkenment, where Millgram proposes between-field translation to reduce the internal and mutual incomprehensibility (i.e., for experts in a discipline, and between respective disciplines) of hyperspecialized disciplines. The goal of translation is intellectual transparency, or making clear the models, values, defeaters, and trade-offs of arguments in and between disciplines. Intellectual transparency is currently scarce due to both the above cited incomprehensibility problems, and the inevitability of mistakes (out of anyone's purview, due to resource constraints in personal and group knowledge management) accruing in \\"modern scientific practical arguments,\\" draped across many fields\\" that are already individually difficult to keep tabs on. Nguyen argues that \\"intellectual transparency will help us achieve direct autonomy, but many intellectual circumstances require that we exercise delegational and management autonomy. However, these latter forms of autonomy require us to give up on transparency\\" (pp. 1). == Examples of knowledge brokers == Every individual or organization, which has access to knowledge from several, unconnected entities, can theoretically act as a knowledge broker. Certain types of organizations have been identified to be acting primarily as knowledge brokers: * Dedicated knowledge brokers (i.e. ESADE Creapolis, IMCG and Sociedade Portuguesa de Inovação) * Venture capitalists * Consulting firms * Evidence-informed decision making support organizations (e.g., Health Evidence,, health-evidence.ca which offers dedicated knowledge brokers to mentor or facilitate evidence-informed decision making in public health organizations, and the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools,, National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools which has knowledge brokers facilitating a public health Community of Practice ===Climate change knowledge broker initiative=== A project funded by the Climate & Development Knowledge Network is aiming to integrate sources of climate change information and tailor data into relevant information products. Access to reliable information and data, and the ability to share lessons and experience, are considered key ingredients in tackling climate change, particularly within developing countries. However, although numerous websites, portals and online platforms have been set up to provide such information, the ‘knowledge infrastructure’ within the climate and development sector is still weak. The project aims to fill some of the gaps and provide bridges between isolated initiatives.Knowledge brokers collaboration: linking stakeholders to integrated climate change data Downloaded 31 July 2013 A study by IISD investigated the value of knowledge brokers within the climate change sphere.How important are climate knowledge brokers? Downloaded 31 July 2013 Interviews and surveys were conducted with more than 200 online climate change information users to understand their needs, preferences and behaviours. The findings were published in the paper \\"A user-oriented analysis of online knowledge brokering platforms for climate change and development\\". This publication identifies potential areas for innovation in online knowledge brokering and highlights the need for taking climate knowledge brokering beyond its online functions. == References == Category:Business terms Category:Knowledge transfer Category:Knowledge management Category:Evidence- based practices ","title":"Knowledge broker"},{"id":"20429689","text":"Sunadavinodini is a rāgam in Carnatic music (musical scale of South Indian classical music).

Holcombe had a political theory based on ideas of hierarchy, which explicitly reversed Jefferson's theme from the Declaration of Independence that all people are created equal. He thought people were naturally unequal and that was his primary argument for slavery.

He is a founder and medical director of Rutherford Health, a company providing proton therapy services, and Director of Medical Oncology at the Bahamas Cancer Centre. He is currently Professor of Medicine at the University of Buckingham,[https://www.hospitaltimes.co.uk/professor-karol-sikora-outlines- tough-choices-ahead-for-the-nhs/ \\"Professor Karol Sikora outlines tough choices ahead for the NHS\\", Hospital Times, 25-02-2020 and a partner in and dean of Buckingham's medical school. ==Early life== Karol Sikora was born in 1948. His father was a captain in the Polish Army who arrived in Great Britain during World War II and his mother was a Scottish schoolteacher. His childhood was spent in Edinburgh, Stafford and London. He attended Dulwich College on a London County Council scholarship before going to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge where he became a Foundation Scholar and obtained a double first. He received his PhD at Stanford University, where he also served a clinical fellowship. ==Career== After leaving Stanford University, Sikora returned to Cambridge to direct the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. From 1985 to 1997, he served as the clinical director for cancer services at Hammersmith Hospital in London, where he established a cancer research laboratory, and was Professor of International Cancer Medicine at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, later the Imperial College School of Medicine. During the 1990s Sikora was also deputy director of clinical research at charity the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, the predecessor to Cancer Research UK. In 1997 he became the Chief of the Cancer Program of the World Health Organization before resigning in 1999 over a disagreement with the UN regarding their proposals to restructure work on non-communicable diseases, stating this would create a \\"top-heavy bureaucracy\\". He served as the Vice-President of Global Clinical Research in Oncology at the Pharmacia Corporation from 1999 to 2002. He has also been a member of the UK Health Department's Expert Advisory Group on Cancer, as well as the Committee on Safety of Medicines. He is currently Medical Director of Rutherford Health, a company he founded in 2015, and dean of the University of Buckingham's medical school, the only private medical school in the UK. He is also a member of the Oncology Scientific Advisory Board at biopharmaceutical company Cyclacel Limited, and serves as an oncology consultant for AstraZeneca. Sikora also served as the Interim Director of Radiation Oncology for the newly constructed Cancer Centre Eastern Caribbean in Antigua. He is an unpaid member of the Meat Advisory Panel, a group of scientists that provide information and advice about meat as part of a balanced diet, and is patron of several cancer and other charities, including Medical Detection Dogs, which trains dogs to detect the odour of human disease to assist in diagnosis. Sikora has published over 300 papers and written or edited 20 books, notably the \\"standard\\" UK postgraduate textbook Treatment of Cancer. He appeared in Michael Apted's 1999 documentary film Me & Isaac Newton, which featured interviews with scientists and researchers. ==Criticism of National Health Service== Sikora is known for his outspoken views on National Health Service (NHS) reform, and has written for the Times, the Observer, the New Statesman, and other publications on the subject. He has been critical of the quality of cancer care available on the NHS and has argued for its restructuring, suggesting that while the UK spends as much per patient on cancer care as the rest of Europe, survival rates are substantially lower: \\"there are 10 new drugs routinely available in Boulogne but not in Brighton\\". In a 2017 Newsnight opinion piece, he described the NHS as \\"the last bastion of communism - it is a monolithic, unmanageable and inefficient system [...] the staff are great but the system is not\\". He proposed instead regarding it as a tax-based insurance scheme covering \\"basic costs\\", and allowing private providers to enter the market. An interview with Sikora, in which he suggested the NHS system led to patients losing control over their own healthcare, was featured in a May 2009 Republican Party attack ad in the US during US President Barack Obama's push to enact healthcare reform. Sikora later told The Guardian that he did not know his interview would be used in the ad campaign, and that he agreed with Obama that the main problems with the American system were \\"the high cost of medical treatment\\" and the large number of uninsured people. In a piece published online by the New Hampshire Union Leader the same day as the advertisement, Sikora was referred to as professor of oncology at Imperial College. This led Imperial to seek legal advice to stop Sikora being referred to as a current professor of cancer medicine at Imperial; a claim that he was also alleged to have made earlier in the previous five years. On 29 January 2009, Sikora was said to have introduced himself to a Commons health select committee as \\"...professor of oncology at Imperial College for 22 years.\\" Prior to 2004, Sikora had held the honorary post of Professor of Cancer Medicine at the Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith, having been the founding chair of cancer medicine at its predecessor, the Royal Postgraduate Medical School.Medical Sciences International Who's Who, Longman, 1990, p.1072 In the context of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) considering whether to apply age criteria when prescribing expensive drugs, he suggested that \\"within limited budgets\\" younger patients might be given priority over the frail elderly.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/doctor-wants-to-deny-elderly- cancer-drugs-fh23xx6dl8c ==Views on alternative medicine== Sikora has in the past suggested that alternative or \\"complementary\\" medicine might have some utility in providing psychological care to cancer patients;British Medical Journal 1989;298:1583 he has commented \\"I personally don’t think that complementary medicine is itself a cure [...] but I do believe it [...] allows you to get on top of the fact that you have cancer and live with it in a way that doesn’t disturb you psychologically too much\\". He has stated that after being invited in the 1980s to work with the Bristol Cancer Help Centre, which employed complementary therapists alongside conventional medicine, he came to believe that complementary therapies such as counselling or acupuncture could \\"help patients to complete their course of orthodox treatment\\" and \\"improve quality of life\\".\\"Empowering the patient\\", International Therapist, 89 (Jul 2009), 58 Sikora was a Foundation Fellow of Prince Charles' now-defunct alternative medicine lobby group The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. He is also a \\"professional member\\" of the College of Medicine, a patient-oriented healthcare lobby group also linked to the Prince of Wales that appeared shortly after the collapse of the FIH. Correspondents to the British Medical Journal have criticised the College for its promotion of alternative medicine, claims which it has contested. Sikora is on the advisory panel of complementary cancer care charity Penny Brohn Cancer Care (formerly the Bristol Cancer Help Centre) of which Prince Charles is a patron, and is a patron of the Iain Rennie Hospice at Home. The pharmacologist David Colquhoun noted that the School of Medicine at Buckingham University, of which Sikora is Dean, had briefly offered a diploma in \\"integrated medicine\\" (a euphemism for alternative medicine) run by the \\"Faculty of Integrated Medicine\\", adding that Sikora's own views on the subject were a \\"mystery wrapped in an enigma\\". Sikora has however, elsewhere been critical of alternative medicine; after Parliament member Lord Maurice Saatchi proposed a bill allowing doctors to use unproven experimental therapies, he noted that this could give false hope to terminally ill patients. He has contrasted therapies having \\"a profound psychological base\\", such as counselling, with others \\"founded on completely spurious pseudoscientific logic\\". ==Release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi== In September 2009, the man convicted of the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds. The Daily Telegraph reported that Sikora, along with Professors Jonathan Waxman and Ibrahim Sharif, was one of three doctors hired by the Libyan government to assess Megrahi's condition prior to the release. Sikora's report concluded that Megrahi would \\"likely\\" die within three months due to terminal prostate cancer; Sharif agreed and Waxman conceded Megrahi did not have long to live. Megrahi outlived the prognosis and died on 20 May 2012, two years and nine months after his release. Sikora later denied that he had been pressured by Libya to agree Megrahi had under three months to live: \\"on the balance of probability, you could justify that [claim], but you couldn't say he was definitely going to be dead in three months\\". The Scottish government confirmed Sikora's report was not used by the Scottish Justice Minister in making the decision to release Megrahi, which was instead based on their own medical reports and input from the parole board and governor. Sikora has since complained about the way journalists have reported his views and stated that he was not paid to make claims, and there was probably a less than one percent chance of Megrahi living 10 years. ==Works== * Interferon and cancer, 1983 * Clinical Physiology (with Campbell, Dickinson, Slater and Edwards), 1984 * Endocrine Problems in Cancer (with Roland T.

Among other occupations, he was a Missouri State Representative before the Civil War and a Kentucky State Representative in 1885–1886. Thomas A. Harris was born in Warren County, Virginia in 1826. His family moved to Missouri when Harris was a young boy. An orphan, he fought in the 1838 Mormon War at the age of 12.

Although he saw little of him, David Railton shared his father's faith and concern for the poorest in society. He was educated at Keble College, Oxford, matriculating in 1904 and obtaining his BA degree in 1908 and was further educated at Bishop's Hostel, in Liverpool. Having joined the Church of England he was ordained in Liverpool in 1908 and took up the curacy of Edge Hill in Liverpool. ==World War I== In 1910, he moved to Ashford, Kent, and in the following year became temporary chaplain to the Forces. He was curate of Folkestone in 1914–20, but had leave of absence to serve in France. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1916 for saving an officer and two men under heavy fire. Railton first had the idea of arranging for the body of an unknown serviceman to be transported back to England, and buried with full honours, in 1916, while he was serving on the Western Front during World War I. Later in the war he wrote to Lord Douglas Haig expressing this idea. He received no response, but felt reluctant to let it go.THE UNKNOWN WARRIOR ‘Unknown and yet well known’ Compiled by Mary P Wilkinson, (2000) Imperial War Museum, London ==The Unknown Warrior== The Tomb of The Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey After the War Railton became the vicar of St. John the Baptist Church at Margate, but he still hoped to impress the authorities with his idea. In August, 1920 he wrote to Bishop Ryle, the Dean of Westminster, about the possibility of giving an unidentified soldier a national burial service in Westminster Abbey. Ryle took up the idea and his and Lloyd George's enthusiasm won over the initially hesitant King George V. In October 1920 Railton heard that his idea had been accepted by the Government. A committee headed by Lord Curzon, the then Foreign Secretary, was arranging for an unknown \\"warrior\\" to be disinterred in France and brought to Westminster Abbey. On 7 November 1920 six, or according to other accounts four, working parties visited the battlefields of Ypres, the Marne, Cambrai, Arras, the Somme, and the Aisne, where units of the Royal Naval division as well as the Army had died: each party exhumed an unidentified body which was examined to ensure that it was British before being placed in a plain coffin. At midnight one of these coffins was chosen by Brigadier General L. J. Wyatt, General Officer Commanding troops in France and Flanders, and thus became the official \\"Unknown Warrior\\", placed in a new coffin bearing the inscription \\"A British Warrior who fell in the Great War 1914–1918 for King and Country\\".M. Gavaghan, The Story of the Unknown Warrior (1997). In 1916 Railton was an experienced and mature man in his thirties and was appalled at the sufferings and loss caused by the War. He later tried to explain why he had felt it was so important to commemorate the individual in this way. He recalled an incident near Armentières where he came across a grave with a rough wooden cross inscribed \\"An unknown British soldier, of the Black Watch\\": > How that grave caused me to think!... But, who was he, and who were they > [his folk]?... Was he just a laddie... . There was no answer to those > questions, nor has there ever been yet. So I thought and thought and > wrestled in thought. What can I do to ease the pain of father, mother, > brother, sister, sweetheart, wife and friend? Quietly and gradually there > came out of the mist of thought this answer clear and strong, \\"Let this body > – this symbol of him – be carried reverently over the sea to his native > land\\". And I was happy for about five or ten minutes. ==Later years== After the war Railton returned briefly to Folkestone before being successively vicar of St John the Baptist, Margate (1920–25), curate of Christ Church, Westminster, vicar of St James's, Bolton, Yorkshire, vicar of Shalford, near Guildford (1931–35), rector of St Nicholas's, Liverpool, and archbishop's visitor to the RAF (1943–45) before his retirement in 1945. In addition, he worked with the Revd Geoffrey Anketell Studdert Kennedy (better- known as the First World War padre poet \\"Woodbine Willie\\") for the Church of England's Industrial Christian Fellowship, among workers at their places of work.Obituary, 1 July 1955. \\"Padre\\" Railton made his home in retirement at Ard Rhu, Onich, Inverness-shire, and was returning there on 30Register of Deaths – 09 August 1955 Fort William June 1955 from Battle, Sussex, where he had been helping the Rural Dean, when he accidentally fell from a moving train at Fort William railway station and died from his injuries.

In the early 1970s, while Don Remington was visiting England, he came across a man named Colonel Graville Williams who sold him the carriage BBreak by Holland & Holland, London. Remington's Royal Hansom Cab #4212 Made by Forder & Company Limited, Wolverhampton, England Circa 1870. ==The famous Concord coach== Concord Wells Fargo Remington Collection... Concord Stagecoach Wells Fargo Another Concord in the collection is an original Buffalo Bill's Stages North Platte Nebraska stagecoach. ==Notables in the Remington Collection== The Wells Fargo & Co. Yellowstone Wagon, made by Abbot-Downing Company, Concord, New Hampshire, circa 1886. This carriage was later used as a touring wagon in Yellowstone National Park. When Don Remington set about restoring the wagon, they found the original Wells Fargo & Co. lettering on each side. == Hollywood and The Remington Collection == The popular Fox television show The Simpsons episode 17 of the 17th season, \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore\\", features sisters Patty and Selma kidnapping Richard Dean Anderson, the actor who played action hero MacGyver. Selma and Patty show Dean slides of their summer vacation, including various carriages from the Remington Museum with a front image of Patty and Selma standing next to a bronze statue of the museum's visionary, Don Remington. Hollywood has made the covered wagon and stagecoach icons of the idealized Old West, and the Remington Carriage Museum has both, including coaches used in past and present Hollywood productions. Visitors can climb aboard the stagecoach used by Jackie Chan in Disney's Shanghai Noon and by Tom Selleck in Crossfire Trail. The Fay Wray Fountain Memorial is located one block from the Remington Carriage Museum. Fay Wray rose to fame as the dame in distress in the immortal 1933 film King Kong. When Fay Wray returned to Cardston in 1967, she rode in a Remington Concord Stagecoach. Cowboy Country Television profiled Don Remington, season 4 episode 12. ==Horses and The Remington Collection== The story of 19th century transportation would be incomplete without the horse, and the museum's herd of Clydesdales, Quarter Horses and Canadians are a major feature of daily programs. An elegant equestrian eventing program is also featured at the museum, demonstrating the skill and protocol of competitive driving horses in harness. Each horse breed is selected to support the ride program at the museum. The Clydesdale breed is a widely recognized draft horse used in teams of two, three or four to pull large vehicles seating up to 18 passengers. This breed is known famously as the Budweiser Clydesdale horses. The American Quarter Horse is bred for speed and for distance, up to a quarter mile, and they are well suited to pulling wagons, buggies and sleighs. The Canadian Horse was bred from horses shipped to Quebec from France in 1665. Their stamina and quiet temperament make this breed a perfect choice for carriage work. Pairs of Quarter Horses and Canadians are used at the museum to pull smaller carriages up to six people. Tack is also an important part of the carriage, Don Remington made thousands of unique one of a kind tack... The Remington Carriage Museum is part of a network of historic sites and museums in Alberta which include Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the Frank Slide Centre. The museum is open year-round, 7 days a week. Cardston is also home to the first Mormon LDS temple built outside the United States. ==Affiliations== The museum is affiliated with CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada. ==References== Category:Museums established in 1993 Category:Transport museums in Alberta Category:Carriage museums Category:Buildings and structures in Cardston County Category:Cardston Category:1993 establishments in Alberta ","title":"Remington Carriage Museum"},{"id":"20430007","text":"Stephen Wakelam is an English writer and playwright born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire.

It includes various forms of art therapy, whereby individuals and groups can express themselves to nurture healing and restoration. It is also used to overcome the recurrence of violence, as a preventative measure to make the foundations of peace stronger, especially in contexts of war and conflict. Creating an environment of lasting peace is the primary goal of creative peacebuilding. == War and conflict == According to Johan Galtung, peacebuilding is the process of creating self- supporting structures that \\"remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur.\\" For John Paul Lederach, peacebuilding is a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships, which involves a wide range of activities. It has a diverse range of interaction and involves various stakeholders in various levels within the spectrum of governance and development. Creative peacebuilding facilitates the establishments of sustainable peace by preventing recurrence of violence, addresses the root causes, healing and effects of conflict, and offer alternatives to violence through reconciliation, economic and social transformation with the use of photography, film, painting, and the like. Jolyon Mitchell argues that the visual arts can both encourage peacebuilding and instigating violence. This is true of various forms of visual arts, ranging from posters, cartoons, and stained glass, to websites, radio, and films by reflecting on examples from around the world. Creative peacebuilding can be especially powerful when used with those suffering from a young demographic and those with post-traumatic stress disorder. For at-risk youth, it lays the roots for a peaceful lifestyle and to help children who have already experienced trauma in their lives become fully functional adults. ==Art therapy== Art therapy has been used to help rehabilitate child soldiers in Uganda as well as to help children who lost their homes in the tsunami of 2004 cope with their feelings. Many youth centers catering to impoverished children use art forms to build community, discipline and trust. === Music === Music therapy can be used in several different fashions to build peace. It can be used to help individuals express themselves or to foster communication between individuals or groups of people. It can be used to nurture healing and reconciliation. Music is something that transcends language and national or ethnic boundaries. It has unique styles depending on the community it originates in and can also be adapted to fit individual's tastes. When two groups who have been in conflict or have the potential for conflict make music together communication and healing become possible. When individuals listen to or play music, they can reduce their stress levels and express their feelings. === Visual arts === Visual art therapy can be used to help individuals cope with their feelings resulting from violent experiences. It is also used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Art therapy is especially useful for people who are having trouble verbalizing their feelings and are keeping them bottled up. By sharing their experiences and processing them through a tactical and visual activity, people are able to heal. No prior experience with visual art is needed to participate in and gain benefits from art therapy—it is about the process of creation, not about the aesthetic appeal of the product. Art therapy can be used in group settings as well—creating a collaborative art project can be an experience that bridges differences between people and builds feelings of trust. === Visualization and technology === If people who have lived through traumatic or violent experiences can relive them and change the situation or their response to the situation they can come to terms with their past. Virtual technology and especially virtual reality simulations can be especially useful in cases like these and have been used to treat veterans of the Iraq war who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. If the technology needed for these simulations is too expensive to be practical, mental visualization, in which the victim uses their imagination to create situations and feel as if they are gaining control of the way events play out, can be used as an alternative. ==ExamplesCreate Peace Project=== Create Peace Project is an arts-for-peace education organization working to promote the practices of peace and spread the message of hope and goodwill to children around the world using creativity. Create Peace Project was founded in San Francisco, California in 2007 by artist and peace activist Ross Holzman in response to the overwhelming amount of violence in the world, on the news, and in our communities. Violence, coupled with the lack of creativity in peoples lives sparked the creation of projects such as Banners for Peace and The Peace Exchange. Create Peace Project has included more than 25,000 children from around the world in its arts-for-peace projects since its inception and continues to work with schools in the US and beyond promoting peace through creativity to children of all ages. ===Barefoot artists=== Artist Lily Yeh has helped to heal the wounds genocide left on a village of widows and orphans through her work with Barefoot Artists. The members of the community were provided with a chance to honor their lost loved ones through their construction of a beautiful and expressive monument commemorating the mass grave of the local victims of the genocide. The construction process also provided a sense of closure to their mourning. Other aspects of the peacebuilding process in the village included paintings on building walls created by the village children of things that they hoped to see in the future as well as things important to their everyday existence. On the economic side of this peacebuilding effort, the people of the village learned how to mosaic and pour concrete, two useful and marketable skills to help provide economic stability. ===River City Drum Corps=== In the United States, creative peacebuilding is used in many inner-city areas in places such as New York, Philadelphia, and Louisville. The River City Drum Corps in Louisville, Ky provides a musical outlet for children who perhaps are not listened to in other parts of their lives. It is also a structured program where discipline and the importance of both uniqueness and teamwork are taught. The children learn drumming patterns and perform for different events and groups of people throughout the city. Both the children in the program and their audience benefit from the cultural exchange and communication that take place during drum corps performances. == See also == * Creative peacebuilding (visual arts) == References External links == * American Art Therapy Association, https://arttherapy.org * Art & Healing Organizations, http://artheals.org/resources/art_healing_organizations.html Category:Peacebuilding Category:Art therapy ","title":"Creative peacebuilding"},{"id":"20430092","text":"Eric Albronda (born November 18, 1945) is an American musician, best known as a co-founder of the band Blue Cheer.

They come from the Indo-Pacific which is variously a commercial gamefish, an invasive species, and occasionally an aquarium resident. Its species name comes from its resemblance to the \\"hundred staring eyes\\" of the monster Argus in Greek mythology. ==Description== Cephalopholis argus, Hawaii This is a medium-sized fish that can reach a length of . Small individuals are dark brown with hundreds of small, dark- edged iridescent blue spots. Larger specimens sometimes develop four to six lighter vertical bars on the back half of its body. Cephalopholis argus, Vilamendhoo Maldives ==Distribution and habitat== The species is extremely widely distributed, occurring in warm waters from the Red Sea to South Africa and east to French Polynesia and the Pitcairn group. It is also present in northern Australia, Lord Howe Island, and Japan, and has been introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It makes use of a variety of habitats but prefers the exposed fronts of reefs, at depths of up to 40 m. ==EcologyFeeding=== Hunting, they lie on the bottom and surge forward, preferring juvenile surgeonfish and crustaceans. Alternatively they may hover motionless in the water column before attacking. This grouper may follow and cooperate with another predator species, such as an octopus or eel or camouflage themselves in a school of surgeonfish. Multiple individuals may cooperate to harass an eel to get it to flush prey for them. In the Red Sea, they hunt in the morning and evening. ===Behavior=== The species typically sit on a coral head, retreating when startled. Red Sea males defend harems of 2–6 females in territories ranging up to . Each female defends part of the territory from the other females. The male visits each female daily, raising his dorsal fin to signal his approach. The females emerges from hiding, erecting her own dorsal fin and changing to a lighter color. They swim together, rubbing flanks before he departs until the next day. Territorial disputes may involve \\"color fights\\" in which two males positioning themselves at right angles to each other. They then darken their color and repeatedly switch their bars from dark to light. The loser becomes pale and retreats. If the color fight ends in a draw, the two males may attack each other. ===Reproduction=== In Micronesia, spawning usually occurs territorially at dusk. During courtship, both sexes darken except for a white keyhole-shaped patch at the center of the body. ==In the aquarium== Cephalopholis argus is a hardy aquarium fish for those who have a large marine aquarium. Its large size combined with its aggressive nature means it is best housed either alone or with other large aggressive fish such as lionfish, and moray eels. As a predator it will eat any smaller aquarium inhabitants such as damselfish. ==Introduced status in Hawaii== Known in Hawaii as roi, the state introduced the species in the 1950s to enhance local fisheries. Hawaii's Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR) finds that roi have become the reefs' dominant predator. The Roi population there has increased 15 fold since the 1980s. From 1999 to 2005 there was a 23% increase in their population. Their biomass is now greater than that of all other reef fish predators combined. These predators threaten native reef fish such as parrotfish and goatfish. A University of Hawaii study estimated that in a three-square-mile area off the Kona Coast of Hawaii Island, Roi eat of reef fish annually— equivalent to 8.2 million fish. ===Ciguatera=== Prized as delicious eating in other Pacific regions, in Hawaii's waters roi may contain the ciguatera toxin, which builds up in humans and causes serious illness. A study published in 2007 found that 18% of Roi sampled from Oahu and Hawaii islands had toxins above levels safe for consumption. Due to high variability of toxin levels between individuals in the same area, toxicity cannot be predicted based on location. There is a weak correlation between the length of Roi and their toxicity, however, due to high variability, this is not a reliable predictor of toxicity.Dierking, Jan. 2007. Effects Of The Introduced Predatory Fish Cephalopholis argus on Native Reef Fish Populations In Hawaii. There is currently no commercially available testing kit. Because of the toxicity issues, Roi does not have a functional fishery, with just an average of $1000 per year in sales. ===Diet=== Analysis of stomach contents of Hawaiian roi found that diets consist of 97.7% fish and 2.3% crustaceans. Of the fish eaten, there were 27.1% Scaridae (Parrotfish), 18.7% Acanthuridae (Surgeonfish), 17.6% Squirrelfish, 13.7% Monacanthidae (Filefish), 9.3% Priacanthidae (Bigeyes), 4.3% Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfish), 2.8% Aulostomidae (Trumpetfishes), and 6.9% other consisting of 9 families. Roi are estimated to eat 0.8% of their body weight each day. ===Impact=== Roi feed primarily on juvenile fish that have recruited the reef. The family of fish that make up the majority of their diet Scaridae or Parrotfish, are crucial to the coral reef ecosystem by removing algal growth on coral colonies through feeding. Parrotfish also play a large role in the production of sand. Hawaii has the highest rate of endemism of its nearshore marine fish species at 24.3%. The lack of natural predators to control Roi populations along with their high efficiency is a major threat to the unique fish fauna found in Hawaii. Ichthyologist Dr. Jack Randall describes the impact of Roi in Hawaii as greater than the impact of fishing and aquarium collection combined. Estimates of consumption on the Kona coast suggest that Roi consume 11% of the total reef fish biomass and 72% of the total number of fish. ===Roundups=== On Maui, spearfishers participate in \\"Roi Roundup\\" tournaments that target these problematic fish, attempting to reduce their numbers and impact. This practice has spread to other islands, where there are similar tournaments that target roi and other invasive fish species. These events not only reduce the roi population, but also work to boost public awareness about this issue. ==Conservation== The species is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. and is widespread and common throughout its range. It is exploited in commercial and recreational fisheries and for the aquarium trade. ==References *Blue Spotted Grouper Species Profile :: AquariumDomain *animal-world.com Page on blue-spotted grouper *fishbase Page on Cephalopholis argus * argus Category:Fish of Hawaii Category:Fish described in 1801 ","title":"Cephalopholis argus"},{"id":"20430174","text":"William Ekron Bowman Jr. (September 22, 1931 – February 7, 2008) was a professional American football player who played fullback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Detroit Lions and the Pittsburgh Steelers. ==External links== * * Category:1931 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Birmingham, Alabama Category:Players of American football from Alabama Category:American football fullbacks Category:William & Mary Tribe football players Category:William & Mary Tribe men's basketball players Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Pittsburgh Steelers players Category:San Francisco 49ers players Category:American men's basketball players ","title":"Bill Bowman (American football)"},{"id":"20430185","text":"John or Jack Robinson was a tenant of William Shakespeare in London, UK towards the end of the latter's life.

The song is best known for its use in the United States Navy's \\"Accelerate Your Life\\" commercials, following a similar use of the album's title track. \\"Sick of Life\\" was written during Godsmack's tour supporting their self-titled album. ==\\"Accelerate Your Life\\" commercials== In one of the recruitment advertisements, the beginning of \\"Sick of Life\\" plays in the background while scenes showing men dropping out of helicopters and scuba diving are juxtaposed with the image of a civilian's mundane life. The voice goes \\"And to think, somewhere, some poor guy is buying a mini van\\". Godsmack frontman Sully Erna told ArthurMag.com about the use of \\"Sick of Life\\" in U.S. Navy commercials: \\"The military came to us, believe it or not. Somebody in the Navy loves this band, because they used \\"Awake\\" for three years and then they came to us and re-upped the contract for another three years for \\"Sick of Life.\\" So, I don't know.

What we support is our troops. And the women and men that go over there — or anywhere — to fight for our country and our lives and protect our freedom and I feel that.\\"Arthur Magazine - Talking to Godsmack \\"I actually sympathize with a lot of the soldiers, and the military in general, that are trained to go out and protect for us, and what they have to go through, it's really kind of shitty in a sense that these young kids have to go over there and die, sometimes, for something that isn't our problem. And that kind of sucks. So what I have to do is at least support them, because they don't have the choice that we do.\\"Sully Erna Visits \\"Showbiz Tonight\\" Some critics say that the band's young audience will now be influenced to join the military because of the popular tunes. However, Erna doubts very seriously that a kid is going to join the Marines or the US Navy because he heard Godsmack as the underlying bed music in the commercial. ==References * YouTube - Godsmack - Sick of Life (LIVE @ Worcester, 2001) * YouTube - US Navy Recruiting Ad * Category:Godsmack songs Category:2000 songs Category:Songs written by Sully Erna ","title":"Sick of Life"},{"id":"20430377","text":"Ján Zachar (born 1936)http://web.quick.cz/jfk-fotbal.kopecky/LIGATREN.htm is a Slovak football coach.

It is a Grade II listed building. The Clarke family owned the estate in the 16th century. Godfrey Clarke and his son Sir Gilbert Clarke served as High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1652 and 1676 respectively. Sir Gilbert bought an additional estate at Chilcote Hall in 1672. His son Godfrey Clarke was Member of Parliament for Derbyshire. He left the estate to his nephew, also Godfrey Clarke, who lived at Chilcote, was High Sheriff in 1740, bought Sutton Scarsdale Hall and built a new house at Somersall. The new house was built in 1763 on the site of an earlier 17th-century house and incorporates some of the early features. The new work created a three-storey three-bayed house with an east-facing entrance front. In the 19th century a two-storey wing was added to the north of the frontage. A gazebo (possibly originally part of the house) is Grade II* listed and the gatepiers in front of the house are listed at Grade II. Sutton became the family seat and Somersall was let out as a farmhouse. Godfrey Bagnall Clarke died without issue and his estates passed to his sister and then to her daughter who married Walter Butler, 18th Earl of Ormonde. On the Earls death in 1824 the estates were broken up. The house was rented for about 30 years in the early to middle part of the 20th century to John and Rosemary Milward and their family, John being a Milward's Needles heir and the surgeon at Chesterfield Hospital. They later bought the ancient Barlow Woodseats Hall in Barlow, Derbyshire and restored it. ==References== * A History of the County of Derby Glover and Noble (1829) p.143, Google Books Category:Country houses in Derbyshire Category:Grade II listed buildings in Derbyshire Category:History of Derbyshire Category:People from Chesterfield (district) ","title":"Somersall Hall"},{"id":"20430506","text":"Oren Nisim (, born 4 November 1976) is a retired Israeli footballer.

The park encompasses an area once occupied by settlers in what was a thriving community on the river. Later, Confederate soldiers were garrisoned here and fought in the last major battle of the U.S. Civil War against superior Union forces. ==History== The park was founded by school teacher Mary Grice, of Mobile, Alabama. In 1976 the park was established as a private not-for-profit foundation. The goal was to preserve and redevelop the area. In 1981, the Alabama Legislature named Blakeley a state park and created a separate state authority to oversee operations. Although it is called a state park, it is not operated by the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. State funding was suspended during 2011, and the park is now fully funded by private contributions and gate receipts. In 1993, Blakeley was named a Class A Civil War site by the United States Congress. The park is part of the Civil War Discovery Trail due to it being the site of the Battle of Fort Blakeley. Some remnants of battlefield operations remain including the Confederate breastworks that cross the park. Some effort is underway to restore the Confederate and Union constructs that supported the Battle of Fort Blakeley. That battle, involving over 16,000 soldiers occurred on the same day as the Confederate surrender. African-American troops made up a significant number of the Union forces. Little evidence remains today of the previous town of Blakeley. A few historical markers designate important locations such as a brick kiln and an old oak tree used as a hanging tree for the local courts. A river crossing here once linked Mobile and Baldwin counties. Prior to the establishment of the town of Blakeley, an ancient Native American village existed and, later, a large plantation occupied this location. ==Location and activities== The park is located on Alabama 225 just north of the town of Spanish Fort, Alabama. The park is bounded on the east by the highway and by the river to the west. Mobile, Alabama can be seen in the distance across the river. Camping, both primitive and RV, is available year-round. Group campsites are also available. Numerous picnic areas and over of hiking trails are found within the park. The park charges a fee for admission and for camping. A motorized launch takes guests on a tour of the delta region during warmer months. ==Gatra Wehle Nature Center== The Gatra Wehle Nature Center, located on Green Street in Historic Blakeley State Park, features conservation and environmental educational exhibits about the Mobile-Tensaw River Delta.

Using the Internet, G-HOU participants around the world request observations from an automated telescope, download images from a large image archive, and analyze them with the aid of user-friendly image processing software, as described by Dr. Miller. ==About== Global Hands-On Universe is a worldwide project, with extensions over all the continents, the root project being GHOU. The project is based on observations, possibly acquired by the pupils themselves in classrooms thanks to a worldwide network of automatic telescopes operated via Internet or didactic tools (webcam system, radio telescope) developed within this project. These observations can be manipulated in classrooms with a specific software designed to be pupil- friendly. They are integrated into pedagogical resources constructed in a close collaborative work between researchers and teachers. The resources developed in the course of this project are posted on the Web site. ==History== The International Astronomical Union (IAU) launched in 2009 the Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP), a Cornerstone project of the International Year of Astronomy 2009. GHOU is a major component of GTTP. GHOU, among which EU-HOU is the leading consortium, is now officially included in the Astronomy for the Developing World Strategic Plan 2010-20 of IAU, under Section 3.4.2 Astronomy for Children and Schools. During the next decade the IAU will concentrate more resources on education activities for children and schools designed to advance sustainable global development. In Europe, the EU- HOU project is led by Dr. Ferlet & Dr A.-L. Melchior. EU-HOU has been funded through the European Community (EC) program MINERVA (SOCRATES) for a two-year period (2004–2006), and through the European Community (EC) program COMENIUS (LifeLong Learning Program) for two two-year periods (2008–2010, 2010-2012). EU-HOU has extended up to 15 EC countries, with national websites. The Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris is the educational centre for the EU-HOU project. The EU-HOU project has developed numerous (free) pedagogical resources tested in classrooms and posted on the project's website. The most ambitious ones are: (1) the multilingual SalsaJ software: it enables secondary school pupils to handle astronomical data and analyse them. An exercise series based on this software has been developed. Associated data can be downloaded directly from the software. (2) The EUHOUMW Small Radiotelescope Network developed in the framework of the Comenius project \\"Connecting classrooms to the Milky Way\\" enables secondary school pupils to access the instruments installed in five different European countries (France, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain). Kids can observe the hydrogen from the Milky Way with these 3-metres radiotelescopes. Every operation can be performed from the Web interface, available in 17 different languages, which enables the learners to reconstruct the rotation curve of the Milky Way as well as its spiral arms. Pedagogical resources (teacher's manual, simulator of observation, archives, kinesthetic activities) have been tested in teacher's training, secondary school level and also at undergraduate level. In America, the US HOU project is led by the United States with support from the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy. In the USA, HOU has developed and pilot tested an educational program that enables high school students to request their own observations from professional observatories. Students download telescope images to their classroom computers and use the powerful HOU image processing software to visualize and analyze their data. High school curriculum developed by HOU integrates many of the science and math topics and skills outlined in national standards into open-ended astronomical investigations. HOU has also developed activities and tools for middle school students and products for informal science education centers. The Lawrence Hall of Science at University of California, Berkeley, is the educational center for the HOU project. In Asia, the AS-HOU section have China and Japan strongly involved. They have their own web sites. In Africa, AF-HOU is now extending to Kenya with a recently launched pilot, researchbased astronomy and astrophysics curriculum into Kenya High in Nairobi, Kenya as a vehicle to introducing the methodologies of scientific research into secondary education. == Teacher training sessions == In the context of the European Commission Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013, EU-HOU proposes regular European training sessions in France, at Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University in Paris, since 2010. These sessions are published on the Comenius training database (reference numbers: FR-2010-314-003, FR-2011-359-006, FR-2013-408-003). The main goal of these training sessions is to re-awake the interest for science in the young generation with inquiry-based methods. Active methods based e.g. on kinesthesia (Proprioception) have been recently introduced to introduce modelling concepts. Renewing of the teaching of science is fulfilled through astronomy as a well-established source of motivation, and through the use of new information and communication technologies (ICT). Involving teachers in a variety of research-based astronomical projects, they will get excited, enthused and motivated to teach science/technology/maths. The training is intended to enhance basic competencies of teachers and develop higher level skills and expertise, primarily in Information and communication technologies in education (ICT), maths and physics area. These sessions are financed through European Commission Comenius national Agencies (Comenius programme). Information related to scheduled training sessions are posted on the EU-HOU Website and its news. A dedicated forum in English has been opened to favour feed-back from trained teachers and interaction with a wider educator and researcher community. ==See also== * Global Science Opera ==References External links == * Official site of Global Hands-On Universe GHOU * Official site of European Hands-On Universe EU-HOU * Official site of US Hands-On Universe US HOU * Official site of Asian Hands-On Universe AS-HOU * Official site of Spanish Hands-On Universe HOU-Spain * Official site for Teachers training sessions registering Category:Science education Category:Amateur astronomy organizations ","title":"Global Hands-On Universe"},{"id":"20430619","text":"Atriplex elegans is a species of saltbush known by the common name wheelscale saltbush, Mecca orach,Mojave Desert Wildflowers, Pam MacKay, 2nd ed., 2013, or wheelscale.

The character first appeared on screen during the episode airing on 26 November 2008. Mary's storylines have included: trying to seduce Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) and kidnapping him when he refuses to give her attention, yet later becoming close friends; falling in love with Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin); an affair with Brendan Finch (Ted Robbins); and revealing that she gave birth to a son after being raped when she was fourteen years old. Producers later introduced a new family for Mary consisting of son Jude Appleton (Paddy Wallace), his wife Angie Appleton (Victoria Ekanoye) and a grandson. Mary is often used in comedic stories and Clare has won two comedy related awards for her portrayal of Mary. ==Casting== Clare had wanted to work on Coronation Street for some time. She wrote to the casting director requesting her involvement but was refused. She then wrote her own part for the show, a character named Cherise who would have been the sister of Raquel Watts (Sarah Lancashire). The casting department wrote back to Clare rejecting her idea. Clare was offered the role of Mary in September 2008 and Mary was billed as a \\"oddball competition winner\\". Mary was initially intended to be a guest role for five episodes. But the character's one-liners were well received by viewers and her time on the show was extended. The character remained on- screen on a recurring basis until May 2009. Clare was invited back to play the role on a regular basis signed to longer contracts. The actress has also taken part in the 2010 spin-off show titled \\"Coronation Street: A Knights Tale\\". ==DevelopmentNorris Cole=== Upon being introduced into the series Mary bonds with established character Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) over their interest of entering competitions. Mary develops feelings for Norris and tries to flirt with him. He does not respond to her behaviour and she tries to seduce him. He rejects her and becomes concerned about her romantic intentions. When Mary's mother dies she decides to go travelling. The character was later reintroduced to the series and a show publicist stated that Mary returns with the intention to reconnect with Norris. Hebden has claimed that his off-screen friendship with Clare helped to create a good comedy duo with Mary and Norris. Norris agrees to go on a cottage holiday with Mary. Brian Roberts from the Daily Mirror revealed that Coronation Street had planned a kidnapping storyline in similar to the narrative featured in the novel Misery. While at the cottage Mary vandalises their car and telephone to prevent Norris from leaving. Mary develops fantasies of her and Norris having a romance resembling Heathcliffe and Cathy, fictional characters from the novel Wuthering Heights. Norris tries to escape but hurts his ankle and she refuses to take him to the hospital. The storyline takes a sinister turn when Norris watches Mary using an axe in the yard. He begins to fear Mary and barricades himself in the cottage. Roberts revealed that Mary becomes \\"seriously demented\\" during the scenes. Hebden branded the plot as \\"strangely enjoyable\\" to portray. He believed that rival soap operas had not portrayed such a strange \\"one-off\\" story. ===Brendan Finch=== In 2015, Producer Stuart Blackburn announced that he had planned romance and comedy stories for Mary. The casting department hired Ted Robbins to play Brendan Finch who was billed as a new love interest for Mary. The pair bond over Mary's interest in Brendan's magazines. Robbins stated that \\"he has a bit of a backbone and I think Mary likes that.\\" He believed that Mary is instantly attracted to Brendan and he notices. The pair start an affair in secret as Brendan is married. He tells Mary that he will eventually leave his wife and plan a future with Mary. Clare told David Brown of Radio Times that Mary is true to her characterisation and has fantasies about the relationship. She believes everything that Brendan has told her. He is a \\"clever man\\" who knows the right things to say and Mary believes him. The actress added \\"she’s totally fallen for him and he's everything to Mary: he’s manly, he’s straight out of a Mills and Boon novel.\\" Norris is upset about her affair and does not like Brendan. Clare explained that Norris has become a \\"very loyal friend\\" to Mary but she thinks that he is jealous of her relationship. Dev walks in on Mary and Brendan being intimate and she is so embarrassed that she quits her child- minding job. It was later reported that Brendan's wife Bridget would be introduced. A publicist from Coronation Street told Susan Hill of the Daily Star that Bridget slaps Mary in the face in-front of her neighbours. They added that Brendan is a \\"love rat\\" who used Mary for sex and Bridget knows exactly what her husband is like. Clare believed that her character was filled with excitement by Bridget's arrival. She believed it was to be the \\"eye of the storm\\" in her romantic novel. She presumed that the public showing would be the first step towards her future with Brendan. She thinks it is time for Bridget to know the truth, but the scenario plays out different. Brendan denies all knowledge of their affair, sides with his Bridget and she insults Mary. Clare explained that her character is left \\"humiliated [and] mortified\\" because her close friends Dev and Erica are witness to the attack. She was not worried for her character's emotional development and added \\"she’s been badly bruised but Mary’s extremely resilient. She’s like the Terminator, perhaps to the point of being foolhardy.\\" ===Secret son=== In 2016, producers decided to introduce a family for the character. Writers created a breast cancer scare for Mary. But when her results return clear, she remains upset and her friends are confused. David Brown from Radio Times reported that Mary would \\"deliver shock news\\" that would leave other characters in \\"astonishment\\". No more details were publicised prior to transmission. Norris becomes concerned for her and asks her for the truth. Mary tells Norris that she was sexually assaulted when she was fourteen and gave birth to a son. Mary's mother had forced her to conceal the pregnancy and give the child, who she had named Jude, up for adoption. Norris convinces Mary to find Jude, believing that he will not blame her for what happened. Soon Paddy Wallace joined the cast as Mary's son Jude Appleton. He gets to know Mary and asks her to move to South Africa with him. She accepts and makes preparations to leave Weatherfield. However, the character remained on the show. Wallace later joined the cast on a permanent basis and writers introduced Mary's daughter in law Angie Appleton (Victoria Ekanoye) and grandson George Appleton (Romeo Cheetam-Karcz). Their introduction storyline involved Mary and Norris creating a sham marriage in order to win a competition. Jude and Angie arrive for the wedding and later end up moving into Coronation Street. Ekanoye told Radio Time's Brown that Jude decides to stay because getting to know Mary is a \\"big thing for him\\". She added that Mary is pivotal in convincing Jude and Angie to stay. She added \\"she wants her family around. So you will see her clashing with Angie quite a bit. But, in time, they might become quite a formidable force.\\" Mary settles with her new-found family. Later stories for them include Jude pretending to be a marine biologist despite only working in an aquarium gift shop. Mary decides to keep the secret and helps him lie to Angie. ==Storylines== Mary became familiar with Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) after repeatedly beating him at competitions. They met up in November 2008 and Mary was instantly taken with Norris. As they starting spending time together, Mary told Norris that she cared for her invalid mother and used the competitions as a way of escape. Although shy around most people, Mary was happier in Norris's company, although her boundless enthusiasm was often met with bemusement by the more cynical Norris. Mary also spent Christmas with him and Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire). Mary and Norris won a holiday in the Bronte Country, and Norris agreed to go with Mary when Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) offered to look after The Kabin. When they arrived at their house, Mary began to enjoy herself, spending most of the days entering competitions, but Norris rebuffed her attempts to get cozy and soon made plans to spend time away from the cottage and phoned Rita to complain about Mary. To keep Norris under control, Mary cut the phone lines and told Norris the motor home wouldn't start, so they couldn't go anywhere. Mary found Norris had run off and went looking for him in the motor home. He sprained his ankle while running away, and was forced to return so that Mary could take care of him. Upon their return, Mary suggested that they get married, and was relieved when Norris didn't immediately say no. The next day, Norris overheard Mary talking to her mother and phoned the police, as he was convinced that Mary was mad and that Mary was going to kill him like she killed her mother. The police arrived and brought them both to the station, but Mary was released without charge as there was no evidence of foul play at the cottage, and Mary's mother was actually still alive, as Mary confessed to Norris after visiting him. Norris refused to listen to Mary and rejected her attempts to speak to him thereafter, having been deeply disturbed by his ordeal at the cottage. Mary persisted with her attempts to stay in Norris's life and they become friends. After the death of Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati), Mary became the full-time nanny to her children Aadi and Asha and took care of the domestic duties, after widower Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) struggled to cope single-handed with the children and his business. She began to have feelings towards Dev and she and Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) fought for Dev's affections however Julie and Dev later begin a relationship. Mary later has her mobile home removed and has to move in with Julie and clashes with her, as Dev is not around. Dev returns to the street and he breaks up with Julie after developing feelings for his friend Talisa, making Mary happy. Mary meets a fellow fan of seances and mysterious happenings, Brendan Finch (Ted Robbins) and begins a relationship with him, however after finding out he has a wife she breaks up with him, leaving Mary heartbroken. Mary and Dev spend a night together and whilst he panics that they had sex and worries about his girlfriend Erica Holroyd (Claire King) Mary later reveals that they didn't have sex and just slept together after getting drunk. Mary tells Norris that when she was 14 years old, she used to babysit for a family friend, who later raped her. She consequently fell pregnant. As her pregnancy became more conspicuous, her mother informed the neighbours that Mary was visiting an aunt. Following a homebirth, her son was left on the doorstep of St Jude's church in Newton-le-Willows. He was subsequently named Jude by a nurse named Maureen Nuttall. Mary's son finds her and asks her to move to South Africa with him, to which she agrees. After saying goodbye to her friends in The Rovers, Mary and Jude leave for the airport. However, she changes her mind and tells Norris that she wants to stay in Weatherfield. ==Reception== Clare has been recognised for her comic scenes and storylines on Coronation Street. In 2011 the actress was nominated for 'Funniest Performance' at the Inside Soap Awards and won 'Best Comedy Performance' at the British Soap Awards. More \\"funniest female\\" nominations followed for Clare at the 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 Inside Soap Awards. The character's behaviour and stories have led her to be dubbed as \\"Scary Mary\\" and \\"Mad Mary\\" in British media. Jennifer Rodger from the Daily Mirror branded Mary's love life a \\"complete disaster area\\". She opined that the writers were cruel to Mary with endless heartbreak put onto the character.

Although they were not the first recordings of the individual symphonies, Bernstein's advocacy was an important part of the Mahler boom of the 1960s (especially in the US) and helped increase the popularity of the less commonly played symphonies like the third, sixth, and seventh. The cycle used performances by the New York Philharmonic—the same orchestra that Mahler led during a brief tenure between 1909 and his death in 1911—as well as a performance of the 8th symphony by the London Symphony Orchestra. Bernstein subsequently re-recorded Symphony No. 2 for CBS with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1973; sometimes this recording has been included in CD editions of the cycle. Bernstein refused to conduct the complete tenth, rendered posthumously from Mahler's sketches by the musicologist Deryck Cooke, although he did record the opening adagio with the New York Philharmonic in 1975. ==The Second Cycle== Bernstein's second Mahler cycle recorded for Deutsche Grammophon took advantage of the newly developed digital recording technologies of the 1980s. The new cycle also involved recordings by orchestras closely linked to Mahler's compositional and conductorial output, including the New York Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic, and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Bernstein utilized his preferred latter-day technique of recording several live performances with patchup sessions to correct minor mistakes, believing it to be more satisfactory than a full studio recording. The 8th symphony was still to be recorded at the time of Bernstein's death, and a 1975 radio tape of a Salzburg Festival performance was used to complete the cycle. The performances of the fifth and first symphonies are often seen by critics as an improvement over the first cycle, as well as the recording of the fourth, despite sharp criticism of Bernstein's use of a boy soprano in the fourth movement. Although there are many similarities between the two cycles, Bernstein's later conducting style is often slower and more heavily expressive than his more youthful approach in the 1960s. ===Other Recordings=== In addition to the two audio cycles, Bernstein recorded a filmed cycle for Unitel in the 1970s with the Vienna Philharmonic and the London Symphony Orchestra (in Symphony 2 - in conjunction with the audio recording by CBS mentioned above). The film of the 8th symphony (recorded in Vienna) is a different performance to the Salzburg performance released in the second audio cycle. Bernstein made two recordings of Das Lied von der Erde: in Vienna (1966) for Decca and in Israel (1972) for CBS. He also made various recordings of Mahler's song cycles including Kindertotenlieder and Lieder aus \\"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\\" (The Youth's Magic Horn). Since Bernstein's death, several other Mahler recordings have emerged from broadcast sources and have been released commercially, including a Second Symphony with the Orchestre de Radio France from 1958, and a Ninth Symphony with the Berlin Philharmonic from 1979. As well also came out, on a CBS record, the finale of the Second Symphony with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, in a part of a record named \\"Hatikvah on Mt.

It started out with accommodation for 80 pupils in which extensions were built on to accommodate the rise in pupil numbers. By the 1950s the school had become very overcrowded so plans were made to create a new school. The new school opened in 1958. The school has a large catchment area stretching all over Berwickshire including Duns, Greenlaw, Chirnside, Coldstream, Foulden, Paxton, Eccles, Leitholm , Allanton and Swinton. The school motto is from the famous poem Ulysses, \\"To Strive, To Seek, To Find and not to Yield\\" basically meaning to make the most of your life.William Anderson, A Century Recalled (no ISBN) ==House system== The school has three 'houses' into which the pupils are split. This is not only a way to organise classes but is also intended to encourage a rivalry, being the basis of inter-house competitive events. The houses are named after notable people from Berwickshire. The three houses are Scott, Home and Douglas. Each has its own colour, Head of House (Staff), House Captains and Vice Captains (derived from pupils in S5/S6) and House Representatives. Each earn points throughout the year, at the end of which the house with the most points wins the Interhouse trophy. ==Change of buildings== The new high school was officially opened in February 2009. Work started in October 2006 on the new school which is located opposite the old building. The design was similar to Eyemouth High School and Earlston High School which were all built at the same time under a Public Private Partnership with the Scottish Borders Council. ==Notable former pupils== *Daniel Blades, Lord Blades, Senator of the College of Justice *Harald Leslie, Lord Birsay, judge *Ronald Mackay, Lord Eassie, judge *Helen Lowe, one of the first women chartered accountants in Scotland ==References * Official website * Previous Website * Category:Secondary schools in the Scottish Borders Category:Berwickshire Category:Educational institutions established in 1896 Category:1896 establishments in Scotland ","title":"Berwickshire High School"},{"id":"20430878","text":"Julián Mauricio Rápalo Agüero (born 9 August 1986) is a Honduran footballer who currently plays for Marathón. ==Club career== In summer 2011, clubs like Platense and Victoria were reportedly interested in Rápalo but he chose to stay with Savio.

The agreement was initialled by Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker on 17 November.

This was strongly criticised by Sistani, who said MPs should \\"assume their national and historical responsibility to give their opinion frankly about the agreement\\".Top Iraq Shiite Cleric Demands MP Vote on US Pact, Agence France Presse via Asharq Al-Awsat, 2008-11-20 When first debated the vote was shouted down by opponents from the Sadrist Movement, but it was passed the following day. The Sunni Arab coalitions, the Iraqi Accord Front and the Iraqi National Dialogue Front were reported to be concerned that the departure of the United States' Army would allow the Shi'ite majority to dominate them. They called for the end of the prosecution of Baath party members, the abolition of the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal and that the agreement be put to a referendum the following year. In the end the Maliki government agreed to the referendum and the two groups dropped their other demands. The small Islamic Virtue Party and the Iraqi National Dialogue Front also opposed the agreement, arguing it \\"infringed Iraqi sovereignty\\" Iraqi parliament debate on pact ends in scuffles, International Herald Tribune, 2008-11-19 If the referendum result would have been against the SOFA, the Iraqi government would have given notice to end the agreement and US troops would have been required to leave Iraq within one year.Iraq Approves Long-Debated US Security Pact, TIME, 2008-11-27 \\"If the Iraqi people reject the pact in the referendum ... the government of Iraq will be committed, according to the law, to the result of the referendum and will convey this will to the American administration.
