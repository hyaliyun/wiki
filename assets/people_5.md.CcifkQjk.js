He is the founder and executive board chairman of MediaNews Group, the fourth-largest newspaper company in the United States in terms of circulation, with 53 daily papers totaling 2.7 million subscriptions daily and 3 million on Sunday. He is also a former chairman of the board of directors of the Associated Press.http://www.ap.org/company/board-of-directors Additionally, he has been publisher of a number of MediaNews' dailies, including the Denver Post, the Salt Lake Tribune and the Detroit News. He is a cattle rancher, owning several ranches.http://coloradostatesman.com/content/991040-innerview-with-dean- singleton ==Biography== Singleton was born in Graham, Texas.Menn, Joseph. \\"There are two sides to this publisher's story.\\" ChainLINKS He began his newspaper career at the age of 15 as a part-time reporter in Graham and bought his first newspaper at age 21. Singleton has built his newspaper company through the acquisition of newspapers. He closed several of those newspapers, such as the Fort Worth Press and the Houston Post. He also bought the Denver Post and the Oakland Tribune where he laid off staff, he said, to increase efficiency. In the latest round of cuts, the daily Oakland Tribune will become a weekly.http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_29581099/bay-area-news-group- announces-newspaper-rebranding Singleton was a pioneer in \\"clustering\\"‚Äîdeveloping groups of newspapers that centralized a variety of functions, including production, ad sales, business operations and, in some cases, editorial. An example of this was the Alameda Newspaper Group in suburban San Francisco, where in the mid-1990s, a central newsroom in Pleasanton, California, did all the copy editing, layout and page makeup for five daily papers. Upon acquiring the diverse group of papers, Singleton consolidated several news sections (such as sports and features) to one local office away in order to streamline work. He was also a pioneer, at developing pooled-asset partnerships. Among the first were papers in California, which included papers from Gannett Co. Inc., Stephens Media Group and MediaNews. Singleton's company contributed Los Angeles Daily News and the ANG operation, as well as other papers, while Stephens contributed papers such as the Vallejo Times Herald and the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin of Ontario. A year after forming the partnership, the duo allowed Gannett to enter, with its contributions including the San Bernardino Sun and the Marin Independent Journal. The partnership is known as the \\"California Newspapers Partnership\\". MediaNews has entered into similar partnerships in Texas and Pennsylvania with Gannett and in Colorado with The E.W. Scripps Company. In the late 1990s, Singleton began focusing less on consolidating news rooms and put more focus on the quality of news rooms. He lured Gregory Moore, the former assistant managing editor of the Boston Globe, to the Denver Post and together the two worked to improve the paper's journalism. Singleton's empire began rapid growth in the early part of the 21st century, when he acquired in rapid succession daily newspapers in Salt Lake City, Detroit, St. Paul, Minnesota, and San Jose, California. Singleton served on the board of the Newspaper Association of America from 1993 until 2004 and is the former board chairman. He is on several boards in Colorado, including The Helen G. Bonfils Foundation, The Denver Center for the Performing Arts, the Winter Park Recreational Association Board, and the Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Center, the National Sports Center for the Disabled. In addition, he is a former member of the board of trustees for University of Denver. He is married to the former Adrienne Casale of Fairfield, New Jersey. They have three children, William, Paige, and Adam. ==MediaNews developments, 2010== In January 2010, Affiliated Media, parent of MediaNews, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The MediaNews creditors then removed Media News president Joseph Lodovic and its chairman, William Dean Singleton, was reassigned to the position of ‚Äúexecutive chairman of the board.\\" The Singleton-Lodovic appointees to the MediaNews board were replaced by new directors representing the stockholders group led by Alden Global Capital, a hedge fund firm which has acquired a large, though not controlling, stake. Several interim executive positions were also filled by people related to Alden or its parent, Smith Management LLC. ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== * The Next Level * Question: Who Is MediaNews's Dean Singleton? * Hearst and Singleton: Which is the Cat, Which the Mouse?

Street view of headquarters FirstEnergy Corp is an electric utility headquartered in Akron, Ohio. Its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in the distribution, transmission, and generation of electricity, as well as energy management and other energy- related services. Its ten electric utility operating companies comprise one of the United States' largest investor-owned utilities, based on serving 6 million customers within a area of Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Its generation subsidiaries control more than 16,000 megawatts of capacity, and its distribution lines span over 194,000 miles. In 2018, FirstEnergy ranked 219 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest public corporations in the United States by revenue. In November 2016, FirstEnergy made the decision to exit the competitive power business, and become a fully regulated company. On July 21 2020, Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, Larry Householder, former Ohio Republican Party Chairman Matt Borges, and three others were accused of accepting $60 million in bribes from FirstEnergy in exchange for $1.3 billion worth of benefits in the form of Ohio House Bill 6, as part of what became known as the Ohio nuclear bribery scandal. The stock price of the company plummeted within hours of the arrests bring made. First Energy denies involvement in the charges. As of July 22, 2020, FirstEnergy has not been named as a defendant. According to U.S. Attorney David DeVillers, the investigation is far from over. \\"There are a lot of federal agents knocking on a lot of doors.\\" ==HistoryFormation=== FirstEnergy was formed on November 7, 1997, when Ohio Edison acquired Centerior Energy and its subsidiaries for $1.6 billion in stock. The company was acquired with plans for a restructuring and layoffs to cut costs.Baird K. FirstEnergy transition revving up. Crain's Cleveland Business [serial online]. April 21, 1997;18(16):1.

That same month the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) initiated an investigation into the reliability of FirstEnergy's energy transmission in the context of possible plant shutdowns and prior problems with Centerior.Baird, K. (1997). PUCO orders investigation of FirstEnergy's system. Crain's Cleveland Business, 18(46), 15. ===Subsequent Mergers=== In 2001, FirstEnergy merged with GPU, Inc., the owner of Jersey Central Power & Light Company, Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec), and Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed). FirstEnergy would later merge with Greensburg, Pennsylvania-based Allegheny Energy in 2011. ===Bankruptcy of FirstEnergy Solutions=== On March 31, 2018, FirstEnergy Solutions filed for bankruptcy. FirstEnergy Solutions was a generation subsidiary, and FirstEnergy itself remains solvent. The case is being closely watched as it could have significant implications for the U.S. power sector, as the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Ohio has asserted its primacy over the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) relating to certain FirstEnergy Solutions FERC-regulated power purchase agreements. The Company filed its eighth amended bankruptcy plan on October 14, 2019. In 2020, it emerged from bankruptcy, becoming Energy Harbor Corp. ===Proposed power plant closures and bailout=== In March, 2018, FirstEnergy announced it is closing the Perry Nuclear Generating Station and Davis‚ÄìBesse Nuclear Power Station, both in Ohio, and Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station in Pennsylvania. This was followed in August 2018 with the announcement of the closure of two coal-fired plants, the W.H. Sammis Power Plant in Stratton, Ohio and the Bruce Mansfield Power Plant in Shippingport, Pennsylvania by June 2022. However, the closure of the Perry, Davis‚ÄìBesse, and Sammis plants were rescinded in July 2019 when the State of Ohio passed and signed into law a subsidy to support the Perry and Davis‚ÄìBesse nuclear plants. Bribery allegations On July 21 2020, Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, Larry Householder, former Ohio Republican Party Chairman Matt Borges, and three others were accused of accepting $60 million in bribes from FirstEnergy in exchange for $1.3 billion worth of benefits in the form of Ohio House Bill 6, which increased electricity rates and provided that money as a $150 million per year bailout for the two above-mentioned nuclear plants (Perry and Davis‚ÄìBesse). The stock price of the company plummeted within hours of the arrests bring made. First Energy denies involvement in the charges. State legislators quickly announced plans for a bill to repeal H.B. 6. ===COVID-19 pandemic=== During the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the company stopped power shutoffs and restored connections for those whose power had been terminated because of non-payment. They also requested that customers who were facing hardship paying their utility bills contact the company to set up alternate payment programs, energy assistance programs or other energy arrangements, based on the customer's ability to pay. This included customers of all ten First Energy utility companies in six states. == Former Subsidiaries Ohio Edison=== Ohio Edison Company (formerly OEC on the NYSE)Standard & Poor's Stock Guide was a publicly traded holding company that began in 1930, from the consolidation of 200 electric companies. By 1950, it ended up with two utility operating companies, Pennsylvania Power and Ohio Edison. It continued in existence until 1997, when its merger with Centerior formed FirstEnergy: * In 1944, the Pennsylvania Power Company became a subsidiary of Ohio Edison, and is now one of the ten operating utilities. * In 1950, the Ohio Edison Company merged with the Ohio Public Service Company, which continued to operate under its new Ohio Edison name. It is now one of the ten FirstEnergy operating companies, and is the main power provider for northeastern Ohio outside of Cleveland itself. ===Centerior=== Centerior Energy Corporation (formerly CX on the NYSE) was formed in 1986 from the merger of two old operating companies. Centerior was based in Independence, Ohio, and existed as a publicly traded holding company for ten years, until its merger with Ohio Edison formed FirstEnergy in 1997: *Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, commonly known as The Illuminating Company, was a publicly traded operating company through 1986, until it merged with Toledo Edison to come under the control of Centerior. Having been acquired by 1929, by 1940 it had become one of ten major direct subsidiaries of North American Company, which in turn had been one of the original 12 stocks listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. FindLaw.com It is one of two power companies serving Greater Cleveland, the other being city-owned Cleveland Public Power. *Toledo Edison Company (formerly TED on the NYSE) was a publicly traded utility operating company, until it merged to form Centerior in 1986. It is the main power provider for northwestern Ohio. ===GPU=== General Public Utilities (formerly GPU on the NYSE) was a publicly traded utility holding company in Morristown, New Jersey. In 1996, the company was reorganized and renamed GPU, Inc. In 1996, it formed a new division as well, GPU Energy, which became the holding company for its three utility operating companies: *Jersey Central Power and Light (JCP&L;, serving most of central and northwestern New Jersey) *Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec, serving northern and central Pennsylvania) *Metropolitan Edison (Met-Ed, serving eastern and south-central Pennsylvania) In 2001, FirstEnergy Corporation, with its four utility operating companies, merged with GPU, Inc., bringing GPU's three additional operating companies into FirstEnergy as well. Through the 2001 acquisition of GPU, FirstEnergy also acquired: *MYR Group (formerly MYR on the NYSE), a subsidiary that GPU had created as a publicly traded company in the 1996 reorganization, to install and maintain utility power lines and cellular telephone communications towers.Weekly Corporate Growth Report, Jan 10, 2000 GPU is best known as the former owner of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. In 1989, Standley H. Hoch, a former executive with General Dynamics, became the CEO of GPU. Hoch had two main goals‚Äîcut costs and fight to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which made it difficult for utilities to operate across state lines. ===Allegheny Energy=== Allegheny Energy was an electric utility serving customers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland. Its regulated subsidiaries are West Penn Power (serving Southwestern and Central Pennsylvania), Monongahela Power (a.k.a. \\"Mon Power\\", serving Northern and Southern West Virginia), and The Potomac Edison Company (western and central Maryland, parts of eastern West Virginia, and northern Virginia). The electric generating plants are operated by subsidiary Allegheny Energy Supply Company and Monongahela Power. Before the formation of Allegheny Energy, the holding company was known as Allegheny Power System which had the three utility operating units. The brand name Allegheny Power was used on customer bills, trucks and company equipment starting in 1996. In 1997, the company attempted to merge with Pittsburgh- based Duquesne Light Company. The merger was withdrawn by both parties and both companies did not merge. In 1999, Allegheny Power purchased the West Virginia operations of UtiliCorp United's West Virginia Power. UtiliCorp purchased Virginia Electric and Power Company's (present day Dominion Resources) West Virginia service area in 1986 and renamed the acquired service area West Virginia Power. In February 2010, Allegheny Energy announced plans to merge with FirstEnergy. The merger was approved by stockholders of both companies, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and regulatory commissions in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. The merger was finalized when the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission approved the merger on February 24, 2011; the merger closed on February 25, 2011. The merger does not include Allegheny's service area in Virginia, which was purchased in 2010 by the Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative and the Rappahannock Electric Cooperative. After the merger with Allegheny Energy, FirstEnergy was the largest investor-owned electric utility in the country for a short period of time based on customers served before the Exelon/Constellation and Duke Energy/Progress Energy mergers. ==Intent to exit non-regulated business== FirstEnergy announced its intent in November 2016 to exit the competitive businesses while staying in the regulated businesses and become a fully regulated company during the next 18 months. FirstEnergy Solutions, the company's competitive subsidiary, manages 13,000 MW of generating capacity and is a leading energy supplier serving residential, commercial and industrial customers in the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. It was anticipated that some generating units would be sold, and some would be shut down. Robert E. Murray, CEO of Murray Energy, warned in August 2017 that FirstEnergy Solutions was in danger of bankruptcy if an emergency order to open coal-fired plants was not issued by the White House. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) unanimously rejected a United States Department of Energy (DOE) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) to subsidize coal and nuclear plants in January 2018. FirstEnergy Solutions filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 31, 2018. As a result of the bankruptcy, FirstEnergy Solutions sought federal intervention of invoking Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to keep their power plants operating. In February 2018, FirstEnergy announced plans to deactivate or sell Pleasants Power Station in West Virginia. In March 2018, FirstEnergy announced plans to deactivate or sell the Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse, and Perry nuclear power plants, which are in the Ohio and Pennsylvania deregulated electricity market, during the next three years. FirstEnergy's electric generation is primarily from coal and nuclear power plants, but also includes natural gas, oil, and hydroelectric power plants. ==Environmental record== A 2017 report conducted by the University of Massachusetts Amherst placed FirstEnergy 9 out of the top 100 of the country's largest greenhouse polluters. FirstEnergy was required to pay $1.5 billion by 2011 as part of a settlement to end a lawsuit filed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. This lawsuit alleged that the company failed to install pollution control equipment when upgrading its coal burning plants. Also as part of the settlement, major pollution control equipment is now being installed at the FirstEnergy Sammis site and others. This lawsuit was one of the New Source Review lawsuits filed in the 1990s. The Columbus Dispatch Retrieved May 15, 2008 To provide cleaner energy to its customers, FirstEnergy took several important steps in 2009. First, the company announced plans in April to repower Units 4 and 5 at its R.E. Burger Power Station in Shadyside, Ohio, to generate electricity principally with biomass, the only base load renewable source that can displace coal emissions. Furthermore, FirstEnergy hosted a 1 MW pilot plant test of carbon capture retrofit equipment for carbon sequestration on one of the remaining coal units at the R.E. Burger.http://www.powerspan.com/FirstEnergy-ECO2-Carbon-Capture- Pilot-Facility In September, FirstEnergy decided to complete construction on the Fremont Energy Center, a 707-MW natural-gas-fired peaking plant by the end of 2010. And finally in November, FirstEnergy purchased the rights to develop a compressed-air electric generating plant in Norton, Ohio, which Ohio Governor Ted Strickland praised as \\"an example of how we can leverage technology and our natural resources to grow our economy and ensure our energy future.\\" The Norton project, part of the company's overall climate change strategy, has the potential to be expanded to up to 2,700 MW of capacity‚Äîthe largest in the world by far. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, \\"a compressed-air energy storage project of this size...could be a key component in integrating large-scale intermittent renewables (such as wind) onto the nation's grid system.\\" Together, these projects, when completed, will further reduce the utility's emissions of , which already is about one-third below the regional average. FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. has also given renewable energy certificates to help balance out the amount of electricity used in Earth Day events that were held at nine post-secondary education locations in Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Each of the schools received five SmartWind REC's, enough energy to light a large building for the entire day.http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/firstenergy-solutions-provides- green-offsets,362227.shtml The Earth Times Retrieved May 12, 2008 Energy efficiency became a state mandate in 2008 when lawmakers agreed with former Gov. Ted Strickland after months of debate to pass a law requiring electric utilities to help customers use less electricity every year‚Äî22 percent less by 2025 than they did in 2009. Under the 2008 law, FirstEnergy slaps companies that do not invest in energy efficiency with higher rates. But industries that use their waste heat to make power could escape that rate increase. As of November 29, 2012 FirstEnergy Corp. has abandoned its behind-the-scene lobbying campaign to persuade lawmakers to gut a four-year-old law requiring utilities to help customers use less electricity by switching to energy efficient equipment and lighting. ===Little Blue Run=== Several cases have been brought against FirstEnergy for its dumping of coal waste into Little Blue Run Lake in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. FirstEnergy has dumped more than 20 billion gallons of coal ash and smokestack scrubber waste into the body of water which has contaminated local water supplies with arsenic, sulfates, sodium, calcium, magnesium and chloride. A July 2012 consent decree from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection is forcing FirstEnergy to close the Little Blue Run Lake, an unlined waste impoundment in Beaver County, Pennsylvania and Hancock County, West Virginia. Coal ash waste slurry has been piped there from FirstEnergy's Bruce Mansfield Power Plant since 1974. The reservoir at Little Blue Run is the country's largest coal ash impoundment. Pollutants including sulfates, chlorides, and arsenic have been found in groundwater nearby. FirstEnergy must stop dumping coal ash at the site by 2016, pay a penalty of $800,000, provide clean water to local residents, and do environmental monitoring of seeps for toxic pollutants including selenium, boron, and arsenic.Lord, Rich FirstEnergy compelled to close Beaver County waste dump by end of 2016, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 2012-07-27.Consent Decree, PA Department of Environmental Protection and FirstEnergy, filed 2012-07-27. ==Executives== Charles E. Jones has been president and chief executive officer of FirstEnergy since 2015. ==Notable accidents and incidents== *The 2003 North American blackout was attributed partly to FirstEnergy's failure to trim the trees around its high voltage lines in a certain sector of Ohio; heat and extreme power needs caused the lines to sag, coming into contact with the trees and causing flashover. *On Friday, January 20, 2006, FirstEnergy acknowledged a cover-up of serious safety violations by former workers at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, and accepted a plea bargain with the U.S. Department of Justice in lieu of possible federal criminal prosecution. The plea bargain relates to the March 2002 discovery of severe corrosion in the pressure vessel of the nuclear reactor, contained within the plant's containment building. In the agreement, the company agreed to pay fines of $23 million, with an additional $5 million to be contributed toward research on alternative energy sources and to Habitat for Humanity as well as to pay for costs related to the Federal investigation. In addition, two former employees and one former contractor were indicted for purposely deceiving Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) inspectors in multiple documents (including one videotape) over several years, hiding evidence that the reactor pressure vessel was being seriously corroded by boric acid. The maximum penalty for the three is 25 years in prison. The indictment also cites other employees as providing false information to inspectors, but does not name them. *In 2005, the NRC identified two earlier incidents at Davis-Besse as being among the top five events (excluding the actual disaster at Three Mile Island) most likely to have resulted in a nuclear disaster in the event of a subsequent failure. *In 2011, a 20-year employee was electrocuted to death; when a supervisor ordered an unsafe operation.

On July 30, 2006, the Israeli Shin Bet security service and the Israeli police released Dr. Falah without filing charges against him.

At present, Ghazi Falah is a tenured Full Professor at the University of Akron and engaged in research on American bilateral relations with the Arab world.

The only series- built variant was Amiot 122 BP3 medium bomber, other known variant was Amiot 123 long-distance record plane. ==Design and development== The aircraft was designed as a medium single-engine biplane bomber with metal construction and conventional in layout, with braced wings. The fuselage consisted of a frame of duralumin pipes while the engine was covered with duralumin sheets, with the rest of the aircraft covered in fabric. A fixed conventional landing gear, with a rear skid was fitted. A crew of three sat in tandem in open cockpits. The first of the series was Amiot 120 BN2, a 2-seater bomber prototype, powered with a Renault 12Ma 580 hp inline engine (registration F-AHCR). It was not ordered by the French Air Force and only one example was built. More successful was the next slightly enlarged variant, the Amiot 122, of 1927, powered by a Lorraine 18 Kd, 650 hp engine. Its initial production variant was Amiot 122 BP2 2-seater bomber (registration F-AIUQ), but it entered production as the Amiot 122 BP3 3-seater bomber. A total of 80 aircraft were built for the French Air Force and five for Brazil. Another variant was the Amiot 123. Designed as a bomber, designated the Amiot 123 BP3 (one was built) but the French Air Force showed no interest in it. At that time, Polish authorities were looking for a long-distance record aircraft for transatlantic flights. In 1928 and 1929, two modified Amiot 123 aircraft were built as a long-distance variant, with enlarged fuel tanks (first had Lorraine 18 Kdrs 710 hp engine, the second Lorraine 18 Kdrs 785 hp engine). The last two variants, the Amiot 124 BP3 and Amiot 125 BP3 were bomber prototypes in 1931, fitted with Hispano- Suiza 18Sbr 1000 hp and Renault 18Jbr 700 hp engines respectively, but not ordered by the French Air Force. Some sources claim, that Amiot 121 with a Lorraine 18 Kd 650 hp engine and Amiot 126 prototypes with a Lorraine 18 Gad 700 hp engine were also built. ==Operational history== The Amiot 122 was first used as a long-distance sports aircraft. From 13 September 1927, the prototype carried out a 10,800 km tour around the Mediterranean Sea, from Paris, through Vienna, Beirut, Cairo, Benghazi, Tunis, Casablanca to Paris. From 3‚Äì5 April 1928, Lieutenant Girardot flew it across the Sahara, on the Paris-Timbuktu- Dakar-Paris 10,100 km route. A total of 80 Amiot 122 BP3s were used by the French Air Force as reconnaissance bombers, starting in 1930. They were used in the 11th Aviation Regiment, based in Metz. They were nicknamed by pilots La Grosse Julie (Big Julie). In 1931, Brazil ordered five aircraft (four, according to Brazilian publications). They were used until 1936. One aircraft was used on the government side during a coup d'etat in July 1932. ===Transatlantic flights=== Paul Teste was killed in an Amiot 120 on the 13 June 1925 as he was training for a transatlantic flight. The first Amiot 123 was bought by the Polish Air Force in order for a first westbound transatlantic flight (in some sources, it is designated as Amiot 123.01). It was named Marsza≈Çek Pi≈Çsudski (Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski). The crew were pilot Ludwik Idzikowski and navigator Kazimierz Kubala. They commenced their first trial of a transatlantic flight on 3 August 1928, taking off at 4:45 a.m. from Paris Le Bourget airfield. However, after flying some 3200 km away, above the ocean, they noticed a lowering oil level in the engine, which was caused by a cracked oil tank. They decided to return to Europe, since it was more than a half way to America, against the wind. After 31 hours of flight, when the oil in engine had depleted, Idzikowski decided to land on water, by the German merchant ship Samos, about 70 km away from the Spanish coast. The sailors rescued the crew and pulled the aircraft out of the water, but it was damaged. Idzikowski and Kubala repeated this trial the next year. The second Amiot 123 was bought, initially built for the French pilot (according to some sources, it was still the first aircraft). It was named Orze≈Ç Bia≈Çy (the White Eagle, although according to some sources, it was still Marsza≈Çek Pi≈Çsudski). They took off on 13 July 1929, at 3:45 a.m. from Le Bourget. After flying 2140 km, over the ocean, about 5 p.m., the engine started to lose power, becoming noisy. They decided to land on Faial Island of the Azores. However, because of more irregular engine work, at 9 p.m. (7 p.m. local time), Idzikowski decided to make an emergency landing on a closer rocky island Graciosa. During the landing on a field, the aircraft hit a low stone wall and overturned wheels up. In the crash, Ludwik Idzikowski was killed, while Kazimierz Kubala was lightly injured. During a rescue action, the aircraft burned. ==Variants== Amiot 122 BP3 photo from Annuaire de L'A√©ronautique 1931 ;Amiot 120BN2''' : Two-seat light bomber prototype. ;Amiot 121''' : Record breaking aircraft. ;Amiot 122BP3''' : Three-seat medium-bomber aircraft. ;Amiot 122S''' : Two- seat record breaking aircraft. ;Amiot 123''' : Two-seat long-range record aircraft. ;Amiot 124BP3 : Bomber prototype. ;Amiot 125BP3 : Bomber prototype. ==Operators== ; : Brazilian Air Force - five bombers ; : French Air Force - 80 bombers ; : Polish Air Force - two sports aircraft ==Specifications (Amiot 122BP3)== Amiot 120 3-view drawing from Les Ailes December 16,1926 ==See alsoNotesReferences== * Amiot at Aviafrance ==External links== * Photo and specs of Amiot 122 BP3 at Aviafrance Category:1920s French bomber aircraft Category:1920s French sport aircraft 120 Category:Biplanes Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1925 ","title":"Amiot 120"},{"id":"2215723","text":"Pukkelpop is an annual music festival that takes place near the city of Hasselt, Belgium, in mid- to late August. It is held within a large enclosure of fields and woodland‚Äîbetween a dual carriageway called Kempische Steenweg‚Äîin the village of Kiewit, approximately 7 km north of Hasselt. It is the second largest music festival in Belgium after Rock Werchter, with an attendance of 180,000 over the course of the event in 2009. The program is noted for its wide variety of alternative music, spanning styles such as rock, pop, electronic, dance, hip-hop, punk and heavy metal. The event's organizers aim for a \\"progressive and contemporary\\" musical event. Notable acts that have performed at previous editions include Within Temptation, Sonic Youth, Ramones, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Smashing Pumpkins, Foo Fighters, Radiohead, Metallica, PJ Harvey, Green Day, Blink-182, Guns N' Roses, Pixies, Daft Punk, The Prodigy, Nine Inch Nails, Iron Maiden, Bj√∂rk, The Stone Roses and Eminem. \\"Pukkel\\" is the Dutch word for \\"pimple\\". ==History== The festival was founded in 1985 by youth organisation Humanistic Youth of Leopoldsburg (, or \\"Hujo\\"). It originated as a single day event, held on July 21‚Äîa national holiday in Belgium‚Äîin the village of Leopoldsburg, located approximately 25 km north of the event's current home in Kiewit. The inaugural event in 1985 took place at the village football grounds of Complex Excelsior Heppen and featured seven acts, with English songwriter Anne Clark headlining. The first year was attended by 3,000 people. In 1988, the festival moved to the village of Hechtel-Eksel where it was held at Sanicole Airfield. The festival was also moved to late August. In 1989, the festival was cancelled after the two headliners, The Pogues and The Sugarcubes, cancelled their appearances a few weeks before the event. The festival returned in 1990, again taking place in Hechtel-Eksel, and reached a peak of 10,000 attendees. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds headlined. In 1991, the festival moved to its current home in Kiewit. That year, the event took place on the grounds of the children's petting farm (Dutch: Kinderboerderij) located in the village. Ramones headlined on a bill which included Nirvana, who performed at the festival a month prior to the release of the group's breakthrough album Nevermind. In 1992, the festival site was moved to the fields by the Kempische Steenweg motorway, where it has been held ever since. A shot of the commemorative stand at the 2005 edition. The stand was installed to mark the event's 20th anniversary. In 1993, a new indoor stage called The Marquee was added, supplementing the outdoor Main Stage and almost doubling the number of performers over the previous year. A second indoor stage, the Dance Hall, was added in 1994. In 1995, for the festival's tenth anniversary, the event became a two-day event for the first time, with Neil Young and The Smashing Pumpkins as the headlining acts. The festival also reached a peak in attendees at 60,000. In 1996, two new stages were added: the outdoor Skate Stage, and a smaller-sized marquee called Club. Another marquee, named the Boiler Room, was added in 1997, bringing the total number of stages to six. From 1998 to 2001, the Skate Stage was renamed to the Hip-hop Stage for one of the two festival days, exclusively focused on rap and hip-hop artists such as Jurassic 5 and The Pharcyde. In 1999, the dance event Creamfields was amalgamated into Pukkelpop on the first day of the event; as a result most of the existing stages exclusively showcased dance music under different names. 1999 also saw the debut of the Experimental Stage, renamed to ChateauXCrapule the following year, and shortened to Chateau from the 2004 edition. British band Editors performing on the Main Stage at the 2007 edition. In 2000, an exchange programme was announced with Oppikoppi, an annual music festival held in South Africa near the city of Pretoria. In the same year, Eminem was forced to cancel his confirmed headline slot at the festival as he was barred from leaving the United States. In 2001, the festival became a three-day event for the first time, reaching an attendance peak of 115,000, a 76% increase over the previous year. In 2004, an eighth stage was added, called Wablief? (Dutch word for \\"What?\\"). In 2005, the festival celebrated its 20th anniversary, featuring headliners Pixies, The Prodigy and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. The event also reached another attendance peak, totaling 137,000 festival-goers. The festival returned in 2010 for its 25th anniversary, with Iron Maiden, Placebo, Queens of the Stone Age and Snow Patrol among the headlining acts. The 2010 edition was notable as the first ever Pukkelpop to have sold out its entire allotment of tickets, approximately five weeks prior to the commencement of the festival. ==Incidents== During the 2010 festival, two musicians died. Michael Been, lead singer and guitarist of The Call, died on August 19 of a heart attack after performing duties as sound engineer for Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. On August 20, Ou Est Le Swimming Pool singer Charles Haddon committed suicide by jumping from a telecommunications mast in the backstage parking area, shortly after the group's performance at the festival. Haddon was reported to be upset about an injury sustained by a fan after stage-diving into the crowd. The 2011 festival was affected by a severe thunderstorm during the evening of August 18, 2011, the opening day of the event. Torrential rain and strong winds toppled several concert tents, uprooted trees and knocked down festival light towers and video screens. The Chateau tent collapsed shortly after American rock band Smith Westerns began performing their set. Lead singer/guitarist Cullen Omori updated the band's Twitter account directly after the incident: \\"Stage collapsed max almost got crushed by trees, I hope pukkelpop has insurance bc all our shit is broke\\". The message was later removed. Five people were killed, and at least 140 were injured. The death toll was originally believed to be five, however this figure was later dropped to four; Belgian media have suggested that a man who died in a local hospital and did not attend the festival was erroneously counted as a reported death. Another victim died five days later in the hospital, which brought the death toll back to five. Following the storm, officials of the event announced that all music performances for the remainder of the night would be cancelled and that the festival would be put on hold \\"until we understand the situation completely\\". On August 19, 2011, the organisers decided to cancel the entire event. A statement read: The closest anemometer, in the town of Diepenbeek, recorded gusts above 80 km/h (50 mph), with reports of large hail and the possibility of a tornado. However, research done by specialists after the event, showed that the actual wind speed at the festival site reached 170 km/h (106 mph). The 2011 festival was to have featured Eminem, Foo Fighters, The Offspring, dEUS and Thirty Seconds to Mars among the headlining acts. The incident came just five days after the Indiana State Fair stage collapse in the United States, which killed seven people and sparked debate about regulations in outdoor concert events. ==Camping and transport facilities== Pukkelpop provides free camping facilities to attendees. The campsite lies on one side of Kempische Steenweg‚Äîwith the main event grounds located directly on the other‚Äîand is opened on the day prior to the commencement of the event. Traffic guards are implemented in order to direct traffic and attendees during the festival period. To encourage use of public transport, an outward return trip within Belgium to Hasselt or Kiewit on the NMBS/SNCB train network or on the De Lijn bus network is included with all ticket types. A free shuttle bus, which runs regularly during the festival period, is also provided to-and-from Hasselt train station and the festival site in Kiewit. There are two ticket types available: day tickets, which provide access to one of the three days of the event, and \\"combi\\" tickets, which provide access to all three days of the festival. ==Lineups2011‚Äì=2001‚Äì2010=1991‚Äì2000=1985‚Äì1990=Polsslag== Logo for Polsslag 2009. Polsslag (Dutch term for \\"pulse\\" or \\"heartbeat\\") was a one-day annual music festival which took place in Hasselt in the spring of 2008 and 2009. The event, billed as Pukkelpop's sister festival, was held indoors at the Grenslandhallen in Hasselt. The festival featured four stages, the names of which are all retained from Pukkelpop: The Marquee, Dance Hall, Club and Boiler Room. The first Polsslag event took place on April 15, 2008, and featuring acts such as The Breeders, Millencolin and Boys Noize. In 2009, the festival ran on May 2, with artists such as Dizzee Rascal and Yeah Yeah Yeahs performing. ===Lineups=References * Official website * Polsslag official website * About Pukkelpop in Russian Category:Rock festivals in Belgium Category:1985 establishments in Belgium Category:Annual events in Belgium Category:Music festivals established in 1985 Category:Hasselt Category:Summer events in Belgium Category:Concert disasters ","title":"Pukkelpop"},{"id":"2215724","text":"The shoulder shrug (usually called simply the shrug) is an exercise in weight training used to develop the upper trapezius muscle. == Form and execution == The lifter stands erect, hands about shoulder width apart, and raises the shoulders as high as possible, and then lowers them, while not bending the elbows, or moving the body at all. The lifter may not have as large a range of motion as in a normal shrug done for active flexibility. It is usually considered good form if the slope of the shoulders is horizontal in the elevated position. == Equipment == A barbell, dumbbells, trap bar, or a Smith machine may be used for resistance, and overhand, inside, outside, underhand or mixed grip can be used. The barbell can be held in front of the thighs, resting on the quadriceps, or behind, resting on the hamstrings. Using these excludes inside and outside grips. One or two dumbbells, kettlebells or resistance bands can also be used, together or opposite one another. A trapbar can also be used, necessitating an inside grip. Standing calf raise machines can also be used to execute the shrugging movement, by resting the pads on the shoulders and trying to raise the shoulders as high as possible.

They are typically made of hard plastic and rest on hinges so they can be folded into the wall when not in use. They are usually not enclosed in a stall. These became popular in the 1990s. Originally they were mainly found in women's restrooms. Through the lobbying efforts of Eric Letts, a founder of the Fair Parenting Project, it became commonplace to find them in men's rooms across Canada and the United States.

Baby oil is, in general terms, an inert oil for the purpose of keeping skin soft and supple. It is often used on babies for the purpose of maintaining \\"baby-soft\\" skin, but it is also often used by adults. The skin of an infant, especially a premature one, is sensitive, thin and fragile. Its neutral pH on the surface significantly reduces the protection against excessive bacterial growth. The epidermis and dermis are thinner than those of adults and the epidermal barrier is not yet fully developed. Consequences can for example be dry skin, infections, peeling, blister formation and poor thermoregulation. The application of different oils to the skin of the newborn is routinely practiced in many countries. In general, these oils are used for cleansing, to maintain the skin's moisture and to protect its surface. Additionally, baby oil is used for the massage of newborns and as additive in lotions and creams. == Ingredients == Ingredients of a baby oil product based on mineral oil with paraffinum liquidum, isopropyl palmitate and parfum. Baby oils can be classified by the base formulation of the product. They are based on *Mineral oil or *Vegetable oils. === Products based on mineral oil === Typical components of baby oils are the highly purified mineral oil products such as liquid paraffin (INCI name: paraffinum liquidum) and vaseline (INCI name: petrolatum). These compounds are odorless and tasteless, dermatologically tested and approved, not allergenic, hydrophobic and contain no pesticides or herbicides. Preservatives or antioxidants are not necessary, because in contrast to vegetable oils, there is no risk of rancidity with paraffins. Nevertheless, the use of mineral oil in cosmetics is being criticized. Natural cosmetic companies claim that the use of mineral oil results in skin occlusion. Conventional cosmetic manufacturers and even dermatologists and cosmetic chemists argue against that and studies were not able to show any statistical difference between paraffin oil and vegetable oils in terms of skin penetration and skin occlusion. On the contrary, petrolatum-based preparations have been shown to be effective to the skin barrier function, even in premature infants. === Products based on vegetable oils === List of ingredients (INCI-code) of a baby oil based on vegetable oils Vegetable oils are produced by plants with the highest concentration being present in seeds and fruits. About 95% of each vegetable oil is primarily composed of triglycerides. Coconut oil and palm oil contain mainly saturated fatty acids, while other oils largely contain unsaturated fatty acids, for example oleic acid and linoleic acid. Accompanying substances in vegetable oils are, inter alia, phospholipids, glycolipids, sulfolipids, squalene, carotenoids, vitamin E, polyphenols and triterpene alcohols. To avoid rancidity, preservatives or antioxidants are added to baby oils based on vegetable oils. On cosmetic products, these oils are listed according to the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), e.g.:Personal Care Products Council - International Buyers' Guide * Cocos Nucifera Oil (coconut oil) * Elaeis Guineensis Oil (palm oil) * Glycine Soja Oil (soya oil) * Hydrogenated Olive Oil (olive oil) * Persea Gratissima Oil (avocado oil) * Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil (almond oil) * Shea Butter Glycerides (shea butter) * Simmondsia chinensis Oil (jojoba oil) * Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil (sunflower oil) Vegetable oils are not to be confused with essential oils, both being sourced from plants. == Usage == Baby oils are largely used as skin care products and their principle use remains as skin moisturizers. In particular, baby oils find application in the treatment of various skin diseases like atopic dermatitis, xerosis, psoriasis and other eczematous conditions. Another area of use is the oil massage of the newborn which has been a tradition in India and other Asian countries since time immemorial. == References == Category:Skin care Category:Babycare ","title":"Baby oil"},{"id":"2215769","text":"Qasim ibn al-Hasan () (Sha'aban 7, 47 AH /October 2, 667 CE - Muharram 10, 61 AH /October 10, 680 CE), supported his uncle Husayn Ibn Ali in fighting off the Umayyad forces during the Battle of Karbala where he was killed in his teens. ==Early life== Qasim was born the son of Hasan ibn Ali, the second Imam, and his wife Umm Farwa. His father was the elder son of Ali ibn Abi Talib and Fatimah, and Qasim was thus a great-grandson of the prophet Mohammad, father of Fatimah. Qasim was only three years old when his father died. However he grew up in the company of his paternal family. Like his cousins, Awn and Muhammad, the sons of his paternal aunt Zaynab, Qasim were taught fencing by his uncle Abbas ibn Ali and cousin Ali Akbar. When Hasan's brother Husayn ibn Ali prepared to leave Medina in 680, Qasim's mother Umm Farwa asked Husayn to take her and the young Qasim with him. == Battle  Preparation === Qasim asked his uncle, \\"Will I also be among the martyrs?\\" Husayn ibn Ali replied: \\"How do you see death?\\" Qasim said, \\"O uncle, death to me is sweeter than honey.\\" === Ashura === On the day of Ashura, Qasim, like other cousins before him, went to his uncle to ask for permission. Husayn would not permit him to fight because he was too young and Husayn could not bear the thought of anything happening to him. Qasim asked many times before going to his mother. When his mother saw that her son was upset, she gave him a letter that Qasim's father had written before he died. The letter stated: Qasim read the letter and gave to his uncle. After reading the letter Husayn said, He went to the battlefield and killed many fighters. A man came from behind and struck Qasim on the head. He fell to the ground, bleeding heavily. He called out for his uncle. Husayn and Abbas rushed over. The army of Yazid got scared thinking they were coming to attack them, creating confusion. Horses began running from one side to another, trampling and killing Qasim. Husayn and Abbas called out for him, but no reply came. When they found his body Husayn as took off his abaa and with Abbas collected his remains. ==See also== *List of casualties in Husayn's army at the Battle of Karbala *Sakinah bint Husayn == References == Category:667 births Category:680 deaths Category:People killed at the Battle of Karbala Category:Family of Muhammad Category:7th-century Arabs Category:Alids ","title":"Qasim ibn Hasan"},{"id":"2215776","text":"Donald Gordon McKenzie (April 9, 1887‚ÄîMay 14, 1963) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1928 to 1936 and was a cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken.

It is on the Sokolnicheskaya Line, between Komsomolskaya and Sokolniki stations. Krasnoselskaya is located under Krasnoprudnaya Street, east of the intersection with Krasnoselskaya Street. ==Name== It is named after Krasnoselskaya Street. ==History== The section of the Sokolnicheskaya Line between Sokolniki and Komsomolskaya was built under Krasnoprudnaya Street, using the cut and cover method. Construction work on Krasnoselskaya began in spring 1933, and the station opened along with other 9 stations of the line on 15 May 1935. ==Design== The planned passenger volume at Krasnoselskaya was relatively low, so the station was built with a narrower platform than the other stations of the first line. The station has one row of ten-sided columns, which are faced with red and yellow Crimean marble. The walls are finished with yellow and red ceramic tile and punctuated at regular intervals by concrete pilasters. The architects of the station were B. Vilenskiy and V. Yershov. ==Entrance== Krasnoselskaya was originally planned to have entrances at two ends, but only the western one, located at the northeast corner of Krasnoprudnaya Street and Upper Krasnoselskaya Street, was built. In 2005 the vestibule's original tile floor was replaced with similarly-coloured marble. ==References== Category:Moscow Metro stations Category:Railway stations in Russia opened in 1935 Category:Sokolnicheskaya Line Category:Railway stations located underground in Russia ","title":"Krasnoselskaya"},{"id":"2215786","text":"Route 249 is a , four-lane state highway in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Missouri.

K.\\" Williams (November 4, 1936 ‚Äì September 20, 2015) was an American poet, critic and translator. Williams won many poetry awards. Flesh and Blood won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1987. Repair (1999) won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, was a National Book Award finalist\\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1999\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-04-08. and won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. The Singing won the National Book Award, 2003 and in 2005 Williams received the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. The 2012 film Tar related aspects of Williams' life using his poetry. ==Life== The American poet C.K. Williams was born in Newark, New Jersey, on November 4, 1936. His parents were Paul B. Williams and Dossie Kasdin. His grandparents came to the USA from Kiev, then a Russian city, and Lvov, Ukraine. He went to Columbia High School in Maplewood, attended Bucknell University for one year, then moved on to and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. He started writing poetry during his second year at Penn, and half-way through junior year he left for Paris. At that time he wrote ‚ÄúI fell into a period of lacerating loneliness. I‚Äôd always been a little shy but now something, maybe my uncertainty about my identity as a poet, my sense of being a pretender, made me all but mute with strangers : I used to stay all day in my hotel room, reading, trying to write, then I‚Äôd go out to eat by myself, and take endless, anguished walks.‚Äù Williams, C.K. (1997) Contemporary Authors, Autobiography Series, Vol. 26, GALE (Shelly Andrews, editor) When he returned to Penn, he switched major from philosophy to English. He studied poetry with Morse Peckham, who also mentioned that T.S. Eliot had written that if you wanted to be a poet, you had to write poetry every day, a recommendation Williams applied in his writing life. C.K. Williams passport ID photo taken on Greek island of Patmos in 1973 After graduating from Penn, he stayed in Philadelphia. His circle of friends included artists, carpenters, poets, a famous sociologist, photographers, musicians and film makers. He spent time with young architects who worked for Louis Kahn, and later wrote: ‚ÄúI realized that my image of the artist‚Äôs calling had come almost entirely from Kahn: he was absolutely devoted to his craft, and expected the same dedication from everyone else.‚Äù He published his first book, Lies, in 1969. In 1963 he married Sarah Dean Jones, a printer who worked for Eugene Feldman at the Falcon Press in Philadelphia. The marriage ended in divorce. Their daughter, Jessie Williams Burns, founded Tursulowe Press in Philadelphia. In 1973 he met Catherine Mauger. They married in 1975 and had a son, Jed Williams, a painter and the owner of an art gallery in Philadelphia. His paintings are often featured on the covers of Williams‚Äô books. Catherine and C.K. lived part of the year in the USA, and part of the year in Paris, France, and later in Normandy. Williams began teaching in the mid 70‚Äôs at the YM-YMHA in Philadelphia. He also worked as an assistant group therapist. He taught creative writing at different universities, among them, Franklin and Marshall, the University of California at Irvine, Boston University, Brooklyn College, Columbia University, George Mason University and, starting in 1996, Princeton University. He traveled across the country, and out of the country, giving readings and poetry workshops. He also worked on translations, notably of two Greek tragedies. After publishing his second book, I Am the Bitter Name, Williams said that he had felt like giving up writing. Then he was asked to read at a college of art in Philadelphia, and he decided to read some unfinished poems: ‚Äú and I was astonished to realize that they were exactly what I‚Äôd been waiting for, though I hadn‚Äôt known I‚Äôd been waiting for anything at all. The poems were long, ragged lines, they had a much more conversational tone than the poems I‚Äôd been writing. Most importantly, the new poems, while having a much more narrative structure than the older ones, also had much more direct mechanisms for tracing thoughts, perceptions and emotions ; they gave me a way to deal more inclusively and exhaustively with my own mind than the poems I‚Äôd been writing until then. I began to write poetry again, with more conviction than ever, and more confidence, more of a sense of what I wanted to do (‚Ä¶) The scope of the poems, the certainty they gave me that I could deal thoroughly with themes that interested me, were enough to keep me going. They are the poems that were collected in With Ignorance and Tar.‚Äù C.K. Williams became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2003. He had a wide circle of friends in the U.S. and in Europe, many of them artists and writers. He gave a last reading and interview at Drew University in June 2015. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the summer of 2013. He died at home in Hopewell, New Jersey on September 20, 2015.Princeton University - C.K. Williams, distinguished poet and ‚Äúgreat mentor‚Äù, dies at 78 C.K. Williams obituary Twenty days earlier, he had finished working on the manuscript of his last book of poems, Falling Ill. ==Works== His first book, Lies', was published in 1969, and he published many collections of poetry. His Collected Poems appeared in 2006, of which Peter Campion wrote in The Boston Globe: ‚ÄúThroughout the five decades represented in his new Collected Poems, Williams has maintained the most sincere, and largest, ambitions. Like Yeats and Lowell before him, he writes from the borderland between private and public life‚Ä¶(His poems) join skeptical intelligence and emotional sincerity, to make sense of the world and ourselves. C.K. Williams has set a new standard for American poetry.\\" His book Repair won the Pulitzer Prize in 2000, and in 2003 The Singing won the National Book Award. He also wrote essays, plays, children books and worked on translations. His last book of poetry, Falling Ill, was published in 2017, after his death. ==Publications== C. K.

He was consul in 173 BC, with Marcus Popillius Laenas. The war in Liguria was assigned to both consuls. Albinus, however, was first sent into Campania to separate the land of the state from that of private persons, because private land owners had slowly expanded their boundaries into public land. This business occupied him all the summer, so that he was unable to go into his province. He was the first Roman magistrate who put the Latin allies to any expense when a magistrate travelled through their territories.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, xli.28; xlii.1, 9.

Most of their keyboards are based on the 8048 microcontroller to communicate to the computer. Their early keyboards used an Intel 8048 MCU. However, as the company evolved, they began to use their own 8048-based MCUs. In 1978, Keytronic Corporation introduced keyboards with capacitive-based switches, one of the first keyboard technologies to not use self-contained switches. There was simply a sponge pad with a conductive-coated Mylar plastic sheet on the switch plunger, and two half-moon trace patterns on the printed circuit board below. As the key was depressed, the capacitance between the plunger pad and the patterns on the PCB below changed, which was detected by integrated circuits (IC). These keyboards were claimed to have the same reliability as the other \\"solid-state switch\\" keyboards such as inductive and Hall-Effect, but competitive with direct- contact keyboards. ==Corporate information== The company, which has been described as a contract manufacturer, was founded in 1969, went public in 1983, and has an estimated 5,000 employees.

Harvard Magazine, March‚ÄìApril 2001, accessed September 7, 2010 He was active in both universities' Gilbert and Sullivan performing groups.Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players (The Gondoliers 1977; Ruddigore 1978) ==Microsoft== Ballmer recruited Zbikowski, who joined Microsoft in 1981. In March 1982 he replaced Tim Paterson as development lead and manager for Microsoft's MS-DOS 2.0, a position he held through DOS 4.0. His first major contributions were the addition of hierarchical directory structure to DOS 2.0 and installable device drivers. From March 1985 until 1991, he was on the architecture team for OS/2, development manager for file systems and device drivers, and technical advisor to Paul Maritz. The breakthrough concept of Installable File System in OS/2 is attributed to him. Following the demise of the Microsoft/IBM joint development agreement, he was an architect, development manager and key contributor to Cairo, working for Jim Allchin and, later, Anthony Short. This led to Cairo's Object File System and content index efforts. In 1996, as Cairo migrated from being a standalone product to a technology source, Zbikowski worked under Lou Perazzoli on the Windows NT kernel, focusing on performance and size, before becoming architect and development manager for NT file systems in 1998. In 2001, Zbikowski was a candidate for director of the Harvard Alumni Association. Zbikowski retired from Microsoft in June 2006. Due to his interest in education, he became affiliated, in 2007, with the University of Washington as a lecturer in the Computer Science and Engineering department in the College of Engineering.

Following the novel's publication, Ellen Wren, the wife of bookmaker and businessman John Wren sued Hardy for libel, claiming that the characters of John West and his wife Nellie were modelled on the Wrens, and that Nellie's affair in the novel was libellous to Ellen Wren. Ultimately Hardy was cleared and publication allowed. Griffin, James: Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 12, 1990 accessed 6 June 2020 == Publication == The work was originally self-published, with illustrations by Hardy's friend \\"Amb\\" Dyson, with the subtitle \\"a novel in three parts by Frank J. Hardy, Ross Franklyn\\". \\"Ross Franklyn\\" was the pseudonym Hardy had always used prior to Power Without Glory. This combination of real name and pen name was also used in Hardy's 1961 book The Hard Way which describes the difficulties \\"Ross Franklyn\\" had in having the book published, and the problems Frank Hardy faced in answering the criminal libel charge against him arising from the publication. Hardy was a member of the Communist Party of Australia, which features in the novel as the enemy of the protagonist. After the novel's publication, Hardy would run unsuccessfully for office as a member of the Communist Party. Hardy wrote in his later work, The Hard Way, that he felt dissatisfied with the final chapters of the novel. In his desire to complete the long work at a manageable length for publication, and with the threats regarding the novel's publication, Hardy felt the final chapters were hurried. == Novel == _Power Without Glory_ follows the life of John West, who is born into an impoverished family in the fictitious Melbourne suburb of Carringbush, which is based on the actual suburbs of Abbotsford and Collingwood. When the novel opens, in 1893, West is twenty-four years old and already involved in criminal activities including gambling and bookmaking. The novel follows West's life as he rises to be a highly ambitious businessman and corrupt politician, as a powerbroker for the Australian Labor Party power-broker, John Wren. The novel is partly set during World War I, and the debate about conscription is a major issue in the novel. John West is a fierce patriot who supports conscription, and his sometimes fiery arguments with the Irish-Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, who opposes conscription on the grounds that to send men to aid England was contrary to his, and Ireland's, historical enmity with that country. West's family dramas are many: his brother Arthur spends time in jail for aiding and abetting a crime of rape, West's wife Nellie has an affair with a tradesman and falls pregnant with his child, and his daughter becomes a member of the Communist Party of Australia in the years after the War. West's relationship with Communism is a hateful one, and he heavily finances the efforts of the (real life) anti-communist, Roman Catholic B.A. Santamaria. This crusade damages both his family fortunes and his marriage, and continues until West's death as an old man in 1950. == Characters== The novel can be considered a Roman √† clef, or a novel in which many of the characters correlate with real-life figures of the time, including Victorian Premier Sir Thomas Bent and Prime Minister James Scullin. The following list attempts to align Power Without Glory characters with real historical persons who may have been inspirational to the author. Recognisable features do not necessarily imply any attempt at an exact correlation. Hardy himself conceded or even affirmed some such correlations, but says in The Hard Way that many such lists were being created and passed around by parties without his involvement, perhaps even without his knowledge. *ASHTON, Frank ‚Äî Frank Anstey, Labor politician and social propagandist *BACON, Snowy ‚Äî Reginald Leslie (Snowy) Baker, fight promoter, sportsman, actor, soldier, and journalist ('versatile') *BENNETT (The Gentleman Thief) ‚Äî Hon.

It was the last prosecution for criminal (as opposed to civil) libel in Victoria. The case attracted enormous publicity, coinciding as it did with the anti-Communist referendum and served mainly to give the novel and any negative portrayal of Wren greater prominence. Hardy readily conceded that he had published the work, and so the defense was built on the remaining two points, of whether the informant Ellen Wren was in fact identical with the character Nellie West, and if so, whether in fact the publication was defamatory. Witnesses had testified that they recognized Ellen in the character of Nellie, and that she had been defamed. Hardy's successful defense, as described in The Hard Way, argued that while the character of John West had character traits of John Wren, he was also an amalgam of ideas, with many events in the story not correlating to Wren's life. Hardy argued that if John Wren was not solely based on John West, then the character's wife could not solely be based on Ellen Wren. Hardy was acquitted of all charges, and the novel was published to a wider audience than its initial publication. Historians have debated whether Ellen Wren did actually have an affair and conceive an illegitimate son, as in the novel. In The Hard Way, Hardy denied ever having spoken to any member of the Wren family during his extensive research for the book, claiming the affair was entirely fictional. However in 2005, Monash University academic Jenny Hocking claimed to have discovered archival material supporting the argument that Ellen Wren did indeed have an affair with a tradesperson, and that Hardy may have had knowledge of the affair. == Cultural influence == In 1976, the novel was made into a 26-episode ABC-TV series starring Martin Vaughan as West. While Nellie's affair with the brickie is depicted, the affair does not produce a child. The series won numerous Logie, Penguin and Sammy Awards. Hardy wrote several books examining his experiences arising from writing Power Without Glory, including The Hard Way: The Story Behind Power without Glory (1961), Who Shot George Kirkland?: A Novel About the Nature of Truth (1981), and But the Dead are Many: A Novel in Fugue Form (1975). In these a central theme is the ambiguity between truth and fiction. == References * * Hollywood Ten, Melbourne One, 1985, Daryl Dellora, CA Film and TV Digital Archive Project, Published on YouTube May 31, 2016.

Burrows provide a form of shelter against predation and exposure to the elements and can be found in nearly every biome and among various biological interactions. Many different animal species are known to form burrows. These species range from small invertebrates, such as the Corophium arenarium, to very large vertebrate species such as the polar bear. Burrows can be constructed into a wide variety of substrates and can range in complexity from a simple tube a few centimeters long to a complex network of interconnecting tunnels and chambers hundreds or thousands of meters in total length. An example of this well-developed burrow would be a rabbit warren. == Vertebrate burrows == A black-tailed prairie dog, with young, emerges from its burrow A large variety of vertebrates construct or use burrows in many different types of substrate and can range widely in complexity. Some examples of vertebrate burrowing animals include a number of mammals, amphibians, fish (dragonet and lungfish), reptiles, and birds (including small dinosaurs). Mammals are perhaps most well known for burrowing. Mammal species such as Insectivora like the voracious mole, and rodents like the prolific gopher, great gerbil and groundhog are often found to form burrows. Some other mammals that are known to burrow are the platypus, pangolin, pygmy rabbit, armadillo, rat and weasel. The rabbit, a member of the family Lagomorpha, is a well-known burrower. Some species such as the groundhog can construct burrows that occupy a full cubic metre, displacing about 300 kilograms of dirt. There is evidence that rodents may construct the most complex burrows of all vertebrate burrowing species. For example, great gerbils live in family groups in extensive burrows, which can be seen on satellite images. Even the unoccupied burrows can remain visible in the landscape for years. The burrows are distributed regularly, although the occupied burrows appear to be clustered in space. Even Carnivora like the meerkat, and marsupials, are burrowers. The largest burrowing animal is probably the polar bear when it makes its maternity den in snow or earth. Lizards are also known to create and live in burrows, and may exhibit territorial behaviour over the burrows as well. There is also evidence that a burrow provides protection for the Adelaide pygmy blue-tongue skink (Tiliqua adelaidensis) when fighting, as they may fight from inside their burrows. Burrows by birds are usually made in soft soils; some penguins and other pelagic seabirds are noted for such burrows. The Magellanic penguin is an example, constructing burrows along coastal Patagonian regions of Chile and Argentina.C. Michael Hogan, (2008) Magellanic penguin, Globaltwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Stromberg Other burrowing birds are puffins, kingfishers, and bee-eaters. Bird burrows on the Volga shore near Kstovo, Russia Kangaroo mice construct burrows in fine sand. ==Invertebrate burrows== Scabies mites construct their burrows in the skin of the infested animal or human. Termites and some wasps construct burrows in the soil and wood. Ants construct burrows in the soil. Some sea urchins and clams can burrow into rock. The burrows produced by invertebrate animals can be filled actively or passively. Dwelling burrows which remain open during the occupation by an organism are filled passively, by gravity rather than by the organism. Actively filled burrows, on the other hand, are filled with material by the burrowing organism itself. The establishment of an invertebrate burrow often involves the soaking of surrounding sediment in mucus in order to prevent collapse and to seal off water flow. Examples of burrowing invertebrates are insects, spiders, sea urchins, crustaceans, clams and worms. == Types of burrows == Animals can create burrows using a variety of methods. Burrowing animals can be divided into three categories: primary excavators, secondary modifiers and simple occupants. Primary excavators are the animals that originally dig and construct the burrow, and are generally very strong. Some animals considered to be primary excavators are the prairie dog and the aardvark. Pygmy gerbil are an example of secondary modifiers, as they do not build an original burrow, but will live inside a burrow made by other animals and improve or change some aspects of the burrow for their own purpose. The third category, simple occupants, neither build nor modify the burrow but simply live inside or use it for their own purpose. Some species of Bird will actually make use of burrows built by tortoises, which is an example of simple occupancy. These animals can also be referred to as commensals. == Protection == Some species may spend the majority of their days inside a burrow, indicating it must have good conditions and provide some benefit to the animal. Burrows may be used by certain species as protection from harsh conditions, or from predators. Burrows may be found facing the direction of sunlight or away from the direction of cold wind. This could help with heat retention and insulation, providing protection from temperatures and conditions outside. Insects such as the earwig may create burrows to live in during the winter season, and use them for physical protection. Some species will also use burrows to store and protect food. This provides a benefit to the animal as it can keep food away from other competition. It also allows the animal to keep a good stock of food inside the burrow to avoid extreme weather conditions or seasons where certain food sources may be unavailable. Additionally, burrows can provide protection to animals that have just had their young, providing good conditions and safety for vulnerable newborn animals. Burrows may also provide shelter to animals residing in areas frequently destroyed by fire, as animals deep underground in a burrow may be kept dry, safe and at a stable temperature. ==Fossil burrows== Burrows are also commonly preserved in the fossil record as burrow fossils, a type of trace fossil.

He is best known for having been detained by the People's Republic of China on allegations of spying for Taiwan. He was imprisoned from April 2005 to February 2008; spending more than 1,000 days in prison. ==Life== Ching was born in Guangzhou, China on 3 December 1949. He was educated in St. Paul's College, Hong Kong, and graduated from Hong Kong University in 1973 with a degree in Economics. In 1974, he joined the pro-Communist China newspaper Wen Wei Po (), of which he eventually became vice-editorial manager. After the Tiananmen massacre of 4 June 1989, Ching and around 40 other journalists resigned from the newspaper in protest. After that he, Li Zhisong, and others founded Commentary, a magazine commenting on China. In 1996 he joined the staff of the Singapore-based Straits Times. At first he was assigned to the Taiwan desk, where his articles clearly showed a pro-unification stance. These articles are collected in a book called 'Will Taiwan Break Away: The Rise of Taiwanese Nationalism' . Ching was later named China correspondent for the journal. ==Arrest on spy charges== In the spring of 2005, he entered mainland China on a Home Return Permit, while researching former Communist Party leader, Zhao Ziyang. On 22 April 2005, he was charged with spying on behalf of a foreign intelligence agency and was arrested in Guangzhou. The Chinese Foreign Ministry later reported that he had confessed to these accusations. Formal charges were drawn up on 5 August. He was charged with passing state secrets to the Republic of China (Taiwan) over a period of five years. In particular, he was accused of using money provided by Taiwan to purchase political and military information. He is the first Hong Kong journalist to be charged with spying since the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the PRC in 1997. Ching's wife, Mary Lau, said the charges were 'ludicrous'. She also added that Ching had apparently fallen victim to entrapment by an intermediary as he was trying to obtain recordings of secret interviews with the former Prime Minister. In June 2005, the Hong Kong Journalists Association and Reporters Without Borders organised a petition calling for Ching's immediate release from unfair detention. The petition, containing more than 13,000 signatures, was sent to Hu Jintao, then President of the People's Republic of China. The International Federation of Journalists and the Committee to Protect Journalists also protested Ching Cheong's detention. The British Government was also asked to intervene as Ching Cheong held a British National (Overseas) passport. During the incident, some tabloids in Hong Kong insinuated that he was spying because he had to earn money for a mistress in China. The supposed mistress went to Hong Kong from China and gave witness that she had no relationship with Ching. The accusation ceased when a lot of evidence showed that Ching Cheong was innocent. On 12 January 2006, 35 legislative councillors including 10 pro- Beijing councillors (including three from the Liberal Party, three from the DAB, and one from the Alliance Party) signed an open letter asking the Chinese authorities to release Ching unless there was sufficient evidence. On 22 February 2006, the prosecutor in charge of Ching's case decided to send his file back to the State Security Department for further investigation. The trial was thus delayed for at least one month. Ching was tried in camera, found guilty of spying, and was sentenced on 31 August 2006 to five years' imprisonment. The family's statement on the same day stated the verdict was extremely biased, adopting only evidence of the Procuratorate while ignoring almost all defence arguments and Ching's defence.

The title refers to the small city of that name in Alaska, and all track titles on the album share a similar Alaskan theme.

Mislabeled MP3 files claiming to be copies of Hooper Bay are in wide circulation on peer to peer networks, but are understood to be fakes.

It is on the Sokolnicheskaya line, between Krasnye Vorota and Krasnoselskaya stations. It is located under Komsomolskaya Square, between the Leningradsky, Yaroslavsky, and Kazansky railway terminals. The station was named for the workers of the Komsomol youth league who helped to construct the first Metro line. It has a transfer at the- same-called-station on the Koltsevaya line. Komsomolskaya was built using the cut and cover method, with construction beginning on 3 May 1933. Temporary bridges were built over the construction site to avoid disrupting traffic, especially the numerous tram routes in the area. To counteract the high water table, the station was built on 636 piles which were driven into the saturated soil. Heavy rains in the summer of 1934 threatened the construction site several times, and at one point even the Kazansky terminal was in danger of collapsing. Nevertheless, the concrete structure of the station was completed by August 26 and Komsomolskaya opened on schedule on May 15, 1935. Due to Komsomolskaya's location under a major transit hub, the station was built with an unusual upper gallery above the platform to help handle rush crowds. The station has tall pillars faced with pinkish limestone and topped with bronze capitals displaying the emblem of the Komsomol league. The station was designed by Dmitry Chechulin, and a model of it was displayed at the 1937 Paris World's fair.

Its eastern terminus is at the Interstate 55/Interstate 44 junction in St. Louis. Its western terminus is at Interstate 44 in St. Clair. In St. Louis, the section between Interstate 44 and Route 366 is part of historic U.S. Route 66 and is marked as such. In the St. Louis area, it is known as Gravois Avenue or Gravois Road. Further south, Gravois Rd is used to mark the old section of the highway where the newer, divided highway rerouted Highway 30. ==Route description== Route 30 begins as it crosses over Interstate 55 at I-55's interchange with I-44. The four-lane road turns southwest as Gravois Rd and, after about , intersects Route 366. Shortly after the intersection with Route 366, the road becomes a narrow street passing through some older parts of St. Louis. At the city limits of St. Louis, it continues into the suburban area (unincorporated). Shortly before reaching Grantwood Village is the northern terminus with Route 21. About further west is the intersection with Lindbergh Boulevard (U.S. 50 / U.S. 61 / U.S. 67) and the road becomes a four-lane divided highway. A mile past Lindbergh Boulevard is the junction with I-270, and southwest of that is an interchange over Route 141. As the highway continues southwest in the suburban St. Louis area, the road has several traffic lights which gradually diminish as the road approaches Cedar Hill. West of Cedar Hill, the divided highway ends and the road becomes a winding road all the way to its end. A portion of the highway over the Meramec River was re-routed in the early 2000s when a new, wider bridge was built. West of Lonedell is the beginning of a concurrency with Route 47. The concurrency ends later inside the city limits of St. Clair. The road briefly joins former U.S. Route 66, turns a corner, and ends at Interstate 44. ===Mass transit=== The southern half of MetroBus Route #10 (Lindell-Gravois) follows Gravois Ave from the Civic Center Station at 14th and Spruce, then onto Tucker and Chouteau.

The character has been depicted as both a superhero and a supervillain, and as a member of Alpha Flight, X-Factor and Weapon X. ==Publication history== He was created by John Byrne and appeared in a cameo appearance in Alpha Flight #1 (Aug 1983), but he did not appear in full until Alpha Flight #11. ==Fictional character biography== Kyle Gibney is a mutant who manifested a feral mutation during puberty; this mutation granted him enhanced physical abilities and an increased rate of regeneration. He also suffered from a bestial freakish appearance, which prompted his parents to throw him out of their house. Living on the streets, he was kidnapped by the conspiratorial Secret Empire and subjected to mind- and body-altering experiments. The experiments had the consequence of making him psychologically unstable, and in particular prone to violent and animalistic behavior. During this time, he became acquainted with Dr. Valerie Cooper, a United States government official who was unaware of the Secret Empire's true nature or activities. He was freed by Wyre, the man who had unwittingly been the source for the genetic material that was used in the Empire's experiments. Gibney (now Wild Child) was detained by the military and given over to the custody of Canada's secret Department H, who oversaw the formative Alpha Flight team. The Flight member Walter Langkowski, wanting to protect the youth from the military, placed him in the trainee team dubbed Gamma Flight. After Alpha Flight and its trainee groups were officially disbanded, Gibney was recruited to join the first Omega Flight team, a group of professional criminals. Alongside Omega Flight, he battled Alpha Flight and was defeated.Alpha Flight #11‚Äì13 Alongside Omega Flight, he battled Alpha Flight again in the West Edmonton Mall, and was defeated by Madison Jeffries.Alpha Flight #26‚Äì28 Afterwards, he committed a series of murders, which ended when he battled and was captured by Wolverine after he severely injured and almost killed Alpha Flight member Heather Hudson.Marvel Comics Presents #51‚Äì53 Wild Child was subsequently pardoned under unrevealed circumstances and given membership in the new Gamma Flight.Alpha Flight #76 Alongside Gamma Flight, he battled Alpha Flight.Alpha Flight #84 However, he then aided Gamma and Alpha Flight against Llan the Sorcerer's forces.Alpha Flight #85‚Äì86 When Gamma Flight was disbanded soon after that, he went berserk over his deprecated status and attacked Pathway, another trainee. Gamma's leader Nemesis teleported him away during a fight with Heather Hudson (then Guardian) and Wolverine, and he was captured by Wolverine.Alpha Flight #87 Department H would later help him overcome his psychological problems and cure his mental illness, train him in unarmed combat, and place him as a special operative of the Canadian government assigned to Alpha Flight under the codename Weapon Omega. Alongside Alpha Flight, he battled Diablo.Alpha Flight #102‚Äì103 He joined Alpha Flight's \\"Core Alpha\\",Alpha Flight #104 met the second X-Factor team,Alpha Flight #107 and prevented the mind-controlled Omerta from assassinating Italy's head of state.Alpha Flight #108 He also fought a Wild Child doppelganger during the Infinity War.Alpha Flight #111 He was attacked by Wyre but rescued by Alpha Flight.Alpha Flight #114‚Äì115 He searched for Nemesis, and was held prisoner with her by Rok, but they were then rescued by Weapon X.Alpha Flight #116 He defeated Wyre in personal combat; he then learned about his true origin, and changed his codename to Wildheart.Alpha Flight #117‚Äì118 He aided Alpha Flight in combat with the Wrecker.Alpha Flight #119 He also became romantically involved with his teammate Aurora. His appearance eventually deteriorated back to his initial feral form, which prompted him to leave Alpha Flight and Aurora. He followed Valerie Cooper to the United States, where he joined the government operated team X-Factor. There he began a romantic relationship with his teammate Shard. His feral teammate Sabretooth frequently attempted, with little success, to convince Wild Child to become a hunter and killer like himself. He remained with the team until his body began mutating towards a more feral form. He eventually degenerated to a near-mindless state and was recruited (either willingly or via brainwashing) by the new Weapon X team. As part of his draft, Wild Child was paired with Sabretooth to try and recruit Sunfire to the program. The Japanese mutant refused and badly burned Sabretooth. When Wild Child mocked his burns Sabretooth viciously sliced through Kyle's vocal cords and threatened to kill any Weapon X medical staff who would operate on him, making sure that he would remain mute.Weapon X: The Draft ‚Äì Wild Child #1 His past flame, Aurora, was also recruited into the team but she was not herself. After the Weapon X upgrades she became cocky and aloof, snubbing the ugly Wild Child and even engaging in a relationship with the horribly disfigured Director of the program. This became fuel for the fire when Brent Jackson attempted to undermine the authority of the Director Malcolm Colcord. Using Aurora's attitude toward him as motive, Jackson convinced Wild Child to join his splinter group. ===Decimation=== Wild Child was seen on a terminal screen as one of the mutants depowered after M-Day.New Avengers #18 His energy signature was found within the entity known as The Collective, along with the energy signatures of many other depowered mutants.New Avengers #19 (2006) ===Post-Decimation=== Wild Child recently demonstrated that his powers had returned as well as previously erased memories. He even managed to best Wolverine in a quick fight. He is now looking like his old Wildheart persona.Wolverine vol. 2 #53 Wild Child appeared once more in conflict with Wolverine aiding Omega Red and attempting to kill Logan. He was doing so under the order of the enigmatic Romulus. His plan consisted of dropping Logan into molten steel; however, he was interrupted by Omega Red. While Wild Child and Omega Red battled each other, Logan managed to flee. Omega Red succeeded in distracting Wild Child and thus was able to impale him on his coils before throwing him into a vat of molten steel.Wolverine: Origins #39 ==Powers and abilities== Kyle Gibney is a mutant who was experimented upon, genetically engineered by Secret Empire scientists using DNA replicated from Wyre. He has superhumanly acute senses, as well as superhuman speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance. His teeth and nails are hardened and strong enough to rend substances as thick as bone. His body heals at a rate several times greater than that of a normal human being but not at the rate of Sabretooth's healing factor. He also has various animal-like mutations common for \\"feral\\" mutants: leaf-shaped ears; eyes with neither pupils nor irises; sharper-than-normal teeth with pronounced, fang-like canines; and elongated fingernails and toenails which can be used as claw-like weapons, as well as his hunched body posture. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with both special ops and martial arts training from Wolverine as well as the Canadian government's superhero Flight program, and is also trained in acrobatics and gymnastics. In his bestial rages, he relies more on sheer ferocity than fighting skill. As Wildheart, the savage, bestial side of his personality was suppressed by an unknown drug, but his savage self still threatened to overwhelm his sanity at all times. As a result of injuries suffered at the hands of Sabretooth, who prevented him from getting medical treatment, Wildchild was mute for a time. However, along with his renewed powers, he seems to have regained the ability to speak as well. ==Other versionsAge of Apocalypse=== In the Age of Apocalypse alternate timeline, Wild Child was a member of the X-Men and was frequently partnered with Sabretooth.Astonishing X-Men #2‚Äì3 (1995), AoA Wild Child possessed a low level of intelligence (comparable to that of a dog) and an inability to communicate verbally. As such, he was kept on a chain leash to prevent him from harming any of the X-Men. For a time, he was Sabretooth's sidekick, as Creed had rescued Wild Child from being a prisoner of Apocalypse's son Holocaust but his current fate is unknown. The 2005 Handbook to the Age of Apocalypse states that Kyle is away on a secret mission with the other X-Men who were not present during the Age of Apocalypse 10th Anniversary Limited Series, though when Sabretooth and Blink revisited their home reality during a mission as Exiles, Magneto and Rogue revealed to them that Kyle had run away after Victor and Clarice had disappeared when they were taken away by the Tallus. He was eventually found and claimed by Quentin Quire. He then moved to the latter's reality to replace its deceased Wild Child, who was not supposed to have died.Exiles: Days of Then And Now Wild Child has since been returned to the Age of Apocalypse timeline as he is seen following and later confronting the X-Force.Uncanny X-Force #11 He is killed while, along with the X-Men from his world and X-Force, trying to stop Archangel's genocidal plans on Earth-616.Uncanny X-Force #17 ===House of M=== In the House of M reality, Wild Child (alongside Arclight and Mentallo) is a Red Guard member positioned in Australia to serve Exodus.Hulk: Broken Worlds #1 ===Mutant X=== In the Mutant X alternate reality, Wild Child roams the wilds of Canada, feral, along with that reality's version of Sabretooth and Wolverine, both as feral as he.

The management of forests is known as forestry, silviculture, and forest management. A forest ecosystem is a natural woodland unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms (Biotic components) in that area functioning together with all of the non-living physical (abiotic) factors of the environment.Robert W. Christopherson. 1996 The forest ecosystem is very important. ==Relationship to other branches of ecology== Redwood tree in northern California forest, where many trees are managed for preservation and longevity Forest ecology is one branch of a biotically- oriented classification of types of ecological study (as opposed to a classification based on organizational level or complexity, for example population or community ecology). Thus, forests are studied at a number of organizational levels, from the individual organism to the ecosystem. However, as the term forest connotes an area inhabited by more than one organism, forest ecology most often concentrates on the level of the population, community or ecosystem. Logically, trees are an important component of forest research, but the wide variety of other life forms and abiotic components in most forests means that other elements, such as wildlife or soil nutrients, are often the focal point. Thus, forest ecology is a highly diverse and important branch of ecological study. Forest ecology studies share characteristics and methodological approaches with other areas of terrestrial plant ecology. However, the presence of trees makes forest ecosystems and their study unique in numerous ways. ==Community diversity and complexity== Since trees can grow larger than other plant life-forms, there is the potential for a wide variety of forest structures (or physiognomies). The infinite number of possible spatial arrangements of trees of varying size and species makes for a highly intricate and diverse micro-environment in which environmental variables such as solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed can vary considerably over large and small distances. In addition, an important proportion of a forest ecosystem's biomass is often underground, where soil structure, water quality and quantity, and levels of various soil nutrients can vary greatly.James P. Kimmins. 2004 Thus, forests are often highly heterogeneous environments compared to other terrestrial plant communities. This heterogeneity in turn can enable great biodiversity of species of both plants and animals. Some structures, such as tree ferns may be keystone species for a diverse range of other species.Fountain-Jones N.M, Mc Quillan P and Grove S. (2012) ‚ÄòBeetle communities associated with the tree fern Dicksonia antarctica Labill. in Tasmania‚Äô Australian Journal of Entomology. 51, 154-165. A number of factors within the forest affect biodiversity; primary factors enhancing wildlife abundance and biodiversity are the presence of diverse tree species within the forest and the absence of even aged timber management.Philip Joseph Burton. 2003 For example, the wild turkey thrives when uneven heights and canopy variations exist and its numbers are diminished by even aged timber management. Forest management techniques that mimic natural disturbance events (variable retention forestry Franklin et al 1997) can allow community diversity to recover rapidly for a variety of groups including beetles.Fountain-Jones, N.M, Baker, S.B and Jordan, G (2015). ‚ÄòMoving beyond the guild concept: developing a consistent functional trait framework for terrestrial beetles‚Äô Ecological Entomology. 40, 1-13. ==Energy flux== Forest ecologists are interested in the effects of large disturbances, such as wildfires. Montana, United States. Forests accumulate large amounts of standing biomass, and many are capable of accumulating it at high rates, i.e. they are highly productive. Such high levels of biomass and tall vertical structures represent large stores of potential energy that can be converted to kinetic energy under the right circumstances. The world‚Äôs forests contain about 606 gigatonnes of living biomass (above- and below-ground) and 59 gigatonnes of dead wood. Two such conversions of great importance are fires and treefalls, both of which radically alter the biota and the physical environment where they occur. Also, in forests of high productivity, the rapid growth of the trees themselves induces biotic and environmental changes, although at a slower rate and lower intensity than relatively instantaneous disturbances such as fires. ==Death and regeneration== Sea star regenerating legs Woody material, often referred to as coarse woody debris, decays relatively slowly in many forests in comparison to most other organic materials, due to a combination of environmental factors and wood chemistry (see lignin). Trees growing in arid and/or cold environments do so especially slowly. Thus, tree trunks and branches can remain on the forest floor for long periods, affecting such things as wildlife habitat, fire behavior, and tree regeneration processes. Some trees leave behind eerie skeletons after death. In reality these deaths are actually very few compared to the amount of tree deaths that go unnoticed. Thousands of seedlings can be produced from a single tree but only a few can actually grow to maturity. Most of those deaths are caused from competition for light, water, or soil nutrients, this is called natural thinning. Singular deaths caused by natural thinning go unnoticed, but many deaths can help form forest ecosystems. There are four stages to forest regrowth after a disturbance, the establishment phase which is rapid increase in seedlings, the thinning phase which happens after a canopy is formed and the seedlings covered by it die, the transition phase which occurs when one tree from the canopy dies and creates a pocket of light giving new seedlings opportunity to grow, and lastly the steady-state phase which happens when the forest has different sizes and ages of trees. ==Water== Lastly, forest trees store large amounts of water because of their large size and anatomical/physiological characteristics. They are therefore important regulators of hydrological processes, especially those involving groundwater hydrology and local evaporation and rainfall/snowfall patterns. An estimated 399 million ha of forest is designated primarily for the protection of soil and water, an increase of 119 million ha since 1990. Thus, forest ecological studies are sometimes closely aligned with meteorological and hydrological studies in regional ecosystem or resource planning studies. Perhaps more importantly the duff or leaf litter can form a major repository of water storage. When this litter is removed or compacted ( through grazing or human overuse), erosion and flooding are exacerbated as well as deprivation of dry season water for forest organisms. ==Ecological potential of forestal species== The ecological potential of a particular species is a measure of its capacity to effectively compete in a given geographical area, ahead of other species, as they all try to occupy a natural space. For some areas it has been quantified, as for instance by Hans-J√ºrgen Otto, for central Europe. He takes three groups of parameters: :*Related to site requirements: Tolerance to low temperatures, tolerance to dry climate, frugality. :*Specific qualities: Shade tolerance, height growth, stability, longevity, regeneration capacity. :*Specific risks: Resistance to late freezing, resistance to wind/ice storm, resistance to fire, resistance to biotic agents. Every parameter is scored between 0 and 5 for each considered species, and then a global mean value calculated. A value above 3.5 is considered high, below 3.0 low, and intermediate for those in between. In this study Fagus sylvatica has a score of 3.82, Fraxinus excelsior 3.08 and Juglans regia 2.92; and are examples of the three categories. ==See also== *Clear cutting *Close to nature forestry *Deforestation and climate change *Forest Ecology and Management (journal) *Forest Principles *Intact forest landscapes *Mountain ecology *Old-growth forest *Plant ecology *Regeneration (ecology) == Sources  References Bibliography=== * Philip Joseph Burton. 2003.

It is set during the Vietnam War in 1967. The expansion pack Vietcong: Fist Alpha was released in 2004 and was bundled with Vietcong as Vietcong: Purple Haze for the PC. Vietcong: Purple Haze was also released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, ported by Coyote Games. Another official add-on titled Red Dawn was released as a free downloadable content. A sequel to the game, Vietcong 2, was released in 2005. ==Plot== The player takes on the role of Sergeant First Class Steve R. Hawkins, assigned to the United States Special Forces (\\"Green Berets\\") camp at a strategic location of Nui Pek in South Vietnam near the Cambodian border. Hawkins and his A-Team carry out a series of various missions against the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces. The game ends in a massive North Vietnamese attack on the team's base camp which is ultimately abandoned by all American forces. The ground assault on Nui Pek is a recreation of the ground assault that happened at Special Forces Camp Lang Vei. ==Gameplay== Vietcong has the player take part in military operations against the Viet Cong and later also the North Vietnamese Army. Some levels are highly linear, while others take place in more open outdoor environments, allowing for more tactical freedom. Missions typically require the player to sabotage weapons caches or simply clear areas of enemies - usually not all objectives need to be achieved in order to complete a mission. Gameplay mostly revolves around open combat in the jungle, tunnels and other locations typical for the setting but the player occasionally also has to traverse longer passages without encountering enemies during which punji pits and other traps pose the main threat. Vietcong aims for a high level of authenticity and realism. AI characters make frequent use of cover but change the latter often, making it difficult for the player to anticipate enemies' specific locations and encouraging a tactical approach. All weapons' aim sights can be used to increase aim but a sway is present which simulates a shooter's shaking hands. The latter can be reduced by entering a crouching or prone stance. While aiming the gun is raised, which allows the player to shoot over cover without fully exposing himself. The game avoids the use of health packs and rather has the player use bandages, which briefly exposes him, or have a medic treat his wounds. The game features a variety of authentic weapons from the era such as the M-16 and AK-47 assault rifles. The player is able to choose the weapons he wants to go on a mission with in advance but can also replace them with weapons found on missions, giving him access to weapons used by the enemies. In some missions airstrikes can be ordered to bombard specific areas of the map. Typically for tactical shooters the player is usually accompanied by AI controlled comrades. Each of the fellow soldiers is a unique character who is not allowed to die and serves a specific role in the team. For instance the point man can safely lead the team towards the objective, avoiding any traps and warning the player of enemies in advance, while a combat engineer carries an infinite supply of ammo for the player. By default the team simply follows the player character and engages at will but general orders such as to attack the enemy or retreat can be given. The fellow soldiers can also be called individually to the player character's location. ===Quick fight=== In addition to the main campaign a \\"quick fight\\" mode is available. The latter allows the player to simply engage in a fight on one of several arena-like maps with the sole objective of eliminating all enemies. The player can choose whether he wishes to be accompanied by a team, how many and what kind of enemies to engage, and what equipment he wishes to go on the mission with. In this mode the player is also able to assume the role of a Viet Cong combatant and engage American soldiers. By default only a single map and few weapons are available but more become available as the player makes progress in the game's main campaign. ===Multiplayer=== The game also features a local and online multiplayer mode which supports up to 64 players per match. The online lobby servers were hosted by the now-defunct GameSpy Arcade. Several gameplay modes typical for shooter games are available: Free for all deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag and last man standing. Additionally a team mode is available where, similarly to Counter-Strike, players remain dead for the remainder of the current round and teams only score a point if the opposite team has been completely annihilated. ==ReceptionSales=== In the United Kingdom, Vietcong sold roughly 20,000 units during the first half of 2003. Kristan Reed of GamesIndustry.biz wrote that these were \\"not figures that spell H.I.T.\\" Its sales in the region rose to around 50,000 units by year's end. As of November 2007, Vietcong had sold more than 1 million copies worldwide. ===Reviews and awards=== The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In the Czech Republic, the game's country of origin, the game is highly popular. Vietcong was voted the 3rd best video game developed in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in a survey by Czech web provider BonusWeb when it received 1393 votes out of 13,143 as every reader could choose for three games to vote for. GameSpot gave it the award of the Game of the Month for April 2003. Vietcong was named the eighth-best computer game of 2003 by Computer Games Magazine. The editors wrote that \\"the interface feels more like shooting a gun and interacting with the environment than any other first-person shooter ever\\". ==References * Pterodon and Vietcong official website * Category:2003 video games Category:2K Czech games Category:2K Games franchises Category:Cooperative video games Category:First- person shooters Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Tactical shooter video games Category:Take-Two Interactive franchises Category:Video games with expansion packs Category:Vietnam War video games Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Cold War video games Category:Video games developed in the Czech Republic ","title":"Vietcong (video game)"},{"id":"2215979","text":"The AFI Conservatory is a private not-for-profit graduate film school in the Hollywood Hills district of Los Angeles. Students (called \\"Fellows\\") learn from the masters in a collaborative, hands-on production environment with an emphasis on storytelling. The Conservatory is a program of the American Film Institute founded in 1969. ==History== The Center for Advanced Film Studies (later the AFI Conservatory) opened its doors at Greystone Mansion on September 23, 1969. Harold Lloyd screened his film The Freshman and spoke with AFI Fellows on the school's very first day. The first class included Terrence Malick, Caleb Deschanel and Paul Schrader. In 1973 filmmaker John Cassavetes was the first filmmaker-in-residence while editing A Woman Under The Influence. Although we didn't see much of him we knew he was there. In 1975, filmmaker J√°n Kad√°r, director of the Oscar-winning film The Shop on Main Street, became the Conservatory's second filmmaker-in-residence. In 2013, Emmy and Oscar-winning director, producer and screenwriter James L. Brooks (As Good as It Gets, Broadcast News, Terms of Endearment) joined the AFI Conservatory as Artistic Director, where he provides leadership for the film program. Brooks' artistic role at the AFI Conservatory has a rich legacy that includes Daniel Petrie, Jr., Robert Wise and Frank Pierson. Former Deans of the AFI Conservatory include Robert Mandel, Jan Schuette and Richard Gladstein. Susan Ruskin is the current Dean of the AFI Conservatory and Executive Vice President of AFI. Among those AFI has bestowed Honorary Degrees upon during its annual Commencement ceremony are Maya Angelou, John Williams, Ken Burns, Sherry Lansing, Sydney Pollack, Clint Eastwood, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Kathleen Kennedy, Spike Lee, Rita Moreno and Quentin Tarantino. Thirteen AFI Conservatory thesis films have been nominated for Academy Awards. ==Academics== The Warner Bros. building on the AFI campus. ===Rankings=== In 2020, both The Hollywood Reporter and the TheWrap ranked AFI as the #1 film school in America in their respective best film school issues. It is ranked in the top five graduate film programs along with USC, UCLA, NYU and California Institute of the Arts by the Princeton Review and US News and World Report ===Conservatory Program=== AFI Conservatory is a five-term Master of Fine Arts program in six disciplines: Cinematography, Directing, Editing, Producing, Production Design, and Screenwriting. Traditionally, the Conservatory accepts 28 Fellows per year for most disciplines and 14 for the Production Design and Editing disciplines. Each discipline's program runs two years in length. First Year - Fellows from all disciplines work on at least three digital video or high definition short films (up to 20 minutes), referred to as 'cycle projects'. Each of these first-year projects are accomplished by Fellows with a minimum of oversight from the senior faculty. The purported goal being to stimulate a flexible and creative approach to filmmaking within imposed budgetary constraints and without the crutch of seasoned oversight. These 'cycle projects' make up the core curriculum of the first year experience and amount to a 'boot camp\\" of filmmaking that simultaneously challenges and invigorates the Fellows involved. Second Year - Most Fellows work on at least one thesis short film, shot on digital video, high definition, 35mm film, or 16mm film, and develop portfolio materials (such as a reel and a feature film screenplay). Screenwriting Fellows have the option of writing two feature- length screenplays instead of participating in a thesis film. They are responsible for raising the bulk of their own financing for these projects (average budget is $30,000), and must adhere to standard industry regulations, such as SAG charter rules, during filming. The senior faculty of the conservatory oversee the development of the 'second year' projects and monitor their development in a manner similar to what might be expected of an Executive Producer. ===Disciplines=== AFI Conservatory Fellows filming on the AFI campus Cinematography - Encompassing training from pre-visualization to advanced image manipulation and control, Cinematography Fellows develop their storytelling skills using formats ranging from digital video to 16mm and 35mm film cameras to the most cutting-edge cameras on the market. Directing - With a focus on narrative filmmaking, Directing Fellows learn diverse directing styles, techniques and strategies as they gain a thorough understanding of the production process, script to screen. Editing - Editing Fellows master the skills to be editors, assistant editors and post-production producers while learning the technical, aesthetic and collaborative aspects of post-production with a primary focus on storytelling. Producing - Producing Fellows study all aspects of creative, entrepreneurial production while developing and producing a minimum of three short films in their first year and a thesis film in their second year. Production Design - Attracting artists from architecture, interior design, theater design and other related fields, the Production Design curriculum focuses on the creative process of visually and physically developing cinematic environments. Screenwriting - Screenwriting Fellows conceive and write multiple projects in features, short films, long and short- form TV drama and comedy as well as webisodes and other Internet innovations. Fellows learn to collaborate with Directing and Producing classmates to bring their stories to the screen. ===Faculty=== The AFI Conservatory has an esteemed faculty of working professionals including Todd Cherniawsky (art director, Star Wars: The Last Jedi), Stan Chervin (writer, Moneyball), Destin Daniel Cretton, (director, Short Term 12), David Cook, (editor NCIS), Matthew Friedman (editor, The Farewell), Joe Garrity (production designer, Best in Show), Michael Jablow (editor, Old School), Susan Littenberg (editor Easy A), Stephen Lighthill (recipient 2018 ASC President's Award), Elvis Mitchell (film critic), Michele Mulroney (writer, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows), Martin Nicholson (editor, The Alienist), Lauren Polizzi (art director, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ‚Äì Part 1 & The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ‚Äì Part 2), Louis Provost (VP Production, Walt Disney Studios), Patricia Riggen (director The 33), Russell Schwartz (marketing executive on films including Chappaquiddick), Anna Thomas (co-writer El Norte), Jennie Tugend, (producer, Free Willy), Janet Yang (producer, The Joy Luck Club). ===Seminars=== The Harold Lloyd Master Seminar series ‚Äî named after silent film legend Harold Lloyd, who gave the first seminar in 1969 ‚Äî takes place on campus throughout during the academic year and brings AFI Conservatory Fellows together with artists to share their work and experiences in an informal and accessible setting.

It is not clear whether she was also the mother of Abu Lahab's son Durrah. ==Opposition to MuhammadSura 111=== Umm Jamil supported her husband in his opposition to Muhammad's preaching. When Muhammad promised Paradise to the believers, Abu Lahab blew on his hands and said, \\"May you perish. I can see nothing in you of the things that Muhammad says.\\" Muhammad therefore declared a revelation from Allah about them.Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 160. May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he. His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained. He will burn in a Fire of flame And his wife ‚Äì the carrier of firewood. Around her neck is a rope of fibre.Quran 111:1-3 (Sahih International). The occasion for this revelation is disputed. Ibn Sa'd and Ibn Kathir state that it was in 613 CE, when Muhammad summoned the Quraysh to Mount Safa for his first public warning that they must heed Allah's message. Abu Lahab interrupted: \\"May you perish! Did you assemble us for this? You should die!\\" and Muhammad responded with the prophecy.Ibn Sa'd/Haq p. 231.The Reason for the Revelation of this Surah and the Arrogance of Abu Lahab toward the Messenger.

Ibn Ishaq says that Umm Jamil was called \\"the carrier of firewood\\" because she carried thorns and cast them in Muhammad's way where he would be passing;Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 161. however, he also states that the Quraysh did not resort to this form of harassment until after the death of Abu Talib in 620.Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 191. Ibn Kathir also offers the alternative theory that \\"carrier of firewood\\" does not refer to a past event but to Umm Jamil's future destiny of willingly stoking the fires that would punish her husband in Hell. ===Counterblast=== When Umm Jamil bint Harb heard that Muhammad had been prophesying about her and her husband, she went to the Kaaba, where Muhammad was sitting with Abu Bakr, carrying a stone pestle. She did not notice Muhammad, so she asked Abu Bakr after him, \\"for I have been told that he is satirising me. If I had found him, I would have smashed his mouth with this stone.\\" Then she produced a poem of her own: We reject the reprobate, His words we repudiate, His religion we loathe and hate.

The Jeffrey Burr Kobra and his brother Jason first appeared in Kobra #1 (February 1976), and were created by Jack Kirby. Jason Burr debuted as Kobra in Faces of Evil: Kobra #1 (March 2009) by Ivan Brandon and Julian Lopez. ==Publication history== Both Jeffrey and Jason Burr were created by Jack Kirby for a proposed DC Comics series called King Kobra, the first issue of which was both written and drawn by Kirby. This first issue then sat in DC inventory for over a year, during which time Kirby left the publisher to return to Marvel Comics. Eventually the concept was handed over to writer Martin Pasko with orders to make a series out of it. Pasko was unimpressed with King Kobra, feeling it to be a throwaway idea churned out by Kirby as he was preparing to leave DC, and tried to make the best out of the assignment by whiting out all of Kirby's original dialogue, rescripting the issue, and having Pablo Marcos redraw some of the art. Now titled simply Kobra, the first issue of the series appeared in late 1975 (cover-dated February 1976). It was cancelled after seven issues, though the contents of the unpublished Kobra #8 saw print in DC Special Series #1. Pasko later reflected, \\"I wrote all of Kobra with my tongue firmly planted in my cheek‚Äîit was a preposterous exercise dumped in my lap, and it helped pay the rent on a very nice place in the Village.\\" Kobra is also featured in a January 2009 Faces of Evil one-shot, written by Ivan Brandon.Ivan Brandon Sharpens Fangs on ‚ÄúKobra‚Äù, Comic Book Resources, November 17, 2008 ==Fictional character biographyJeffrey Franklin Burr=== Kobra is an international terrorist and mad scientist who has crossed paths with the majority of Earth's costumed heroes during his attempts to usher in the Kali Yuga (an age of chaos). His real name is Jeffrey Franklin Burr, and he was born part of a set of siamese twins, but was stolen at birth by the Cult of the Kobra God, since a prophecy claimed he would lead them to rule the world. Under their teaching, he became a dangerous warrior and a sadistic criminal mastermind. He led the cult into using advanced technology to menace the world. Followers of Kobra would frequently address their master as \\"Naja- Naja\\", \\"naja naja\\" being the binomial name for the Indian cobra. This later became \\"NƒÅga-Naga\\", a meaningless title which translates from the Sanskrit as \\"snake-snake\\". Whether this change was intentional or an error is not known. However, unknown to the cult, he had a psychic link to his twin brother, Jason, who knew nothing of Kobra. As a result, one felt what the other felt, including pain. Because of this, his brother was recruited by an international agency to help them combat Kobra. At first, Kobra was unable to kill or even hurt his brother; eventually, however, he used a device that \\"shut off\\" the psychic link, and gave him the chance to kill Jason. However, Kobra was subsequently haunted by visions of his brother. Whether it really was his ghost or just Kobra's imagination was never revealed. In subsequent years, Kobra would clash with assorted superheroes, including Batman, whom he first met over a Lazarus Pit of his own creation. Kobra had learned to build modified Lazarus Pits, which allowed him to control the minds of those he killed and resurrected. Kobra is the only person in the DC universe ever to decipher the formula for the Lazarus Pits. Kobra had special concerns about Wonder Woman and sought to ensure her death, first by hiring a cartel of international assassins who were led secretly by corrupted UN Crisis Bureau chief Morgan Tracy (also Diana Prince's boss), then by kidnapping and irretrievably damaging environmental activist Deborah Domaine, forcibly transforming her into a new Cheetah, and ultimately, facing Wonder Woman in combat in Egypt, faking his own demise after being defeated by the Amazon Princess. A short while later his various Strike Force Kobra teams would fight two different incarnations of Batman's Outsiders. Kobra also fought the third Flash, the Suicide Squad led by Amanda Waller, the original incarnation of Checkmate, Captain Atom, a Superman whose personality had been swapped with Ambush Bug's by exposure to Red Kryptonite, and others. Kobra is one of a very small number of individuals that has the capability of defeating Batman in hand-to-hand combat, and actually did so on one occasion. The only organization ever to rival Kobra in the old DC Universe (Pre-Crisis I) was SKULL. There were frequent recorded clashes between the two groups, the last occurring in Outsiders Annual #1 story \\"The Skull...The Serpent...and The Outsiders\\". After the betrayal of his lover Lady Eve during the Strike Force Kobra fiasco, she split Kobra in two and established her own splinter group. In the Power Company: Sapphire #1 the Justice League rushes to San Diego to prevent disaster as two rival factions of the Kobra Cult prepared to go to war. One faction was led by Eve; the other was led by Kobra himself. He kidnaps the former hero Air Wave and uses him to seize control of the world's media and satellite resources, intending to destroy a number of major world cities. However, in a demonstration of his power, he incidentally kills Terri Rothstein, Atom Smasher's mother, ensuring the Justice Society of America's involvement. Mrs. Rothstein's life would later be saved through time travel; Atom Smasher replacing her with the villain Extant so that the same number of people died in the plane crash that killed his mother. He appeared again in JSA #45, which featured his trial. He shrugs off claims of terrorism, claiming to be an enlightened soul (a bodhisattva) trying to free souls from their karmic debt by random acts of violence. Following this, his followers threatened to kill the media outside the courthouse with a bioengineered suicide bomb implants. Holding everyone hostage with this tactic, he was allowed by the JSA to escape, leading to an outraged Black Adam and Atom Smasher, who both subsequently choose to leave the team. In JSA #51, Atom Smasher, Black Adam, Northwind, and Brainwave track Kobra down to his headquarters in the Himalaya Mountains, Kobra's prophesied 'reign of darkness' as the world fell to the return of Eclipso and Obsidian having ended when Alex Moretz took control of Eclipso and Alan Scott managed to redeem Obsidian. After killing Kobra's guards, Black Adam rips his heart out and he died instantly. ===Jason Burr=== Jeffrey's twin brother Jason is re-animated by the Kobra CultFaces of Evil: Kobra #1, possibly through the use of Kobra's Lazarus Pits. This involves the death of an entire facility of Checkmate agents, including several of Burr's old friends. Within the one-shot Jason reveals that he is re-structuring the organization and killing off all the old members. Before revealing himself as the new Kobra, Jason spent some time undercover as a Checkmate agent learning their secrets. ===King Kobra=== During the \\"Convergence\\" storyline, an unidentified Kobra leads the Kobra Cult under the alias of \\"King Kobra\\" and faces off against Red Hood and Arsenal.Convergence: Titans #1.

DC Comics. ==Kobra organization== Kobra Blackadders vs Checkmate Knight * The Kobra organization survived Jeffrey Burr's death, and has been gaining converts. In Identity Crisis, it was revealed that DCU prisoners (such as Slipknot) sometimes convert to the cult of Kobra, to the general disgust of the DC's supervillains. * Like Ra's al Ghul, Kobra owned a hidden network of very specialized Lazarus Pits. * Kobra apparently entertains many specialized sub-sections. One such section was the Blackadders, a group of ninja-like fanatics. In the past, Kobra operated an aggressive metahuman research and recruitment program. This program gave birth to both known versions of Strike Force Kobra. * Kobra is currently active in the DCU as a terrorist organization with a religious bent. Upon the death of Jeffrey Burr, it underwent a power-struggle, with would-be leaders including King Snake, and (unwillingly) a schoolfriend of Tim Drake who apparently fitted the prophecy, but this has apparently settled: a new leader has emerged (possibly Eve who had split off with half of the old school Kobra). Under her, the organization now seeks to fulfill 'the prophecies of Kali Yuga'. It is actively being fought by the super-spy agency known as Checkmate. * The new Kobra seems to be ranked by serpent type, low level members are Lanceheads, higher level members are called Nagas (Checkmate vol. 2 #4), the highest level shown are the Bestowed, mystics who specialize in Blood Magic.Checkmate vol. 2 #24 ===Strike Force Kobra=== Kobra researched every villain that ever fought Batman and how they each acquired their respective powers. After obtaining some test subjects, Kobra had his researchers use this information to transform them into Strike Force Kobra. Kobra sent them to fight the Outsiders and infiltrate Stagg Enterprises. During the resulting fight, Spectrumonster was destroyed and the rest of Strike Force Kobra was defeated by the Outsiders and arrested by the police.Outsiders #21-22. DC Comics. Kobra would later form a second incarnation of Strike Force Kobra led by his cult member Lady Eve. When this version of Strike Force Kobra was defeated by Eradicator's incarnation of the Outsiders even after the death of the third Syonide, Lady Eve called Kobra for help only for him to tell them to surrender. This action caused a strain between Kobra and Lady Eve.Outsiders Vol. 2 #5. DC Comics. Membership Strike Force Kobra I * Clayface IV - A supervillain with shapeshifting powers similar to the Matt Hagen version minus the limits that he had. * Elemental Woman - A former lab assistant of Kobra who can turn into different elements like Elemental Man did. * Planet Master II - A supervillain whose suit enables him to tap into the powers of the planets. * Spectrumonster - A Stagg Enterprises employee-turned-spy for Kobra who became a being of coherent light. He was destroyed during the first mission. * Zebra-Man II - A supervillain with diamagnetism. Unlike the first Zebra-Man, this version lacks the aura sported by the first Zebra-Man and sports a mohawk that evokes the image of his equine namesake. Strike Force Kobra II * Lady Eve - The leader of the second Strike Force Kobra. * Dervish - A female supervillain with super- speed. * Fauna Faust - The daughter of Felix Faust who can perform magic and control animals. She was apparently killed by her father. * Syonide III - A whip-wielding female supervillain. She was killed by Eradicator. * Windfall - A female aerokinetic supervillain who is the sister of New Wave. ==Other versions== In Kingdom Come, Jeffrey Burr is a part of the Mankind Liberation Front led by Lex Luthor. The first King Kobra appears in Batman '66 comic continuation of the series. ==In other mediaTelevision=== * A future version of Kobra (or, at least, his organization) appeared in four episodes of Batman Beyond where its members are variously voiced by Corey Burton, Kerrigan Mahan, Gary Anthony Sturgis and Keith Szarabajka. Its members appeared not to be warriors, but scientists who have an obsession with reptiles. They also made virus tests on people who were kidnapped. They in turn became reptilian creatures that obey Kobra's every command. Little is known about the origins of Kobra, but they had long admired the power of the dinosaurs. They envisioned them as the only life form capable of ruling the world once again. So, for years Kobra sought a way to splice human genes with dinosaur DNA. Until they could achieve this main goal, Kobra used cutting edge technology for robberies, extortion and terrorism, which led them to clash with Batman (Terry McGinnis) on a few occasions. : Kobra was ruthless and unforgiving. Every member of Kobra was expected to have complete allegiance and devotion to the organization, and any protocol breach was punished with a gruesome death in a pit of vipers. Among their interrogation techniques, Kobra used a sensor that turned one's thoughts into pictures. This way they could weed out traitors among their ranks (however, this instrument was revealed to be fallible, as a young kid deceived it by sheer force of will as seen in \\"Unmasked\\"). : There were several Kobra branches around the world, and each cell seemed to have its own Main Operator. The hierarchy of Kobra was depicted by color and garments. The ones on the bottom were foot soldiers, identified by their green spandex uniforms. They responded to members who donned an orange variation of the same spandex uniform, with golden bracelets on their forearms and forelegs, and a green exomis or hooded cloak. There were also scientists, technicians, or assistants who wore these garments. However, Main Operators usually had a chin beard. Within the infantry there were assassins that ranked above the rest. They were trained in specific fighting techniques, or armed with special weaponry, such as electrical flail or edge weapons. Altogether, these combatants were more dangerous and deadlier than the average foot soldier. : Kobra's first appearance was in \\"Plague\\", where it continued executing fiendish schemes to gain an edge and thrive. In the episode, they had developed a deadly super virus capable of complete biological devastation. They hired a criminal named False-Face to smuggle the virus from Saint Denis into Gotham City, and then broke into Gotham Plastics, where they planned to coat millions of cred-cards with the virus, thus transmitting it by hand-to- hand contact. In case that plan failed or the government resisted their demands, Kobra secretly turned False-Face into a virus carrier. Kobra planned to demand a ransom of 10 billion credits. Their actions were eventually intercepted by the NSA that had enlisted Stalker to track down and retrieve the virus. Kobra's plans were foiled by an unlikely alliance between Stalker and Batman. : In \\"Curse of the Kobra\\", it is revealed that despite having a resolute goal, Kobra lacked cohesive leadership. Therefore, they decided to genetically engineer the perfect Kobra leader, and so in the long run, they created Zander (voiced by Alexis Denisof) to be their leader. They carefully monitored and controlled his gestation to create a healthy and resilient makeup. Right from early infancy, Kobra started to groom Zander to become the perfect leader, educating and training him in military strategies and tactics. When Zander finally reached adolescence and was ready to assume his leadership, Kobra could finally move on with their main plan. They stole a vial from Dr. Padu Banjahri, a paleontologist who had been recovering dinosaur DNA, and used its contents to help splice their lackeys into dinosaur hybrids. However, there was still the problem of adaptability: Dinosaurs were cold- blooded, so they could only survive in a tropical environment. In order to raise the planet's temperature, Kobra had stolen the R12 thermal bomb from the Nova Research Center. They planned to plunge it into a dormant volcano standing on a rift that went down to the Earth's core. This would start a chain reaction that would raise the temperature of the whole planet. However, thanks to the combined efforts of Batman, Max and Kairi Tanaga (Zander's martial arts teacher and a former fellow student of Bruce Wayne's own sensei), Kobra's supreme goal was brought to naught, and in the process they lost their perfect leader. * The version of Kobra seen in Batman Beyond appears in an episode of Static Shock. In \\"Future Shock\\", Kobra carried on with their tactics, and eventually acquired another leader (voiced by Lance Henriksen). They also secretly moved into a location known as Platform 247, and used it as their new headquarters. In an undocumented occurrence, the police arrested the unnamed Kobra Leader. Thus, Kobra designed a plan to capture Static and then negotiate a trade. They forged a holographic message from Static's friend Gear to lure Static to Platform 247, where he was ambushed, subdued and imprisoned in a stasis field. The negotiation, however, was never in Kobra's plans, as they never truly intended to give up the captive hero. It was but a ruse to provide their leader with an escape opportunity, while he was being transported to the exchange. After breaking out, Kobra Leader headed off to Kobra's headquarters to kill Static. However, Batman and Static's younger self broke in and took on Kobra's Leader and his soldiers. Static released his older self from the stasis field, who single-handedly defeated a battalion of Kobra worshipers with a single jolt. Kobra's fate afterward remains unknown. * The Kobra organization appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster\\" with the Kobra Leader voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. They are shown to be a cult where they had planned to sacrifice a woman in order to prepare for their world domination only to run afoul of Batman and the Outsiders (consisting of Black Lightning, Katana, Metamorpho, Geo-Force, and Halo). Though they managed to defeat Kobra and save the woman, Batman learned the Outsiders forgot to blow up the bridge that was to prevent other Kobra soldiers from arriving. * The first King Cobra appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold in episode \\"A Bat Divided!\\" and \\"Joker: The Vile and the Villainous!\\" and appears in the film Scooby-Doo and Batman: The Brave and the Bold as cameos. * The Jeffrey Burr version of Kobra (alongside his cult) appears in the Young Justice episode \\"Drop Zone\\", voiced by Arnold Vosloo. He and his cult are in conflict with Bane over the production of the drug Venom and ultimately revealed to be combining it with the Blockbuster Formula to create a more powerful and permanent transformation for the Light. With the inclusion of some unnamed members, Kobra is served by Mammoth (who was created from the Venom/Blockbuster formula) and Shimmer. He and his cult ended up fighting Bane and Young Justice at the time when the Light's operative Sportsmaster came to pick up the formulas. He does fight Robin in the climax of the episode, but manages to get away. In the second season, which takes place five years after the first season, Queen Bee has the cult under her control leaving Kobra's fate unknown. * Jason Burr appears in the Beware the Batman episode \\"Safe\\", voiced by Matthew Lillard. He is depicted as the inventor of the Ion Cortex that would help with the world's power. Batman had to protect him when the League of Assassins targeted him so that they can get the Ion Cortex. Tatsu Yamashiro worked to protect Jason Burr from Silver Monkey. Though Jason Burr did grow attached to her to the point where he tended to her wounds after Batman repelled Silver Monkey. After Silver Monkey's mission was a failure, Lady Shiva told Silver Monkey not to go after Jason Burr again for they will obtain the Ion Cortex another way. : In \\"Control\\", Jason Burr invites Katana on a date at the time when Cypher is sent by the League of Assassins in their next attempt to control the Ion Cortex. Cypher ends up controlling Jason Burr and Katana when it comes to fighting Batman. During the fight on the subway where Batman disconnects the cars, Batman damages the controls to the subway which causes Cypher to break his control over Katana. With help from Katana, Batman is able to free Jason and defeat Cypher. Jason Burr is later seen recuperating in the hospital where part of Cypher's control is still in Jason. : In \\"Instinct\\", Jason Burr analyzes the residue that Katana gave him had contained the phosphorus of African Toads which explodes upon heat where the residue was planning to be used by Professor Pyg and Mister Toad to bomb the yacht. After a call from Katana, Jason is shown to still be controlled by the League of Assassins as he speaks with Lady Shiva. : In \\"Fall\\", Jason finishes the Ion Cortex and is ready to hand it over to the League of Assassins. He also bombs his lab in an attempt to kill Bruce Wayne and Tatsu, but fails. Batman and Katana track Jason down to a secret lair, where he confronts them. Tatsu frees him from Cypher's control once more, and he attempts to help them shut down the Cortex. However, Lady Shiva uses the Soultaker Sword on him before he is able to finish. * In the seventh season of Arrow, Kobra is mentioned as one of the terrorist cells that the Ninth Circle's financier Dante has been in contact with. ===Film=== Jeffrey Burr will appear in the animated film Batman: Soul of the Dragon, voiced by Josh Keaton.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat- vision/batman-soul-dragon-sets-voice-cast-1306722 ===Web series=== An alternate version of Kobra appears in Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles (a companion to Justice League: Gods and Monsters), voiced by Bruce Thomas. ===Miscellaneous=== Kobra appears in issue #16 of the comic book tie- in to Young Justice. He plotted to perform a ritual on his twin brother Dr. Jason Burr by having Mammoth and Shimmer abduct him. The ritual was crashed by Batman, Flash, Green Arrow, and their prot√©g√©s. In issue #17, Kobra had to prick his brother's finger in order to step up the ritual despite the interference. After feeding some of Jason's blood to a snake, Kobra drank the Blockbuster formula and some of the blood in order to finish the ritual. Jason was absorbed into the dagger as Kobra gains snake-like abilities. After the mutated Kobra was pricked with the dagger, the mutation was undone and Jason Burr was restored. Unfortunately, Kobra was nowhere to be seen. ==References * Kobra at the DCU Guide * Kobra at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. from the original on December 2, 2015. * Strike Force Kobra at DC Comics Wiki * Strike Force Kobra at Comic Vine * Strike Force Kobra at Angelfire Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976 Category:1976 comics debuts Category:Comic book terrorist organizations Category:DC Comics supervillain teams Category:DC Comics titles Category:Fictional cults Category:Fictional cult leaders Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional organized crime groups Category:Fictional scientists Category:Fictional twins Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby Category:Supervillains with their own comic book titles ","title":"Kobra (DC Comics)"},{"id":"2216004","text":"Michael L. Sorce (born September 18, 1958), better known by his stage name Don Geronimo, is a former American radio personality formerly featured on the nationally syndicated radio talk show Don and Mike Show. ==Career== Geronimo began his career in radio at the age of 13 when he went to work at Rockville, Maryland AM station WINX (now WLXE, a Spanish-language music station). He continued working at a variety of local stations, being fired at each for lacking the required FCC broadcaster's license, before forging a license. Geronimo landed what was then his dream job at WLS-FM in Chicago, Illinois in the early 1980s. He then moved to WBBM-FM (B96) to do the evening show. Eventually, he replaced Dick Biondi doing morning drive at the same station. Geronimo returned to the Washington, D.C. area in 1985, doing afternoons at WAVA-FM. He moved to mornings in 1986, replacing Charlie & Harrigan. His partnership with Mike O'Meara, co-host of the Don and Mike Show, was forged at WAVA. Their show moved to WJFK-FM in 1991. Washington Post radio reporter Marc Fisher features Geronimo in his book Something in the Air, on the rise and fall of radio in the United States. Fisher also conducted an interview with Geronimo prior to his first of three retirements, the first from The Don & Mike Show in 2008, during which Don spoke out about his frustration with the direction radio has taken following high profile decency events such as the Janet Jackson Super Bowl incident. After only two months in retirement, Geronimo announced that he would return to the air on WOCM, a small, independently owned radio station in Ocean City, Maryland. Don Geronimo's Rockin' Soul Show featured popular music from the '70s and '80s. Geronimo described the show as \\"music that doesn't suck\\". After one month on the air at WOCM, Geronimo was fired from the station over creative differences. Don subsequently hosted a mid-morning talk show on WGMD (92.7 FM Rehoboth Beach, Delaware) from June 22, 2009 to October 13, 2009, when he retired for his second time, although he did some fill-in work at Classic Hits WCBS-FM in New York a few days in late November and December 2009. Don Geronimo was named midday host of 1140 The Fan 1140 KHTK (AM), Sacramento effective on Monday, June 21, 2010. The four-hour program was scheduled Monday through Friday, noon to 4 pm local time. On January 27, Geronimo announced that he would be a regular on the TV show Good Day Sacramento, with his first appearance on February 14, 2011. On May 9, 2011, Geronimo announced that his contract with CBS was extended through 2014 and he was named Program Director for 1140 The Fan KHTK. As of July 11, 2011, Geronimo's show moved to the morning drive, 5:30‚Äì10 am local time after the \\"Rise Guys\\" left for a gig in San Francisco. At the same time, Don also ended his in-studio presence on Good Day Sacramento. He now occasionally contributes to GDS remotely via camera.'Rise Guys' leave KHTK for S.F. station - Sacramento Living - Sacramento Food and Wine, Home, Health  Sacramento Bee On July 8, 2013, Geronimo's show moved to the midday slot on KHTK and can now be heard from noon to 3:00 pm local time. As of Friday October 4, 2013, The Don Geronimo Show has been replaced by the Jason Ross show on CBS Sports Radio 1140 KHTK. A caller asked what happened, and Jason Ross simply explained, \\"CBS Sports Radio decided to go in another direction, which is sports. Don Geronimo is still employed by CBS Sports Radio.\\" On October 16, 2013, Don went on the air on KHTK in Sacramento to thank those who supported him during his time in Sacramento. He said he was going to be doing a new project with CBS in the near future and it would be announced via his Twitter feed. On October 23, Don appeared on 106.7 The Fan's Lavar and Dukes show to announce his return to the station after five years, where he would appear weekdays from 7‚Äì10 p.m. local time, Saturdays from 9 a.m.‚Äìnoon local time, and during Washington Redskins pre/post game shows as well. On March 1, 2014, Geronimo stated that he would no longer be heard on WJFK anymore. He announced on his Twitter feed that \\"No one should be shocked I'm not in the plans for CBS/DC. I had opined recently on air how I didn't understand the logic. Now 30 more days.\\" ===Radio history=== Don has worked at the following stations: {  + - ! Number !! Date !! Station !!

In November and December 2009, Geronimo filled shifts on WCBS-FM in New York City. ===Acting=== Don has appeared in The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., Babylon 5 and The King of Queens. He is a member of the Screen Actors Guild. He has stated on several occasions on the Don and Mike Show that he and his partner at that time, Mike O'Meara, spoke without authorization during their Babylon 5 taping, which was supposed to have been a non-speaking role for each. Rather than re-shoot the scene, the show's producers arranged for their union memberships. This paved the way for a speaking role on The King of Queens, where he spoke one line, \\"Lookin' good, Heffernan!\\" He has also co- hosted with Marty Bass post-game coverage of the Baltimore Ravens games for WJZ-TV (Channel 13). ==Personal lifeFamily=== Don married Janet Sorce on March 21, 2009 TV Announcement and has one son (Bart Sorce) and one daughter (Amy) from previous marriages. Don's first wife, Freda, died on July 10, 2005 in an automobile accident on Maryland Route 90 near Ocean City, Maryland, where the Sorces had their vacation home. Freda was a frequent contributor to the Don and Mike Show and her spirited interaction with Don was an integral part of the program. Following her death, Don took a hiatus from the show until August 1, 2005, when he returned to the air with an emotional solo broadcast. On Friday, October 22, 2010, during the Don Geronimo live stage show Don slipped and fell off the stage. Don suffered head trauma and was admitted to a local hospital and later transferred to ICU.Radio Ink Magazine ===Controversy=== In 1994, Geronimo and his then radio partner Mike O'Meara were sued for $35 million by an anonymous University of Maryland student who claimed the pair had violated her privacy and inflicted emotional distress. In May 2007, a Leesburg, Virginia man named Carl Grossman, who had once been a frequent caller to the Don and Mike Show, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of stalking. Geronimo had received a letter from the man which contained threats to Geronimo and his family. The judge also issued a lifetime restraining order in the case. ===Retirement and return=== On February 4, 2008, Don announced his retirement from his radio show to pursue his personal life for a while. His last appearance on the Don and Mike Show was Friday, April 11, 2008 with Mike O'Meara to continue the show after that (as the Mike O'Meara Show). Don was widely expected to return to radio in some form in the future. After only two months in retirement, Geronimo announced that he would return to the air on WOCM, a small, independently owned radio station in Ocean City, Maryland. Don Geronimo's Rockin' Soul Show aired weekdays from 1 pm - 3pm featuring popular music from the 1970s and 1980s. After four weeks, Geronimo left the station. In May 2010, Geronimo announced that beginning June 21, he would be returning to KHTK, a station which formerly syndicated the Don and Mike Show, to host a mid-day show. As of Friday October 4, 2013, The Don Geronimo Show was replaced by the Jason Ross show on CBS Sports Radio 1140 KHTK. Geronimo would return to the airwaves several days later to explain that KHTK decided to go with all sports programming, but that he would return to a CBS Radio station soon. Don Geronimo returned to WJFK-FM on October 24, 2013. His sports-oriented show aired weekdays from 7-10pm and on Saturdays from 9:00am to noon. Initially, he broadcast the show from a studio at CBS Radio's main building in Sacramento at Commerce Circle, then from a studio at his home in Sacramento when CBS internal politics prevented the show from being done at the company's building. Co-hosts for the show were located at WJFK's studios in Lanham, Maryland. While it was intended that Geronimo would move to the Washington area to do the show live at WJFK's studios, this never materialized after frequent preemptions and schedule changes. Geronimo announced on his Twitter feed on March 1, 2014 that he would no longer be heard on WJFK. His last show had been broadcast on February 26, 2014.

He was the son of John Beaumont, 1st Viscount Beaumont and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Phelip. He was born at Edenham, Lincolnshire. Although his exact date of birth is not recorded, parish records show the date of his baptism as 23 April 1438. ==Wars of the Roses== Sir William led an uneventful life until the feud between the houses of York and Lancaster broke into open bloodshed. While he always claimed in life \\"...to let each man place his feet in the soil as the good lord intended...\\"()), he ultimately sided with the Lancastrians. ===Battles and land issues=== He fought in several of the major battles of the Wars of the Roses. He was probably knighted before the Battle of Northampton, where his father was killed. He fought at the Battle of Towton, the bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil, but was taken prisoner and attainted along with other prominent Lancastrian lords. Beaumont obtained a general pardon two days before Christmas, but all his lands were declared forfeit and granted to Lord Hastings. This action erected a permanent barrier to any reconciliation with King Edward. After the restoration of Henry VI in November 1470, King Henry revoked the bill of attainder and restored Sir William's lands and titles. However, the following March, he opposed Edward's landing at Ravenspur. He joined forces with the Duke of Exeter, but they were too weak and were forced to stand aside at Newark and allow Edward to march south to London. Beaumont fought under Oxford at the Battle of Barnet, but suspecting treachery, they fled. With the Yorkist Edward IV on the throne again, Beaumont was once more stripped of his lands and titles. Between 1471 and 1474, he was continually at war, holding (amongst other bastions), St Michael's Mount along with John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, for the Lancastrians in 1473. However, misfortune continued to dog Sir William, and in 1474, he was taken prisoner and imprisoned at Hammes. Released by Sir James Blount, he landed at Milford Haven with Henry Tudor and fought against Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485. Sir William's lands and titles were restored (for the second time) by act of Parliament on 7 November 1485. ===Mental illness=== By 1487, Beaumont was reported to be incapacitated by mental illness. Parliament ruled that he no longer had \\"sadness [seriousness] or discretion to rule and keep\\" his estates, and gave Beaumont's former comrade-in-arms John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford control of Beaumont's lands during his lifetime. He and his family lived in the care of his friend for his remaining years. The precise nature of Beaumont's mental illness is not known, but two sources suggest that he was not completely incapacitated. He was witness to a bond in 1488, which suggests he was capable of lucidity at that time. In 1498, an inscription written in his name bequeathed a book to his wife.James Ross, The Foremost Man of the Kingdom: John de Vere, Thirteenth Earl of Oxford (1442-1513), Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2015, p.96. He died on 19 December 1507, aged 69, at Oxford's home at Wivenhoe, where he is buried. His widow later married Oxford. The Beaumonts were one of only seven great families who remained irreconcilably anti-Yorkist throughout the Wars of the Roses. ==Family== Beaumont married firstly on 6 August 1462, Joan daughter of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham. This marriage was set aside before 1477. He married secondly Elizabeth Scrope, daughter and coheir of Sir Richard Scrope, the second son of Henry Scrope, 4th Baron Scrope of Bolton, by Eleanor, the daughter of Norman Washbourne.. At least one child was born to his mistress Jayne Stephens circa 1459, by the name of John Francis Beaumont. Whilst Sir William never recognised the child as his heir, he did provide for the child's education and welfare. Upon the death of Sir William, the Viscountcy of Beaumont became extinct in both England and France and due to discord and fighting between his great-nephews, the title fell into abeyance. ==NotesReferences== * * * Category:1438 births Category:1507 deaths Category:People from Edenham Category:People of the Wars of the Roses Category:English knights Category:15th-century English people Category:16th- century English nobility Category:Viscounts Beaumont Category:Barons Beaumont ","title":"William Beaumont, 2nd Viscount Beaumont"},{"id":"2216015","text":"League for Socialist Reconstruction (LSR) was a DeLeonist political organization with sections in New York City and Michigan.

The reaction product is usually a nucleus in an excited state which immediately decays, emitting ionizing radiation. To obtain depth information the initial kinetic energy of the projectile nucleus (which has to exceed the resonance energy) and its stopping power (energy loss per distance traveled) in the sample has to be known. To contribute to the nuclear reaction the projectile nuclei have to slow down in the sample to reach the resonance energy. Thus each initial kinetic energy corresponds to a depth in the sample where the reaction occurs (the higher the energy, the deeper the reaction). ==NRA profiling of hydrogen== For example, a commonly used reaction to profile hydrogen with an energetic 15N ion beam is :15N + 1H -> 12C + Œ± \\\\+ Œ≥ (4.43 MeV) with a sharp resonance in the reaction cross section at 6.385 MeV of only 1.8 keV . Since the incident 15N ion loses energy along its trajectory in the material it must have an energy higher than the resonance energy to induce the nuclear reaction with hydrogen nuclei deeper in the target. This reaction is usually written 1H(15N,Œ±Œ≥)12C.https://www.tandemlab.uu.se/infrastructure/Accelerators/pelletron/t1/ It is inelastic because the Q-value is not zero (in this case it is 4.965 MeV). Rutherford backscattering (RBS) reactions are elastic (Q = 0), and the interaction (scattering) cross-section œÉ given by the famous formula derived by Lord Rutherford in 1911. But non-Rutherford cross-sections (so-called EBS, elastic backscattering spectrometry) can also be resonant: for example, the 16O(Œ±,Œ±)16O reaction has a strong and very useful resonance at 3038.1 ¬± 1.3 keV. In the 1H(15N,Œ±Œ≥)12C reaction (or indeed the 15N(p,Œ±Œ≥)12C inverse reaction), the energetic emitted Œ≥ ray is characteristic of the reaction and the number that are detected at any incident energy is proportional to the hydrogen concentration at the respective depth in the sample. Due to the narrow peak in the reaction cross section primarily ions of the resonance energy undergo a nuclear reaction. Thus, information on the hydrogen distribution can be straight forward obtained by varying the 15N incident beam energy. Hydrogen is an element inaccessible to Rutherford backscattering spectrometry since nothing can backscatter from H (since all atoms are heavier than hydrogen!). But it is often analysed by elastic recoil detection. ==Non- resonant NRA== NRA can also be used non-resonantly (of course, RBS is non- resonant). For example, deuterium can easily be profiled with a 3He beam without changing the incident energy by using the :3He + D = Œ± \\\\+ p + 18.353 MeV reaction, usually written 2H(3He,p)Œ±. The energy of the fast proton detected depends on the depth of the deuterium atom in the sample. ==See also== * Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) ==References * Details of many known reactions are hosted by the IAEA at http://www-nds.iaea.org/ibandl/. * The energy released in nuclear reactions (the \\"Q value\\") can easily be calculated (from E=mc2): see http://nucleardata.nuclear.lu.se/database/masses/. * NRA at JSI Microanalytical center in Ljubljana, Slovenia Category:Materials science ","title":"Nuclear reaction analysis"},{"id":"2216051","text":"The IX Waffen Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian) (), later simply IX SS Mountain Corps, was a German Waffen-SS alpine corps which saw action on the Eastern Front during World War II. ==History== The IX Waffen Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian) was raised on 21 June 1944 in B√°csalm√°s, Hungary as a command formation for the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) and the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian) under the command of SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig. The 13th SS Division was not initially transferred to the corps, being involved in fighting against Yugoslav Partisans in the Independent State of Croatia. In August, due to high rates of desertion from 13th SS Division, Sauberzweig proposed to disarm the Bosnians in both 13th SS Division and 23rd SS Division, but Heinrich Himmler instead opted to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of 23rd SS Division from Hungary to Bosnia and re-organise the remaining troops of both divisions there, with key support units from 13th SS Division centralised under IX SS Mountain Corps, which would also move to Bosnia from Hungary. By September 1944, the Red Army had advanced to the border of Hungary, which placed the corps training area close to the front lines. Kama was not ready for combat and was disbanded; its volunteers went to strengthen the Handschar and the 31st SS Panzergrenadier Division. In mid-September, the corps was strengthened by several combat divisions, including the Handschar and went into action against Yugoslav partisans. In October, the corps was moved to the frontline in Hungary, where it took command of four combat divisions, the 13th Panzer Division, 60th Panzergrenadier Division Feldherrnhalle, 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer and the 22nd SS Cavalry Division Maria Theresa. All these divisions had been involved in the recent heavy fighting around Debrecen. Between them, the divisions barely had 60 tanks. As all subordinate units were now Germanic, the corps was redesignated as IX SS Mountain Corps. The renamed corps was ordered to form a part of the 6th Army, defending the approaches to Budapest. On 24 November 1944, the corps staff arrived in Budapest, the combat divisions already in action against the advancing Soviet forces. After a month's heavy fighting, the corps was encircled in the city. The corps was placed in command of all encircled German units, and Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch was placed in command. Having spent his career as a police commander, Pfeffer-Wildenbruch lacked even a basic military understanding, and as the 6th Army commander Hermann Balck said \\"At best, one could say that Budapest was being led by a politician\\". Pfeffer-Wildenbruch established his corps command centre on Castle Hill, in the centre of the Hungarian Government District, and ordered the encircled forces to attempt breakouts, which they were unable to accomplish. A rescue effort was being assembled by Balck's army group. On 1 January 1945, the IV SS Panzer Corps launched Operation Konrad I, the first in a series of relief attempts. After initial gains, the assault stalled. Konrad II followed, which reached to within sight of the city before being halted by stubborn Soviet defence. By 17 January, the remainder of the corps along with the Hungarian I Corps, commanded by General Iv√°n Hindy, were evacuated across the Danube to Buda. The final relief effort, Konrad III, was halted on 28 January. By this stage, the axis forces in Buda had been pushed into a one square kilometer pocket. On 11 February 1945, the corps was ordered to attempt a breakout. Only 785 troops were able to reach German lines, including 170 Waffen-SS men. On 12 February, the remainder of the corps was destroyed, with small groups of men, including Pfeffer-Wildenbruch and his staff, surrendering to the Soviet forces. ==Commanders== * SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig (21 June 1944 ‚Äì ?

Malice is either expressed or implied. Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to unlawfully take away the life of a human being. Malice is implied when no considerable provocation appears, or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.Cal. Pen. Code ¬ß 188. Malice, in a legal sense, may be inferred from the evidence and imputed to the defendant, depending on the nature of the case. In many kinds of cases, malice must be found to exist in order to convict. (For example, malice is an element of the crime of arson in many jurisdictions.) In civil law cases, a finding of malice allows for the award of greater damages, or for punitive damages. The legal concept of malice is most common in Anglo- American law, and in legal systems derived from the English common law system. In English civil law (being the law of England and Wales), relevant case law in negligence and misfeasance in a public office includes Dunlop v. Woollahra Municipal Council [1982] A.C. 158; Bourgoin S.A. v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [1986] Q.B. 716; Jones v Swansea City Council [1990] 1 WLR 1453; Three Rivers District Council and Others v Governor and Company of The Bank of England, [2000]Parliament.the-stationary-office.co.uk and Elguzouli- Daf v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1995] 2 QB 335, in which Steyn LJ. found that malice could be made out if the acts were done with an actual intention to cause injury. Malice could be shown if the acts were done in the knowledge of invalidity or lack of power and with knowledge that it would cause or be likely to cause injury. Malice would also exist if the acts were done with reckless indifference or deliberate blindness to that invalidity or lack of power and that likely injury. These elements, with respect, are consistent with the views of the majority albeit that some of those views were expressed tentatively having regard to the basis upon which the case before them was presented. In English criminal law on mens rea (Latin for \\"guilty mind\\"), R v. Cunningham (1957) 2 AER 412 was the pivotal case in establishing both that the test for \\"maliciously\\" was subjective rather than objective, and that malice was inevitably linked to recklessness. In that case, a man released gas from the mains into adjoining houses while attempting to steal money from the pay-meter: > In any statutory definition of a crime, malice must be taken ... as > requiring either: # an actual intention to do the particular kind of harm > that in fact was done; or # recklessness as to whether such harm should > occur or not (i.e. the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm > might be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it). Lord Diplock confirmed the relationship to recklessness in R v Mowatt (1968) 1 QB 421: > In the offence under section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, > the word \\"maliciously\\" does import upon the part of the person who > unlawfully inflicts the wound or other grievous bodily harm an awareness > that his act may have the consequence of causing some physical harm to some > other person ... It is quite unnecessary that the accused should have > foreseen that his unlawful act might cause physical harm of the gravity > described in the section, i.e. a wound or serious physical injury. It is > enough that he should have foreseen that some physical harm to some person, > albeit of a minor character, might result. In the United States, the malice standard was set in the Supreme Court case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, allowing free reporting of the civil rights movement. The malice standard decides whether press reports about a public figure can be considered defamation or libel. ==See also== *Malice murder ==References== Category:Legal terminology Category:Intention ","title":"Malice (law)"},{"id":"2216055","text":"Malice is a 1993 neo-noir thriller film directed by Harold Becker, written by Aaron Sorkin and Scott Frank, and starring Alec Baldwin, Nicole Kidman, Bill Pullman, Anne Bancroft and George C. Scott. Adapted from a story by Jonas McCord, the plot follows Andy and Tracy Safian, a newlywed couple whose lives are upturned after they rent part of their Victorian home to Jed, a cavalier surgeon; things are further complicated when he removes Tracy's ovaries during an emergency surgery to save her life. The film features supporting performances from Bebe Neuwirth, Peter Gallagher, and Tobin Bell, with minor appearances from Gwyneth Paltrow and Brenda Strong. Released in the fall of 1993, Malice grossed a total of $46 million in the United States. ==Plot== Andy and Tracy Safian are a newlywed couple living in a Victorian house that they are restoring in Western Massachusetts. He is an Associate Dean at a local women's college, while his wife teaches art to children. When a student is attacked and seriously wounded by a serial rapist, Dr. Jed Hill, a brilliant surgeon who has recently joined the staff of the area hospital, operates and saves her life. Money is tight, so Andy invites him to rent the third floor of their home, in order to finance the new plumbing. With his propensity to bring home sexual partners and to party late into the night, Jed quickly proves himself to be a less-than-ideal tenant. When Paula Bell, one of Andy's students, is attacked and killed by the serial rapist, Andy is the one to find her body, prompting police detective Dana Harris to view him as a possible suspect. Harris asks Andy to come to the police station and submit a semen sample in order to clear his name. While at the police station, Andy learns that Tracy has been hospitalized and is being operated on by Jed. In removing one of Tracy's ovaries, which has ruptured due to a cyst, Jed discovers Tracy is pregnant, but the stress of the procedure causes the fetus to abort. Another doctor notices that Tracy's other ovary is torsed and appears necrotic. Jed consults with Andy and advises him to agree to the removal of Tracy's second ovary, rather than risk her life. Andy painfully agrees, since this will mean that Tracy can never have children. Jed overrules the protests of other doctors that the ovary might still be healthy and he removes it. After the removal, it is confirmed that the ovary was, in fact, healthy. Tracy tells Jed she's suing him for malpractice. Jed delivers a deposition in which he launches into a monologue about his own infallibility as a surgeon, concluding with the assertion that he is literally God. Fearful of the negative publicity that would result from a civil trial, the hospital and Jed's insurance company settle with Andy and Tracy for $20 million. However, Tracy leaves Andy, telling him that she can't forgive him for the loss of her ability to have children. The serial rapist, a handyman at the college named Earl, is arrested after a struggle with Andy. He had stumbled upon hairs Earl had collected from his victims and kept among his belongings. Andy's name was cleared in the process. In the aftermath of the arrest, Dana informs Andy that his semen sample indicated that he was sterile, and that he couldn't have fathered Tracy's child. Andy confronts Tracy's lawyer, Dennis Riley, accusing him of having impregnated Tracy; Riley protests his innocence, but tells Andy that Tracy's mother ‚Äî whom she had told Andy had died 12 years ago ‚Äî can answer all of his questions. Riley refuses to break lawyer-client privilege, but tells Andy to take a bottle of Scotch to her. Andy tracks down Mrs. Kennsinger, who tells Andy that Tracy is a lifelong con artist. As a younger woman, she had an affair with a wealthy man, who paid for her to have an abortion; Tracy kept the money and had it done at a clinic, beginning her career as a con woman. Andy ultimately learns that Tracy arranged for Jed to move into the house so that he could begin overdosing her with a fertility drug which causes ovarian cysts when taken in excess amounts, revealing the real reason why Tracy left Andy for Jed. An angry Andy confronts Tracy and tells her he wants half of the settlement money. Suspecting that she might try to murder him, Andy implies their next-door neighbor, the ten-year-old boy who's been their seeming voyeur, is named in his will as a potential police witness to her and Jed's nefarious activities. Supported by Andy's suggestion, Jed tells Tracy to give Andy what he wants so they can leave the country, but Tracy instead suggests murdering the boy. Jed refuses to kill a child, so Tracy shoots him to death, ending their partnership. That night, with the money about to be given to Andy, she slips into the neighbor's house and attempts to suffocate the boy, only to see that the figure she had seen sitting by his bedroom window was in fact a CPR dummy. Tracy destroys the dummy and lunges at Andy, claiming that it was a set-up. Detective Harris appears and arrests her, revealing that the boy's supposed agreement to testify against her was part of a sting operation to catch her in the act of attempted murder. As Tracy is led away in handcuffs, the real boy and his mother return home; as she is put into the police car, Tracy sees that the boy is, in fact, blind. Andy leaves with Dana to have a drink of Scotch. ==CastProduction== Malice was shot on location in Boston, Amherst, Holyoke, and Northampton in Massachusetts. Smith College was the setting used for Andy's college. Michael Hirsh and Patrick Loubert, two of the co-founders of Canadian animation studio Nelvana, worked as executive producers on the film. ==Release== Malice had its world premiere in Los Angeles on September 29, 1993, and opened on 1,431 screens in the U.S. on October 1, 1993 and grossed $9,232,650 during its opening weekend, ranking #1 at the box office. It eventually earned a total of $46,405,336 in the U.S. ==Critical reception== Malice earned mixed reviews from critics, holding a 57% approval rating on the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \\"one of the busiest movies I've ever seen, a film jampacked with characters and incidents and blind alleys and red herrings. Offhand, this is the only movie I can recall in which an entire subplot about a serial killer is thrown in simply for atmosphere.\\" He added, \\"I can't go into detail without revealing vital secrets. Yet after the movie is over and you try to think through those secrets, you get into really deep molasses . . . Malice was directed by Harold Becker, whose credits include the splendid films The Onion Field and Sea of Love, and he milks this material for a great deal more than it is worth.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone observed, \\"Goaded on by writer Aaron Sorkin, who could run a red-herring factory, the actors work to keep you guessing long after you've caught on. No one shows any shame about going over the top, especially Anne Bancroft in an Oscar-begging cameo as Tracy's mother. Perhaps director Harold Becker thought flashy acting could distract us from the gaping plot holes. Becker gets so intent on confusing us, he forgets to give us characters to care about . . . It's got suspense but no staying power.\\" Timothy M. Gray of Variety said, \\"The immaculately crafted Malice is a virtual scrapbook of elements borrowed from other suspense pix, but no less enjoyable for being so familiar. [It] should tickle audiences who want to be entertained without being challenged . . . Some of the plotting gets plodding . . . but on the whole, the script does what it set out to do, and if the filmmakers didn't worry about these things, neither should you . . . After listless performances in such pics as Days of Thunder and Far and Away, Aussie Kidman, who here uses a flawless American accent, proves her strengths as an actress, and Baldwin mixes menace, sex and humor in another terrific performance.\\" ==Cultural impact and references== In the 30 Rock episode \\"St. Valentine's Day\\", Jack Donaghy, portrayed by Baldwin, confesses to a priest that he once said \\"I am God\\" during a deposition. This is a reference to a famous line by Jed Hill, Baldwin's character in this film. In the episode \\"Terms of Endearment\\" of the animated television series Drawn Together, the character Wooldoor Sockbat recites the closing lines of Baldwin's speech verbatim. ==See also== * List of films featuring home invasions ==ReferencesWorks cited== * ==External links== * * Category:1993 films Category:1990s psychological thriller films Category:1990s thriller drama films Category:American films Category:God complexes in fiction Category:American thriller drama films Category:Canadian thriller drama films Category:Castle Rock Entertainment films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith Category:Films about con artists Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films directed by Harold Becker Category:Films set in Massachusetts Category:Nelvana films Category:New Line Cinema films Category:American neo-noir films Category:Home invasions in film Category:Films with screenplays by Aaron Sorkin Category:Films with screenplays by Scott Frank Category:American serial killer films Category:1993 drama films Category:Canadian films ","title":"Malice (1993 film)"},{"id":"2216056","text":"The Scream was an American, Los Angeles, California-based hard rock band, originally formed in 1989 as Saints Or Sinners. The band originally featured former Angora singer John Corabi and former Racer X members guitarist Bruce Bouillet, bassist Juan Alderete, and drummer Scott Travis. However, Scott Travis quickly left to join Judas Priest, and was replaced by former Shark Island drummer Walt Woodward III. Scott Travis co-wrote \\"I Don't Care\\" on Let It Scream, though he did not actually play on the album. They changed their name from Saints Or Sinners to The Scream shortly after Walt Woodward III replaced Scott Travis. Many of the songs on their 1991 debut Let It Scream were performed by the band in concert before the album was ever recorded. After releasing their 1991 debut Let It Scream on Hollywood Records, which included the single \\"I Believe in Me,\\" Corabi left the band to replace the recently departed Vince Neil in M√∂tley Cr√ºe. The Scream then recruited former Dashboard Mary singer Billy Fogarty and recorded their second album, Takin' It To The Next Level, but were dropped from the record label before the album could be released. The Scream split up and Fogarty, Bouillet and Alderete went on to form a brief musical project with John Moore and drummer Abe Laboriel, Jr. called DC-10, which recorded and released the album Co-Burn. John Corabi joined M√∂tley Cr√ºe after Vince Neil's departure and recorded the self-titled 1994 album with the band. However, poor sales and inadequate tour support resulted in Vince Neil's return to the band. Corabi has played in many bands since, including Ratt, Union and E.S.P., a covers band with other big names Eric Singer, Bruce Kulick, Chuck Garrick and Karl Cochran (often performing many songs from the various members well known bands). Since February 2015, Corabi has joined The Dead Daisies with which he has recorded two studio albums (Revoluci√≥n in 2015, and Make Some Noise in 2016).

It is a particular Dirichlet L-function, the L-function for the alternating character of period four. ==Definition== The Dirichlet beta function is defined as :\\\\beta(s) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^n} {(2n+1)^s}, or, equivalently, :\\\\beta(s) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Gamma(s)}\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{x^{s-1}e^{-x}}{1 + e^{-2x}}\\\\,dx. In each case, it is assumed that Re(s) > 0\\\\. Alternatively, the following definition, in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function, is valid in the whole complex s-plane: :\\\\beta(s) = 4^{-s} \\\\left( \\\\zeta\\\\left(s,{1 \\\\over 4}\\\\right)-\\\\zeta\\\\left( s, {3 \\\\over 4}\\\\right) \\\\right). proof Another equivalent definition, in terms of the Lerch transcendent, is: :\\\\beta(s) = 2^{-s} \\\\Phi\\\\left(-1,s,{{1} \\\\over {2}}\\\\right), which is once again valid for all complex values of s. Also the series representation of Dirichlet beta function can be formed in terms of the polygamma function :\\\\beta(s) =\\\\frac{1}{2^s} \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{(-1)^{n}}{\\\\left(n+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^{s}}=\\\\frac1{(-2)^{2s}(s-1)!}\\\\left[\\\\psi^{(s-1)}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\right)-\\\\psi^{(s-1)}\\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right]. == Euler product formula == It is also the simplest example of a series non- directly related to \\\\zeta(s) which can also be factorized as an Euler product, thus leading to the idea of Dirichlet character defining the exact set of Dirichlet series having a factorization over the prime numbers. At least for Re(s) ‚â• 1: : \\\\beta(s) = \\\\prod_{p \\\\equiv 1 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{mod} \\\\ 4} \\\\frac{1}{1 - p^{-s}} \\\\prod_{p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{mod} \\\\ 4} \\\\frac{1}{1 + p^{-s}} where are the primes of the form (5,13,17,...) and are the primes of the form (3,7,11,...). This can be written compactly as :\\\\beta(s) = \\\\prod_{p>2\\\\atop p \\\\text{ prime}} \\\\frac{1}{1 -\\\\, \\\\scriptstyle(-1)^{\\\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\\\textstyle p^{-s}}. ==Functional equation== The functional equation extends the beta function to the left side of the complex plane Re(s) ‚â§ 0. It is given by :\\\\beta(1-s)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\right)^{-s}\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}s\\\\right)\\\\Gamma(s)\\\\beta(s) where Œì(s) is the gamma function. ==Special values== Some special values include: :\\\\beta(0)= \\\\frac{1}{2}, :\\\\beta(1)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\arctan(1)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}, :\\\\beta(2)\\\\;=\\\\;G, where G represents Catalan's constant, and :\\\\beta(3)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\frac{\\\\pi^3}{32}, :\\\\beta(4)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\frac{1}{768}\\\\left(\\\\psi_3\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\right)-8\\\\pi^4\\\\right), :\\\\beta(5)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\frac{5\\\\pi^5}{1536}, :\\\\beta(7)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\frac{61\\\\pi^7}{184320}, where \\\\psi_3(1/4) in the above is an example of the polygamma function. More generally, for any positive integer k: :\\\\beta(2k+1)={{{({-1})^k}{E_{2k}}{\\\\pi^{2k+1}} \\\\over {4^{k+1}}(2k)!}}, where \\\\\\\\!\\\\ E_{n} represent the Euler numbers. For integer k ‚â• 0, this extends to: :\\\\beta(-k)={{E_{k}} \\\\over {2}}. Hence, the function vanishes for all odd negative integral values of the argument.

Poland is Europe's third largest beer producer, producing 36.9 million hectolitres, coming after the United Kingdom with 49.5 million hl and neighboring Germany with 103 million hl. Following the Second World War, most breweries were nationalized by the Communist Government of the Polish People's Republic. After the collapse of communism and return to capitalism, the market economy returned, international beer companies moved in and a period of consolidation followed. Three companies now control 80% of the Polish beer market (according to data at the end of 2014). At the end of 2013, there were 97 breweries in Poland, including microbreweries and contracted breweries. The most popular Polish beers are ≈ªywiec, Okocim and Tyskie. Beer from small regional breweries, grouped in the Association of Polish Regional Breweries (Stowarzyszenie Regionalnych Browar√≥w Polskich), crafts, contracted breweries and brewpubs has become very popular and desired by consumers. ==Industry== According to a 2009 Ernst & Young report, Poland is Europe's third largest beer producer. Poland produces 36.9 million hectolitres, coming after the UK with 49.5 million hl and Germany with 103 million hl. Following consecutive growth in the home market, ZwiƒÖzek Pracodawc√≥w Przemys≈Çu Piwowarskiego (the Union of the Brewing Industry Employers in Poland), which represents approximately 90% of the Polish beer market, announced during its annual brewing industry conference that consumption of beer in 2008 rose to 94 litres per capita, or 35,624 million hectolitres sold on the domestic market. Statistically, a Polish consumer drinks some 92 litres of beer a year, which places it third behind the Czech Republic and Germany. In 2009, beer sales paid some PLN 3.097 bn in excise taxes to the Polish government. Total employment due to beer production and sales is 207,900. ==Brands and varieties== Bottle cap Polish beer Poland is well known for its beer culture and many varieties. Large breweries are majority owned by multinational companies. However, since 2011, craft beer has become more and more popular each year.

The test is performed by placing the patient in the lateral decubitus position, thereafter the clinician performs a lumbar puncture. The opening pressure is measured. Then, the clinician's assistant compresses both jugular veins (if increased intracranial pressure is not suspected then one may exert pressure on both external jugular veins but usually pressure is first exerted on the abdomen, this pressure causes an engorgement of spinal veins and in turn rapidly increases cerebrospinal fluid pressure), which leads to a rise in the intracranial pressure. Given normal anatomy, the intracranial pressure will be reflected as a rapidly rising pressure measured from the lumbar needle, within 10‚Äì12 seconds. If there is a stenosis in the spine, there will be a damped, delayed response in the lumbar pressure, thus a positive Queckenstedt's maneuver. Nowadays this test has been made mostly superfluous by superior imaging modalities like MRI and CAT.

It was established to monitor the activities of Nazi and pro-Nazi groups in Central and South America. In 1934, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt became concerned about the activities of Nazi groups within the United States. The FBI was ordered to begin investigating these groups operating within the country. The goal of this work was to determine if foreign agents were working within these pro-Nazi groups. In 1940, the government decided to expand the scope of this mission. There were more than 1.5 million expatriate/ethnic Germans living in South America, including Argentina and Brazil. As a result, this area had become an active area of Axis espionage, propaganda and sabotage. In June 1940, Roosevelt ordered the formation of the Special Intelligence Service to monitor these activities.

The organization took some time to become fully operational, due to language and cultural differences, but within a year the SIS had a number of agents in place under various covers. This organization placed more than 340 undercover agents in regions of Latin America. They operated for seven years, and by 1946 a total of 887 Axis spies had been discovered. Also found were 281 agents of Axis propaganda, 222 smugglers shipping important war materials, and more than 100 saboteurs and other operatives. It located 24 secret Axis radio stations and confiscated 40 radio transmitters and 18 receiving sets. Following the war the SIS was disbanded, having been in operation in 1940‚Äì1946. After it was disbanded, its region of operation was incorporated into the responsibilities of the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency.

The Kick.\\" \\"Get it done, and then some,\\" \\"Chug & Charge,\\" and \\"Get to it!\\" == Marketing == Vault was a citrus-flavored beverage containing many of the same ingredients as the Coca-Cola beverage Surge. It was discontinued in 2011 in favor of a reintroduced Mello Yello. Test-marketing occurred in a limited area from June 2005 through Labor Day 2005. During this time, the drink was only available in certain markets in Alabama, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Texas, and West Virginia. Vault was released nationally in February 2006 following commercials that were shown during the pregame show for Super Bowl XL. == Formulation == Coca-Cola representatives and the American Beverage Association stated that Vault contained 47 mg of caffeine per 237 ml (8 fl. oz.) serving, or 70.5 mg per 355 ml (12 fl. oz.) can, and 117.5 mg per 20 fl. oz.

He attended Yale University, where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity, graduating in 1891 with both a Ph.D. and M.A. He returned to Cleveland to pursue a business career in steel and mining, and married Julia Cobb in December 1904. As war loomed, he rose quickly through the ranks of the United States Army Reserve, being made first an honorary major on his entry in 1916, and eventually a brigadier general before being tapped for political positions. During the war he went on to serve as Assistant Secretary of War and Director of Munitions, founded the Army Ordnance Association in 1919, and eventually became a special consultant to the Secretary of War during World War II. He remained influential and active in politics between the wars, serving as a principal framer of the National Defense Act of 1920, and was president of the Army Ordnance Association, a lobbying group, for a quarter of a century.

In the 1920s, his father left the Corriere della Sera and moved to the United States, where he directed the Italian-American newspaper Corriere d'America from 1923 to 1931. After completing his studies in Italy and at Columbia University, Barzini Jr. worked for two New York newspapers, including the New York World. In 1928, together with Richard Washburn Child, former Ambassador to Italy and a supporter of Benito Mussolini, he ghostwrote The Autobiography of Benito Mussolini.D'Agostino, Rome in America, pp. 163‚Äì64 He returned to Italy in 1930 to become a correspondent for Corriere della Sera. His father had pro-Fascist sentiments and had access to highest political circles of Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. Luigi Jr., however, frequently associated with the younger generation of fascists around Galeazzo Ciano, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mussolini's son-in-law. ==Panay incident== As the Corriere della Sera Asian correspondent, he went to China. On 11 December 1937, he was aboard the USS Panay on the Yangtze Patrol in Nanking at the prompting of George Atcheson, a U.S. Embassy official. Also aboard were Universal News cameraman Norman Alley, Movietone News' Eric Mayell, the New York Times's Norman Soong, Collier's Weekly correspondent Jim Marshall, and La Stampa correspondent Sandro Sandri. Atcheson had invited them aboard the Panay so that they could document the fall of the city from relative safety. The four journalists had been covering the ongoing Japanese invasion of China in the mid-1930s, and found themselves in the thick of things in early December 1937 as Japanese forces moved on Nanking.Suddenly and Deliberately Attacked! The Story of the Panay Incident, The USS Panay Memorial Website (Accessed 17 October 2010) According to Alley, writing in his memoir I Witness, Atcheson proclaimed that aboard the gunboat the group would be \\"as safe as you would be on good old American soil.\\" Little did any of them know that in just a week's time, the Panay would be attacked and sunk, Sandri killed, and that they would witness the Rape of Nanking. During the attack Barzini, although wounded, performed heroically helping to bring the wounded ashore and providing first aid to the best of his ability. As Sandri, known as \\"the Floyd Gibbons of Italy,\\" was stretched out in the reeds with excruciatingly painful, fatal stomach wounds, Barzini could only comfort him with an occasional cigarette and a word from time to time. This episode of the incident was captured on Alley's and Mayell's cameras and in a 1937 Wide World Photos shot titled \\"Consoling dying Panay victim\\". ==Banned by the Fascists== In April 1940, he was arrested on charges of leaking confidential information to the enemy and making disparaging remarks about Mussolini. He was confined by the Fascists to forced residence in a village for five years. In 1944, when Rome was liberated, he returned to journalism. ==Journalism== In 1944 he resumed his journalistic career as the editor-in-chief of daily and weekly publications. He founded Il Globo. Subsequently, he served in turn as the chief editor of several newspapers and magazines. ==Parliamentarian== A staunch anti-Communist, he was a member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies from 1958 to 1972, for the centre-right Italian Liberal Party (Partito Liberale Italiano ‚Äì PLI). ==Later life and family== He was the father of five children, and lived on a small farm near Rome, where he produced his own olive oil, wine, vegetables, and fruit. Barzini died in 1984 of cancer at his home in Rome.Luigi Barzini, Italian Author, Dies At 75 In Rome, Obituary, The New York Times, 1 April 1984 His daughter Benedetta, by his first wife Giannalisa Feltrinelli, was a successful fashion model during the 1960s. The quote in the original Italian is: Abbiamo tirato fuori per esempio le foto della madre di Benedetta, chic, freddissima, upper class¬ª. La signora era Giannalisa Gianzana Feltrinelli (madre anche di Giangiacomo), il padre il giornalista Luigi Barzini jr. His marriage to Feltrinelli also made him the stepfather of Italian publisher and left-wing political activist Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, of whom Barzini eventually disapproved, saying that he thought Giangiacomo preferred the company of men who \\"despised the masses as he did, who thought them something they could play with.\\" Barzini also rejected as implausible conspiracy theories concerning Giangiacomo's death. ==Works== *Americans are Alone in the World (1953)These Strange Americans, Time, 26 October 1953 *The Italians: A Full Length Portrait (1964)Reflections on the Italians, Time, 25 September 1964 *From Caesar to the Mafia (1971) *O America When You and I were Young (1977) *The Europeans (1983) ==ReferencesBibliography== *D'Agostino, Peter R.

He grew up with his twin sister and an elder brother. His father, Richard Sauer, had trained as a confectioner, but worked as an insurance representative. Sauer excelled at school and it quickly became clear that he had both the ability and the ambition to achieve more than this in his own life. == Career and research == Sauer studied chemistry from 1967 to 1972 at the Humboldt University of Berlin and was awarded a doctorate in chemistry in 1974. He continued to do research there until 1977, when he joined the Academy of Sciences, Central Institute of Physical Chemistry in Berlin, one of the leading scientific institutes of the former GDR (East Germany). For a brief time during and after the German reunification (1990‚Äì1991) he was the deputy technical director (catalysis and sorption) for BIOSYM Technologies, San Diego/USA (now BIOVIA). He remained an advisor for BIOSYM until 2002. In 1992, he joined the Max Planck Society as head of the Quantum Chemistry Group in Berlin. In 1993, he became full professor of physical and theoretical chemistry at the Humboldt University of Berlin. He retired from his chair in October 2017 and was succeeded by Martin Sch√ºtz, who died the following year. Sauer remains affiliated with the university as a senior research fellow. He is an active research scientist in quantum chemistry and computational chemistry. His computational studies have allowed for a better understanding of the structures and activities of some catalysts such as zeolites, specifically their acid sites, as well as the interpretation of solid state NMR spectra of nucleus Si-29, and quadrupolar nuclei such as Na-23, Al-27 and O-17. ===Awards and honours=== * 1991: Chemistry Prize of the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities * 1995: Member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities * 2006: External scientific member of the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society * 2007: Member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina * 2009: Member of the Academia Europaea * 2010: Liebig Medal * 2013: Honorary Doctor of Science, University College London * 2018: Foreign Member of the Royal Society * 2019: Schr√∂dinger Medal == Personal life == From his previous marriage to a fellow chemist, Sauer has two sons, Daniel and Adrian.

Sauer (right) with Angela Merkel, George W. Bush and Laura Bush Because of his wife's political career, Sauer has received far more media attention than is usual for a research scientist. On several occasions he has stated that he is not fond of this publicity. During the 2005 election campaign Joachim Sauer kept a very low profile, declining to give any interviews not related to his scientific work. He attended the Bayreuth Festival, an opera festival and a highly visible social event in Germany, with his wife. Sauer is known as a great lover of Wagner's music. Even during his wife's election in the Bundestag, her inauguration, and later her taking the oath of office, Sauer was not present but reportedly briefly followed the event on TV from his university chemistry lab. == References == Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:People from Senftenberg Category:German chemists Category:Spouses of the Chancellors of Germany Category:Humboldt University of Berlin faculty Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni Category:Angela Merkel Category:Computational chemists Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society Category:Husbands of national leaders Category:Schr√∂dinger Medal recipients ","title":"Joachim Sauer"},{"id":"2216168","text":"Jeffrey Mylett (June 8, 1949 ‚Äì May 7, 1986) was an American actor and songwriter.

It was estimated that the park would attract 88,000 users a year, replacing the Eastway Cycle Circuit.Report of the IOC Evaluation Commission on the London bid Eastway Cycle Circuit opened in 1975, it was the first purpose built road cycling venue in Britain. The facility closed in September 2006 to make way for London's VeloPark. The velodrome is the third covered track in Great Britain. In September 2008 plans for the VeloPark were revealed, which were chosen with help from Chris Hoy. However, by March 2007, the VeloPark was revealed to be only a third of its original size, rescaled from 34 to 10 hectares. The decrease in the size of the site led to users of the Eastway cycle circuit to protest to the Mayor of London. ==Builders== On 12 July 2007, the Olympic Delivery Authority selected the design team: Hopkins Architects, Expedition Engineering, BDSP, and Grant Associates, following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions. The Velopark was scheduled to be completed by the contractor, ISG,ISG installs timber cycling track at Olympic Velodrome Construction Index in 2011. In 2004, during London's Olympic and Paralympic bid, the estimated cost was ¬£37 million, including ¬£20 million for the velodrome. ==Velodrome== In 2009, at the time work began on the construction of the velodrome, the estimated cost of that facility alone was ¬£105 million.Work begins on world's fastest velodrome, reuters.co.uk, 25 March 2009. Work on the velodrome was completed in February 2011, and was the first Olympic Park venue to be completed. The roof is designed to reflect the geometry of cycling as well as being lightweight and efficient reflecting a bike. There is also a 360-degree concourse level with windows allowing people views of the Olympic Park. The velodrome is energy efficient‚Äîrooflights reduce the need for artificial lights, and natural ventilation reduces the need for air condition. Rain water is also collected, which reduces the amount of water used from the municipal water system. Designer Ron Webb, who designed the velodrome tracks for the Sydney and Athens Games, was in charge of the design and installation of the track. The 250-metre track was made with of Siberian Pine and 350,000 nails. The velodrome was officially opened by many successful British athletes including Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.

After the Supercross world cup event, Shanaze Reade called for changes to the track. She stated that the track was on the limit if the wind changed. Sarah Walker echoed Reade's calls stating that the track could get ugly on a windy day. In preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics, in 2010 the Dutch National Olympic Committee commissioned a replica of the planned BMX track at their National Sports Centre Papendal. It came into use in March 2011, ahead of the hand over of the London Velopark BMX venue. ==London 2012== The venue was used for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic track cycling competition was held in the Velodrome with the adjoining BMX track hosting the Olympic BMX competition.

The course will now cross the River Lee and parkland linking up with other cycle routes in London. British Cycling will remain based at the Olympic-standard Manchester Velodrome which has been a catalyst for the success of British Cycling in recent years, most notably at the 2008 Olympic Games. Team manager of British Cycling, David Brailsford has stated that the new indoor National BMX Arena in Manchester and the undulating terrain of North West England, ideal for practising road race cycling, offer a distinct advantage over London. An agreement was struck in 2012 to bring track cycling to the London Velodrome post-2012 Olympics, with events such as Revolution series which have proved popular in Manchester.

Founded in Hawaii in 1984 by Frank Orrall, initially as a solo project. In 1985 Orrall formed the first line-up of PDP to perform its first concert; at the Honolulu Academy of Arts. The band then embarked on a yearlong Street Performance Busking tour across North America, eventually settling in Austin, Texas in 1987, where they recorded their first three albums. In 1992, the band relocated, this time to Chicago, Illinois, where they began to incorporate Orchestral arrangements & elements of Electronic, House Music and Soul music into their Acoustic Rock style.

It was written by Vincent Tilsley and directed by Don Chaffey and fifth to be produced. It was the second episode to be broadcast in the UK on ITV (ATV Midlands and Grampian) on Friday 6 October 1967 and first aired in the United States on CBS on Saturday 8 June 1968. The episode starred Patrick McGoohan as Number Six and introduced Leo McKern as Number Two. McKern's Number Two would return for the last two episodes of the series. ==Plot summary== The episode opens with the relentlessly cheerful voice of the radio announcer encouraging every Villager to participate in an upcoming crafts show. Number Six is playing chess near the beach when Number Two (Leo McKern) joins him. During their conversation, a helicopter lands and an unconscious woman (Nadia Gray) is taken out on a stretcher. Later, Number Six is invited to The Green Dome where he and Number Two watch the woman wake up on the main viewing screen. Number Two says that she is the new Number Eight and that she will be Number Six's new neighbour. When Number Six returns to his cottage, Number Eight emerges, confused, and asks for directions to The Green Dome. When she returns later, she reveals to him that her name is Nadia, but she is suspicious that he is a Village spy. The day after, Nadia tries to escape by swimming out to sea but is brought back by Rover and interrogated in the hospital. In response, Number Six makes a deal, agreeing to participate more in Village life ‚Äî for instance, by entering the craft show ‚Äî if this puts an end to her torture. Number Six and Nadia become closer and eventually plan to escape. She tells him that she knows the location of The Village: On the Baltic coast of Lithuania about from the Polish border. At the craft show (where every entry except Number Six's is a depiction of Number Two in some medium), Number Six presents his work, a multi-piece abstract sculpture called \\"Escape\\". He is then awarded first prize and uses the \\"work units\\" he has won to purchase a tapestry, the entry of one of the other prize winners. At night, he and Nadia escape in his exhibit, which is really a carved boat, using the tapestry as a sail. When they reach land, they meet Nadia's contact. Number Six borrows the contact's watch since his own has stopped. Number Six and Nadia then hide in a packing case as they travel to London. They end up in Number Six's old office and meet his former bosses. When they suspect him of being a double agent, Number Six agrees to tell them why he resigned if Nadia is given protection. However, as he is about to talk, Number Six hears the familiar chimes of Big Ben. He looks at his watch and finds that it shows the same time ‚Äî not the one hour's difference of the time in Poland. Realising that he has been tricked, he begins a search of the office and discovers a tape recorder recreating the background sounds of London. He exits the building, finding himself back in The Village, with Nadia standing with Number Two ‚Äî thus revealing she was an operative all along. ==Cast== * Leo McKern . . .

At the press coverage Patrick McGoohan (at the start wearing his kosho uniform, a made up martial art used in the series) was interviewed inside the cage shown in the episode \\"Once Upon a Time\\". Also present was Angelo Muscat, the mute butler seen in many episodes and Alexis Kanner. Two episodes - \\"Arrival\\" and \\"The Chimes of Big Ben\\" - were shown to the press. The alternate version of \\"The Chimes of Big Ben\\" includes a sequence that was later cut where Number Six uses a triquetrum (an ancient Greek measuring device) to locate the general position of the Village. The end titles also finished with the smaller wheel of the penny farthing resolving into the Earth while a galaxy of stars fills the bigger wheel and then the canopy on the bicycle. The Earth then expanded to a single word 'POP'. ==Broadcast== The broadcast date of the episode varied in different ITV regions of the UK.

These interpretations form the basis of Jewish and Christian attitudes towards homosexuality. == Hebrew Bible  Leviticus 18 and 20 === Chapters 18 and 20 of Leviticus form part of the Holiness code and list prohibited forms of intercourse, including the following verses: *\\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\\" Chapter 18 verse 22 Bible Gateway provides 42 other English translations of the verse. *\\"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.\\" Chapter 20 verse 13. Bible Gateway provides 42 other English translations of the verse. These two verses have historically been interpreted by Jews and Christians as clear overall prohibitions against homosexual acts in general. More recent interpretations focus more on its context as part of the Holiness Code, a code of purity meant to distinguish the behavior of Israelites from the polytheistic Canaanites. The Hebrew Bible only prohibits this practice for men. This is clearly seen by contrasting these verses with Lev. 18:23 and 20:15-16 respectively, where sex with animals is prohibited for both men and women. More recent interpretations focus on its context as part of the Holiness Code, a code of purity meant to distinguish the behavior of the Israelites from the Canaanites. One of those interpretations is from Janet Edmonds, which says: > \\"To interpret these passages of Leviticus, it‚Äôs important to know that this > book of the Bible focuses on ritual purity for the Israelites, and setting > guidelines for the Israelites to distinguish themselves from their pagan > neighbors, the Egyptians and Canaanites, who lived in the lands before they > were settled by the Jews. This is shown in Leviticus Chapters 18 and 20 by > three specific scripture passages (Leviticus 18:2-3, 18:24 and 20:23) that > state that the Israelites should never do what the Egyptians and Canaanites > did.\\" === Sodom and Gomorrah === Lot prevents Sodomites from raping the angels, by Heinrich Aldegrever, 1555 The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, John Martin, 1852 The story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis does not explicitly identify homosexuality as the sin for which they were destroyed. Some interpreters find the story of Sodom and a similar one in Judges 19 to condemn the violent rape of guests more than homosexuality, but the passage has historically been interpreted within Judaism and Christianity as a punishment for homosexuality due to the interpretation that the men of Sodom wished to rape, or have sex with, the angels who retrieved Lot. While the Jewish prophets spoke only of lack of charity as the sin of Sodom, the exclusively sexual interpretation became so prevalent among Christian communities that the name \\"Sodom\\" became the basis of the word \\"sodomy\\", still a legal synonym for homosexual and non-procreative sexual acts, particularly anal or oral sex. While the Jewish prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos and Zephaniah refer vaguely to the sin of Sodom, Ezekiel specifies that the city was destroyed because of its commission of social injustice as well as its commission of 'abomination': The Talmudic tradition as written between c. 370 and 500 also interprets the sin of Sodom as lack of charity, with the attempted rape of the angels being a manifestation of the city's violation of the social order of hospitality; as does Jesus in the New Testament, for instance in Matthew 10:14‚Äì15 when he tells his disciples that the punishment for houses or towns that will not welcome them will be worse than that of Sodom and Gomorrah. Later traditions on Sodom's sin, such as Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, considered it to be an illicit form of heterosexual intercourse. In Jude 1:7 the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah are stated to have been \\"giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh\\", which may refer to homosexuality or to the lust of mortals after angels. Jewish writers Philo (d. AD 50) and Josephus (37 ‚Äì c. 100) were the first to assert unambiguously that homosexuality was among the sins of Sodom. By the end of the 1st century AD, Jews commonly identified the sin of Sodom with homosexual practices. === David and Jonathan, Ruth and Naomi === The account of the friendship between David and Jonathan in the Books of Samuel has been interpreted by traditional and mainstream writers as a relationship of affectionate regard. It has also been interpreted by some authors as of a sexual nature.Boswell, John. Same-sex Unions in Premodern Europe. New York: Vintage, 1994. (pp. 135‚Äì137)Halperin, David M. One Hundred Years of Homosexuality. New York: Routledge, 1990. (p. 83) Theologian Theodore Jennings identifies the story as one of desire for David by both Saul and Jonathan, stating, \\"Saul's jealousy has driven [David] into Jonathan's arms.\\" Michael Coogan addresses the claim of their homosexual relationship and explicitly rejects it. One relevant Bible passage on this issue is 1 Samuel 18:1: *When David had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was bound to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. (NRSV) Another relevant passage is 2 Samuel 1:26, where David says: *I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; greatly beloved were you to me; your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. (NRSV) The story of Ruth and Naomi in the Book of Ruth is also occasionally interpreted by contemporary scholars as the story of a lesbian couple. Coogan states that the Hebrew Bible does not even mention lesbianism. == New Testament  Romans 1:26‚Äì27 === This passage, part of a larger discourse in 1:18-32, has been debated by some 20th and 21st century interpreters as to its relevance today, what it actually prohibits and whether it represents Paul's view or rhetoric that Paul is actively arguing against. Clement of Alexandria and John Chrysostom regard it as concerning female and male homosexual intercourse, while Augustine of Hippo views it as referring to heterosexual and homosexual anal sex.Bernadette J. Brooten: Patristic Interpretations of Romans 1:26, in: Elizabeth E. Livingstone (ed.), Studia Patristica XVIII, vol. 1, Kalamazoo 1985, p. 287-291. Although Christians of several denominations have historically maintained that this verse is a complete prohibition of all forms of homosexual activity, some 20th and 21st-century authors contend the passage is not a blanket condemnation of homosexual acts, suggesting, among other interpretations, that the passage condemned heterosexuals who experimented with homosexual activity or that Paul's condemnation was relative to his own culture, in which homosexuality was not understood as an orientation and in which being penetrated was seen as shameful. These interpretations are, however, in a minority. Scholars, noting that Romans 1:18‚Äì32 represents an exception in the book of Romans as a whole and uses vocabulary elsewhere not seen in Paul's letters, have for decades puzzled over the passage. Several scholars believe these verses are part of a much larger non-Pauline interpolation, a later addition to the letter.Percy Neale Harrison, Paulines and Pastorals (London: Villiers Publications, 1964), 80-85; Robert Martyr Hawkins, The Recovery of the Historical Paul (Nashville, TN: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943), 79-86; Alfred Firmin Loisy, The Origins of the New Testament (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1962), 250; ibid., The Birth of the Christian Religion (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1962), 363 n.21; Winsome Munro, Authority in Paul and Peter: The Identification of a Pastoral Stratum in the Pauline Corpus and 1 Peter, SNTSMS 45 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), 113; John C. O'Neill, Paul's Letter to the Romans (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1975), 40-56; William O. Walker, Jr., \\"Romans 1.18‚Äì2.29: A Non-Pauline Interpolation?\\" New Testament Studies 45, no. 4 (1999): 533-52. Others argue that the grammar of the Greek original demands that Romans 1:18-32 be read as a rhetorical set-up, a summary of Hellenistic Jewish legalist rhetoric that Paul actively forbids followers of Christ from using in Romans 2. === 1 Corinthians 6:9‚Äì11; 1 Timothy 1:8‚Äì11 === In the context of the broader immorality of his audience, Paul the Apostle wrote in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 6 verses 9-11: In 1 Timothy 1:8‚Äì11, Paul the Apostle states: In the letter to the Corinthians, within the list of people who will not inherit the kingdom of God, Paul uses two Greek words: malakia () and arsenokoitai (). Arsenokoitai is a compound word. Compound words are formed when two or more words are put together to form a new word with a new meaning. In this case, arsenokoitai is from the Greek words 'arrhƒìn / arsƒìn' () meaning \\"male\\", and koitƒìn () meaning \\"bed\\", with a sexual connotation. A direct translation would be ‚Äúmale-bed‚Äù. Its first recorded use was by Paul in 1 Corinthians and later in 1 Timothy 1 (attributed to Paul). Some scholars consider Paul to have adapted this word by translating, to Greek, the verse from Leviticus 20:13 ‚Äúmales who lie with males.‚Äù with additional adaption from the wording of the Septuagint translations of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:23\\" Due to its unclear definition, English translators struggled with representing the concept of arsenokoitai. It has been variously rendered as \\"sodomites\\" (NRSV), \\"abusers of themselves with mankind\\" (KJV), \\"men who have sex with men\\" (NIV) or \\"practicing homosexuals\\" (NET) Malakia (ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒØŒ±, \\"softness\\", \\"weakliness\\") is an ancient Greek word that, in relation to men, has sometimes been translated as \\"effeminacy\\". Also translates to ‚Äúof things subject to touch, \\"soft\\" (used in Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 to describe a garment); of things not subject to touch, \\"gentle\\"; and, of persons or modes of life, a number of meanings that include \\"pathic\\". However, in modern Greek it has come to mean \\"masturbation\\", and its derivative ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ¨Œ∫Œ±œÇ ‚Äì malakas means \\"one who masturbates\\". Interpretation Bishop Gene Robinson says the early church seemed to have understood it as a person with a \\"soft\\" or weak morality; later, it would come to denote (and be translated as) those who engage in masturbation, or \\"those who abuse themselves\\"; all that is factually known about the word is that it means \\"soft\\".Robinson 2012 Most scholars hold that Paul had two passages of the Book of Leviticus, and , in mind when he used the word ·ºÄœÅœÉŒµŒΩŒøŒ∫Œø·øñœÑŒ±Œπ (which may be of his coinage) with most commentators and translators interpreting it as a reference to male same-sex intercourse. However, John Boswell states that it \\"did not connote homosexuality to Paul or his early readers\\", and that in later Christian literature the word is used, for instance, by Aristides of Athens (c. 138) clearly not for homosexuality and possibly for prostitution, Eusebius (d. c. 340) who evidently used it in reference to women, and in the writings of 6th-century Patriarch John IV of Constantinople, known as John the Faster. In a passage dealing with sexual misconduct, John speaks of arsenokoitia as active or passive and says that \\"many men even commit the sin of arsenokoitia with their wives\\".Œ§·Ω∏ ŒºŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒøŒπ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºÄœÅœÉŒµŒΩŒøŒ∫ŒøŒπœÑŒØŒ±œÇ Œº·ø¶œÉŒøœÇ œÄŒøŒªŒªŒø·Ω∂ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ŒºŒµœÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ Œ≥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒπŒ∫·ø∂ŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫œÑŒµŒªŒø·ø¶œÉŒπŒΩ (Migne PG 88, col. 1896). Although the constituent elements of the compound word refer to sleeping with men, he obviously does not use it to mean homosexual intercourse and appears to employ it for anal intercourse, not generic homosexual activity. Particulars of Boswell's arguments are rejected by several scholars in a way qualified as persuasive by David F. Greenberg, who declares usage of the term arsenokoites by writers such as Aristides of Athens and Eusebius, and in the Sibylline Oracles, to be \\"consistent with a homosexual meaning\\". A discussion document issued by the House of Bishops of the Church of England states that most scholars still hold that the word arsenokoites relates to homosexuality. Another work attributed to John the Faster, a series of canons that for various sins provided shorter though stricter penances in place of the previous longer penances, applies a penance of 80 days for \\"intercourse of men with one another\\" (canon 9), explained in the Pedalion as mutual masturbation ‚Äì double the penalty for solitary masturbation (canon 8) ‚Äì and three years with xerophagy or, in accordance with the older canon of Basil the Great, 15 without (canon 18) for being \\"so mad as to copulate with another man\\" ‚Äì ·ºÄœÅœÅŒµŒΩŒøŒºŒ±ŒΩŒÆœÉŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ± in the original ‚Äì explained in the Pedalion as \\"guilty of arsenocoetia (i.e., sexual intercourse between males)\\" ‚Äì ·ºÄœÅœÉŒµŒΩŒøŒ∫ŒøŒØœÑŒ∑ŒΩ in the original. According to the same work, ordination is not to be conferred on someone who as a boy has been the victim of anal intercourse, but this is not the case if the semen was ejaculated between his thighs (canon 19). These canons are included, with commentary, in the Pedalion, the most widely used collection of canons of the Greek Orthodox Church, an English translation of which was produced by Denver Cummings and published by the Orthodox Christian Educational Society in 1957 under the title The Rudder.Text in the original Greek language, pp. 562‚Äì578 Some scholars consider that the term was not used to refer to a homosexual orientation, but argue that it referred instead to sexual activity. Other scholars have interpreted arsenokoitai and malakoi (another word that appears in ) as referring to weakness and effeminacy or to the practice of exploitative pederasty. === Jesus's discussion of marriage === In Matthew 19 and parallel in Mark 10, Jesus is asked if a man can divorce his wife. In that context, Jesus replies: Robert A. J. Gagnon, a theologian, argues that Jesus's back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he \\"presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage\\".Robert A. J. Gagnon, \\"Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice?: A Response to David G. Myers and Letha Dawson Scanzoni, What God Has Joined Together?\\" Reformed Review 59.1 (Autumn 2005): 19-130, 56. Available online at On the other hand, Bart Ehrman, Distinguished Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina, states of Jesus's references to Genesis 1 and 2, \\"Yeah, [Jesus is] not actually defining marriage. He's answering a specific question.\\" Ehrman notes further \\"And here the conversation is quite easy. In our surviving records Jesus says nothing about same-sex acts or sexual orientation. Nothing. Nada.\\" === Matthew 8; Luke 7 === In Matthew 8:5‚Äì13 and Luke 7:1‚Äì10, Jesus heals a centurion's servant who is dying. Daniel A. Helminiak writes that the Greek word pais, used in this account, was sometimes given a sexual meaning. Donald Wold states that its normal meaning is \\"boy\\", \\"child\\" or \\"slave\\" and its application to a boy lover escapes notice in the standard lexica of Liddell and Scott and Bauer. The Greek-English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott registers three meanings of the word œÄŒ±·øñœÇ (pais): a child in relation to descent (son or daughter); a child in relation to age (boy or girl); a slave or servant (male or female). In her detailed study of the episode in Matthew and Luke, Wendy Cotter dismisses as very unlikely the idea that the use of the Greek word \\"pais\\" indicated a sexual relationship between the centurion and the young slave. Matthew's account has parallels in Luke 7:1‚Äì10 and John 4:46‚Äì53. There are major differences between John's account and those of the two synoptic writers, but such differences exist also between the two synoptic accounts, with next to nothing of the details in Luke 7:2‚Äì6 being present also in Matthew. The Commentary of Craig A. Evans states that the word pais used by Matthew may be that used in the hypothetical source known as Q used by both Matthew and Luke and, since it can mean either son or slave, it became doulos (slave) in Luke and huios (son) in John. Writers who admit John 4:46‚Äì53 as a parallel passage generally interpret Matthew's pais as \\"child\\" or \\"boy\\", while those who exclude it see it as meaning \\"servant\\" or \\"slave\\". Theodore W. Jennings Jr. and Tat-Siong Benny Liew write that Roman historical data about patron-client relationships and about same-sex relations among soldiers support the view that the pais in Matthew's account is the centurion's \\"boy-love\\" and that the centurion did not want Jesus to enter his house for fear the boy would be enamoured of Jesus instead. D.B. Saddington writes that, while he does not exclude the possibility, the evidence the two put forward supports \\"neither of these interpretations\\", with Wendy Cotter saying that they fail to take account of Jewish condemnation of pederasty. === Matthew 19:12 === In Matthew 19:12, Jesus speaks of eunuchs who were born as such, eunuchs who were made so by others, and eunuchs who choose to live as such for the kingdom of heaven. Jesus's reference to eunuchs who were born as such has been interpreted by some commentators as having to do with homosexual orientation; Clement of Alexandria, for instance, cites in his book \\"Stromata\\" (chapter III,1,1Clemente de Alejandria: Stromata II-III, Fuentes Patristicas, vol.10 (Marcelo Merino Rodriguez ed.), Madrid 1998, p. 315) an earlier interpretation from Basilides that some men, from birth, are naturally averse to women and should not marry. \\"The first category ‚Äì those eunuchs who have been so from birth ‚Äì is the closest description we have in the Bible of what we understand today as homosexual.\\" === Acts 8 === The Ethiopian eunuch, an early Gentile convert described in Acts 8, has been interpreted by some commentators as an early gay Christian, based on the fact that the word \\"eunuch\\" in the Bible was not always used literally, as in Matthew 19:12. Some religious commentators suggest that the combination of \\"eunuch\\" together with the title \\"court official\\" indicates a literal eunuch who would have been excluded from the Temple by the restriction in Deuteronomy 23:1. == See also == * Biblical law in Christianity * Christianity and homosexuality * Homosexuality and Judaism * Homosexuality in ancient Greece * Malakia * Homosexuality and religion * Women in Christianity * Abomination (Judaism) * Sexuality of Jesus ==Notes References  Bibliography == * Amsel, Nachum.

He is known for his win in the 1990 Daytona 500. He last competed part-time in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, driving the No. 99 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 for StarCom Racing. Cope also serves as team manager. ==Early life and education== Cope was born in San Diego, California and was raised in Spanaway, Washington. In high school, he enjoyed auto racing and baseball. He was a catcher on the Bethel High School baseball team, and later played college baseball at Whitman College. While being scouted by major league baseball teams, Cope suffered a knee injury that ended his playing career. He then devoted himself to racing full-time. == Career  Early career === Cope progressed through the short-track ranks in the Northwest, and later made his Winston Cup Series debut at Riverside International Raceway in 1982. Cope's No. 95 car finished 36th there after developing an oil leak, and he won $625. He ran part-time in the Winston Cup Series after that, making an attempt at Rookie of the Year in 1987. In 1989, he signed with Bob Whitcomb to drive the No. 10 Purolator Pontiac and later Chevrolet, posting four top-10 finishes. ===1990‚Äì1995=== During the last lap of the 1990 Daytona 500, Dale Earnhardt ran over a piece of debris and cut a tire in turn three. After narrowly avoiding most of the resulting debris, Cope assumed the lead and earned his first win, as well as his first Top 5 (his best finish prior to the 1990 Daytona 500 was sixth) in NASCAR competition. He became an overnight sensation as a result of the win, appearing on Late Night with David Letterman that week. At Dover later in the 1990 season, Cope rallied for another win after running out of fuel and falling off the lead lap. At year's end, he wound up 18th in points. Following the 1992 season, the Whitcomb team closed down, and Cope drove an originally unsponsored No. 66 Ford for Cale Yarborough. After Daytona, the car was sponsored by Bojangles, and the number changed to No. 98 starting the next race at Rockingham, reflecting the restaurant's 98 cent value menu. Midway through the 1994 season, Cope was replaced by Jeremy Mayfield and began driving for Bobby Allison's No. 12 Straight Arrow-sponsored Ford, after a brief stint with car owner T.W. Taylor. During this season, Cope won his first career Busch Series race at New Hampshire International Speedway, driving the No. 82 Ford Thunderbird for Ron Zock. The 1995 season was Cope's most consistent. He had eight Top 10 finishes, and garnered a 15th-place finish in points. ===1996‚Äì2005=== Cope's No. 36 car in 1997 When Allison's team shut down after the 1996 season, Cope signed on with the fledgling MB2 Motorsports operation, driving the No. 36 Skittles-sponsored Pontiac to a 27th-place finish in points. After one year, he was released and signed on with the Bahari Racing operation. Despite missing some races due to an injury, Cope won his first career pole position at Lowe's Motor Speedway, although he failed to post a Top 10 finish in the No. 30 Gumout-sponsored car. Cope returned to Bahari in 1999 with Sara Lee sponsorship. After failing to qualify for 10 races, Cope was released from the team. He made sporadic appearances for LJ Racing and Larry Hedrick Motorsports, and later signed on to drive the No. 15 Ford Taurus owned by Fenley-Moore Motorsports. Cope became unhappy when the team only ran a part-time schedule, and quit after a few races. He spent the rest of the year on the sidelines, before taking over the No. 86 R.C. Cola-sponsored Dodge Ram at Impact Motorsports at the end of the season in the Craftsman Truck Series. In 2001, Cope announced the formation of Quest Motor Racing, a team he would co-own with drag racer Warren Johnson. The team did not qualify for a race all year, and his only start came with CLR Racing. He ran four races in the Busch Series in the No. 94 owned by Fred Bickford, posting a best finish of 21st at Bristol Motor Speedway. The team had mild success the next year, garnering sponsorship from Avacor and Poison. Cope also ran some races with BAM Racing that year. After 18 starts in 2003 driving the No. 37 Friendly's Ice Cream-sponsored Chevrolet, Cope merged the team with Arnold Motorsports. Cope qualified fifth for the 2004 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400, but after several starts, Cope was released from the ride, and took back his equipment. He also ran 30 races in the No. 49 Advil-sponsored Ford for Jay Robinson in the Busch Series that season. His best finish, 20th, came at Daytona. In 2005, Cope tried merging his team again, joining forces with Larry Hollenbeck and S.W.A.T. Fitness, but lost the opportunity after he failed to qualify for the Daytona 500. Cope had attempted a couple of races with Ware Racing Enterprises before making his only Cup start of the season at Martinsville Speedway, finishing 33rd in the No. 08 Royal Administration/Sundance Vacations/My Guardian 911-sponsored Dodge for McGlynn Racing. Cope was later given the team's full-time ride in the No. 00, as requested by the sponsor. ===2006‚Äì2018=== In 2006, Cope intended to run a full schedule for McGlynn with No. 74 car, but soon cut back to part-time. His best finish was at Michigan International Speedway, where he finished 34th. In the Busch Series, his best finish in the 49 car was 33rd at Dover International Speedway, and his best start was 33rd at Bristol Motor Speedway. He intended to run more races with McGlynn in 2007, but the team suspended operations after only attempting one race. He spent the season driving part-time schedules for Robinson and Xpress Motorsports. In 2008, he signed to drive for Means Racing in the Nationwide Series, but switched midseason to drive for James Finch and Jay Robinson Racing. Later in the season, Cope began entering his own trucks and cars in the Craftsman Truck Series and Nationwide Series. In the truck series he fielded the No. 73 and No. 74 trucks with Nick Tucker and Jennifer Jo Cobb being the primary drivers, while in the Nationwide Series he fielded the No. 73 and No. 78 cars with Kevin Lepage driving the No. 73 and others racing the No. 78. Cope in his No. 73 Nationwide car in 2009 As the 2009 season approached, Cope announced he would be involved on all three of NASCAR's circuits, as he would pilot the No. 75 Cope/Keller Racing Dodge in the Sprint Cup series with BluFrog Energy Drink coming on board as a primary sponsor during Daytona Speedweeks. He began the season as the driver of the No. 41 Metal Jeans Chevrolet Impala for Rick Ware Racing in the Nationwide Series, but was released after three races, and moved to his own team. He has also fielded trucks part-time for himself, Larry Foyt, and Jennifer Jo Cobb. Cope has fielded the No. 78 car for one race in nationwide. He has fielded the No. 73 for most of the races. In 2009, Cope attempted six races with his self- owned team; he failed to qualify for any of them. At the October Martinsville race, Cope successfully attempted his first Sprint Cup race since 2006 while driving for Larry Gunselman. In 2010, Cope teamed up with Dale Clemons as co- owners of new racing venture Stratus Racing Group. The team ran a full schedule with Cope as driver in both the Nationwide Series and Camping World Truck Series. It also ran a limited schedule in the ARCA Re/Max Series, fielding a car for Cope's twin nieces Amber Cope and Angela Cope, who split the ride. Cope racing his 2011 Nationwide car Cope returned to Jay Robinson Inc. for 2011 in the No. 28 Chevrolet. For the 2011 Daytona 500, Cope attempted to qualify the No. 64 Toyota for Larry Gunselman with sponsorship from Sta-Bil. Cope finished 13th in the Budweiser Shootout driving for Gunselman. Cope has decided to field his cup car in select races with manufacturing backing from Chevrolet instead of Dodge. In the 2011 Sprint Showdown, Cope was involved in a crash with Landon Cassill, where he T-boned Cassill's car when he spun out. Neither driver was injured. Cope finished 20th in Nationwide Series standings, competing in all but one event. Cope returned to the Nationwide Series in 2012, competing in the No. 73 Chevrolet for CFK Motorsports. Cope made his first race of the season in his own car during the fall race a Phoenix. Cope announced that he would run a part-time schedule in 2013. During the test session in Daytona in January 2014, Cope tested the 73 car. He hired the No. 70 car, driving for Jay Robinson Racing at Phoenix International Raceway with his Toyota Camry, but after qualifying crash, although the car didn't have the backup car, the car changed to an old 2012 Chevrolet Impala. 2015 Xfinity car at Road America In 2014, Cope's team bought the equipment from the defunct ML Motorsports. Youtheory agreed to sponsor Cope for the entire 2014 season, enabling Cope to race full-time for the first time since 2011. It was a much needed break for Cope, and he piloted the No. 70 Youtheory Chevrolet to a 22nd-place points finish. In January 2015, Cope announced that he would return to the Xfinity Series for the part-time 2015 season with Charlie's Soap as the sponsor. Cope returned in 2016, with him driving 28 races, Timmy Hill driving 2 races and Dexter Stacey driving the last three races of season. Cope missed the race at Daytona after issues in qualifying, but qualified the following week in Atlanta. During the Zippo 200 at The Glen, Cope radioed to his team that he was having a brake problem. Shortly after, the front end of the car exploded and black smoke blew from the car. NASCAR confiscated the car and investigated what had happened. Cope was unharmed. It was later discovered that the explosion was caused by tire failure triggered by excess heat from a broken spindle. ===2017=== In January 2017, Cope closed down his Xfinity Series team after 16 years of competition. In February, it was announced that Cope would return to the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, driving for Premium Motorsports. On March 3, Cope qualified for the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, his first race since 2009 at NASCAR's highest level. Cope would finish under power in 36th, after suffering power steering problems during the race. Sundance Vacations and the United Way of NEPA partnered to sponsor Cope at the Overton's 400 at Pocono. As part of Darlington Raceway's annual \\"throwback\\" weekend, Cope's 55 car was designed like his no. 12 Mane 'n Tail car that he drove for Bobby Allison Motorsports from 1994‚Äì1996, and Mane 'n Tail returned as the sponsor. On September 10, 2017, Cope announced that he and Premium Motorsports had agreed to part ways, saying, \\"I'm thankful to Jay Robinson and the folks at Premium for the opportunity they have given me this season to return to the Cup Series but the timing is right to pursue other opportunities.\\" Two weeks later, Premium sponsor StarCom Fiber formed StarCom Racing, fielding the No. 00 for Cope at Dover. However, on September 26, 2017, StarCom Racing announced they will withdraw from Dover due to personnel hiring and timing. Cope did make his first start with StarCom at the Hollywood Casino 400 at Kansas, starting 39th and finishing last after mechanical problems plagued the car. Cope's best race of the season came in the penultimate race of the season at Phoenix. He started last due to not making a qualifying run after an engine problem appeared on his #00, but spent most of the race charging through the field to place 32nd due to late-race crashes. ===2018=== In January 2018, StarCom Racing announced that they had secured a charter for the 2018 Cup Series season and will run the full schedule with Cope and Jeffrey Earnhardt serving for the majority of the schedule. However, Earnhardt and StarCom split, and Landon Cassill was hired. Cope announced that they would hopefully run his No. 99 car at Texas Motor Speedway, though the team did not attempt to make that race. Cope and the 99 would make their 2018 debut at Dover International Speedway, the site of Cope's second Cup win in 1990. == Personal life == Cope's first cousin is NASCAR crew chief, Ernie Cope. ==Motorsports career resultsNASCAR=== (key) (Bold ‚Äì Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

The screenplay, by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, is a semi-fictional account of Thomas Jefferson's tenure as the Ambassador of the United States to France before his presidency and of his alleged relationships with British artist Maria Cosway and his slave, Sally Hemings. The film was critically and commercially unsuccessful, grossing $4.4 million on a $14 million budget. ==Plot== Set in the period 1784‚Äì1789, the film portrays Jefferson when he was US minister to France at Versailles before the French Revolution. French liberals and intellectuals hope he will lead them away from the corruption of the court of King Louis XVI and Marie- Antoinette and toward a more democratic form of government. Although deploring the poverty of the common people, he embraces the riches of French culture and civilization. It is his first time abroad, and he takes advantage of the opportunity to extend his knowledge of liberal arts and science while absorbing the refinements France has to offer. A lonely widower, Jefferson develops a close friendship with Maria Cosway, a beautiful (and married) Anglo-Italian painter and musician. Although she becomes increasingly devoted to him, he is attached to his memory of his late wife, whom he promised that he would not remarry, and to his two younger daughters. His elder daughter is especially possessive, and Patsy becomes jealous of Maria's influence on her father. Maria becomes his confidant and correspondent, with their personal relationship becoming more affectionate as well. Later, Jefferson becomes attracted to Sally Hemings, his enslaved maid and companion of his younger daughter Polly. Three-quarters white in ancestry, she is his late wife's half- sister. Their father had taken Sally's slave mother as a concubine after he was widowed for the third time; Sally is the sixth of their children. Sally's enslaved brother James Hemings is also in Paris, learning to be a French chef for Jefferson at Monticello. When George Washington offers Jefferson the post of Secretary of State, he accepts and prepares to sail home with his family. But James, having enjoyed his freedom in Paris, is unwilling to return to the United States and urges Sally to remain with him. It is only when Jefferson promises, making an oath upon the Bible, that he will give James and Sally their freedom that they consent to return with him. Sally is also pregnant with Jefferson's child, and Jefferson extends his oath to promise freedom to all of Sally's children as well. ==Production== The film was shot on location in Paris, at the Desert de Retz and the Palace of Versailles. The scenes at the Desert reenact the actual visit made by Jefferson and Cosway in September 1787. Many of French supporting cast are members of Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. It premiered at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. Antonio Sacchini's 1784 opera Dardanus appears in the film. Also Marc-Antoine Charpentier' \\"Le√ßons de t√©n√®bres\\", performed by William Christie and Les Arts Florissants with Jean- Paul Fouch√©court, Sandrine Piau, Sophie Daneman, and Jory Vinikour. Arcangelo Corelli's La Folia is performed by Nolte, Scacchi, and Paltrow; however, the soundtrack CD is re-dubbed by others. Although Gwyneth Paltrow studied harpsichord for the film, her playing is dubbed by Jory Vinikour, including pieces by Jacques Duphly and Claude Balbastre. Scacchi's performance of Maria Cosway's song, \\"Mormora,\\" was dubbed. The film was budgeted at $14 million. It grossed $2,473,668 in the US. ==Cast== Nick Nolte as Thomas Jefferson. ===At Jefferson's house, the H√¥tel de Langeac=== *Nick Nolte ..... Thomas Jefferson *Gwyneth Paltrow .....

Reporter ==Critical reception== As of February 2018, Jefferson in Paris holds a rating of 31% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews. In her positive review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin called the film > an extraordinary spectacle ... the rare contemporary film that's both an > entertainment and an education, despite some glaring misimpressions that are > sure to spark heated debate ... The biggest problem with [the film] is at > the basic editing level, with such abrupt jumps between diverse scenes that > the film's momentum remains choppy. Overshadowed by its own ambition and > not-quite-ironic pageantry, Jefferson in Paris doesn't quite come to life > ... Casting Nick Nolte as a Founding Father may sound like this film's > riskiest choice, but in fact it makes solid sense. Beyond having the right > physical stature for the imposing, sandy-haired Jefferson, Mr. Nolte > captures the man's vigor and his stiff sense of propriety. He may not adapt > effortlessly to the role of an intellectual giant, but his performance is > thoroughly creditable ... The film makers fare less successfully with Maria > Cosway ... Ms. Scacchi, the film's big casting problem, makes her so > bloodless and prettily artificial that the romance never seems real. There's > much more spice in Ms. Newton's captivating performance as Sally Hemings, > even if she gives this teen-age slave girl the unexpected fiddle-dee-dee > flirtatiousness of a Scarlett O'Hara. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed in a less positive review of the film that, > The film is lavishly produced and visually splendid, like all the Merchant- > Ivory productions. But what is it about? Revolution? History? Slavery? > Romance? No doubt a lot of research and speculation went into Jhabvala's > screenplay, but I wish she had finally decided to jump one way or the other. > The movie tells no clear story and has no clear ideas. In a negative review appearing in Rolling Stone magazine, Peter Travers said, > After a literate and entertaining roll (A Room With a View, Howards End, The > Remains of the Day), the team of producer Ismail Merchant, director James > Ivory and writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala drops the ball with this droopy, > snail-paced prigs-in-wigs movie. It doesn't help that Nick Nolte is such a > lox as Thomas Jefferson ... [He] seems to think that playing an > introspective man means impersonating a wax dummy. Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called the film \\"dull, sluggish and unfocused ... [it] tries telling three or four stories at once, can't decide which is most important and winds up stubbing its well-manicured toes\\" and added, > Coiffed in a strawberry blond ponytail that makes him look like sitcom star > Brett Butler, and surrounded by opulent sets and costumes that look like > early bids for Oscar nominations, Nolte makes a noble, sympathetic effort to > humanize a historical figure, but never manages to look anything other than > tight, corseted and out of his element. In Variety, Todd McCarthy said the film > touches upon much significant history, incident and emotion but, ironically, > lacks the intrigue and drama of great fiction ... as the opportunity for > drama increases with the onset of Jefferson's affair with Sally and the > buildup toward the Revolution, the narrative becomes more dispersed and > murky. Things happen ... but they don't weave and dovetail in the > surprising, intricate and telling ways they can in first-class fiction, some > of Merchant Ivory's recent films included ... The strong points of director > James Ivory's approach here are his attentiveness to wonderful detail ... > The downside is that Ivory's reticence makes it additionally tough for an > emotionally remote figure like Jefferson to come alive onscreen. ==Historic basis== It was the first portrayal in film of Sally Hemings, and at the time most Jefferson scholars disputed the rumors, started in 1802 by a vengeful journalist named James Callender, that Jefferson had fathered a child by her.Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: The Search for Truth Since then, a 1998 Nature study found a match between the male lines of a Jefferson and one descendant of Hemings.Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: The Search for Truth In 2000, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation issued its own report on the DNA test results in light of other historical evidence and said that it was likely that Thomas Jefferson was the father of Eston Hemings, the youngest child of Sally, and \\"perhaps\\" the father of all six, four of whom lived to adulthood, although this claim is heavily disputed.The question of whether Thomas Jefferson fathered one or more children by his slave Sally Hemings is an issue about which honorable people can and do disagree. After a careful review of all of the evidence, the commission agrees unanimously that the allegation is by no means proven; and we find it regrettable that public confusion about the 1998 DNA testing and other evidence has misled many people. With the exception of one member, whose views are set forth both below and in his more detailed appended dissent, our individual conclusions range from serious skepticism about the charge to a conviction that it is almost certainly false. Executive summary of the Jefferson-Hemings Scholars Commission (12 April 2001) \\"... [w]e have found most of the arguments used to point suspicion toward Thomas Jefferson [as the father of all of Sally Hemings' children] to be unpersuasive and often factually erroneous. Not a single member of our group, after an investigation lasting roughly one year, finds the case against Thomas Jefferson to be highly compelling, and the overwhelming majority of us believe it is very unlikely he fathered any children by Sally Hemings ...\\"Dr. Eugene A Foster, et al, \\"The Thomas Jefferson Paternity Case,\\" Nature, January 7, 1999.\\"My study indicates to me that Thomas Jefferson was not the father of Eston or any other Hemings child. The study indicates that Randolph [Thomas‚Äô younger brother] is possibly the father of Eston and the others. Randolph, named for his maternal Randolph family, was a widower and between wives when, shortly after his wife‚Äôs death, Sally became pregnant with her first child. . . . She continued having children until 1808 when Eston was born. Randolph Jefferson would marry his second wife the next year, 1809. . . . [Significantly, t]hree of Sally Hemings‚Äô children, Harriet, Beverly and Eston (the latter two not common names), were given names of the Randolph family.\\" - The Truth about the Thomas Jefferson DNA Study as told by Herbert Barger, Jefferson Family Historian, February 12, 1999. ==See also== *List of films featuring slavery ==References* * *Movie stills Category:1995 films Category:1995 drama films Category:American films Category:American biographical drama films Category:Films about Presidents of the United States Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films set in France Category:Films set in the 1780s Category:Films directed by James Ivory Category:Films with screenplays by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala Category:Merchant Ivory Productions films Category:Touchstone Pictures films Category:Cultural depictions of Thomas Jefferson Category:Cultural depictions of George Washington Category:Cultural depictions of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette Category:Cultural depictions of Louis XVI Category:Cultural depictions of Marie Antoinette ","title":"Jefferson in Paris"},{"id":"2216258","text":"is a 3-episode Japanese original video animation produced by J.C.Staff, the studio's first production. In 1989, Y≈çt≈çden was re-edited into a feature film version titled Wrath of the Ninja for English-speaking regions, but is currently out of print. A manga adaptation was serialized in Newtype. ==Plot== The story takes place during Japan's great civil war Sengoku period, beginning in the summer of 1581 and ending two years later. In the anime, the historical warlord Oda Nobunaga is really an evil demon killing everyone who stands in his way. An ancient prophecy says three mystical Demon Blades from three different ninja clans can end Nobunaga's unholy campaign. The story follows Kasumi no Ayanosuke, a young kunoichi (female ninja) who has escaped her village's annihilation, in her heroic efforts to reunite these three sacred weapons use them to kill Nobunaga. ==CharactersProtagonists=== *Ayanosuke (Ayame) Hayami (voiced by Keiko Toda and Rose Markisello) - the sole survivor of Kasumi village, burnt down in an attack by a huge three- headed demon monster. Her Demon Blade is a kodachi short sword. Ayame (she transformed the feminine name \\"Ayame\\" (Á∂æÂ•≥) into \\"Ayanosuke\\" (Á∂æ‰πã‰ªã) after her village was destroyed) is a strong fighter but gets emotional at times. She is the only survivor of the final battle at Azuchi Castle, left all alone in the world again. *Sakon Hayate (voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue and Hideo Seaver) - the sole survivor of Hyuga village, wiped out by Nobunaga's forces. His Demon Blade is a katana sword. Sakon is calm and puts on a facade of coolheadedness, but when he abandons Ayame and Ryoma to fight the battle between Iga and Nobunaga's army, he is raging with inner turmoil at his decision; later, he develops a love for Ayame and ultimately takes the mortal blow meant for her. He dies saying he had something to tell her, but he cannot remember what it is. *Ryoma Kogure (voiced by Takeshi Watabe and Peter Patrikios) - a headstrong ninja who has a good sense of right and wrong. His Demon Blade is a spear. He leaves his father to his death at his request during the demon invasion of his home village Hagakure, as well as witnesses the death of his sister Kikyo, killed by Jinnai, and is forced to kill his love interest Kayo Momochi. When he dies, his last thoughts are about his sister. *Kikyo Kogure (voiced by Mika Takenaka and Sharon Becker) - Ryoma's younger sister who befriends and admires Ayame and tries to comfort her when she was upset and reminiscing about her tragic past. Kikyo dies in Ayame's arms after she shields her from Jinnai with her own body. *Lord Tanba Momochi (voiced by Tomomichi Nishimura) - Kayo's older brother who leads the Iga into the war. He sacrifices himself trying to kill his sister, begging her to die with him, when her body is possessed by the Masago. *Jinpei (voiced by Masami Kikuchi and Frank Frankson) - a young shinobi who looks up to Sakon and supports Sakon's claims that Koga betrayed Iga (not believed by Momochi), but refuses to abandon his people and leave with Sakon. He is blinded and killed during the attack on Iga. *Genyusai (voiced by Kiyoshi Kobayashi and Greg Wolfe) - Ryoma's father and lord of Hagakure. He is killed in Jinnai's attack on his village. *Shinosuke Hayami (voiced by Kei Tomiyama) - Ayame's brother who was killed in the attack on their village. Before he died, Shinosuke gave her the enchanted blade to avenge them. ===Antagonists=== *Nobunaga Oda (voiced by Kazuki Yao and Flavio Romeo) - the adversary of the main characters. He used to be a ruler of a small region of Owari, until, as it is revealed during the showdown between Mori Ranmaru and Ayame in the final part of the OVA series (\\"Flames of Anger\\"), Ranmaru gave him control of the kagenin (shadow warriors) of the Host of Oboro and the power of the demons to conquer whole Japan. Nobunaga commands the host of Oboro, but unknowingly to him, he is, in turn, himself controlled by Ranmaru and is unaware that he is the most powerful of the Oboro, the Black Demon. In the anime, Oda doesn't die after Akechi Mitsuhide betrayed him at Honn≈ç-ji and where Ayame and Sakon kill only his and Ranmaru's body doubles. Nobunaga is very paranoid that someone will kill him, and as Ranmaru feeds that paranoia he distrusts everyone so much that he has his own guards killed. In the end, he becomes the Black Demon but is killed by Ayame using the combined powers of their weapons. *Ranmaru Mori (voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa and Vinnie Penna) - in the anime, Ranmaru, an advisor to Nobunaga, is a powerful demon who has descended upon the Earth five centuries earlier in 946 from a piece of the passing-by evil star (comet). Thinking he will gain ultimate power, Oda follows all of the advice Ranmaru gives him, tricking Nobunaga into allowing him to rule the Earth. Ranmaru is the one who foretold the prophecy and gave the enchanted weapons to the ninja groups in first place, manipulating everyone including not only Nobunaga and the heroes but even all the other Oboro for his master plan to gather negative human emotions (that was what powered the magic weapons) through the weapons and combine them with the power of the Oboro to form the Black Demon. He attempts to open the gate to the underworld when the returning evil star is closest to the Earth but is killed by the combined efforts of Ayame, Sakon and Ryoma, the latter two, however, sacrifice their own lives for the victory. *Jinnai Saegusa (voiced by Norio Wakamoto and Bruce Winant) - Jinnai is the first Oboro ninja to appear in the anime, using a necklace of giant beads in combat. His demon form is a huge three-headed monster. He comes back later at Hagakure-no-Sato and attempts to kill Ayame, but fails and accidentally ends up killing Kikyo instead and is then himself killed by Ayame. *Masago \\"The Silk Spinner\\" (voiced by Reiz√¥ Nomoto) - Masago is able to cause the people's heads to explode and to transform into a spider monster. He is killed by Ryoma, but not before he possesses Kayo and causes her to kill her own comrades and her brother at Iga. *Kagami - Kagami is childlike in appearance and has the ability to reanimate corpses as undead warriors with her crying and also carries a little ball that she can detonate. During the final battle she manages to severely wound Ryoma, but then she herself meets her death at his hands. *Kiheiji \\"The Quiet Doom\\" (voiced by Sh≈çz≈ç Iizuka and Nick Sullivan) - Khiheji is an extremely quick fighter, skilled with his spear/scythe weapon, and this makes him a tough adversary for Ayame and Sakon until he is eventually killed by Sakon. *Genzo \\"The Harpist\\" (voiced by Ritsuo Sawa) - Genzo uses genjutsu (illusion magic) against his foes. His demon form is a dragon. He is killed by Sakon in the OVA version and by Ayame in the movie version. ===Other characters=== *Ryoan (voiced by Eken Mine and Jack Taylor) - a Buddhist monk who doesn't know he is actually one of the Host of Oboro. He is actually helpful to Ayame, Sakon, and Ryoma, guiding them throughout the story and helping with his chants until he is impaled and killed by Ranmaru. *Kayo Momochi (voiced by Tomomichi Nishimura and Shannon Conley) - a female ninja for whom Ryoma has an unrequited crush. She is a representative of the Koga ninja clan and actually Momochi's younger sister, sent away to Koga when she was young. Kayo is one of the most tragic characters in the story, as her body is possessed by Masago, forcing Ryoma to kill her at her own request. ==OVA== The series was released in three episodes from 1987 to 1988 in Japan only on VHS and videodisc formats;Media release dates a laserdisc version was also released in 1990.LD OVA info The OVA series had been not licensed in the west until 2002, when it was released in the UK by ADV Films on VHS.

With it, an aggressor can influence and eventually dominate a landscape, typically political, piece by piece. In this fashion, the opposition is eliminated \\"slice by slice\\" until it realizes, usually too late, that it is virtually gone in its entirety. In some cases it includes the creation of several factions within the opposing political party and then dismantling that party from the inside, without causing the 'sliced' sides to protest. Salami tactics are most likely to succeed when the perpetrators keep their true long-term motives hidden and maintain a posture of cooperativeness and helpfulness while engaged in the intended gradual subversion. ==Origins== It was commonly believed that the term salami tactics () was coined in the late 1940s by Stalinist dictator M√°ty√°s R√°kosi to describe the actions of the Hungarian Communist Party in its ultimately successful drive for complete power in Hungary.Bullock, Alan, edited by Alan Bullock and Oliver Stallybrass The Harper dictionary of modern thought, Harper & Row, 1977.

Retrieved March 15, 2011 By portraying his opponents as fascists (or at the very least fascist sympathizers), he was able to get the opposition to slice off its right-wing, then its center, then most of its left-wing, so that only fellow travellers willing to collaborate with the Communist Party remained in power.Safire, William, Safire's Political Dictionary, Oxford University Press, 2008 (revised), p.639, , . However, no verified source for the origins of the \\"salami tactics\\" term has ever been discovered. According to historian Norman Stone, the term might have been invented by the leader of the Hungarian Independence Party Zolt√°n Pfeiffer, a hardline anti-communist opponent of R√°kosi. ==Later usage== The People's Republic of China has been accused by Indian army officials, Brahma Chellaney, and the Observer Research Foundation of using salami tactics for territorial expansion against its neighbors like India, Japan and countries in the South China Sea region, Tibet, Aksai Chin, and the Paracel Islands. ==Cultural referencesIn television=== Salami tactics are discussed by the British Chief Scientific Adviser in the Yes, Prime Minister episode, \\"The Grand Design\\". ===In film=== In the 2016 film Arrival, Agent Halpern mentions a Hungarian word meaning to eliminate your enemies one by one.

It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. ==Plot== Tom Thompson (David Schwimmer) is a 25-year-old man who sleeps in a bunk bed and lives with his mother. Tom is contacted by his high school classmate's mother, Ruth Abernathy (Barbara Hershey), to tell him that his \\"best friend,\\" Bill Abernathy, committed suicide, and is asked to give a eulogy at the funeral. Tom does not remember his friend, but out of sympathy attends the funeral as a pallbearer. While Ruth struggles with her loss and Tom with his supposedly failed memory, the two develop a romance. Meanwhile, Tom's unrequited high school crush, Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), re-enters his life. At Abernathy's funeral, Tom's vague and impersonal eulogy confuses the Abernathy family and amuses Tom's friends. Julie, upset at their lack of respect, tries to leave as the pallbearers carry Bill's coffin out of the church. Tom, one of the pallbearers, drags the coffin and the rest of the pallbearers after Julie. He asks her if she knew Bill; she replies that she did not know Bill, but was saddened by the image of Bill in the coffin. Tom asks Julie out for coffee still holding up Bill's coffin. Bill's relatives, upset about Tom's indifference towards Bill, forcefully relieve him of his duty as a pallbearer. Visibly upset, Ruth states that Tom is in Bill's will. Afterwards, Tom calls Julie about the coffee date and Julie asks if Scott and Cynthia can come along for a double date. During dinner with Scott and Cynthia, it is apparent that Julie and Scott have more in common and listen to the same musicians. Conversation between Tom and Julie is stilted and awkward, while Scott slips up and reveals that Tom still lives with his mother. Disgusted by Scott's behavior during dinner, Tom reluctantly follows through with the plan to drive Julie home. When they reach Julie's home, Julie reveals that she remembered Tom in high school. As Tom leans in for a kiss, Julie turns her head colliding against Tom's. Julie states she had given off the wrong signal to Tom, since she is planning on moving away. Tom is rejected at the end of his second interview and goes to Ruth's to help pack Bill's belongings. While looking through pictures of Bill growing up, Ruth and Tom kiss and have sex on Bill's bed. Ruth tells Tom about Bill's father, a Vietnam War veteran, who is implied to have died in the war. Tom, in turn, tells Ruth about Bill's fictitious love interest based completely on Tom's infatuation with Julie. Tom and Ruth continue to see each other as Tom reveals more about his own affections for Julie in the guise of Bill's affections and Tom's attempts to forget about Julie in Ruth's arms. Tom repeatedly watches Julie working at a record store while parked on the street. One day after the shop closes, Tom sees Julie let Scott into the store. Jumping into the driver's seat, Tom drives by and stops to see Scott lean in to kiss Julie. When Scott sees Tom, Tom drives off. The next morning, Julie comes to talk to Tom about Scott's attempt of infidelity, not knowing Tom had witnessed the entire event. Reminiscing about high school band, Julie tells Tom that she wants to just drive away for a year just to be on her own. Julie invites Tom to a concert she had planned on going with her former fianc√©, Jed. When arriving at Ruth's, Tom is rushed to a family gathering of Abernathy's. At Aunt Lucille's, Tom sees that Ruth had overheard him talking to Julie about their date later that evening. When Tom's car breaks down, Julie finds Ruth's charm bracelet, so Tom tells her that he has been helping Bill Abernathy's mother since the funeral. Julie mistakenly assumes an innocent relationship between Tom and Ruth. After a tow truck takes Tom and Julie back to Tom's house, Tom sneaks into his mother's room to get her car keys, while Julie enters Tom's room. Tom reveals he wanted to dance with her at a homecoming dance and she kisses him. As they fall into Tom's bed, Ruth calls Tom finding out that Julie is in the room with him. When Tom goes to see Brad for advice, he tells Tom to drop the bracelet with a letter into a mailbox for a clean break with Ruth. Tom does as Brad tells him and proceeds to continue dating Julie. For Julie's birthday, Julie asks Tom to go with her to meet her parents. On that morning, Tom sees Ruth carrying the envelope with her bracelet and Tom's letter, so Tom sneaks away through the back door. At brunch with Julie's parents, it is immediately apparent that her father disapproves of Tom and Julie's relationship when he keeps asking why he is there with them. After Tom pleads with Julie to abandon her plans to leave for a year, Ruth barges into the restaurant and humiliates Tom by revealing their past relationship. At Brad's bachelor party, Tom makes a scene at the strip club telling Brad not to marry Lauren. Tom says Lauren is an albatross around his neck and Scott thinks so as well. The next day, Scott apologizes to Tom and they reconcile. While talking about past crushes growing up, they both realize that there was another Tom who moved away after junior high school. Tom brings the other Tom to Ruth, who appreciates the gesture to reminisce about her son. They come to an understanding about needing someone at the time, Ruth mourning her son and Tom being rejected by his childhood crush, Julie. At Brad's wedding, Tom patches his friendship with Brad approving of his marriage to Lauren, as Scott and Cynthia appear to talk civilly together hinting of reconciliation. During the reception, Tom sees Julie and gives her the keys to his car as a belated birthday present for her trip. She hints to him from a previous conversation that she wants to dance. Tom gets a new job and moves into Julie's apartment while she is on her trip. ==Cast== * David Schwimmer as Tom Thompson * Gwyneth Paltrow as Julie DeMarco * Toni Collette as Cynthia * Michael Vartan as Scott * Michael Rapaport as Brad Schorr * Barbara Hershey as Ruth Abernathy * Carol Kane as Mrs. Thompson * Bitty Schram as Lauren * Jean De Baer as Suzanne DeMarco * Mark Margolis as Philip DeMarco * Elizabeth Franz as Aunt Lucille ==ReceptionBox office=== The Pallbearer opened at #9 in its opening weekend (5/3-5) with $2,319,236.

At the beginning of the film, the two are driving towards the Kentucky farmhouse, Kilronan, where Jackson grew up, primarily to introduce Helen to Jackson's mother, Martha, during the Christmas holidays. They arrive late in the evening and go straight to bed. The next morning Helen awakens to Martha arranging the room, as she thought Helen was asleep in the other bedroom. During their stay Martha tries to convince Jackson to stay to help her run the farm. Helen notices that Martha cleans their room and arranges their things every day, including Helen's contraceptive. After returning to New York in the new year, Helen discovers she is pregnant after getting violently ill at work. When she informs Jackson of this, he asks her to marry him and she accepts. The wedding is held at Kilronan, where Helen meets Jackson's paternal grandmother, Alice, who tells Helen she doesn't trust Martha. Alice points out Martha is extremely smart and capable of doing the farmwork of four men. Before Alice can say more Martha interrupts. After the wedding they return to their New York apartment. Helen is assaulted by a burglar who steals her locket and makes sexual advances. When Helen tells him she's pregnant, he cuts her abdomen and leaves. The fetus is not injured. Martha arrives unannounced, saying she wants to sell Kilronan because she cannot run it alone. Helen tells Jackson she wants to move to Kentucky and in with Martha for a year and help renovate the land. Jackson tells Helen his father died in that house when he was seven and he blames himself because he ran into his father, pushing him down the stairs to his death. Jackson also tells Helen that his father had been cheating on Martha with a woman named Robin Hayes. Helen says they should go back to the farm so Jackson can face his \\"old ghosts\\". The couple move in with Martha, who attempts to divide them with subversive comments and manipulating the family friends and neighbors. When Helen goes to the doctor, she finds out Martha told him Helen wanted to have the baby at the house, even though Helen had never said that. Suspicious and increasingly annoyed, Helen talks to Alice who tells her that Jackson is not responsible for his father's death. He had landed on a nail puller at the bottom of the stairs, crushing his sternum, which, according to news reports was a freak accident. When Helen returns that evening she finds Jackson calling around asking for her whereabouts with Martha hovering close by. Helen's frigid attitude toward her mother-in-law prompts Martha to visit Alice and warn her to stay away from them. Having had enough of Martha's manipulations, Helen tells Jackson that Martha is tearing their marriage apart. He agrees to go back to New York and tells his mother, who appears to accept it gracefully. Martha is completely convinced the baby will be a boy, and that Helen is a bad influence on her son and unborn grandchild. Jackson leaves the farm on a work call, leaving Helen and Martha alone. That evening, Martha bakes a strawberry cheesecake for Helen laced with pitocin, a labor inducer. Helen wakes up the next morning, feeling strange. She discovers a baby room set up by Martha and finds the locket that was stolen from her in New York amongst the baby clothes. When Martha unexpectedly enters the room, Helen tries unsuccessfully to escape, driving to a neighboring farm and coming face to face with her attacker from New York, then attempting to escape on foot before Martha captures her at the side of the highway. Reluctantly, Helen gives birth at the house, with Martha looking on, offering assistance, but refusing to give Helen painkillers. Martha leaves the room to answer a phone call from Jackson. She tells him that everything is okay, but when Helen screams in pain, Martha hangs up. Helen eventually gives birth to a healthy boy. She begs Martha to hand her the baby, but Martha ignores her, telling the baby she is his mother. Martha tries to inject a needle full of morphine in Helen's arm, but Helen knocks the syringe away. By the time Martha retrieves it, she hears Jackson's footsteps in the house. In a scramble, she quickly cleans up, meeting Jackson at the door with the newborn baby. She tells him to leave Helen alone, as he has no idea what she's been through. The two leave Helen asleep, and Martha gives the baby to Jackson. That night, Martha enters Helen's bedroom with the syringe, but she finds Jackson awake in a chair next to the bed. Despite his mother's insistence that he return to bed, he stays, thereby thwarting her plan. The next morning, Helen awakens to see Jackson with the baby. As Helen finally holds her child she tells Jackson to ask Martha to make breakfast for them. At breakfast, Helen enters the house with an object in her bag. Helen says that it is the object that killed Jackson's father. She proceeds to tell Jackson the whole truth about his father's murder. She reveals that Robin Hayes, the \\"woman\\" Jackson believed his father had cheated on his mother with, was actually a male horse wrangler, with whom Martha had an affair. Helen also shows Jackson a vicious bruise from Martha's attempt to murder her so she could have him and their son to herself. Jackson's father was planning to leave Martha when he discovered the affair but Martha ended up killing him. Martha made Jackson think he did so she can bind him to her for the rest of his life. Jackson tells Martha that he never wants to see her again. Martha claims that Helen is only doing this because she is jealous of her. In utter disgust, Helen slaps Martha to the ground. Helen and Jackson then leave with their baby while Martha sobs on the floor, her hopes dashed. In the final scene, the couple visit Alice before they leave for good, presenting her with her great-grandson. ==Cast== * Gwyneth Paltrow as Helen Baring * Jessica Lange as Martha Baring * Johnathon Schaech as Jackson Baring * Nina Foch as Alice Baring * Hal Holbrook as Dr. Franklin Hill ==Soundtrack== Intrada released a limited edition album of Christopher Young's score on November 12, 2012. # Hush (18:32) # Little Baby (4:41) # Don't (7:56) # You (3:43) # Cry (5:39) # Mama's Gonna (10:36) # Buy You (4:44) # A (4:37) # Hush (Concert Suite) (15:01) ==Reception== The movie has earned a 13% freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes movie review website based on 39 reviews, widely panned by critics.

For his size he was an excellent sportsman, and was an excellent amateur golfer, teaming up with fellow NBC announcer Bud Stevens to win many matches in Southern California. Wilson began his radio career as a singer over Denver radio station KFEL in 1923.\\"Don Wilson Beaming Over Desert TV\\", Los Angeles Times, April 3, 1975. By 1929, he was working at KFI, and shortly afterwards for Don Lee at KHJ, in Los Angeles. In a 1978 appearance on Tomorrow with Tom Snyder, Wilson claimed he was fired from KHJ because he had bought a Packard from Earle C. Anthony, the business arch-rival of Cadillac dealer Don Lee and owner of KFI and KECA.Tomorrow with Tom Snyder, 4 April 1978, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg4RE2hVw1Q ==Career== Though best known for his comedy work with Benny, Wilson had a background as a sportscaster, covering the opening of the 1932 Summer Olympics. Don appeared in two Broadway shows in the 1930s, \\"The Passionate Pilgrim\\", which opened October 19, 1932, and \\"The First Legion\\", which opened October 1, 1934. Wilson first worked with Benny on the broadcast of April 6, 1934, concurrent with a short stint as announcer on George Gershwin's series, Music by Gershwin. At and , Wilson possessed a resonant voice, a deep belly laugh, and a plump figure, all of which would become important parts of his character with Benny. Though Wilson's primary function as announcer was to read the opening and the commercial pitches ‚Äî notably for Jell-O, Grape-Nuts, and Lucky Strike ‚Äî his importance to the program was as both feed and foil to Jack and other cast members. A recurring goal was his effort to get the Sportsmen Quartet singing commercials approved by Benny. On radio in particular, Wilson's girth could be exploited, both in jokes by Benny and in audio gags, such as the amount of time it took a railroad porter to brush the soot off of Don following a train trip, or to measure charging him by the pound. Wilson rarely flubbed his lines. His most famous incident occurred on the January 8, 1950 broadcast. The script called for him to refer to columnist Drew Pearson, but Wilson read the name as \\"Dreer Pooson.\\" Later on in the broadcast, during a murder-mystery skit, Frank Nelson was instructed ‚Äì without Jack Benny's knowledge ‚Äì to take advantage of the situation. Benny asked Nelson, \\"Pardon me, are you the doorman?\\" and Nelson, in his customary sarcastic manner, came back with: \\"Well who do you think I am, Dreer Pooson?,\\" to sustained laughter and applause. Wilson also served stints as announcer for radio comedy or variety shows starring Alan Young, Bing Crosby, Ginny Simms, and Fanny Brice's comedy hit Baby Snooks. In 1946, Don Wilson was a regular on the daytime comedy Glamour Manor, opposite former Jack Benny Program regular Kenny Baker. Wilson accompanied Benny into television in 1950, remaining with him through the end of the series in 1965. On television, the fat jokes were toned down only slightly, mostly because the real Wilson was not as impossibly large as the radio Wilson was described. These appearances also often involved the fictional character of Don's equally hefty, aspiring announcer son, Harlow (played by Dale White). Wilson co-starred with Benny in Buck Benny Rides Again (1940) and voicing a caricature of himself in The Mouse that Jack Built, a 1959 Warner Brothers spoof of The Jack Benny Program directed by Robert McKimson. Wilson appeared in the Broadway show \\"Make a Million\\", which opened on October 23, 1958. In 1959, Wilson appeared as a flim-flam preacher in the episode, \\"Gates Ajar Morgan\\", on the syndicated anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, Morgan promotes a false religious philosophy based on the novel The Gates Ajar. He must confess the sham to save his friend and benefactor from a lynch mob. The episode also features Chris Alcaide and Sue Randall. His other film roles included small appearances as announcers or commentators in several films, providing narration for Walt Disney's Academy Award nominated short Ferdinand the Bull, and a credited appearance as Mr. Kettering opposite Marilyn Monroe in Niagara. His role in the film Village Barn Dance was acclaimed by a review that said, \\"Surprise performance was that of Don Wilson ... who steals the show with his portrayal of a good-humored, grinning radio announcer.\\" Wilson did frequent commercials and appeared in the Western Union Candygram commercials as their spokesman from 1969 through 1971. Those who recall the commercial remember him blaring out \\"Just tell them I want to send a Candygram.\\"\\"Western Union, Don Wilson, Candy Gram, Mother's Day,\\" YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8IkfCkBVVQ His final on-camera appearance in a series was in two episodes of the 1960s Batman as newscaster Walter Klondike (spoofing Walter Cronkite). Wilson would continue to appear on talk-shows throughout his life whenever a program would salute Jack Benny or talk about old-time radio. ==Personal life== Wilson was married four times. His second wife was Peggy Ann Kent, daughter of 20th Century Fox President Sidney R. Kent. They were married November 19, 1940 and divorced in December, 1942.Wife Divorces Don Wilson; Charges Extreme Cruelty. Chicago Daily Tribune, December 4, 1942. The same month the divorce was final, Wilson married Polish countess Marusia Radunska. This marriage ended in divorce in 1949.Don Wilson's Wife Says Television Broke Up Marriage. Chicago Tribune, June 18, 1949. Wilson finally found a lasting partnership with fourth wife, radio actress Lois Corbett (who occasionally appeared as \\"Mrs. Wilson\\" on Benny's later radio and TV shows).

The movie draws its title from ring announcer Michael Buffer's catchphrase, \\"Let's get ready to rumble!\\" The movie features many wrestlers from WCW. This film is also notable for being the media debut of future wrestler John Cena, who makes an appearance as an extra in a scene taking place at a gym. == Plot == Dimwitted sewage workers Gordie Boggs and Sean Dawkins watch their favorite wrestler, WCW World Heavyweight Champion Jimmy King cheated out of the title by Diamond Dallas Page, an evil WCW promoter named Titus Sinclair, and DDP's partners. After the match, the duo expresses their rage while driving in their septic truck, resulting in a car crash with Gordie and Sean surviving. After this event, Gordie believes that the car crash was supposed to happen and that they should make Jimmy King once again the World Heavyweight Champion. Gordie asks a friend to find out where King lives, and they go to an unexpected- looking neighborhood where they find King's estranged wife and his parents. King's parents tell Gordie and Sean that King borrowed their mobile home and never returned it. The duo finds King and becomes over-excited. They have a conversation, and when King says that he has given up on wrestling, Gordie and Sean anger him to the point where he suddenly attacks them. This attack on the boys prompts a change of heart for King where his passion for wrestling returns. The trio proceeds to go on a road trip to the next WCW Nitro taping in New York City. Gordie sends letters to his father, a police officer who wanted Gordie to follow in his footsteps. Gordie writes that he will not join him in the police force, making him frustrated. Gordie, King, and Sean arrive at the Nitro taping where they hide King in a port-a-potty and they meet one of the Nitro Girls, Sasha. When DDP mocks Jimmy King on camera, King comes out of the port-a-potty and attacks him. Sinclair then declares a Steel Cage match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship plus a $1,000,000 cash prize, with the added stipulation that if King loses, he will never wrestle again. Sasha is impressed by Gordie, and they later go to her apartment to have dinner. When Sasha attempts to have sex with Gordie, he reacts like it's a wrestling match and pushes her off of him. Jimmy King is in deep need of a trainer for the match, so he, Gordie, and Sean head to the residence of retired wrestler Sal Bandini, where he accepts becoming King's trainer. The trio then heads to a local gym, where King meets his former partner, Bill Goldberg. King asks Goldberg to help in the upcoming match, but he turns him down, saying that King has no chances of winning. Then that night, Sid Vicious and Perry Saturn attack Sal, hospitalizing him. At the hospital, Gordie overhears Sasha at a phone booth, where he learns that Sasha was working under the orders of Sinclair the entire time, therefore realizing his relationship with her was a total sham; Gordie breaks up with her as a result. As the trio return to Gordie and Sean's home town in Wyoming to continue training, Gordie's father steps in and forces him to abandon his wrestling aspirations and join the police force. Sean and King try to convince Gordie to get out of becoming a police officer, but he refuses. He does, however, hold a huge party for King that wishes him luck in the Steel Cage match. On the night of the match, King is once again outnumbered by DDP's goons but he suddenly receives help from Goldberg, Booker T, Billy Kidman, Disco Inferno, Sting, and Gordie, who ride in on a police motorcycle debuting his new gimmick as \\"The Law.\\" King ultimately wins the match by dropping DDP from the top of the cage to the floor of the ring. As Jimmy King comes up victorious and once again WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Titus gets beaten up by Sean and Gordie (as well as by the fans). Goldberg later asks King to re-team with him, but announces his new partner will be Gordie and their manager will be Sean. An epilogue shows Sean telling some local kids \\"dreams can come true\\" at a convenience store, where Gordie and Goldberg teach the store clerk a lesson for being mean to kids by hurling him out on the street. All ends happily as the heroes ride off in a stretch limousine Hummer, together with Sal, now fully recovered in a hot tub with beautiful women. ==Cast== * David Arquette as Gordie Boggs a.k.a ‚ÄúThe Law‚Äù * Scott Caan as Sean Dawkins a.k.a ‚ÄúSugar Daddy‚Äù * Oliver Platt as Jimmy King * Joe Pantoliano as Titus Sinclair * Rose McGowan as Sasha * Martin Landau as Sal Bandini * Ahmet Zappa as Cashier * Jill Ritchie as Brittany * Richard Lineback as Mr. Boggs, Gordie's father * Chris Owen as Isaac * Melanie Deanne Moore as Wendy * Caroline Rhea as Eugenia King * Tait Smith as Frankie King * Ellen Albertini Dow as Mrs. MacKenzie * Kathleen Freeman as Jane King * Lewis Arquette as Fred King ===Wrestling personalities=== * Goldberg * Diamond Dallas Page * Sting * Randy Savage * * Sid Vicious * Juventud Guerrera * Curt Hennig * Disco Inferno * Billy Kidman * Konnan * Rey Mysterio Jr. * Perry Saturn * Prince Iaukea * Van Hammer * Gorgeous George * Announcers Michael Buffer, Gene Okerlund, Tony Schiavone and Mike Tenay * Referees Charles Robinson and Billy Silverman * The Nitro Girls: Chae, Fyre, Spice, Storm, Tygress * John Cena (uncredited) ==Production== The character of Sal Bandini is based on wrestlers Lou Thesz and Stu Hart. Oliver Platt accidentally struck Randy Savage in the face during the filming of a fantasy scene. The footage of the incident, which was shot over Savage's shoulder, can be seen in the blooper reel shown during the closing credits. Chris Kanyon was Platt's stunt double, and Shane Helms was David Arquette's stunt double. The character of Titus Sinclair is based on WCW President and Executive Producer Eric Bischoff, who was originally planned to star in this movie as a fictionalized version of himself, but was fired from WCW before filming began. ==Publicity== Following the release of the movie, WCW decided to generate publicity for the company by running a storyline in which David Arquette, a legitimate wrestling fan, became WCW World Champion. The storyline was reviled by wrestling fans, and Arquette himself reportedly believed it was a bad idea, as he felt that it would damage the value of the World Heavyweight Championship he held in such high regard. While in WCW, he aligned himself with Diamond Dallas Page (despite Page being the movie's villain) and agreed (in storyline) to drop the title to him. He eventually lost the title in the main event of Slamboree involving the three-tiered cage seen in Ready to Rumble, pitting himself against Page and Jeff Jarrett, which ended when he turned on Page and allowed Jarrett to win. Arquette later donated all the money WCW paid him to the families of deceased wrestlers Owen Hart, Brian Pillman, and Brian Hildebrand, plus to wrestler Darren Drozdov who was left paralyzed due to an in-ring accident a year prior.\\"Brian Pillman Memorial Show Results from Cincinnati, OH - 05/25/00\\", by Mike I., DDTDigest.com The Triple Cage was used by WCW only twice: first, at Slamboree 2000, Jeff Jarrett beat Diamond Dallas Page and David Arquette (defending the WCW World Heavyweight Championship) to win the title. In this match, Chris Kanyon was thrown from the roof of one of the cages, \\"paralyzing\\" him. The other, taking place on the September 4, 2000 episode of WCW Monday Nitro, was the 2000 edition of the WarGames match. ==Critical reception== Ready to Rumble received a largely negative reception, garnering a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 23% based on 70 reviews, with an average score of 3.9/10. Its consensus states, \\"Humor at its lowest that isn't funny for kids and is insulting to adults\\". On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has an average score of 23, based on 26 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert said that the movie works best when focusing on the aspects of professional wrestling instead of the \\"wheezy prefab\\" Dumb and Dumber antics and felt there was misuse of both Platt and Landau, citing the former's comedic talents being wasted and having an actual wrestler in his place instead, and the latter being more suitable in dramatic works. BBC film reviewer Neil Smith commended the efforts of both Platt and Landau in their respective roles but felt the film overall was the typical Hollywood comedy, consisting of \\"oafish slapstick and lavatorial humour in place of genuine wit or imagination\\", concluding that it \\"has its moments, but ultimately feels just as bogus as the Lycra-clad charlatans it lionises.\\" The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin criticized the filmmakers for trying to satirize and indulge in the world of wrestling and ignore it for rehashed humor from films like The Wedding Singer and Mallrats, concluding that, \\"[I]n its attempts not to offend wrestling fans or the wrestlers who make brief, bland appearances, Ready To Rumble is plodding, obvious, toothless, and unfunny.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times mockingly said that the film does a deep exploration into the world of professional wrestling and its core fanbase, but in reality is \\"not a satire of the idiocy [of professional wrestling], but a long, self-satisfied wallow in it.\\" Chris Gramlich of Exclaim! backhandedly called it \\"the best Hollywood wrestling movie since No Holds Barred\\", giving credit to Chris Kanyon's wrestling choreography, the various WCW performers and the contributions from both Landau and McGowan being the film's saving graces, concluding that, \\"While Ready to Rumble may at times make even the most ardent wrestling ashamed by its use of wrestling stereotypes (some even justified); it does make you laugh almost as often. Almost.\\" The Austin Chronicles Marjorie Baumgarten agreed with the critics about the \\"asinine plot, premise, and performances\\" but admitted to laughing at a few moments that shows the film being honest with itself about its creation, concluding that, \\"Filled with lots of appearances by real wrestling stars, the movie seems a certain shoo-in among a certain demographic. But if you're going, hit the theatres soon because this one looks ready to tumble.\\" ==Music== The film score makes extensive use of classical music, both diegetic and non-diegetic. \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\" by Aaron Copland is featured as Jimmy King's theme music. \\"Siegfried's Funeral March\\" from G√∂tterd√§mmerung by German composer Richard Wagner plays quietly in the background during King's initial discomfiture at the hands of Titus Sinclair, played by Joe Pantoliano, and Diamond Dallas Page. A soundtrack for the film was released by Atlantic Records and 143 Records in both 'clean' and 'explicit' editions. Considering the Kid Rock song \\"Badwitdaba\\", the Lower Than You remix, is not deleted on the iTunes version of this soundtrack, it remained one of the only songs of Kid Rock to be available on iTunes, until most of his catalog was released on iTunes in 2013. ==ReferencesCategory:2000 films Category:2000s buddy comedy films Category:2000s comedy road movies Category:2000s sports comedy films Category:American buddy comedy films Category:American comedy road movies Category:American films Category:American sports comedy films Category:Films directed by Brian Robbins Category:Films with screenplays by Steven Brill Category:Films scored by George S.

He was one of the first converts to Smith's Church of Christ. Morley was present at many of the early events of the Latter Day Saint movement, and served as a church leader in Ohio, Missouri and Utah Territory. Morley was born on March 11, 1786 in Montague, Massachusetts, one of nine children of Thomas E. Morley and Editha (n√©e Marsh). He served in the War of 1812 from 1812‚Äì15, and later held the position of captain in the Ohio militia. In June 1812, Morley married Lucy Gunn in Massachusetts, with whom he had seven children. Some years after becoming a member of the church in 1830, he practiced plural marriage, taking Leonora Snow (the older sister of Lorenzo and Eliza R. Snow) and Hannah Blakesley (also found as Blaixly or Blakeslee) as his second and third wife in 1844 in Nauvoo, Illinois. Blakesley bore him an additional three children. Other wives included Hannah Knight Libby and Harriet Lucinda Cox, married 1846 in Nauvoo, Hannah Sibley and Nancy Anne Bache (also found as Back). ==Campbellite commune== Morley was an early settler in the Western Reserve wilderness area of northern Ohio, and created a productive farm in the region near Kirtland, Ohio. While in this area, he joined the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement (aka the Campbellites), under the ministry of Sidney Rigdon, and was a leader of a utopian group that practiced communal principals, holding goods in common for the benefit of all. Members of this group included Lyman Wight, and Morley's brother-in-law Titus Billings. Eight additional families joined in 1830. The society was sometimes called the \\"Morley Family,\\" as Rigdon caused a row of log houses to be built on Morley's farm, where a number of the society's members could live periodically. ==Latter Day Saint movement== In November 1830, Morley was among the first converts to the newly organized Church of Christ, the original name of the Latter Day Saint church founded by Joseph Smith. He was introduced to the teachings of Smith when Oliver Cowdery and several missionary companions passed through Ohio. He was ordained an Elder shortly after his baptism. When Joseph Smith and his family came to Kirtland, Ohio for the first time, they lived with Isaac Morley. He later built a small house for them on his farm, where Joseph's and Emma's twins, Thaddeus and Louisa, were born and died only three hours later on April 30, 1831. Isaac's daughter, Lucy and her elder sister kept house for Emma while she was ill. Morley was ordained a High Priest on June 3, 1831 by Lyman Wight, and was immediately selected for a leadership position. He was ordained, on 6 June, as First Counselor to Bishop Edward Partridge and served until Partridge's death in 1840. In June 1831, Morley was asked to sell his farm and act as a missionary while traveling to Independence, Missouri with Ezra Booth (see: Doctrine and Covenants 52:23). While in Missouri, Morley first faced the violence generated by disagreements and misunderstandings between Mormon settlers and Missouri residents. In July 1833, a mob of about 500 men demolished the home and printing office of William Wines Phelps at Independence and tarred and feathered Bishop Partridge. Willing to be injured or killed, Morley and five others stepped forward and offered themselves as a ransom for these men. After negotiation, the Missouri citizens agreed to stop the violence and the Mormons agreed to leave the county by April 1, 1834. Morley left Missouri and returned to Kirtland in early 1835. He was in attendance at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple in March 1836 and was among the first to receive the washing and anointing also known as the \\"initiatory\\". In 1835, with Bishop Partridge, Morley served a mission in the Eastern States. They returned to Kirtland on 5 November 1835; on 7 November Pres. Smith wrote: > The word of the Lord came to me, saying: \\"Behold I am well pleased with my > servant Isaac Morley and my servant Edward Partridge, because of the > integrity of their hearts in laboring in my vineyard, for the salvation of > the souls of men. Morley returned to Missouri with his family in early 1836, and helped establish the city of Far West. At a general church assembly on November 7, 1837, he was chosen as Patriarch of Far West and ordained under the hands of Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon and Hyrum Smith. He lived in Far West until he was arrested with fifty-five other Mormon citizens on the basis of the Extermination Order of Governor Lilburn W. Boggs. The citizens were taken by the Missouri militia to Richmond, Ray county, to await trial. After being held for three weeks, all the prisoners were released by Judge Austin A. King on November 24, 1838. Upon leaving Missouri with the expelled Saints, Morley settled in Hancock County, Illinois, in a settlement called Yelrome (from the reverse spelling of \\"Morley\\"). There he established a prosperous business as a cooper. In October 1840, Hyrum Smith appointed Morley to serve as president of the stake centered in Lima, Illinois, with John Murdock and Walter Cox as counselors. In March 1845, he was selected to be a member of the Council of Fifty. However, in September 1845, his houses, cooper's shop, property and grain were burned by a mob, and his family took refuge in the Mormon center of Nauvoo. From there, they moved to Winter Quarters, where Morley's first wife, Lucy, died. ==Utah settlement== Morley emigrated to the Great Salt Lake Valley in 1848 with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) following the death of Joseph Smith, and is considered the founder of Manti, Utah. After Ute Indian leader Wakara invited Church president Brigham Young to send Mormon colonists to the Sanpitch (now Sanpete) Valley in central Utah, Young dispatched Morley and James Russell Ivie as leaders of the first company of 225 settlers. Morley and his group felt that part of the purpose of the settlement was to bring the gospel to the Indians. He wrote, Did we come here to enrich ourselves in the things of this world? No. We were sent to enrich the Natives and comfort the hearts of the long oppressed. (May, p. 104) Morley and the settlers arrived at the present location of Manti in November 1849, and established a winter camp, digging temporary shelters into the south side of the hill on which the Manti Utah Temple now stands. It was an isolated place, at least four days by wagon from the nearest settlement. Relations between the Mormons and the local Utes were helpful and cooperative. The first winter was severe and, although the settlers were fairly well supplied, they had great difficulties. A measles epidemic broke out and the settlers used their limited medicine to nurse the Indians. When supplies ran low, Indians helped settlers haul food on sleds through the snow. Morley encouraged the settlers in their work and assured them that their community would grow to be one of the best in the mountains. The settlers and members of the Ute Sanpitch tribe referred to him affectionately as \\"Father Morley\\". Morley supervised the building of the first schoolhouse and the first gristmill in Sanpete Valley. The Sanpete Valley settlement grew and prospered and became known as a prime agricultural area. Morley served as a senator in the general assembly of the provisional State of Deseret. In 1851, 1853 and 1855, he represented Sanpete county in the legislative council of the Utah Territory. During his last years, Morley spent most of his time on his calling as a Patriarch, conferring priesthood blessings on thousands of church members. He died on June 24, 1865 in Fairview, Sanpete County, Utah. On a wall inside the Manti Utah Temple is a framed piece of temple clothing used by Morley in the Nauvoo Temple when he was endowed there. ==See also== *Fountain Green Massacre ==References== *Allen, James B. and Leonard, Glen M.

The publisher's name was derived from Prometheus, the Titan from Greek mythology who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to man. This act is often used as a metaphor for bringing knowledge or enlightenment. Prometheus Books publishes a range of books, focusing on topics such as science, freethought, secularism, humanism, and skepticism. It has published in the \\"atheism\\" category since its founding in 1969, and is considered the \\"grandfather\\" of atheist publishing in America. Their headquarters was located in Amherst, New York, and they publish worldwide. Jonathan Kurtz is executive editor of Prometheus, which is an imprint of Globe Pequot Press. The publisher has roughly 1,700 books currently in print and publishes approximately 95‚Äì100 books per year. Since its founding, Prometheus Books has published more than 2,500 books. == Imprints == Prometheus Books obtained the bulk of the books and manuscripts of Humanities Press International in 1998. It has been building and expanding this into a scholarly imprint named Humanity Books. This imprint publishes academic works across a wide spectrum of the humanities and is now distributed by the academic division of Rowman & Littlefield. In March 2005, Prometheus Books launched the science fiction and fantasy imprint Pyr. In October 2012 it launched the crime fiction imprint Seventh Street Books. In 2018, it sold both imprints. == Lawsuits == Prometheus has been involved in two \\"major libel lawsuits.\\" In 1992 Uri Geller sued Victor J. Stenger and Prometheus Books for libel over his book Physics and Psychics. The suit was dismissed and Geller was required to pay more than $20,000 in costs to the defendant.

The film features multiple cameo appearances including Tommy Hilfiger, Kenneth Cole, Diane von F√ºrstenberg, Kevyn Aucoin, Andr√© Leon Talley, Samia Shoaib, and Gwyneth Paltrow. ==Plot== Jocelyn Bennett (Swain), is an intern at the fictional New York City magazine, Skirt. Horribly mistreated, overworked, and underpaid, Jocelyn lives for Skirt, especially the photo spreads. A spy begins to hand over Skirts spreads and story ideas to its rival glossy, Vogue. Skirt magazine finds itself in a bind and some people begin speculating who the infiltrator (everyone refers to the spy as a yuri) might be. After some fingers begin to point at Jocelyn, she seeks to apprehend the spy and clear her name. Along the way, she meets Paul Rochester (Ben Pullen), the British deputy art director at Skirt, with whom she has much in common. When she finds herself falling in love, one thing stands in her way: Paul's supermodel girlfriend, Resin (Leilani Bishop). Jocelyn continues to search for the spy but several obstacles stand in her way including Art Director Sebastian Niedarfarb (Billy Porter) who believes she is the spy and consistently puts Jocelyn down. However, as she begins to climb the ranks, she begins to stand out to the editors who realize her potential, though they quickly forget it. To make Paul jealous, she starts dating a photo shoot tech named Alex, though the relationship doesn't last. Jocelyn later learns that Resin is only dating Paul because he is related to Prince Charles. Soon after, the spy is apprehended. For her work, Jocelyn is made an assistant, on staff, and finally gets better treatment from her colleagues. During a party thrown by Skirt, Resin dumps Paul for another model, and Paul and Jocelyn get engaged. Two years later, the happy couple are shown on a PBS tour done by the newest intern at Skirt. Jocelyn has been made the senior photo editor at the magazine and Paul accomplished his dream of becoming a famous artist.

Stephen Holden of The New York Times said, \\"The biggest mystery about Intern is how a film about people who are obsessed with appearances could wind up looking so hopelessly drab and tacky.\\" Others have found the film lacking in some aspects but had redeeming qualities. Stephen MacMillan Moser of the Austin Chronicle said, \\"Intern isn't a particularly deep movie, but, to paraphrase Karl Lagerfeld, fashion is not the same thing as feeding the hungry and curing the ill.\\" Emanuel Levy of Variety said, \\"The fashion world is ripe with possibilities for a biting satire, but Lange's Sundance Festival entry is pedestrian, offering a disappointingly flat look at the glamour industry.\\" == See also == * The Devil Wears Prada (2006) ==ReferencesIntern DVD on Amazon.com Category:2000 films Category:Films about fashion Category:American satirical films Category:American films Category:2000 in fashion Category:2000 comedy films Category:Films set in New York City Category:Works about fashion magazine publishing ","title":"The Intern (2000 film)"},{"id":"2216383","text":"CIXN-FM is a Canadian radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick.

The facility, originally called Dzerzhinskaya () station, opened in 1935 as part of the first stage of the metro. ==Name== The station was originally named Dzerzhinskaya after Dzerzhinsky Square, but it was changed on 5 November 1990 after the square's original name, Lubyanka, was restored. There is still a bust of Felix Dzerzhinsky in the station vestibule. ==History== Construction work on the station began in December 1933, and the engineers were faced with extremely difficult soil conditions from the outset. The area under Lubyanka square is made of Jurassic clay, beneath which are layers of quicksand and Carboniferous clay. The Metro station was planned to rest on top of the Carboniferous clay, which was thought to be firm enough to support its weight. It was quickly discovered, however, that the clay was much softer than anticipated due to the proximity of an underground channel of the Neglinnaya River and also tended to swell greatly when exposed to air. This meant that the tunnels had to be built one section at a time, very quickly, in order to allow the concrete to set before the pressure exerted by the expanding clay increased to the point where the wooden forms could no longer contain it. Nikolai Ladovsky's initial design had to be significantly modified in order to cope with these problems. In order to minimize the amount of excavation required, the planned full-length central hall was abandoned in favour of a short passage at the end of the station connecting the two platform tubes, similar to many London Underground stations. This simplified the construction of the station while still allowing the planned hall to be built in the future. Even after the design change, the station's construction was plagued by difficulties. Quicksand from between the two layers of clay began to seep into the construction site almost immediately, and due to the unexpected softness of the Carboniferous clay the station began to slowly sink. Nevertheless, the builders of the station were able to surmount these problems and Lubyanka was opened as planned on May 15, 1935. The heroic efforts of the Metro builders are memorialized in a sculptural composition in the vestibule on Nikolskaya street. In 1965 it was revealed that Lubyanka was to become a transfer point to the planned Tagansko- Krasnopresnenskaya Line, making it clear that the station would need to be completed. Technology had advanced to the point where the building of the central hall, which had been deemed impossible in the 1930s, could finally be accomplished, though this project still took more than seven years to complete. The first phase of the station's expansion was the construction of a second entrance at the northern end, which was completed in 1968. The construction of the northern half of the central hall was simplified by using the new technique of soil freezing, but this could not be used on the southern half. Workers were forced to go back to the original method of quickly building one tunnel segment at a time before the expansion of the clay could crush them. Once the central hall was finished passages to the platforms were blown through using explosives. In 1972 the station was finally reopened. The reconstruction of the station was an engineering triumph, but it was much less impressive aesthetically with blocky white marble pylons and white tiled walls replacing the strikingly patterned dark marble used in the old station. Though the old section of the central hall still exists, the overall effect has been lost. The architects of the expansion were Nina Alexandrovna Aleshin and A.F. Strelkov. In 1975, escalators were added in the centre of the platform for the transfer to the new Kuznetsky Most station. ==Entrances and transfers== The station has numerous entrances, but only two vestibules. The original western vestibule is subterranean and its entrance pavilion is built into the ground floor of a building that stands at the start of the Nikolskaya Street on one side and Malyy Cherkassky side street on the other. The distinctive facade, facing the Lubyanka square, with twin arches was designed by architect Iosif Loveyko, to remind the public of the historic Vladimir gates of the Kitay- gorod wall that was demolished a few years prior. In 1957 a subway was built connecting the vestibule and the new Detsky Mir (Children's World) shop, under the Teatralny drive. The original 3 N-type escalators were replaced in 1997 by ET-3M type (21.8 metres/71 ft high), during which the vestibule underwent renovation. The second entrance was opened in 1968, due to the landscape and the axis of the station platform to vestibule is done via two escalators and an interim mezzanine station that rotates the passenger traffic by 180 degrees. The large incline from platform to the mezzanine retains the three LT-4 21.4 metre (70 ft) high escalators. The 7 metre (23 ft) high smaller incline to the subterranean vestibule originally had three LP-6I escalators, but as this model proved troublesome after long use, it was prematurely replaced throughout the Metro during the 1990s. Lubyanka's turn came in 1995 and three ET-5Ms now soldier in their place. Building of the vestibule included a reconstruction of the whole square, that feature a long subway under the square's square's eastern and southern perimeter: two entrances on the corner of the FSB headquarters and a service drive along its western facade, two on the corner of FSB's computing centre (Lubyasky drive and Myasnitskaya street), a further two to the small garden before the Polytechnical Museum the containing the Solovetsky Stone memorial (Lubyansky drive and Novaya square) and a final two right in front of the original entrance. From the new subway, a small passageway was added linking the old vestibule underground. It is thus possible to circumvent the whole square underground and walk from one vestibule to the other without descending to the platforms. In 2008 the Detsky Mir was closed for reconstruction, and the original building that the entrance was built into was demolished in 2010 and a Kempinski hotel is being erected in its place, though the ground floor and facade are retained. Thus the only way to access the original vestibule is via the mentioned passageway. The station serves as a transfer point to Kuznetsky Most, which linked by a passenger tunnel under the station. Access to which is provided by a pair of tandem escalators in the middle of the central hall. Like on the entrance, the original four LP-6I units, in place since 1975, were replaced in 1993 by ET-5M series. ==2010 bombing== On 29 March 2010 a bomb was reported to have gone off at the Lubyanka station, on the Sokolnicheskaya (–°–æ–∫–æ–ª—å–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è), during rush hour, at 7:56 AM local time.

After the streets were elevated, these spaces fell into disuse, but have become a tourist attraction in recent decades. ==History== Start of the Great Seattle Fire, looking south on 1st Avenue near Madison Street A view looking upwards at the pavement lights (glass skywalks).

Pioneer Square had originally been built mostly on filled-in tidelands and often flooded. The new street level also kept sewers draining into Elliott Bay from backing up at high tide. For the regrade, the streets were lined with concrete walls that formed narrow alleyways between the walls and the buildings on both sides of the street, with a wide \\"alley\\" where the street was. The naturally steep hillsides were used and, through a series of sluices, material was washed into the wide \\"alleys,\\" raising the streets to the desired new level, generally higher than before, in some places nearly . At first, pedestrians climbed ladders to go between street level and the sidewalks in front of the building entrances. Brick archways were constructed next to the road surface, above the submerged sidewalks. Pavement lights (a form of walk-on skylight with small panes of clear glass which later became amethyst-colored) were installed over the gap from the raised street and the building, creating the area now called the Seattle Underground. The concrete floor of the former meat market was originally at the level of the wooden platform on the left, but sank over time because of decomposing sawdust fill. When they reconstructed their buildings, merchants and landlords knew that the ground floor would eventually be underground and the next floor up would be the new ground floor, so there is very little decoration on the doors and windows of the original ground floor, but extensive decoration on the new ground floor. Once the new sidewalks were complete, building owners moved their businesses to the new ground floor, although merchants carried on business in the lowest floors of buildings that survived the fire, and pedestrians continued to use the underground sidewalks lit by the pavement lights (still seen on some streets) embedded in the grade- level sidewalk above. In 1907, the city condemned the Underground for fear of bubonic plague, two years before the 1909 World Fair in Seattle (Alaska-Yukon- Pacific Exposition).

Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons. Three-field system with ridge and furrow fields (furlongs) The three-field system let farmers plant more crops and therefore increase production. Under this system, the arable land of an estate or village was divided into three large fields: one was planted in the autumn with winter wheat or rye; the second field was planted with other crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third was left fallow (unplanted). Cereal crops deplete the ground of nitrogen, but legumes can fix nitrogen and so fertilize the soil. The fallow fields were soon overgrown with weeds and used for grazing farm animals. Their excrement fertilized that field's soil to regain its nutrients. Crop assignments were rotated every year, so each field segment would be planted for two out of every three years. Previously a two- field system had been in place, with half the land being left fallow. With more crops available to sell and agriculture dominating the economy at the time, the three-field system created a significant surplus and increased economic prosperity. The three-field system needed more plowing of land and its introduction coincided with the adoption of the moldboard plow. These parallel developments complemented each other and increased agricultural productivity. The legume crop needed summer rain to succeed, and so the three- field system was less successful around the Mediterranean. Oats for horse food could also be planted in the spring, which, combined with the adoption of horse collars and horseshoes, led to replacement of oxen by horses for many farming tasks, with an associated increase in agricultural productivity and the nutrition available to the population.Wigelsworth, Jeffrey R. (2006). Science and technology in medieval European life. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 10. One of the first Germans to question this system, and new ways of expanding beyond this medieval system was Johann Friedrich Mayer, in his 1769 work Lehre vom Gyps als vorzueglich guten Dung zu allen Erd-Gewaechsen auf Aeckern und Wiesen, Hopfen- und Weinbergen.Roeber, A.

It is situated in the very centre of Moscow in the Tverskoy District, near the Kremlin, Manezhnaya Square and State Duma. It is named after a nearby street, which name literally means \\"hunters' row\\". ==History== Okhotny Ryad station is located under what was originally the swamplands of the upper Neglinnaya River. Later two ancient churches stood on the site, and their graveyards were excavated during the construction of the station. The station opened as part of the original Metro line on 15 May 1935. Okhotny Ryad has been renamed more times than any other Metro station. Planned to be called Okhotnoryadskaya, it was opened as Okhotny Ryad instead. The station was renamed Imeni Kaganovicha in honour of Lazar Kaganovich during the brief period between 25 November 1955 and 1957, when its original name was restored. The station's name was changed once more on 30 November 1961, to Prospekt Marksa (the station still contains a mosaic portrait of Karl Marx). Finally, on 5 June 1990, the original name was restored once more. ===Construction=== The construction of Okhotny Ryad presented a number of engineering challenges. The task of wedging a metro station into the narrow space between two major buildings, the Hotel Moskva that has been re-built, and what is now the State Duma building, at a depth of only without damaging their foundations was further complicated by the difficult soil conditions in the area, including numerous underground water channels. The station was built using a so-called \\"German\\" method in which the station walls were constructed above ground and then lowered into the construction site. This helped to brace the foundations of the nearby buildings during the subsequent construction of the station vault and pylons. The station was originally planned to be a bi-vault design similar to many London Underground stations, but Lazar Kaganovich, who was in charge of the Moscow Metro project at the time, insisted that the station be changed to a tri-vault design after of tunnel had already been bored. A major setback occurred when accumulated rainwater broke through the vault before it had been completely sealed and flooded the station. Though no one was injured in the disaster, construction had to be halted while the damage was repaired. Okhotny Ryad station platform ==Interiors== The architects, Yuri Revkovsky, N. Borov, and G. Zamskoy, employed a silvery marble from Italy for the finishing of the pylons, the only documented case where imported material was used in the Metro. The walls are faced with ceramic tile. The finishing of the station, which involved the installation of more than of marble, of plaster, and thousands of square metres of tile as well as lighting and decorations, was completed in just two weeks. In 2004, Okhotny Ryad underwent a major renovation which included replacing the lighting elements inside the spheres and repainting the plaster from light beige to white. A further renovation took place in 2007/2008 when the old ceramic tiles were replaced by bright marble, though a small tiled section was retained. An average of 42,110 passengers per day enter the station through its vestibules with an additional 241,000 passengers entering via Teatralnaya. ==Entrances== The station has two subterranean vestibules, each linked with the platform via an escalator. During the construction of the vestibules, orders of the Moscow's party committee prohibited the obstruction of traffic, so American bridges had to be built over the pits of the future vestibules. The eastern vestibule, through a mezzanine level is situated on the ground floor of a building situated on the corner of Bolshaya Dmitrovka street, Teatralny Drive, and Teatralnaya Square. The facade of this building was redesigned by Dmitry Chechulin and originally incorporated sculptures of athletes which were modeled after performers from the Moscow Circus. The original three N-type escalators were replaced by ET-5M units in 1997 (9.2 metres/30 ft high). The vestibule also acts as a transfer point to the Teatralnaya station. The western vestibule's original N-type escalators were replaced in 1990 by the ET-5M series (also 9.2 metres/30 ft high). The vestibule's original entrance was built into the ground floor of Hotel Moskva, on the corner of Manezhnaya Square and Okhotny Ryad street. In 1959 the original structure was expanded with the first of many underground subway networks, and opened on 21 November. Dual descent entrances appeared on both corners of the Tverskaya Street, in front of the original entrance. The tunnel the continued along the facade of the Hotel Moskva, to offer entrance on both sides of the driveway between Manezhnaya Square and Revolution Square (closed to traffic only in 1990s). The final addition came in 1997 when a new underground mall was opened under the Manezhnaya Square, a direct access was made possible from the 1959 network. When the original Hotel Moskva was closed for demolition in 2004, the original entrance on its northwest corner was also demolished. It is unknown whether there are plans to restore it in the new building. ==Transfers== Okhotny Ryad station is connected to Teatralnaya station of the Zamoskvoretskaya Line. Originally, when opened in 1938, transfer was only possible via the eastern vestibule. A direct transfer was under construction, but did not open until 30 December 1944.Some sources say 1940. It features a long inclined tunnel that descends towards Teatranalaya. As the system grew, the original arrangement proved inadequate to handle the large passenger load and on 7 November 1974 a second transfer tunnel was opened. Access to both transfer routes is done via escalators in the centre of the platform. The original two tandem N-type escalator pairs were replaced in 2001 by ET-5M series (8.3 metres high). In the mezzanine under the platform the northwards direction carries passenger to Teatralnaya, whilst the southern direction brings them from the station via the older 1940s transfer. Thus the escalators are also one way, with the western on descent and vice versa. There is no direct transfer to Ploshchad Revolyutsii station of the Arbatsko- Pokrovskaya Line, which must be reached via Teatralnaya station. ==References Category:Moscow Metro stations Category:Tverskoy District Category:Railway stations in Russia opened in 1935 Category:Sokolnicheskaya Line Category:Railway stations located underground in Russia ","title":"Okhotny Ryad (Moscow Metro)"},{"id":"2216448","text":"Jason Ricci (born February 3, 1974) is an American harmonica player and singer.

He also posts free video harmonica lessons to his web site, and teaches live lessons via Skype. ==Personal life== Ricci has been openly \\"queer\\" gay/bisexual most his career and has been outspoken about this subject in many interviews. This has been a professional obstacle as well as an opportunity for Ricci to challenge both gay stereotypes and traditional blues expectations: > The [gay] community doesn't like drum sets and guitars and actual live > music. They're used to lip-synching, and dudes in dresses, and Madonna, and > Cher, and techno beats. Those are the things that kept me from coming out > earlier. I felt like I had nothing in common with the gay community, and I > still don't feel like I have a lot in common with the community. I'm hoping > that changes, but the majority of their icons are press-friendly little > Mickey Mouse-doll figureheads that you're more likely to see on a show > redecorating somebody's house than onstage at a blues festival... When I > came out of the closet as a gay white male from an upper-middle-class > suburban home, I came out as not just gay, but as a white guy, and as a guy > who likes punk, and as a guy who didn't come from total poverty, and all > those things that we associate with being 'blues' things. And when I did > that, I wanted to sing about that. I wanted to write songs about what my > life was like, and I wanted to use terminology that was modern.Long, Autumn > . \\"Jason Ricci Gets His Rocks Off\\" . Blues Revue Magazine .

He was considered a famous matin√©e idol and leading man of the 1920s and 1930s. He was given an Academy Honorary Award in 1940 and three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. ==Early life== Born in Keokuk, Iowa, into an upper-middle-class family, he was the son of a musician father, Dr. Frank L. Nagel, who was of German descent, and a mother, Frances (n√©e Murphy), who was a locally praised singer. Nagel's mother died early in his life, and he always attributed his artistic inclination to growing up in a family environment that encouraged self-expression. His father, Frank, became dean of the music conservatory at Highland Park College and when Nagel was three, the family moved to Des Moines. After graduating from Highland Park College in Des Moines, Iowa, Nagel left for California to pursue a career in the relatively new medium of motion pictures where he garnered instant attention from the Hollywood studio executives. With his frame, blue eyes, and wavy blond hair; the young, Midwestern Nagel was seen by studio executives as a potentially wholesome matinee idol whose unpretentious all-American charm would appeal to the nation's nascent film-goers. ==Film career== Nagel was immediately cast in film roles that cemented his unspoiled lover image. His first film was the 1918 retelling of Little Women, which quickly captured the public's attention and set Nagel on a path to silent film stardom. His breakout role came in the 1920 film, The Fighting Chance, opposite Swedish starlet Anna Q. Nilsson. In 1918, Nagel joined The Lambs, the historical theater club. In 1927, Nagel starred alongside Lon Chaney Sr., Marceline Day, Henry B. Walthall and Polly Moran in the now lost Tod Browning directed horror film, London After Midnight. Unlike many other silent films stars, Nagel had little difficulty transitioning to sound films. His baritone voice was judged to be perfect for sound, so he appeared in about thirty films in only two years. He described the time as a \\"great adventure.\\" He was working so steadily that one night when he and his wife planned to go to the movies, he was in the movie playing at Grauman's, Loew's, and Paramount's theaters. \\"We couldn't find a theater where I wasn't playing. So we'd go back home. I was an epidemic.\\" He spent the next several decades being very well received in high-profile films as a character actor. He was also frequently heard on radio and made many notable appearances on television. ===AMPAS & SAG=== On May 11, 1927, Nagel was among 35 other film industry insiders to found the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS); a professional honorary organization dedicated to the advancement of the arts and sciences of motion pictures. Fellow actors involved in the founding included: Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Richard Barthelmess, Jack Holt, Milton Sills, and Harold Lloyd. He served as president of the organization from 1932 to 1933. He was also a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG). Nagel was elected to The Lambs, the New York-based theater organization, in 1918. Nagel was the host of the 3rd Academy Awards ceremony held on November 5, 1930, the 5th Academy Awards on November 18, 1932, and a co-host with Bob Hope at the 25th Academy Awards ceremony on March 19, 1953. The 21-year gap between his appearances in 1932 and 1953 is a record for an Oscar ceremonies host. ==Radio and television== Nagel was the announcer for Alec Templeton Time, a musical variety program on NBC Radio in the summer of 1939. He was the host on Silver Theatre, a summer replacement program that began June 8, 1937. From 1937 to 1947, he hosted and directed the radio program Silver Theater. He then hosted the popular TV game show Celebrity Time from 1948 to 1952 and the DuMont Television Network program Broadway to Hollywood from 1953 to 1954. In 1961, again on television but in an acting role, he made a guest appearance on the popular courtroom drama Perry Mason, portraying the character Nathan Claver, an art collector and murderer, in the episode \\"The Case of the Torrid Tapestry\\".\\"The Case of the Torrid Tapestry\\", S04E23, Perry Mason series, originally broadcast in the United States on the CBS television network, April 22, 1961. IMDb. Retrieved September 5, 2018. Templeton later hosted his own TV show It's Alec Templeton Time on the DuMont Television Network from June 1955 to August 1955. From September 14, 1955 to June 1, 1956, Nagel hosted Hollywood Preview, a 30-minute show on the DuMont Television Network which featured Hollywood stars with clips of upcoming films. ==Personal life== Nagel married and divorced three times. His first wife, actress Ruth Helms, gave birth to a daughter, Ruth Margaret (October 29, 1920-June 14, 2013). His second wife was actress Lynn Merrick. His third wife was Michael Coulson Smith, who gave birth to a son Michael (1949-2020). Nagel died in 1970 in New York City at the age of 72. A spokesman for the office of the Chief Medical Examiner said that Nagel's death was \\"due to natural causes\\", more specifically, a heart attack and emphysema. He added that no autopsy was planned. Nagel was cremated at Garden State Crematory in North Bergen, New Jersey. His remains are interred at the Lutheran Cemetery in Warsaw, Illinois. ==Awards and honors== In 1940, Nagel was given an Honorary Academy Award for his work with the Motion Picture Relief Fund. For his contributions to film, radio, and television, Conrad Nagel was given three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1719 Vine Street (motion pictures), 1752 Vine Street (radio), and 1752 Vine Street (television). ==FilmographySilent=== *Little Women (1918) as Laurie Laurence *The Lion and the Mouse (1919) as Jefferson Ryder *Redhead (1919) as Matthew Thurlow *Romeo's Dad (1919, Short) *The Fighting Chance (1920) as Stephen Siward *Unseen Forces (1920) as Clyde Brunton *Midsummer Madness (1921) as Julian Osborne *Forbidden Fruit (1921) as Actor in play 'Forbidden Fruit' (uncredited) *What Every Woman Knows (1921) as John Shand *The Lost Romance (1921) as Allen Erskine, M.D *Sacred and Profane Love (1921) as Emilie Diaz, a pianist *Fool's Paradise (1921) as Arthur Phelps *Saturday Night (1922) as Richard Prentiss *Hate (1922) as Dick Talbot *The Ordeal (1922) as Dr. Robert Acton *Nice People (1922) as Scotty White *The Impossible Mrs. Bellew (1922) as John Helstan *Singed Wings (1922) as Peter Gordon *Grumpy (1923) as Ernest Heron *Bella Donna (1923) as Nigel Armine *Lawful Larceny (1923) as Andrew Dorsey *The Rendezvous (1923) as Walter Stanford *Name the Man (1924) as Victor Stowell *Three Weeks (1924) as Paul Verdayne *The Rejected Woman (1924) as John Leslie *Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1924) as Angel Clare *Sinners in Silk (1924) as Brock Farley *Married Flirts (1924) as Perley Rex *The Snob (1924) as Herrick Appleton *So This Is Marriage (1924) as Peter Marsh *Excuse Me (1925) as Harry Mallory *Cheaper to Marry (1925) as Dick Tyler *Pretty Ladies (1925) as Maggie's Dream Lover *Sun-Up (1925) as Rufe *Lights of Old Broadway (1925) as Dirk de Rhonde *The Only Thing (1925) as Harry Vane - the Duke of Chevenix *Dance Madness (1926) as Roger Halladay * Memory Lane (1926) as Jimmy Holt *The Exquisite Sinner (1926) as Dominique Prad *The Waning Sex (1926) as Philip Barry *There You Are!

It encompasses the two towns of Cabo San Lucas and San Jos√© del Cabo (the municipal seat) linked by a twenty-mile Resort Corridor of beach-front properties and championship golf courses. The area was remote and rural until the latter 20th century, when the Mexican government began to develop Cabo San Lucas for tourism, which then spread east to the municipal seat. The main draw is the climate and geography, where desert meets the sea, along with sport fishing, resorts and golf. This tourism is by far the main economic activity with over two million visitors per year. Over 1 million visit from the United States. Although San Jos√© del Cabo is the seat of government for the municipality of Los Cabos, it is smaller than the other city of Cabo San Lucas. However, because of federal and private investments in tourism, its growth is now rivaling that of the more famous resort area. This growth has been regulated to outside of the town center, especially to the south where the beaches are, leaving the historic town center quiet and relatively unchanged. There are still cobblestone streets, adobe houses, jacaranda trees and a central square in front of a church that dates from the 1700s, where people still gather in the evening when it is cooler. A number of the large houses in the center date from the 19th century, and most of these have been converted into restaurants, art galleries and shops selling everything from fine handcrafts, silver, local gemstones and souvenirs. The art scene in the town is well-developed because of tourism and people with vacation homes. These shops carry high end paintings, sculptures in from traditional Mexican, Mexican contemporary and international artisans and artists. During the high season from October to May, these galleries stay open late into the night. The town has resisted the addition of large shopping malls and chain stores. There is also some colonial era architecture as well, but this style has more in common with colonial towns to the north into the United States rather than the center and south of Mexico. The main example of colonial architecture here is the town's parish church. It was part of the Estero de las Palmas de San Jos√© del Cabo Mission, founded in 1730. The facade is marked with a tile mural depicting the martyrdom of founder Nicol√°s Tamaral, killed by the local Pericu people . The patron saint of the town is Saint Joseph, whose feast day is celebrated here on March 19. Another important occasion is the feast of the Our Lady of the Pillar on October 12. Occasions like these are marked with traditional dance in dress styles known as ‚ÄúFlor de Pitaya‚Äù and the ‚ÄúLa Cuera.‚Äù Other important landmarks in the town include the municipal hall (palacio municipal), which dates from 1981 and the cultural center or Casa de Cultura, housed in a 19th- century building. The tourist area of the town is the area between the town proper and the shoreline. This area has a nine-hole golf course and a line of hotels and resorts facing the ocean, which served over 900,000 hotel guests in 2011. ==The municipalityOverview=== Autopista San Jos√© del Cabo‚ÄìCabo San Lucas San Jose del Cabo is the seat and the government for the communities found in a 3,451.51km2 area, located in the extreme south of the state of Baja California Sur. It is connected to the capital of La Paz via the Transpeninsular Highway . The municipality borders that of La Paz to the north, with the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of California surrounding it in the other directions. The municipal government consists of a municipal president, a syndic and fourteen representatives called regidors. The main areas of the municipality are the seat, Cabo San Lucas, and the tourist corridor along the coast between them. Although San Jose del Cabo is the government, Cabo San Lucas has a higher population and its natural arch at Land's End is the symbol for the municipality. Outside of the two main cities, other important communities include Colonia del Sol, Las Veredas, Colonia Los Congrejos, San Jos√© Viego and La Ribera. The municipality is one of the most important tourist destinations in Mexico, for its fishing, beaches, and resorts. Historical landmarks are relatively few but include the municipal hall, the Casa de Cultura in San Jose del Cabo, the Faro Viejo and the San Jose del Cabo and Santiago de las Coras missions. The latter was founded in 1721 by Ignacio Mar√≠a Napoli. ===Cabo San Lucas and the tourist corridor=== View of the port of Cabo San Lucas The city of Cabo San Lucas, about twenty miles to the west of San Jose del Cabo, is far more commercial. Unlike most Mexican towns, Cabo San Lucas has no main plaza or large cathedral. Instead, it is centered around the marina and entertainment district. Up until the latter 20th century, the area was a small fishing village when tourist infrastructure was begun. Despite its success, high rise construction has been kept limited, focusing on resorts and sand-top restaurants in the beach area. The main attractions are fishing, nightlife and whale watching. It is a place for vacation, where most visitors stay at all-inclusive resorts. The two main events during the year are Spring Break and Sammy Hagar‚Äôs birthday which happens on the second weekend in October as his birthday is October 13, 1947. The latter focuses on his Cabo Wabo bar and restaurant in the city. The success of Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo has created a tourist corridor along the coastal highway between the cities. While there has been some development of resorts, hotels, and golf courses, there are still smaller isolated and undeveloped beaches. ==Socioeconomics== Royal Solaris resort in San Jose del Cabo By far the main economic activity for the municipality is tourism, focused on a shoreline corridor between Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Most visitors come from the United States (especially California) and Canada, followed by Mexico, and many visitors return year after year. Visitors can get by in Cabo San Lucas purely in English and use U.S. dollars. Most of the about two million visitors a year arrive by plane to the Los Cabos airport, but the Cabo San Lucas marina also has facilities for cruise ships. In 2012, the area has hotel occupancy of just over 60% with 248 cruise ships visiting. The area's high end resorts have also attracted notable names such as Bruce Willis, Kelly Preston and John Travolta, and San Jose del Cabo also has a notable expatriate population, mostly retirees who have economic influence. The main draw for most visitors has been the environment, where the desert meets the sea, best symbolized by El Arco, a natural stone arch over the ocean in Cabo San Lucas where the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California meet. The natural features have led to ecotourism such as boat tours to El Arco, tours of the San Jose Estuary and the coral reefs of Cabo Pulmo, and whale watching from January to March, when the animals are here to breed. Sports fishing is a major and the longest established draw as there are about 800 species of fish in the waters off the coast. High season for this activity is in the summer, the season for marlin, although fishing for various other species extends all year. There are certain exotic species that are off limits due to conservation concerns and others are ‚Äúcatch-and-release‚Äù only. There are four main golf courses in the municipality, designed by the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Pete Dye. Other activities for tourists include snorkeling, diving, dune-buggy rides, camel rides, zip-lining, rides on water-propelled jet packs, surfing (especially at the Acapulquito Beach), jet-ski riding, kayaking, sailing, horseback riding, ATV riding, hang gliding, mountain biking, camping, tennis and rappelling. Off the beaten path, there is the town of Miraflores (for its leather crafts), the Santiago fossil museum, the traditional towns of Cadua√±o, San Antonio and San Bartolo and a glass blowing factory. Los Cabos hosts a culinary event called Ritmos, Colores y Sabores, which attracts chefs from the United States and Europe. The gastronomy of the region is based on seafood, which includes clams, marlin, snails, tuna and shark. A locally produced liquor is Damiana, sweet and flavored with a local herb, said to be an aphrodisiac. The main export of the municipality is the production of salt. There are also limited mineral deposits, especially in the Capuano and Mezquite areas such as limestone and granite. The small town of Miraflores is known for its leatherwork, especially saddles and other gear for horseback riding. Jewelry and decorations made with shells are produced in San Jos√© del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas and Santa Rosa. Despite the development, 28.5% live in poverty and 5.6% live in extreme poverty; 18.1% live in substandard housing and 27.1% need food assistance. There are 313 schools from the primary to high school level. 9.3 years of schooling for those over 15. There are two vocational schools and twelve centers for adult education. There are no schools specifically targeting an indigenous population. ==Geography and environment== The desert and sea at Rancho Punta San Cristobal, Los Cabos The municipality of Los Cabos is at the southern end of the Baja California peninsula, where desert meets the sea and the Gulf of California meets the Pacific Ocean. The area was originally underwater, evidenced by the many fossils of marine animals, which are up to 25 million years old. The basement rock underlying Los Cabos formed even earlier, approximately 115 million years ago. The municipality has an average altitude of forty meters above sea level. There are three main terrain types, mountain terrain, semi flat areas and flat areas. The mountains consist of the Sierra de la Laguna and the Sierra de San L√°zaro, both formed of volcanic rock, covering about fifteen percent of the total territory with peaks between 400 and 1000 meters. The semi flat areas are located between the coast and the mountain ranges, mostly of sedimentary rock and account for sixty percent of the territory. The flat areas are along the coast, beaches and alluvial plains, which account for twenty five percent of the territory. One of the main natural resources is the beaches. Major beaches include Los Frailes, Buena Vista, Agua Caliente, Cabo San Lucas, Puerto Chileno and Punta Colorada, often promoted together as the Costa de Oro (Golden Coast). One very popular beach in Cabo San Lucas is Lover's Beach, which is surrounded by dramatic rock shapes. The sea experiences lows of 72‚Äì73 ¬∞F (22‚Äì23 ¬∞C) in winter, and highs of 77‚Äì84 ¬∞F (25‚Äì29 ¬∞C) during the summer months. { +Average Sea Temperature - !Jan !Feb !Mar !Apr !May !Jun !Jul !Aug !Sep !Oct !Nov !Dec - 73 ¬∞F 23 ¬∞C 72 ¬∞F 22 ¬∞C 72 ¬∞F 22 ¬∞C 72 ¬∞F 22 ¬∞C 73 ¬∞F 23 ¬∞C 77 ¬∞F 25 ¬∞C 81 ¬∞F 27 ¬∞C 84 ¬∞F 29 ¬∞C 84 ¬∞F 29 ¬∞C 84 ¬∞F 29 ¬∞C 81 ¬∞F 27 ¬∞C 77 ¬∞F 25 ¬∞C } Beach at San Jose del Cabo As it is on the edge of the desert that covers most of the Baja California peninsula, it is one of the sunniest locations in the world, with an average of 320 days of sunshine per year. The climate is characterized as hot and dry to the north of the town of San Jos√© del Cabo, hot and semi moist in San Jos√© and along the southern coast and temperate and dry in the highest elevations, because of cyclones that hit this area. Average annual temperature is 24C with the coolest month being January. There is a rainy season in the summer, with most rain in September. The rain and terrain make for a variety of micro climates, including areas with a climate similar to the Mediterranean. Areas between 0 and 400 meters are desert and semi-desert, with many areas having deep sand deposits. Higher elevations get more water and can have pine forests. The main surface water of the municipality is the R√≠o San Jos√© or San Jos√© River, which runs north to south, mostly during the rainy season. Other streams run only during rains and include Santiago, Miraflores, Cadua√±o and Las Palmas. There are subterranean deposits of water such as the Santiago and San Jos√© del Cabo, but the lack of water is the main impediment to human development in the area. A view of the San Jose Estuary The R√≠o San Jos√© stops just shy of the ocean, with a one km long sand bar creating an estuary, the third largest in Mexico. This pooling of brackish water has created an oasis in the surrounding Sarcocaule desert. The R√≠o San Jos√© flows largely underground for from its origin in the Sierra de la Laguna (Laguna Mountains), although its Miramonte River tributary adds almost an additional . Its tributaries flow down the eastern side of the sierra and include Santa Rosa, Santa L√°zaro, San Miguel, San Ignacio (at La Palma), Cadua√±o, Miraflores and San Bernard. The river used to flow above ground until the beginning of the 20th century due to anthropogenic causes. For more than 250 years the R√≠o San Jos√© has furnished drinking and irrigation water for the town of San Jose del Cabo, beginning as a source of fresh water for Spanish galleons traveling back from the Philippines.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Second edition, 1778, Edinburgh, page 1580. Scan of page can be found at http://www.hyzercreek.com/britannica.htm Over the sand bar from the estuary is a bay referred to by early Spanish explorers, including Sebastian Vizcaino, as the Bah√≠a de San Bernab√© or Bay of San Bernab√©, and now as the Bay of San Jos√© del Cabo. The estuary is home to both native and migratory birds and aquatic species, 250 species of tropical birds alone. Most of the migratory species use the area as a stopover on their way to southern Mexico, Central American and South America. It also acts as a nursery to many juvenile and larval stage species. It was declared a state environmental reserve, but pollution and excessive water extraction has caused it to degenerate, leading to a complaint by Greenpeace. One effort to improve the water situation is the creation of new water treatment plants in the 2000s. Vegetation varies mostly by altitude and soil type and how much moisture the area receives. However almost all species are those adapted to desert and semi-desert zones. The highest elevations have pine forests. Wildlife is varied and includes mammals such as badgers, skunks, coyotes, foxes, pumas and other wild cats, deer, raccoons, rabbits, bats and various rodents. Bird species include quail, doves, cardinals, woodpeckers, swallows and marine species such as pelicans and seagulls. There are over 850 species of aquatic animals off the coast such as marlin, sailfish, swordfish, tuna, dorado and whales. Many species and subspecies of both plants and animals are endemic only to Baja California. ==History== The indigenous Pericu names for San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas were A√±i√±i and Yenecami, respectively, with the current names given by the colonizing Spanish. The name of San Jos√© was given by Nicol√°s Tamaral in honor of Jos√© de la Fuente Pe√±a y Castrej√≥n, the Marquis of Villa Puente who sponsored the mission. The appendix of ‚Äúde Los Cabos‚Äù is to distinguish it from San Jos√© de Comond√∫ as well as its proximity to Cabo San Lucas. San Jose was also known as San Barnab√©, as the nearby bay was named this. Pirate Thomas Cavendish called Cabo San Lucas ‚ÄúSafe Port‚Äù as he hid there from Spanish authorities. The seal for the municipality of Los Cabos (referring to the two cities) was approved by the state government in 1981. When the Spanish arrived the main indigenous group in the area was the Pericus, a hunter-gather culture with Stone Age tools. It is possible that these people arrived to the region with a more evolved culture which later simplified to adapt to the harsh conditions. Evidence of this includes the region's cave paintings as the peoples found by the Jesuits did not have an artistic tradition. The Pericu people and culture were distinct from other indigenous groups, first by being taller and second by being polygamous in a tribal organization. Their diet consisted of local seeds and fruits, as well as fish, reptiles, and small mammals. Men were in charge of large game hunting of deer. Tile mural on the San Jose del Cabo church depicting the martyrdom of Father Nicolas Tamaral Hern√°n Cort√©s himself arrived here in 1535, and named the Gulf of California the Sea of Cort√©s (Mar de Cort√©s) the name still used for it in Spanish. The harsh conditions impeded colonization by the Spanish, which did not begin in earnest until 1730, when Father Jos√© Echeverr√≠a and Father Nicol√°s Tamaral founded a mission in what is now San Jose del Cabo in 1730. This date is considered the founding of the town, although a second ceremonial found took place in 1822, when it was declared a town of the Baja California territory. Diseases brought by Europeans devastated indigenous groups here, and in 1768 more missionaries arrived. While colonization was slow, the area was important as a way station for the Manila Galleon and other ships, which stopped here for fresh water, as well as fruits and vegetables. However, its remoteness also made it a place for pirates to hide. The first pirate in the area was Francis Drake in 1578, followed shortly after by Thomas Cavendish, both after the treasures from Spain's Asia trade. One major attack was that on the Santa Ana Galleon, whose looting caused the Spanish colonial government to explore and map the area around Cabo San Lucas at the very beginning of the 17th century. There were recommendations to establish a mission here, but this was rejected in favor of Loreto. This left Cabo San Lucas as a strategic hideout for English pirates until the 18th century. In 1709, pirate Woodes Rogers attacked the Nuestra Se√±ora de la Encarnaci√≥n y Desenga√±o. Hiding nearly a month in Cabo San Lucas, he also mapped the area and wrote detailed descriptions. He was followed by George Shelvocke in 1721, who later published the oldest known drawings of the Pericues. After Independence, the Baja Peninsula was part of the California province, but Cabo San Lucas was named head of a municipality. Its remoteness kept the area out of active participation of most of Mexico's 19th and early 20th century tumultuous history. One exception was the Mexican American War. Resistance to U.S. forces was organized in the small community of Santa Anita, near San Jos√©, headed by Jos√© Mat√≠as Moreno, Vicente Mejia and Jos√© Antonio Mijares, who was in charge of the marina at Cabo San Lucas. One of the main streets in the town is now named after Mijares, who died defending the town. The major political players during the Mexican Revolution were Manuel Gonzalez and Pedro Orozco, along with F√©lix Ortega. In 1915, Ildefonso Green Cese√±a, head of forces loyal to Venustiano Carranza, drove out those of Francisco Villa out of the southern part of the peninsula. Some development of the area began after the Mexican Revolution with a lighthouse at Cabo Falso as early as 1905, just southwest of Cabo San Lucas, in part to remind U.S. ships in the waters here that the territory remained Mexican. Today, it is known as the ‚ÄúFaro Viejo‚Äù (Old Lighthouse) and is a historic monument. In 1917, a U.S. company began tuna fishing operations here and had a floating processing plant. In 1927, the Compa√±√≠a de Productos Marinas based its operations in Cabo San Lucas and helped develop the port to make it open to tourism later. In the 1920s, the first road connecting San Jos√© del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas was begun but not completely finished until 1970. For the most part, the area remained rural and undeveloped until the latter 20th century, when the federal agency Fonatur began to develop a tourism industry here. Development began with Cabo San Lucas for vacationers, but then spread to San Jose del Cabo, but with a different direction with more art galleries and promotion of its traditional Mexican character. The current municipality of Los Cabos was created in 1981, separated from the municipality of La Paz, with the seat at San Jose del Cabo. The town had previously been a municipal seat of a municipality of the same name in 1917 but lost this in a political reorganization in 1972. == Crime == Reports of increased violence in the Los Cabos municipality are connected to the 2016 arrest of drug kingpin Joaquin Guzman, nicknamed \\"El Chapo,\\" following an interview with US actor Sean Penn for Rolling Stone Magazine. Instability that eluded Los Cabos, Mexico's \\"most prized and protected tourist resorts\\" according to the Los Angeles Times, stemmed from the void in the drug cartel. Generally the violence from fragmented, warring factions, seeking to gain control in the region, has not targeted tourists. \\"The vast majority of the violence is playing out in the poor desert hillside communities that house resort workers, far from the beaches that have made this region a magnet for business moguls and Hollywood stars.\\" The \\"lucrative drug-smuggling corridor\\" of the twin cities of Los Cabos has led to bloodshed among rival gangs contributing to the fastest-rising homicide rate in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur from 2015 to 2017. Warring gangs often use intimidation tactics to announce their presence such as hanging victims in public spaces next to banners called \\"narcomantas.\\" In December 2017, rival gangs hanged six bodies from bridges near major resorts, one with a public banner that was translated as: \\"This is what will happen to anyone who does not fall into line with us. It has been made more than clear that we hold all the power and that Baja north and south are ours.\\" Such signs are used to threaten government officials and serve as warnings or intentions of \\"cleansing\\" the drug- smuggling corridor. The city since then has considerably lowered the crime rate after the local government cracked down on violent cartels in early 2018. ==Notable Cabe√±oa== * Jesse Ventura ==References * Ayuntamiento de Los Cabos Official municipal government website.

The station went on the air under the experimental call sign of 10AD broadcasting at 1210 kilocycles in 1923. It was granted a full license as CFNB in 1926. CFNB then moved to 1030 in 1933, and finally to 550 in 1934. The station was affiliated with the CBC's Trans-Canada Network. In 1959 the station increased its power to 50,000 watts, giving it full-time coverage over most of the Maritime Provinces. The CBC affiliation was dropped in 1964 when the network started its own station in Fredericton, CBZ. CFNB played an adult contemporary format before switching to oldies in the early 1990s. In 1996, CFNB's parent company, Radio Atlantic, was granted permission to move its signal to 106.9 FM and to eliminate the AM transmitter.Decision CRTC 96-9 The call sign changed in the process, and after a brief simulcast period, CFNB 550 signed off the air on June 11 of that year. The new station, CIBX, played soft adult contemporary music. The former CFNB call sign now belongs to a radio station in D'Arcy, British Columbia, known as CFNB-FM. Over time, CIBX evolved towards hot adult contemporary. Between 2000 and 2005, CIBX used the on-air EZ Rock branding along with other stations in Canada (while using Capital FM as a secondary name), although it returned to using only the \\"Capital FM\\" name.

The station was opened on May 15, 1935 as a part of the first stage of the Metro. It is situated in the very centre of the city under the Mokhovaya Street, and is named for the nearby Russian State Library (called the Lenin Library in 1925 ‚Äì1992). Its architects were A. I. Gontskevich and S. Sulin. To prevent the disruption of traffic, Biblioteka Imeni Lenina was built using underground excavation rather than cut and cover even though the station ceiling is just two metres (6.5 ft) below ground level. Soil conditions and the narrowness of the space in which the station was to be built necessitated a single-vault design, the only one on the first Metro line. The entire excavation was only 19.8 metres (65 ft) wide and 11.7 metres (38 ft) high. The main station vault was built from rubble stone set in concrete and reinforced with an iron framework. This was lined with an \\"umbrella\\" of bitumen-coated paper to prevent groundwater from seeping into the station. The station was finished with plaster, yellow ceramic tile, and marble. The station originally had two entrance vestibules, one at either end. The southern vestibule, located between the old and new buildings of the State Library, is shared with Borovitskaya. The temporary northern vestibule, which served Biblioteka Imeni Lenina and Aleksandrovsky Sad, was removed in the 1940s. ==Transfers== From this station it is possible to transfer to Arbatskaya on the Arbatsko- Pokrovskaya Line, Aleksandrovsky Sad on the Filyovskaya Line, and Borovitskaya on the Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya Line. Though Biblioteka Imeni Lenina and Aleksandrovsky Sad (then called Komintern) were built concurrently, they were not connected by transfer passages until 1938, when Aleksandrovsky Sad became part of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line.

The Ball or Bahl family had a long association with the English Crown, and had originally emigrated to the County of Norfolk in England from lands in what is now Germany. In 1690, the family purchased lands in New York's Mohawk Valley, paying one shilling per acre to the Crown. Subsequently, they emigrated and settled there. During the American Revolution, the Ball family maintained their allegiance to the Crown. In 1782, Jacob moved to what is now Canada with most of his sons and fought with the Loyalist Butler's Rangers and Queen's Rangers militias for the remainder of the Revolutionary War. Jacob, a Captain in the Rangers, brought much of his company with him. The family received a land grant from the Crown in 1783, and the remainder of the family emigrated to Canada in the following year, 1784. Two of Jacob's sons, John and George, received 1200 acres (486 ha) of land in Niagara in 1807. Twenty Mile Creek, which runs through the area, has two waterfalls. The Ball brothers built a grist mill, a saw mill at the lower falls and a woollen mill at the upper falls. During the War of 1812, the settlement was heavily utilized by the military, as part of a regiment was stationed there for a time. The town began flourishing and soon a blacksmith, tailor, weaver and butcher lived on the land. By 1852 the population of the town, then Glen Elgin, grew to 19 inhabitants. In the late 1850s, the Great Western Railway was established and many moved away from Glen Elgin and were located closer to the railway. In 1962 Manly Ball sold the land to the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Area and the town, now known as Ball's Falls, is a tourist attraction. The falls in Winter 2019 ==Geography== Located in the Niagara region of Ontario, Ball's Falls currently occupies around one sixth of the 1200 acres bought by the Ball brothers. It has a mild climate as a result of its location, which is south of Lake Ontario and north of Lake Erie.Ball's Falls Official Website - Geography There are two waterfalls on Twenty Mile Creek. The upper falls are 35 feet (10.7 m) high, and the lower falls are 90 feet (27.4 m) high. ]The falls can be viewed from above and below. The gorge has also become an area of scientific interest. The lower falls pass over Irondequoit limestone, a firm layer over several weaker sandstone layers. The rock of the upper falls is formed of the same unit, the Lockport Formation, that forms the crest of Niagara Falls. ==Conservation== Thousands of plant and animal species grow throughout the conservation area. The list of plant species totals 471 and includes plants such as wild sarsaparilla, green and white trilliums, wild ginger, wild geranium, Virginia bluebells, Canada yew, arrowhead, wild leek, asparagus, wild yam, red mulberry, wild columbine, Canada anemone, chokecherry, Virginia creeper and St. John's wort.Ball's Falls Official Website - Ecology Ball's Falls is made up of hardwoods mixed with coniferous trees, lying within the deciduous forest zone. Tree species include Eastern cottonwood, butternut, black walnut, shagbark hickory, white oak, tulip tree and slippery elm. Rare species include sycamore, sassafras and pignut hickory. The species of fish living in Twenty Mile Creek include the largemouth bass, yellow perch, grass pickerel, rock bass, green sunfish, creek chub and pumpkinseed. Among the species of birds found at Ball's Falls are the eastern bluebird, indigo bunting, house sparrows, northern cardinals, mallards, killdeer. ==Today== After the purchase of Ball's Falls by the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority in 1962, the area became a conservation area. The park features the Ball's Falls Centre for Conservation to help visitors learn of the area's cultural and natural history. The building, designed to have a limited impact of the surrounding environment, features permanent and temporary galleries, exhibits and interactive displays, including the conservation practices of the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority, archaeological findings, and the watershed ecosystem of Twenty Mile Creek. Still standing within the park are the original Ball family home, an operating gristmill, a lime kiln, a restored church, a blacksmith shop, and a carriage shed. ==References *Ball's Falls - official website *Ball's Falls - Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority Category:Ghost towns in Ontario Category:Conservation areas in Ontario Category:Protected areas of the Regional Municipality of Niagara Category:Nature centres in Ontario Category:Museums in the Regional Municipality of Niagara Category:Historic house museums in Ontario Category:Mill museums in Canada Category:Open-air museums in Canada Category:Lime kilns in Canada ","title":"Ball's Falls, Ontario"},{"id":"2216501","text":"The Consultation on Common Texts (CCT) is \\"an ecumenical consultation of liturgical scholars and denominational representatives from the United States and Canada, who produce liturgical texts for use in common by North American Christian Churches.\\" Its most significant product is the Revised Common Lectionary. ==See also== *English Language Liturgical Consultation ==References * The CCT web site Category:Christian organizations based in North America Category:Practical theology ","title":"Consultation on Common Texts"},{"id":"2216504","text":"Ted Halstead (July 25, 1968 - September 2, 2020) was an American author, policy entrepreneur, and public speaker who has founded four non-profit think tanks and advocacy organizations: the Climate Leadership Council, Americans for Carbon Dividends, New America, and Redefining Progress. His areas of expertise included climate policy, economic policy, environmental policy, healthcare, and political reform. Halstead published numerous articles and two books, including The Radical Center: The Future of American Politics (co- authored with Michael Lind). His articles have appeared in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, Fortune, The Washington Post, The Atlantic, National Review, and the Harvard Business Review, among other publications.

The Climate Leadership Council aims to promote a carbon dividends framework as the most cost-effective, politically-viable and equitable climate solution, and was founded in collaboration with a who's who of business, opinion and environmental leaders. The Climate Leadership Council was soft-launched on May 19, 2016, with the publication of Halstead's white paper, \\"Unlocking the Climate Puzzle\\". This report summarizes the economic, geopolitical, and psychological reasons that climate progress is deadlocked, and suggests that a carbon dividends plan could overcome each of these barriers. The Climate Leadership Council was officially launched on February 8, 2017 with the publication of \\"The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends\\", co-authored by James A. Baker III, Martin Feldstein, Halstead, Gregory Mankiw, Henry M. Paulson, Jr., George P. Shultz, Thomas Stephenson, and Rob Walton. This report argues that a new climate strategy based on carbon dividends can strengthen America's economy, reduce regulation, help working-class Americans, shrink government, and promote national security. A profile in Bloomberg suggested the release of this report \\"may be the biggest day for climate policy since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015.\\" Since then, the Climate Leadership Council has recruited a number of \\"Founding Members\\" which include: * Corporate Founding Members: AECOM, Allianz, AT&T;, Ford, GM, Johnson & Johnson, IBM, MetLife, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo, Santander, Schneider Electric, Unilever * Energy Founding Members: BHP, BP, Calpine, ConocoPhillips, Exelon, ExxonMobil, First Solar, Shell, Total, Vistra Energy * NGO Founding Members: Conservation International, World Resources Institute, World Wildlife Fund * Individual Founding Members: Ben Bernanke, Steven Chu, Ray Dalio, Martin Feldstein, Ted Halstead, Stephen Hawking, N.

The national co- chairs of Americans for Carbon Dividends are former Republican Senate majority leader Trent Lott and former Democratic Senator John Breaux. Americans for Carbon Dividends was publicly launched in June 2018 with the publication of a New York Times op-ed by Senators Lott and Breaux, entitled ‚ÄúHow to Break the Climate Impasse.‚Äù Americans for Carbon Dividends is funded by a wide range of interests, including leading auto manufacturers, tech companies, energy companies and trade associations from across the economy, including those in oil and gas, solar, wind, nuclear and geothermal. Americans for Carbon Dividends represents the first time that leading oil and gas companies have put their money behind a meaningful national price on carbon, and the first time that such a broad coalition of U.S. energy interests have co-funded an advocacy campaign to promote a price on carbon. As of January 2020, corporate funders of Americans for Carbon Dividends include: AWEA, BP, Calpine, ConocoPhillips, EDF Renewables, Exelon, ExxonMobil, First Solar, Ford, GM, IBM, Shell and Vistra Energy. The leadership of Americans for Carbon Dividends also includes former Republican member of Congress Ryan Costello as Managing Director, Steve Rice as Managing Director and Greg Bertelsen as Executive Vice President. ==Previous organizations foundedRedefining Progress=== In 1993, at age 25, Halstead founded Redefining Progress, an environmental economics think tank based in San Francisco, with a $15,000 seed grant from Echoing Green. Halstead served as Executive Director from 1993 to 1997. In 1995, Redefining Progress released the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), an alternative to the GDP that takes social and environmental costs into account. The GPI was launched in an October 1995 cover story in The Atlantic entitled \\"If The Economy Is Up, Why Is America Down?\\" that Halstead co-authored with colleagues Clifford Cobb and Jonathan Rowe. In 1997, Redefining Progress organized the Economists' Statement on Climate Change to promote market-based solutions to climate change. Over 2,600 economists and 19 Nobel Prize winners signed the statement. Redefining Progress and Halstead also promoted the idea of a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which the government of British Columbia was the first to implement in 2008. Halstead stepped down as Executive Director of Redefining Progress in 1997, moving into a position on the board. Redefining Progress closed its doors in 2008. ===New America=== Halstead founded New America (formerly known as New America Foundation) in 1999, at the age of 30, and served as founding President and CEO until 2007. Under his leadership, the organization grew rapidly to a staff of 100 and an annual budget of $10 million. New America's original mission was to bring new voices and new ideas into the public debate, and to break out of the traditional liberal and conservative categories. James Fallows was the original chairman of New America's board of directors. Eric Schmidt, former Executive Chairman of Google and Alphabet Inc, served as chairman of New America's Board from 2008 to 2016. Shortly after founding New America, Halstead and Michael Lind co- authored \\"The Radical Center: The Future of American Politics,\\" which Senator John McCain described as ‚ÄúA political manifesto worthy of the Information Age.‚Äù As a result, New America became known in its early years as a \\"Radical Centrist\\" think tank. On December 10, 2001, The Washington Post published a Styles Section profile on Halstead entitled \\"Big Thinker: Ted Halstead's New America Foundation Has It All: Money, Brains and Buzz\\". Steve Coll succeeded Halstead as President and CEO of New America in 2007. Anne-Marie Slaughter became New America's third President and CEO in 2013. == TED Talk == On May 17, 2017, Halstead delivered a TED Talk entitled ‚ÄúA Climate Solution Where All Sides Can Win‚Äù at the 2017 TED Annual Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. As of December 2019, this TED Talk had received over 1.5 million views and was translated into 20 languages. Halstead begins his TED talk by detailing what he sees as the three main barriers to climate progress: a) the psychological barrier; b) the geopolitical barrier; and c) the partisan barrier. He goes on to explain how the conservative carbon dividends plan that he co-authored with leading Republican statesmen‚ÄúThe Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends‚Äù, clcouncil.org, February 2017. Retrieved February 7, 2017. can overcome each of these barriers. In his talk, Halstead states, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm convinced that the road to climate progress in the United Stated runs through the Republican party and the business community.‚Äù He also explains that under their plan, ‚ÄúWe would end up with less regulation and far less pollution at the same time, while helping working class Americans get ahead.‚Äù At the end of the talk, TED Curator Chris Anderson came on stage for a Q&A; session with Halstead, and began by saying: \\"I'm not sure I've seen a conservative get a standing ovation at TED before\\". ==Yachting== In March 2008, shortly after getting married, Halstead and his wife Veronique Bardach set sail and departed westward from France aboard a 50-foot Catana catamaran yacht that they named Verite (a play on the first two letters of their names and of their dog Ria, who accompanied them). Although Halstead and his wife hoped to complete a circumnavigation by returning to the Mediterranean via the Red Sea, the piracy situation in the Gulf of Aden in 2012 was too dangerous to permit this. So they sold their boat in Bali in late 2012 after 4.5 years of non-stop sailing, during which they visited 5 continents. ==Death== Halstead died in Spain on September 2, 2020, when he fell 30 meters while hiking. https://www.ultimahora.es/sucesos/ultimas/2020/09/02/1193679/fallece- senderista-caer-por-acantilado-metros-capdella.html ==Books== * Ted Halstead and Michael Lind (2001).

He played in Major League Baseball for the Milwaukee Brewers, Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox, Houston Astros, San Francisco Giants, and Baltimore Orioles from 2002 through 2012. ==Professional careerMilwaukee Brewers=== In the season, Hall helped the Brewers to their first .500 season since 1992. Splitting time among third base, shortstop, and second base, Hall had a batting average of .291 with 17 home runs and 62 RBIs. The following season, Hall played behind newly acquired third baseman Corey Koskie, shortstop J. J. Hardy, and second baseman Rickie Weeks. On May 17, , Hall became the Brewers' starting shortstop after Hardy injured his ankle. On Mother's Day 2006, with the Brewers playing the New York Mets, Hall hit a walk-off home run in the 10th inning. He hit the home run using a special Mother's Day pink bat with his mother, Vergie Hall, in attendance. After the game he dedicated the home run to her. When the bat was later auctioned to raise money for breast cancer research, Brewers owner Mark Attanasio purchased the bat and gave it to Hall's mother. The final bid on the bat was over $25,000, the third-highest total ever paid for an auction item on mlb.com.Notes: Capuano understands snub brewers.com In November 2006, Hall represented Major League Baseball in the Japan All-Star Series. Hall became the Brewers' leader offensively with a .553 slugging percentage, 85 RBIs, and 35 home runs. He also led his team in runs scored (101), doubles (39), triples (4), total bases (297), and walks (63). As a result of his play, the Brewers named him the most valuable player of the team. On February 5, 2007, Hall signed a four-year deal for $24 million with the Brewers. There is also a $9.25 million option for a fifth season in 2011.Brewers, Hall agree on four- year deal brewers.com Hall opened the season as a center fielder, batting fourth. In 2007, he led all major league center fielders in errors with 9, and had the lowest fielding percentage among them, .971, as well as the lowest zone rating, .837. On June 12, 2007, Hall drew three of the four walks issued by Justin Verlander in his no-hitter against the Brewers. Milwaukee Brewers in 2008 Hall entered the season as the Brewers' starting third baseman, following the move of Ryan Braun to left field. In May, the Brewers called up left-hander Russell Branyan from Triple-A to platoon at third base with Hall, after Hall struggled to get hits against right-handed pitchers for much of the early part of the season. Still in the lineup, Hall expressed his disappointment on June 3, 2008, by saying that if he was not going consistently to start for the Brewers, he might want to be traded in order to play every day (he had also grown tired of the Brewers changing his field position, which they had done three seasons in a row‚Äîusually something teams avoid so that players remain comfortable in their field positions and perform at their highest potential). Following his statements, many Brewers fans booed him at Miller Park, which he later admitted affected his confidence. In June and early July he began hitting much better, even against right-handed pitchers (including game-winning, back-to-back, go-ahead home runs against right-handed pitchers of division rival St. Louis Cardinals, in the 10th inning of the first game of the series and in the 9th inning of the second), and all but pushed Branyan back out of the starting lineup. When asked what had changed he said that he felt that he had found his swing in early July, and had subsequently regained his confidence. He thanked his teammates for supporting him through it all. Hall's hitting then worsened, as he hit .235 in August, and .182 in September‚ÄìOctober. Hall ended the 2008 season with a .225 batting average, and a .174 batting average against right-handers. On May 25 when the Brewers took on St. Louis in Milwaukee, Hall delivered the game- winning hit while matched up against a right-handed arm in Milwaukee. After the game, Hall declared \\"I wanna get back to when I was good.\\" Hall subsequently recorded just two hits in his next 22 at-bats. On July 30, following a win against the Washington Nationals, Hall was sent down to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Despite not batting over .180 during May, June, or July, Hall has made some great strides with his swing while seeing batting practice action. Hall said this about being sent down: In his second game with the Sounds, Hall went 2-for-4 with a double and a home run while batting third. Hall was subsequently recalled from Triple-A Nashville and started in right field for the Brewers on August 3, replacing an injured Corey Hart.comes back full of confidence\\", jsonline.com, 8/3/2009, accessed 8/4/2009 Hall went 0-for-3 with a bases-loaded walk. On August 12, Hall was designated for assignment, ending his 7-year stint with the Brewers. ===Seattle Mariners=== On August 19, Hall was traded to the Seattle Mariners for minor league pitcher Ruben Flores. Hall recorded his first hit as a Mariner on what was his first game with his new club on August 21. Hall finished the game with two hits and his first Mariner RBI.Wave of offense lifts Mariners to winmariners.com ===Boston Red Sox=== Boston Red Sox in 2010 On January 7, 2010, Hall was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Casey Kotchman and a minor league player to be named and cash. Hall was excited to return to a utility role, saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm up for anything. I‚Äôve played every position. I feel I‚Äôm athletic enough to move over to first base and hopefully make it look like I‚Äôve played there for some years. Everybody knows I can play some defense and everyone knows I can hit. I‚Äôve just had some unfortunate incidents in the last couple of years and I feel like I‚Äôm pretty close back to where I used to be. [Manager Terry Francona] just promised me plenty of at-bats and opportunities to prove I could be the player I want to be. That revolves around hitting.‚Äù Much of the Red Sox roster was plagued by injuries during the 2010 season, forcing manager Francona to constantly juggle the lineups, filling the vacancies with whoever was available. Bill Hall became a \\"super-utility\\" option, and played all but two positions during the year. On May 28, 2010, Francona, facing a ninth inning with no available pitchers, sent Bill Hall to the mound. Hall's major league pitching debut was impressive: wielding nothing but an 89 mph fastball, he retired all three batters he faced. Hall finished his year in Boston with 18 home runs, leading the American League in home runs per at-bat in the final two months of the season. ===Houston Astros=== On December 20, 2010, Hall signed a one-year contract with the Houston Astros. He was released on June 4, 2011, after hitting .224 for the Astros. ===San Francisco Giants=== Hall signed with the San Francisco Giants on June 11, 2011. On July 28, 2011, Hall was designated for assignment by the Giants. ===New York Yankees=== Hall signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees on February 7, 2012, with an invitation to spring training. He did not make the team, and opted out of his contract. ===Baltimore Orioles=== On April 23, 2012, Hall signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles. On May 12, 2012, Hall was called up to the majors due to an injury to third baseman Mark Reynolds. Hall hit a home run in his Orioles debut against the Tampa Bay Rays. On May 25, Hall was designated for assignment by the Orioles. He hit 2-7 with a home run and 4 walks. On September 26, Hall's contract was purchased from the Triple-A Norfolk Tides after Randy Wolf was placed on the 60-day Disabled List. ===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim=== On January 30, 2013, Hall signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.,http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2013/01/angels-to-sign-bill-hall.html but on May 19, 2013, was released after batting .164 over 21 games in AAA. ===Long Island Ducks=== On June 7, 2013, Hall signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League.Ducks Sign Bill Hall, Bring Back Bob Zimmerman, Make Roster Moves ===Milwaukee Brewers=== On Thursday, September 5, 2019 Bill Hall signed a one-day contract and retired as a Milwaukee Brewer. ‚ÄúI was just a small town country boy with Major League dreams,‚Äù said Hall in a news release. ‚ÄúThe Brewers gave me an opportunity to live those dreams. The organization and fans welcomed me like family, and that is what we became. Retiring as a Brewer could not feel better or happen any other way.‚Äù ==Personal life== Hall, along with former teammates J. J. Hardy, Jeff Suppan, and Chris Capuano, appeared in an episode of CBS' soap opera The Young and the Restless. He served as a special playoff analyst on ESPN's Cold Pizza following the 2006 season. Bill Hall has three kids.

It is a potent chemical weapon, specifically a nettle agent. The compound itself is a colorless solid, but impure samples are often yellowish liquids. It has a strong, disagreeable odor and a violently irritating vapor. ==Preparation and reactions== Phosgene oxime can be prepared by reduction of chloropicrin using a combination of tin metal and hydrochloric acid as the source of the active hydrogen reducing acent: : Cl3CNO2 \\\\+ 4 [H] ‚Üí Cl2C=N‚àíOH + HCl + H2O The observation of a transient violet color in the reaction suggests intermediate formation of trichloronitrosomethane (Cl3CNO). Early preparations, using stannous chloride as the reductant, also started with chloropicrin. The compound is electrophilic and thus sensitive to nucleophiles, including base hydrolysis: :Cl2CNOH + 2 NaOH ‚Üí CO2 \\\\+ NH2OH + 2 NaCl + H2O Similar processes provide an easy way to destroy this dangerous compound. Hydrazine converts it to HCN and N2. ==Safety== Phosgene oxime is classified as a vesicant even though it does not produce blisters. It is toxic by inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact. The effects of the poisoning occur almost immediately. No antidote for phosgene oxime poisoning is known. Generally, any treatment is supportive. Typical physical symptoms of CX exposure are as follows: *Skin: Blanching surrounded by an erythematous ring can be observed within 30 seconds of exposure. A wheal develops on exposed skin within 30 minutes. The original blanched area acquires a brown pigmentation by 24 hours. An eschar forms in the pigmented area by 1 week and sloughs after approximately 3 weeks. Initially, the effects of CX can easily be misidentified as mustard gas exposure. However, the onset of skin irritation resulting from CX exposure is a great deal faster than mustard gas, which typically takes several hours or more to cause skin irritation. *Eyes: Eye examination typically demonstrates conjunctivitis, lacrimation, lid edema, and blepharospasm after even minute exposures. More severe exposures can result in keratitis, iritis, corneal perforation, and blindness. *Respiratory: Irritation of the mucous membranes may be observed on examination of the oropharynx and nose. Evidence of pulmonary edema, including rales and wheezes, may be noted on auscultation. Pulmonary thromboses are prominent features of severe CX exposure. *Gastrointestinal: Some animal data suggest that CX may cause hemorrhagic inflammatory changes in the GI tract.

It is corrosive to metals and also decomposes on contact with metals. It is rapidly hydrolysed by alkaline solutions. Adsorbent powders such as Fuller's earth or talcum powder can also be used. ==References * EMedicine: Urticants, Phosgene Oxime * Center for the Study of Bioterrorism: Phosgene Oxime * Centers for Disease Control: Facts About Phosgene Oxime * Virtual Naval Hospital: Phosgene Oxime Category:Chemical weapons Category:Organochlorides Category:Oximes ","title":"Phosgene oxime"},{"id":"2216522","text":"Massachusetts shares with the five other New England states a governmental structure known as the New England town. Only the southeastern third of the state has functioning county governments; in western, central, and northeastern Massachusetts, traditional county-level government was eliminated in the late 1990s. Generally speaking, there are four kinds of public school districts in Massachusetts: local schools, regional schools, vocational/technical schools, and charter schools. ==Municipalities== Massachusetts cities and towns. All territory of the state is within the bounds of a municipality. In many other states, a town is a compact incorporated area; between the towns are unincorporated areas, usually quite large, that do not belong to any town. Such states are completely apportioned into counties, and county governments have significant importance, particularly to those living outside towns, and often perform major functions such as providing police and fire services and operating airports. In contrast, all of the land in Massachusetts is divided up among the cities and towns and there are no \\"unincorporated\\" areas or population centers, nor townships. (This is generally true of most of the New England states, and is described at length at New England town.) This complicates comparisons with other non-New England states. The U.S. Census Bureau considers Massachusetts cities and towns to be minor civil divisions, equivalent to townships in other states, but townships usually have weaker forms of government. Many Massachusetts residents also identify with neighborhoods, villages, or other districts of their towns and cities. ===Services=== Many municipalities have their own police departments, as do many Massachusetts colleges and universities. Massachusetts State Police have sole authority under state law for investigating homicides, except for Boston, Worcester, and Springfield. Fire protection is generally also provided by municipal fire departments but may be divided among multiple smaller departments servicing just individual villages and population centers. Examples of multiple departments servicing the same towns include Dartmouth(three districts) and Barnstable(five districts, plus an airport department). Massport has its own fire department, and its Fire Rescue provides protection on agency property. Fire departments have mutual aid agreements, such as the Massachusetts Metro Fire District in Greater Boston, which facilitate emergency response across department boundaries.http://www.massmetrofire.org/depts.html Water and sewer districts are generally operated at the municipal level, providing retail service to residential and business customers, and making provisions for sewage treatment and acquiring water from wells, rivers, or wholesaler. Some local water districts have been consolidated across municipal boundariesFor example, the Dedham-Westwood Water District, formed by a merger in 1986. and some operate at the sub-municipal (village) level.Examples: the Centerville-Osterville- Marstons Mills Water Department in Barnstable, the Buzzard's Bay Water District in Bourne. Running water and sewer service is not necessarily available to all buildings, especially in low-density areas; building owners in these areas must obtain their own water and dispose of their own sewage. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority provides wholesale water and sewer services to many cities and towns, mostly in Greater Boston, in cooperation with DCR watershed land management. Combined sewers in some areas are being separated to reduce water pollution. State laws delegate limited control over building, alcohol, marijuana, gambling, and taxi licenses to municipal governments. Municipal governments own most roads, and many use police and traffic control officers to enforce their own parking regulations, and set speed limits and various restrictions on local roads within state parameters. Maintenance of state-owned roads (typically major), setting the rules of the road, driver and vehicle licenses, and public transportation are MassDOT responsibilities, though regional transportation agencies such as the MBTA are funded partly by fees paid by municipalities. ===Limits to municipal government=== Many Massachusetts towns were established during the British colonial period, long before the existence of an independent United States. The Massachusetts Constitution was written before the end of the American Revolution (1780). This constitution re-established the relationship between the state government and the towns which was originally specified by the charter which was granted to the Massachusetts Bay Company by King Charles I in 1629. As in most of New England, the powers of Massachusetts cities and towns are set forth in the state constitution, state statutes, and municipal charters. However, the laws regulating their authority have historically been very broadly construed, and there is a long-standing tradition of local autonomy. In 1966, the Home Rule Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution created a limited home rule mechanism explicitly granting certain powers to cities and towns.Constitution of Massachusetts Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Retrieved January 30, 2007.Article of Amendment 89 to the Massachusetts ConstitutionDavid J. Barron, Gerald Frug, and Rick T. Su, Harvard Law School. \\"Dispelling The Myth of Home Rule: Local Power in Greater Boston\\" Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston, 2004. According to the Amendment: * Municipalities may adopt charters without needing state approval * Municipalities may not regulate elections, collect taxes, borrow money, define civil laws or regulations, define felonies or set imprisonment as a punishment for any offense, or dispose of park land; except as provided by the legislature * Whether or not it has adopted a charter, a municipality may exercise any power that the legislature has the power to delegate to it, except in cases where the legislature has already acted, explicitly or implicitly. (Given the large number of matters on which the state legislature has acted, this means the actual powers of municipalities are quite limited, and sometimes uncertain until tested in court.) The legislature is prohibited from passing any special laws that affect fewer than two municipalities, except in any of the following circumstances:Article of Amendment 89 to the Massachusetts Constitution, Section 8 * Approval of a Home Rule Petition from the municipal government * By two-thirds supermajority and the consent of the Governor * Establishing metropolitan or regional agencies with borders different than existing municipalities * Creation, dissolution, and merger of municipalities, and adjustment of boundaries Many municipalities seek approval for special legislation giving them desired powers, which may or may not be available to them under the blanket grant of Home Rule, due to potentially conflicting state laws. Even before the 1966 amendment, the laws regulating municipal powers had been very broadly construed, and there is a long-standing tradition of local autonomy. The Zoning ActMassachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40A grants substantial zoning powers to municipalities. The Massachusetts Subdivision Control LawMassachusetts General Laws, Chapter 41, ¬ß¬ß 81K‚Äì81GG. also concerns land use regulation. ===Form of government: city vs. town=== { style=\\"float:right; margin: 10px\\" - !colspan=2Notable municipalities by population (2002)Secretary of the Commonwealth fact sheet titled \\"Massachusetts Area Code Regions\\". Updated 22 July 2002. Population - Largest city Boston 667,137 - Largest town Brookline 58,732 - Smallest city North Adams 13,708 - Smallest town Gosnold 75 } As in most of New England, the distinction between a \\"city\\" and \\"town\\" as defined in Massachusetts law is primarily related to the form of government that the municipality has chosen. A town is governed under a town meeting form of government‚Äìeither via an open town meeting or representative town meeting, with a board of selectmen handling town affairs between meetings. A city has a council or board of aldermen (and may or may not have a mayor, a city manager, or both). Prior to 1821, the only recognized form of government in Massachusetts was the town meeting. On April 9, 1821, an amendment to the state constitution was approved that permitted municipalities to choose other forms of government. On February 23, 1822, the Governor approved an act that granted a city form of government to Boston. The new charter for \\"the City of Boston\\" was drafted by Lemuel Shaw, later Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The voters of Boston approved the acceptance of the proposed city charter on March 4, 1822. The state Constitution stipulates that any municipality that has a population under 12,000 cannot adopt \\"city\\" form of government and charter; any \\"town\\" with less than 6,000 population cannot adopt a representative town meeting charter and form of government. This applies whether or not the municipality has adopted a home rule charter. Other details of city and town government are left to the legislature. State law defines six possible options for city governments:43 MGL 1, via Mass. gov * Plan A - \\"Strong mayor\\" - Mayor and a city council, the councilors being elected at large. Party primaries prohibited. * Plan B - \\"Weak mayor\\" - Mayor and city council, the councilors being elected partly at large and partly from districts or wards of the city. Party primaries prohibited. * Plan C - \\"Commission\\" - Mayor and commissioners. Party primaries prohibited. * Plan D - \\"Council-manager\\"- City council of seven or nine (one of whom is the mayor), and a city manager. Party primaries prohibited. * Plan E - \\"Council-manager\\"- City council of seven or nine (one of whom is the mayor), a city manager; members of the council and the school committee elected at large by proportional representation.43 MGL 1, via Mass. gov * Plan F - \\"Partisan mayor-council\\" - Mayor and city council, the councilors being elected partly at large and partly from wards of the city, with political party primaries.For a complete list of the forms of government of all cities and towns, see 2005-06 Massachusetts Municipal Directory Massachusetts Municipal Association. pp178-181. There are also certain operational differences between cities and towns. For instance, changes to town by-laws require approval by the Massachusetts Attorney General, but changes to city ordinances do not. A 1966 amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution affirmed the right of local municipalities to self-government and to the exercise of powers not inconsistent with state law. It also prohibited the state legislature from abolishing or combining cities and towns without their consent, and made it illegal for the legislature to enact legislation affecting only one municipality without that community's request or consent. As part of the amendment, Massachusetts for the first time allowed cities and towns to draft and adopt their own home rule charters without receiving permission or approval from the state. The legislature adopted the state Home Rule Procedures Act to establish a process to accomplish the constitutional mandate. For towns without a home rule charter, changes in the structure of the local government must be approved by petitioning the General Court for special legislation giving it that authority, or through adoption of one of the so-call Acceptance Act Charters, A through F. Communities with home rule charters must also request a Special Act in order to exercise a power the state has reserved to itself, such as increase the number of liquor licenses allowed in a city or town. As of 2000, 71 municipalities had adopted home-rule charters under the Home Rule Amendment procedure, 13 operated under charters granted by Special Acts of the legislature passed before the Home Rule Amendment, and 19 operated under Special Acts pass after the Home Rule Amendment.Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development. \\"MASSACHUSETTS COMMUNITIES OPERATING UNDER HOME RULE CHARTERS\\" (prepared and adopted under provisions of the Home Rule Amendment and M.G.L., c. 43B) Out of 53 cities in the Commonwealth, there are now eleven that are legally cities and have city councils, but retained \\"Town of\\" in their names. This distinction derives from provisions of state law that reference the town meeting form of government and that provide for greater self-governance authority for the class of communities governed by a form of chief executive and council which are referred to as cities in state law. Communities adopting a city form while retaining \\"Town of\\" as their name are: The MMA Directory is not an official state document, but is more up to date and specific than the official list from the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth's office, which is dated 10-21-2005 and does not include Braintree, Palmer and Winthrop, which have since adopted the city form of government. Refer to the table at the List of municipalities in Massachusetts for a comprehensive list of city websites used to determine the titles in use by the respective municipalities. Agawam, Amesbury, Barnstable, Braintree, Franklin, Greenfield, Palmer, Southbridge, Watertown, West Springfield, Weymouth, and Winthrop. Legal opinions provided to charter commissions in some of first of the 11 communities adopting a style of government that the General Laws referred to as a city form suggested that for clarity the community be referenced as \\"the City Known as the Town of X\\" as its legal name. The term \\"town\\" was retained in many cases because a suburban community did not desire to be known as a \\"city\\" with the urban issues the name implies, but wished to adopt the city form of government. How a municipality refers to itself has been said to be a decision that is up to the community. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that what a municipality calls itself doesn't matter: \\"It is the substance of the thing done, and not the name given to it, which controls\\". Opinion of the Justices to the Senate, 229 Mass. 600 (Mass. 1918). The \\"City known as the Town of\\" reference was intended in communities adopting it to assert its right to exercise the authority of a city in governance, municipal finance and procurement. In the early days of the spread of the council-based municipal government to towns, it served to eliminate confusion as to a town's ability to do a particular thing. Prior to the adoption of the Home Rule Amendment, no town had become a city in Massachusetts for 45 years, while four made the change in the first 10 years following the adoption of home rule. ===Revenues=== *Local property tax. The Legislature has authorized local governments to administer the property tax under state supervision, and to set property tax rates locally. A 1980 law, passed by popular ballot and known as \\"Proposition 2¬Ω,\\" sets limits on property tax and automotive excise tax rates. There are three parts to the property tax limit calculation. **Levy Ceiling: A community may not, in any one year, collect more than 2.5% of the total full and fair cash value of all taxable real and personal property in the community. **Levy (Increase) Limit. The annual increase of the amount collected cannot exceed 2.5% over the previous year, plus the amount corresponding to increased property values. **New Growth. Each year, the state Department of Revenue calculates a \\"new growth\\" figure for each municipality, allowing that community to increase its levy a certain amount beyond the 2.5% limit to account for value-adding improvements in the local property stock, such as the subdivision of farms to high-priced homes. :A municipality is permitted but not required to tax up to the levy limit. If a city or town wants to raise more money than it is allowed under either the ceiling or the increase limit, it must get voter approval for a \\"Proposition 2¬Ω override\\" or a \\"Proposition 2¬Ω debt exclusion.\\" An exception is granted for water and sewer debt. Tax increases voted through a debt exclusion must be tied to a certain cost and expire on a future date; an override increase sets a new benchmark for all future 2.5 percent rises.MGL Ch. 59 Sec. 21C(l) :Some municipalities have a state-authorized property tax exemption for low-price owner-occupied residences of up to 30%. Other exemptions include hospitals, schools, churches, seniors, veterans, surviving spouses, and blind people *Local income tax. The Massachusetts Constitution was modified in 1915 to permit a state income tax. However, the constitution requires that \\"such tax ... shall be levied at a uniform rate.\\" This means that local municipalities may not impose a local income tax. *Local sales tax. The Massachusetts Constitution requires tax rate uniformity, which means that municipal governments may not institute local sales taxes. However, some exceptions have been granted. In 1985, the Legislature granted cities and towns the right to impose sales tax on aviation fuel and hotel/motel occupancy, as a local option.Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 64F and Chapter 64G, Section 3A. *Local aid. A significant portion of the income of cities and towns comes from the state government's general fund, and is known as \\"local aid\\". *Fees. Some municipal fees, such as parking fines and towing fees, are limited by state law.Barron et al., p. 27 *Unfunded mandates. State laws which place requirements on cities and towns without increasing financial support to cover increased costs are often criticized as \\"unfunded mandates\\" and are a controversial issue in local relations. In theory, Proposition 2¬Ω disallowed unfunded mandates after 1981, and in some cases this has been successfully enforced in court. However, the courts have ruled that the legislature may condition other aid on acceptance of the mandates, partially circumventing the law.Barron et al., p. 31 ==School districts== Primary and secondary school attendance is compulsory and free for Massachusetts residents aged 6‚Äì16. Massachusetts has a school choice law which allows students to attend a school in a district outside their municipality if the other district has space and approves. K-12 students may also attend private schools. Private schools are not state-funded and generally charge tuition. Many are parochial schools operated by subdivisions of the Roman Catholic Church. Generally speaking, there are four kinds of public school districts in Massachusetts: local schools, regional schools, vocational/technical schools, and charter schools. ===Organization=== Local schools are funded by one municipality. 50% of the municipalities in Massachusetts use local schools for grades Kindergarten through 12. Local schools are administered by the municipality through an elected or appointed school committee, and are considered a department of the city or town government. In some cities, such as Cambridge and Malden, the city charter specifies that the mayor has a permanent seat on the school committee. The capital city of Boston is subject to a special state law which allows the mayor to appoint a school committee of seven.1991 Mass. Acts 108. The final budget control for local schools is held by the municipality (Mayor or Town Meeting, respectively), although the school committee receives an annual lump sum appropriation from the municipality, and \\"town-side\\" or \\"city-side\\" officials have no control over the allocation of School Department funds within the annual appropriation, which is controlled by the school committee. Any two or more municipalities may combine their public schools into one district and form regional schools. 27% of the municipalities in Massachusetts have K-12 regional schools, while many other communities are served by local primary Schools and regional secondary schools. Regional schools are administered by a school committee that consists of representatives of the municipalities in the region. Final budget control for a regional district is still held by the voters of its member municipalities, however. Participating mayors and Town Meetings still vote on the bottom line of their share of the regional budget. If municipalities within a school district disagree (e.g., if one town funds 100% of the regional school committee's request, and another funds only 75%), a second round of decisions is taken. If the disagreement persists, registered voters within the regional district's boundaries assemble for a \\"district meeting,\\" similar to a town meeting, at which a majority vote of attendees prevails. Each member city or town must then adjust its own budget to accommodate the voted assessments. Several regional school districts overlay the \\"academic\\" school district system and provide vocational and technical high schools for students from several communities. Vocational/technical schools are administered by a regional school committee. The structure of this committee is established in the regional agreement. Like any regional school committee, vocational committees have final budget control for school spending decisions, but still depend on local authorities for funding. Charter schools are publicly funded schools that are subject to different administrative structures from traditional public schools. There are two types of charter schools in Massachusetts. Massachusetts law specifies governance and entities eligible to apply for a charter, or operate a charter school as follows: Commonwealth Charter Schools were created as part of Education Reform in 1993. Commonwealth Charter Schools are formed by the approval of a charter that defines its administrative structure. Charter Schools are not subject to the collective bargaining agreements that are negotiated for other public schools. There are 51 Commonwealth Charter Schools in Massachusetts. Commonwealth Charter Schools are administered by a board of trustees of the private entity that received the charter authority to operate the school. Massachusetts General Laws: Chapter 71, Section 89 Charter Schools. Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. District/School Administration. Published July 1, 2001. Horace Mann Charter Schools were defined in 1997. The charter for these schools must be approved by the local school committee and the local union. There are 8 Horace Mann Charter Schools in Massachusetts. A Horace Mann Chater school is run operated and managed by a board of trustees independent of the school committees which approve said schools. The board of trustees may include a member of the school committee. The board of trustees may include a municipal school committee member. All school districts in Massachusetts must employ a superintendent and business (or finance) manager. Many districts also have assistant or associate superintendents, pupil services directors, special education directors, and other administrators, although these are not required by state law. State law is developed into regulations by the Massachusetts Board of Education to govern local, regional, vocational, and charter schools. ===School funding and construction=== The cost of operating public schools comes from two sources: local government, funded primarily by the property tax, and payments from the state Legislature (out of the state general fund), calculated to provide more aid to economically weaker school districts and thereby equalize educational opportunity across the state. These \\"Chapter 70\\" payments are in addition to separate local aid payments to town and city governments' general funds. Cities and towns are required by state law to spend a minimum amount on education. This required amount is referred to as \\"Net School Spending\\" and is calculated as part of the Chapter 70 funding formula.Barron et al., pp. 33. Each school district is allocated a certain amount of funding through a foundational budget, which is based on the number of students that community is required to educate according to enrollment figures as of October 1 of the previous year, as well as the calculated wealth of a community. However, when a student transfers out of district to another public district, to a charter school, a public vocational school, etc., a certain amount of funding is transferred along with them. School construction and renovation projects fall under the budgetary and land use powers of the municipalities rather than the school boards.General description of relationship between school committees and municipalities, Malden example: Barron et al., pp. 61-63. ==Counties== District attorneys and sheriffs are elected by constituencies that mostly, but not entirely, follow county boundaries; they are funded by the state budget. Though most county governments have been abolished, each county still has a Sheriff's Department which operates jails and correctional facilities and service of process within the county. By the 1990s, most functions of county governments (including operation of courts and road maintenance) had been taken over by the state, and most county governments were seen as inefficient and outmoded. The government of Suffolk County was substantially integrated with the city government of Boston more than one hundred years ago, to the extent that the members of the Boston city council are ex officio the Suffolk County Commissioners, and Boston's treasurer and auditor fulfill the same offices for the county. Thus, residents of the other three Suffolk County communities do not have a voice on the county commission, but all the county expenses are paid by the city of Boston. The government of Nantucket County, which is geographically coterminous with the Town of Nantucket, is operated as a consolidated town and county government ‚Äî the town selectmen (executive branch) act as the county commissioners. This is the only such example of a true consolidated city-county in New England. Mismanagement of Middlesex County's public hospital in the mid-1990s left that county on the brink of insolvency, and in 1997 the Massachusetts legislature stepped in by assuming all assets and obligations of the county. The government of Middlesex County was officially abolished on July 11, 1997. Later that year, the Franklin County Commission voted itself out of existence. The law abolishing Middlesex County also provided for the elimination of Hampden County and Worcester County on July 1, 1998. This law was later amended to abolish Hampshire County on January 1, 1999; Essex County and Suffolk County on July 1 of that same year; and Berkshire County on July 1, 2000. Chapter 34B of the Massachusetts General Laws allows other counties either to abolish themselves, or to reorganize as a \\"regional council of governments\\", as Hampshire and Franklin Counties have done. The governments of Bristol, Plymouth, and Norfolk Counties remain substantially unchanged. Barnstable and Dukes Counties have adopted modern county charters, enabling them to act as efficient regional governments. Dukes County in particular has a strong regional planning agency known as the Martha's Vineyard Commission. == References == Massachusetts ","title":"Administrative divisions of Massachusetts"},{"id":"2216527","text":"Rougui tea (; pronounced ) is a variety of the tea plant, commonly grown in the Wuyi Mountains and processed into oolong tea.

According to Said, two key beliefs form the essence of humanism: firstly, the historical world is made by men and women and not by God and secondly, it can be rationally understood according to the principles formulated by Vico. The humanist is called upon to use philology as a rigorous instrument with which he contributes to the only form of knowledge available, namely, knowledge which is knowing how something is made.\\"Edward W.

One of the oldest Metro stations, it was designed by Alexey Dushkin and Ya. Likhtenberg and opened in 1935 as part of the original Metro line. The station was originally planned to serve the enormous Palace of the Soviets (Dvorets Sovetov), which was to rise nearby on the former site of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. Kropotkinskaya was therefore designed to be the largest and grandest station on the first line. However, the Palace project was cancelled by Nikita Khrushchev in 1953, leaving the Metro station as the only part of the complex that was actually built. Kropotkinskaya was constructed in a massive open trench measuring long by wide. The tunnels from Biblioteka Imeni Lenina were constructed using the cut and cover technique. The combination of unrestricted space and dry soil made for ideal conditions, and construction of the station took only 180 days from start to finish. Kropotkinskaya was completed in January 1935 and opened five months later, on 15 May 1935. The station was named Dvorets Sovetov until 1957, when it was renamed in honour of Peter Kropotkin, a geographer, philosopher, and anarchist theoretician born in the vicinity. Since it was to serve as the gateway to the Palace of Soviets, great care was taken to make Kropotkinskaya suitably elegant and impressive. The station has flared columns faced with white marble which are said to have been inspired by the Temple of Amun at Karnak. Contrary to popular opinion, the marble used in the station did not come from the demolished Cathedral. The spacious platform is covered with squares of gray and red granite and the walls, originally tiled, are now faced with white Koyelga marble. The station is illuminated by concealed lamps set into the tops of the columns. A model of the station won two Grand Prix awards at expositions in Paris (1937) and Brussels (1958). In 1941 the designers and engineers were also awarded the Stalin prize of the USSR for architecture and construction. Kropotkinskaya opened with only one entrance vestibule, located at the end of Gogolevskiy Boulevard. This U-shaped structure was designed by S.M. Kravets and features two separate pavilions joined by a central arch. In late 1950s the station was given a slight reconstruction replacing the original cast of the upper pillars was replaced by marble and the floor was relayed with granite. The reconstruction finished with a new entrance which faces the Cathedral and Moskva River which was opened on 16 July 1960. Because of the demise of the Palace of Soviets project, much of Kropotkinskaya's planned ridership never materialized. the station serves about 42,050 passengers daily, many of them tourists visiting the newly rebuilt Cathedral or the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts. By 2020, a transfer to the Kalininskaya Line is planned to open. The future station will be called Volkhonka.\\"–ü–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤—ã —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏—è.\\" Moscow Metro.

At this time, the name \\"Alice Cooper\\" referred to the band and not its lead singer Vincent Furnier. The album has a psychedelic flavor to it; the group had yet to develop the more concise hard rock sound that they would become famous for. Most of the tracks feature unusual time signatures and arrangements, jarring syncopation, expressive dynamics, sound effects, and an eclectic range of music influences. A few songs, such as \\"Levity Ball\\", show the influence of Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd, with whom the band hung out during the British group's U.S. tour.Liner notes to The Life and Death of Alice Cooper box set, p. 62. Alice Cooper guitarist Glen Buxton stated he could listen to Barrett's guitar playing for hours on end. The artwork for this album is a painting by Edward Beardsley. It was originally hanging on the wall of the living room in Frank Zappa's house, and his wife Gail Zappa stated that it was later stolen from them. Pretties for You was a critical and commercial failure, only briefly appearing on the Billboard Top 200, and none of its songs have ever been played live by Cooper since the release of the band's breakthrough album Love It to Death.Alice Cooper Tour Archive The song \\"Reflected\\", Alice Cooper's first single, was later rewritten as \\"Elected\\", which features on their 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies. ==Production== According to Alice Cooper's band manager Shep Gordon, when recording at Whitney Studios in Burbank, Frank Zappa left his brother in charge of recording while Zappa left the studio. Zappa returned later that day and informed them the album was finished, having only recorded the band rehearsing. Gordon states that there was no producer during recording, that the band had no complete songs written, that Zappa \\"didn't spend 5 minutes in the studio\\" and never asked to hear their material, and that the band's debut album was made up entirely of that rehearsal recording, aside from the live recording of \\"Levity Ball\\". ==Track listing== All songs written by Alice Cooper, Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway and Neal Smith. ;Side one #\\"Titanic Overture\\" ‚Äì 1:12 #\\"10 Minutes Before the Worm\\" ‚Äì 1:39 #\\"Sing Low, Sweet Cheerio\\" ‚Äì 5:42 #\\"Today Mueller\\" ‚Äì 1:48 #\\"Living\\" ‚Äì 3:12 #\\"Fields of Regret\\" ‚Äì 5:44 ;Side two #\\"No Longer Umpire\\" ‚Äì 2:02 #\\"Levity Ball\\" ‚Äì 4:39 #\\"B.B. on Mars\\" ‚Äì 1:17 #\\"Reflected\\" ‚Äì 3:17 #\\"Apple Bush\\" ‚Äì 3:08 #\\"Earwigs to Eternity\\" ‚Äì 1:19 #\\"Changing Arranging\\" ‚Äì 3:03 ==Reception== Lester Bangs of Rolling Stone felt that there were no \\"[hints] of life, spontaneity, joy, rage, or any kind of authentic passion or conviction\\". However, he stated that \\"within the context of [Alice Cooper's] self-imposed limitations, the album is listenable\\". He concluded the review by saying that \\"Alice Cooper's music is, for this reviewer at any rate, totally dispensable\\". ==Legacy== AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine feels that the album \\"was an earnest but flawed stab at psychedelia that occasionally caught fire\\". ==Live covers== On November 8, 2015, the entire record was performed live at The Stone in NYC as part of Nick Didkovsky's residency there.

It is on the Sokolnicheskaya line, between Frunzenskaya and Kropotkinskaya stations. Named after the nearby Maxim Gorky Park of Culture and Leisure located across the Moskva River. The station was designed by Nikolai Kolli and opened on 15 May 1935, along with the first phase of the Moscow Metro. ==History== The construction of the station began in the spring of 1933. From the start it was clear that construction of this final station would not be an easy task. Being only several hundred metres from the bank of the Moskva River, the soil was particularly damp, with the level of subterranean waters being higher than the future ceiling of the station. Even more important was the fact that the station is situated under the Crimean Square (Krymskaya Ploshchad) of the Garden Ring's intersection with the southwestern Ostozhenka Street/Komsomolsky Avenue and thus being an important traffic hub. Before the pit of the station was excavated along its future perimeter, metallic casts reinforced by solid logs with caulked slits between them were forced into the ground, and abyssal water lowering was employed as the pit was slowly excavated to its required depth. All of this was necessary to prevent the flooding of the pit, which was likely to have caused subsidence and even destruction of nearby houses. As soon as that work was completed, a wooden bridge was erected at street level to prevent traffic disruption. Most of the construction was carried out at night. The station was completed in eleven months during which time 100,000 cubic metres of soil was removed from the pit and replaced with 25,000 cubic metres of concrete. Central span in 1930s The station is a bi-level pillar-trispan with four footbridges above the platforms. Architects Krutikov and Popov chose a decoration inspired by ancient Greek elements. Along the platform, two rows of 22 pillars are faced with Crimean marble Kadykovka and topped with moulded —Åapitals. Along the walls a set of dark rose-coloured mosaic pilasters repeat the step of the pillars (every seven metres), blending very well with the porcelain tiles that face the rest of the wall area. Also, a dark-brown mosaic socle runs below the platform level along both walls. A total of 1500 square meters of marble, and 200 square metres of porcelain tiles, were used in the decorations. The footbridges which lead to the vestibules are separately decorated with red metalloplastic tiles and moulded white balustrades with marbled railings. The walls of the corridors leading to the vestibules are revetted with white uralian koelga marble. Original vestibule on Krymskaya Square The station originally had two vestibules, one of which, a distinctive rotunda building, still stands on the corner between Ostozhenka street and Novokrymskiy side-street. The second vestibule used to stand on the corner of Komsmolskiy Avenue and Sadovoye Koltso. The ticket hall was faced with brown Ural ufaley marble and had four welded octagonal columns faced with white koelga marble. The ticket offices themselves were built out of polished oak. This vestibule was pulled down in 1949 when a larger vestibule was erected in its place, and the old corridors were integrated into it. The vestibule also offers a transfer to the Koltsevaya line, which was opened in 1950. This station is one of the few surviving from the first stage that have remained more or less unchanged since their opening (compared with Lubyanka or Chistiye Prudy), except for the resurfacing the platform with granite (instead of original asphalt) and the installation of new lighting. The latter consisted of beautiful chandeliers in the central span and semi-circular lamps made of milk-white glass in side naves. However, with the introduction of luminescent lamps, the chandeliers and the lamps in the naves were completely removed. Despite that, the new lighting installations managed to fit in with the architectural composition and do not appear out of place, like on Kiyevskaya which had an analogous makeover. When the station opened in 1935, it was also the terminus of the Frunze Branch of the first stage (and from 1938, of Kirovsko‚ÄìFrunzenskaya line). Although the plans called for the station to have a four-track reversal siding, that was not finished until 1937, and a temporary piston junction was instead installed before the platform to allow reversal of the trains. The station ceased to be the terminus in 1957, with the extension of the Frunzenskiy radius southwestward to Sportivnaya. When the station was opened, it had quite a long name: Tsentralnyi Park Kultury i Otdykha imeni Gorkovo (The Maxim Gorky Central Park of Culture and Leisure). However, even on the plans it was abbreviated as TsPKiO and only voice announcements used the full name. In 1980, with the holding of the Olympic Games in Moscow, the name was shortened to avoid lengthy trilingual station announcements, although some signs still bear the original long version of the name. The station is used by 107,700 people daily, mainly passengers changing to and from Park Kultury on the Circle line, with only 9,650 passengers entering and leaving the Metro system at the station. On March 29, 2010, the station, along with Lubyanka, was subject to a terrorist attack, resulting in 40 casualties.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8592190.stm == Gallery == File:Park kulturi2.jpgPlatform view File:Moscow Metro lighting - Park Kultury - SL.jpgStation lighting File:Park kulturi1.jpgStation name File:Moscow ParkKulturyR vestibule 04-2016.jpgEntrance building ==References== Category:Moscow Metro stations Category:Sokolnicheskaya Line Category:Railway stations in Russia opened in 1935 Category:Railway stations located underground in Russia Category:Khamovniki District ","title":"Park Kultury (Sokolnicheskaya line)"},{"id":"2216575","text":"Route 181 is a highway in southern Missouri.

He taught at Suva Methodist Primary School in the 1930s and among his students was the future ombudsman of Fiji, Sir Moti Tikaram. ==Lelean Memorial School== Towards the end of 1942, at the height of the Pacific Campaign of the Second World War, the Colonial Authority was issued a command to close all urban schools and surrender their compounds to the military, to be used as military camps for the war campaign against the Japanese threat. At that time, a notable missionary teacher by the name of Mr William Earnest Donnelly, was serving as principal of Toorak Boys‚Äô School. Whilst other overseas teachers immediately left Fiji to await the end of the war, the determined missionary principal, Mr Donnelly sent a circular to all members of the senior classes of Classes Six, Seven, and Eight of Toorak Boys School, inviting volunteers to come away with him, to continue their education. After consultation with the heads of the Methodist Church, he was given permission to use the principal‚Äôs residence at the Davuilevu Technical School. As a result, he and 50 volunteers from Toorak Boys School in Suva, met at the principal‚Äôs residence on 3 March 1943. Their first classrooms were the two master bedrooms in the house and the long verandah on the eastern side as their library. There were only two classes and two teachers; the late Mssrs W.E Donnelly and Semesa Sikivou. In the 1943 Methodist Church Annual Conference, Mr Donnelly was given permission to expand his classes along the same ridge and as a result, the boys themselves, with his and Semesa Sikivou's guidance, built three large bures, where the teachers staff quarters presently stand. He was also directed to name the new school, Lelean Memorial School, in memory of a long serving and beloved missionary in Fiji, the Reverend Charles Oswald Lelean. Rev Lelean was an Australian missionary who served in Fiji for 36 years, from 1914 to 1934. Amongst his students were Rusiate Nayacakalou, who later became the first South Pacific Islander to graduate with a PhD and Jimione Samisoni who became the first Fijian to become the dean of the Fiji School of Medicine. ==Political career== Sikivou served as a member of the Legislative Council in the 1960s, and in January 1963 he was one of eight to sign the Wakaya Letter, which affirmed the principles of Fijian paramountcy. When Fiji gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1970, he was appointed Fiji's first Ambassador to the United Nations, serving until 1976. He reentered politics in the 1980s, and served as Minister for Foreign Affairs. In the 1972 New Year Honours List is was appointed a CBE. Sikivou was offered a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, but declined it, saying that it was his honour to serve her without remuneration. == Personal life == Sikivou, who hailed from Rewa Province, belonged to the tribe of the Roko Tui Dreketi's Guardians of the Spirit and the Wise Counsel, and as such was a member of the traditional court of the Paramount Chief of the Burebasaga Confederacy. He had strong ties to the Provinces of Namosi, Naitasiri, and Verata. He was married twice, first to Seini Ratuvou of the Vutia District of Rewa, with whom he had one daughter, Ateca (who died of asthma at the age of one) and three sons: Navitalai, Rokocanini, and Metuisela Sikivou. His second marriage was to Salote Tabuanitoga of Kadavu Island. With her he had two sons: Jese and Mosese, and a daughter, Vasiti Sikivou-Waqa. == References == Category:1917 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Alliance Party (Fiji) politicians Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:Permanent Representatives of Fiji to the United Nations Category:Foreign Ministers of Fiji Category:Fijian educators Category:I-Taukei Fijian members of the Legislative Council of Fiji Category:Politicians from Rewa Province Category:20th-century Fijian educators ","title":"Semesa Sikivou"},{"id":"2216590","text":"Craig Ward Anton (born August 28, 1962) is an American actor and comedian.

He is a member of the Democratic‚ÄìFarmer‚ÄìLabor Party (DFL). Walz was the U.S. Representative for from 2007 to 2019. The district comprises the state's southern end, running along the entire border with Iowa; it includes Rochester, Austin, Winona and Mankato. He was first elected in 2006, defeating six-term Republican incumbent Gil Gutknecht. He was reelected five times and served on the Agriculture Committee, Armed Services Committee and Veterans' Affairs Committee. Walz also served on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. In March 2017 Walz announced that he would not run for reelection to Congress and instead run for Governor of Minnesota. On November 6, 2018, Walz was elected to the governorship, defeating the Republican nominee, Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson. == Early life, education and military career == Walz was born in West Point, Nebraska, the son of Darlene R. and James F. \\"Jim\\" Walz. The son of a public school administrator and community activist, Walz was raised in Chadron, Nebraska, a rural community in the northwestern portion of the state.

Walz and his wife, Gwen, ran Educational Travel Adventures, accompanying high school juniors and seniors on summer educational trips to China. == U.S. House of Representatives  Political campaigns === Walz decided to run for Congress in 2006. He had no opponent for the DFL nomination in the September 12, 2006 primary election. He beat incumbent Republican Gil Gutknecht in the general election on November 7, and took office on January 3, 2007. After the election, Gutknecht was described as having been caught \\"off guard\\" and Walz as having \\"resolved never to get caught like that himself. ‚Ä¶ He packaged himself as a moderate from Day One, built an office centered on constituent service and carved out a niche as a tireless advocate for veterans.\\" Walz was reelected in 2008 with 62% of the vote, becoming only the second non-Republican to win a second full term in the district. He won a third term in 2010, defeating State Representative Randy Demmer with 50% of the vote. He was reelected in 2012, 2014, and 2016. During his 2018 campaign for governor, two senior NCOs of the Minnesota National Guard falsely accused Walz of fabricating facts about his service and lying about his military rank. The allegation about his military rank was debunked. === Tenure === 110th Congress) Upon his swearing in, Walz became the highest-ranking retired enlisted soldier ever to serve in Congress, as well as only the fourth Democrat/DFLer to represent his district. The others were Thomas Wilson (1887‚Äì89), William Harries (1891‚Äì93), and Tim Penny (1983‚Äì95). Walz served on the House Agriculture Committee, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and the Armed Services Committee. Along with fellow Minnesota Democrat Keith Ellison, Walz opposed President Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq. In his first week as a legislator, Walz cosponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage, voted for stem cell research, voted to allow Medicare to negotiate pharmaceutical prices, and voiced support for pay-as-you-go budget rules, requiring that new spending or tax changes not add to the federal deficit. Representing a district that has traditionally voted Republican, Walz cast votes ranging from moderate to liberal. He voted against the act to Prohibit Federally Funded Abortion Services, and voted to advance the Affordable Care Act out of the House. He has also voted to continue funding for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and against the 2008 TARP bill, which purchased troubled assets from financial institutions. Walz received a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood in 2012, from the ACLU in 2011, from the American Immigration Lawyers Association in 2009‚Äì10, from the AFL-CIO in 2010, from the Teamsters in 2009‚Äì10, and from NOW in 2007. He also received single-digit ratings from the National Taxpayers' Union, Citizens against Government Waste, Americans for Tax Reform, and Freedom Works. The US Chamber of Commerce gave him a 25% rating in 2010. Walz was ranked the 7th most bipartisan member of the House during the 114th Congress (and the most bipartisan member from Minnesota) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of Congress by measuring how often their bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and how often they co-sponsor bills by members of the opposite party.  Veterans' issues  Having served 24 years in the Army National Guard, as a freshman in Congress he was given a rare third committee membership when he was assigned to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Walz has championed enhanced veterans benefits since taking office in 2007. In May of that year the House unanimously passed his \\"Traumatic Brain Injuries Center Act\\" to set up five centers around the nation to study traumatic brain injuries and develop improved models for caring for veterans suffering from such injuries. Walz also supported the GI Bill of 2008, which expanded education benefits for veterans and in some cases allowed them to transfer education benefits to family members. In 2009, Walz gave the keynote address at the American Legion National Convention in Louisville, KY. He spoke about the need for the VA and Department of Defense to work together to make sure that returning service men and women \\"do not fall through the cracks when they transition to civilian life\\". Walz was the lead House sponsor of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, which directs the Veterans Administration to report on veteran mental health care and suicide prevention programs. It also gives the VA permission to provide incentives to psychiatrists who agree to join the VA medical system.  2008 financial crisis  During 2008, Walz repeatedly spoke out against using taxpayer money to bail out financial institutions; in late September he voted against the $700 billion TARP bill, which purchased troubled assets from these institutions. Walz released a statement after the bill's passage, saying, \\"The bill we voted on today passes the buck when it comes to recouping the losses taxpayers might suffer. I also regret that this bill does not do enough to help average homeowners, or provide sufficient oversight of Wall Street.\\" For the same reasons, in December 2008 he voted against the bill that offered $14 billion in government loans to bail out the country's large automobile manufacturers. In June 2009 Walz introduced a bipartisan resolution calling on the federal government to \\"relinquish its temporary ownership interests in the General Motors Corporation and Chrysler Group, LLC, as soon as possible\\" and stated that the government must not be involved in those companies' management decisions. Economic issues Despite his votes against bailout bills that loaned taxpayer money to large banks and auto manufacturers, Walz did vote with his Democratic colleagues to support the 2009 American Recovery & Reinvestment Act. As a member of the House Transportation Committee, Walz saw the stimulus bill as an opportunity to work \\"with his congressional colleagues to make job creation through investment in public infrastructure like roads, bridges and clean energy the cornerstone of the economic recovery plan\\". Walz has focused heavily on job and economic issues important to his southern Minnesota district, which has a mix of larger employers like the Mayo Clinic along with small businesses and agricultural interests. In July 2009 he voted for the Enhancing Small Business Research and Innovation Act, which he described as \\"part of our long-term economic blueprint to spur job creation by encouraging America's entrepreneurs to innovate toward breakthrough technological advancements\\".http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll486.xml Walz also urged assistance for hog and dairy farmers who struggled with lower prices for their commodities in 2008 and 2009.  Education  Walz was a public school teacher for 20 years. He opposes using merit pay for teachers. Voting in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Walz pointed to its strong provisions in support of public school buildings. Walz is on record supporting legislation to lower tuition costs. In a February 12, 2009 speech, he said that the most important thing to do \\"to ensure a solid base for [America's] economic future ‚Ä¶ is to provide the best education possible for [American] children.\\" He has received strong backing for these policies from many interest groups, including the National Education Association, the American Association of University Women and the National Association of Elementary School Principals.  Women's issues  Walz supports abortion rights and has a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood. The National Right to Life Committee gave him a rating of zero. In early 2009, Walz voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.  LGBT rights Walz strongly supports LGBT rights, including federal anti-discrimination laws on the basis of sexual orientation. In a 2009 speech he called for an end to the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. Walz voted in favor of the Matthew Shephard Hate Crimes Act and the Sexual Orientation Employment Nondiscrimination Act. In 2007, he received a 90% grade from the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT organization. In 2011, Walz announced his support for the Respect for Marriage Act.  Cannabis  Walz is a longtime supporter of legalizing both medical and recreational cannabis use. === Committee assignments === * Committee on Agriculture ** Subcommittee on Conservation, Energy, and Forestry ** Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management * Committee on Veterans' Affairs (Ranking Member) ** Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs ** Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity === Caucus memberships === * Chair, Congressional EMS Caucus * Co-Chair, National Guard and Reserve Component Caucus * Co-Chair, Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus * Co-Chair, Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus * Member, LGBT Equality Caucus * Congressional Arts Caucus ==Governor of Minnesota== Tim Walz is sworn in as Minnesota's 41st governor at the Fitzgerald Theater in St Paul, Minnesota Walz was sworn in as governor of Minnesota on January 7, 2019, at the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul. Walz took the oath of office alongside incoming Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, Minnesota State Auditor Julie Blaha, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, all Democrats. Walz spoke about education and healthcare reform in his inauguration speech. ===Police reform=== On May 26, 2020, the day after the killing of George Floyd, Walz and lieutenant governor Peggy Flanagan demanded justice and called the video of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck \\"disturbing\\". Walz elaborated, \\"The lack of humanity in this disturbing video is sickening. We will get answers and seek justice\\". Walz responded to Floyd's death by ordering the Minnesota state legislature to reconvene for a special sessions on legislation for police reform and accountability. After police reform failed to pass the first special session in June, a second special session was held in July. On July 21, the Minnesota state legislature passed major police reform legislation. The new compromise law includes a limited ban on police from using chokehold restraint so long as the officers were not at greater risk. It bans the old warrior training program, which was regarded as dehumanizing people and encouraging aggressive conduct. It requires training peace officers to deal with people with autism or in a mental health crisis and deescalation training for situations that could turn volatile. And it creates a special independent unit at the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for investigations of fatal police encounters and a community relations advisory council to consult with the Police Officers Standards and Training Board on policy changes. Walz signed the legislation into law on July 23. == Personal life == Walz and his wife, Gwen, married in 1994. They lived in Mankato, Minnesota for nearly 20 years before moving to Saint Paul with their two children upon his election as governor. Walz's brother, Craig, was killed by a falling tree during a storm in 2016. He was survived by his wife Julie, and their son, Jacob, who suffered severe injuries but survived. == Election campaigns  See also == * US Congressional Delegations from Minnesota * List of United States Representatives from Minnesota == References  External links == * Governor Tim Walz official government website * Campaign website * * - - - - - Category:1964 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American Lutherans Category:American people of German descent Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American people of Swedish descent Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:Governors of Minnesota Category:Living people Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Minnesota Category:Military personnel from Minnesota Category:Nebraska National Guard personnel Category:Minnesota Democrats Category:People from Chadron, Nebraska Category:People from West Point, Nebraska Category:Politicians from Mankato, Minnesota Category:United States Army soldiers Category:Nebraska Army National Guard ","title":"Tim Walz"},{"id":"2216595","text":"Wilderness-acquired diarrhea is a variety of traveler's diarrhea in which backpackers and other outdoor enthusiasts are affected. Potential sources are contaminated food or water, or \\"hand-to-mouth\\", directly from another person who is infected. Cases generally resolve spontaneously, with or without treatment, and the cause is typically unknown. The National Outdoor Leadership School has recorded about one incident per 5,000 person-field days by following strict protocols on hygiene and water treatment. More limited, separate studies have presented highly varied estimated rates of affliction that range from 3 percent to 74 percent of wilderness visitors. One survey found that long-distance Appalachian Trail hikers reported diarrhea as their most common illness. Based on reviews of epidemiologic data and literature, some researchers believe that the risks have been over-stated and are poorly understood by the public. Archived version April 20, 2010 U.S. adults annually experience 99 million episodes of acute diarrhea in a population of about 318 million. A very small fraction of these cases results from infections acquired in the wilderness, and all infectious agents occur in both wilderness and non- wilderness settings. ==Symptoms== The average incubation periods for giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis are each 7 days. Certain other bacterial and viral agents have shorter incubation periods, although hepatitis may take weeks to manifest itself. The onset usually occurs within the first week of return from the field, but may also occur at any time while hiking. Most cases begin abruptly and usually result in increased frequency, volume, and weight of stool. Typically, a hiker experiences at least four to five loose or watery bowel movements each day. Other commonly associated symptoms are nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, bloating, low fever, urgency, and malaise, and usually the appetite is affected. The condition is much more serious if there is blood or mucus in stools, abdominal pain, or high fever. Dehydration is a possibility. Life-threatening illness resulting from WAD is extremely rare but can occur in people with weakened immune systems. Some people may be carriers and not exhibit symptoms. ==Causes== Infectious diarrhea acquired in the wilderness is caused by various bacteria, viruses, and parasites (protozoa). The most commonly reported are the protozoa Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Other infectious agents may play a larger role than generally believed and include Campylobacter, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, enterotoxogenic E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, Shigella, and various other viruses. More rarely, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Cyanobacterium may also cause disease. Giardia lamblia cysts usually do not tolerate freezing although some cysts can survive a single freeze‚Äìthaw cycle. Cysts can remain viable for nearly three months in river water when the temperature is 10 ¬∞C and about one month at 15‚Äì20 ¬∞C in lake water. Cryptosporidium may survive in cold waters (4 ¬∞C) for up to 18 months, and can even withstand freezing, although its viability is thereby greatly reduced. Many other varieties of diarrhea-causing organisms, including Shigella and Salmonella typhi, and hepatitis A virus, can survive freezing for weeks to months. Virologists believe all surface water in the United States and Canada has the potential to contain human viruses, which cause a wide range of illnesses including diarrhea, polio and meningitis. Modes of acquiring infection from these causes are limited to fecal-oral transmission, and contaminated water and food. The major factor governing pathogen content of surface water is human and animal activity in the watershed. ==Diagnosis== It may be difficult to associate a particular case of diarrhea with a recent wilderness trip of a few days because incubation of the disease may outlast the trip. Studies of trips that are much longer than the average incubation period, e.g. a week for Cryptosporidium and Giardia, are less susceptible to these errors since there is enough time for the diarrhea to occur during the trip. Other bacterial and viral agents have shorter incubation periods, although hepatitis may require weeks. A suspected case of wilderness-acquired diarrhea may be assessed within the general context of intestinal complaints. During any given four-week period, as many as 7.2% of Americans may experience some form of infectious or non-infectious diarrhea. There are an estimated 99 million annual cases of intestinal infectious disease in the United States, most commonly from viruses, followed by bacteria and parasites, including Giardia and Cryptosporidium. There are an estimated 1.2 million U.S. cases of symptomatic giardiasis annually. However, only about 40% of cases are symptomatic. ==Prevention== Since wilderness acquired diarrhea can be caused by insufficient hygiene, contaminated water, and (possibly) increased susceptibility from vitamin deficiency, prevention methods should address these causes. ===Hygiene=== The risk of fecal-oral transmission of pathogens that cause diarrhea can be significantly reduced by good hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water after urination and defecation, and washing eating utensils with warm soapy water. Additionally a three-bowl system can be used for washing eating utensils. ===Treating water=== Water can be treated in the wilderness through filtering, chemical disinfectants, a portable ultraviolet light device, pasteurizing or boiling. Factors in choice may include the number of people involved, space and weight considerations, the quality of available water, personal taste and preferences, and fuel availability. In a study of long-distance backpacking, it was found that water filters were used more consistently than chemical disinfectants. Inconsistent use of iodine or chlorine may be due to disagreeable taste, extended treatment time or treatment complexity due to water temperature and turbidity. Because methods based on halogens, such as iodine and chlorine, do not kill Cryptosporidium, and because filtration misses some viruses, the best protection may require a two-step process of either filtration or coagulation-flocculation, followed by halogenation. Boiling is effective in all situations. Iodine resins, if combined with microfiltration to remove resistant cysts, are also a viable single-step process, but may not be effective under all conditions. New one-step techniques using chlorine dioxide, ozone, and UV radiation may prove effective, but still require validation. Ultraviolet (UV) light for water disinfection is well established and widely used for large applications, like municipal water systems. Some hikers use small portable UV devices which meet the U.S. EPA Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers, for example, the SteriPEN. Another approach to portable UV water purification is solar disinfection (also called sodis). Clear water is sterilized by putting it in a clear polyethylene (PET) bottle and leaving it in direct sunlight for 6 hours. ===Water risk avoidance=== Different types of water sources may have different levels of contamination: * More contamination may be in water that # likely could have passed through an area subject to heavy human or animal use # is cloudy, has surface foam, or has some other suspicious appearance. * Less contamination may be in water from # springs (provided the true source is not surface water a short distance above) # large streams (those entering from the side may have less contamination than those paralleling the trail) # fast-flowing streams # higher elevations # lakes with undisturbed sediments (10 days undisturbed water storage can result in 75‚Äì99% removal of coliform bacteria by settling to the bottom) # freshly melted snow # deep wells (provided they aren't subject to contamination from surface runoff) # regions where there was a heavy snow year when streams run full and long compared to dry years. Rain storms can either improve or worsen water quality. They can wash contaminants into water and stir up contaminated sediments with increasing flow, but can also dilute contaminants by adding large amounts of water. Unfortunately, there have not been any epidemiological studies to validate the above, except possibly for the case of spring water. ===Vitamins=== One study suggests that on very long trips in the wilderness, taking multivitamins may reduce the incidence of diarrhea. ==Treatment== WAD is typically self-limited, generally resolving without specific treatment. Oral rehydration therapy with rehydration salts is often beneficial to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Clear, disinfected water or other liquids are routinely recommended. Hikers who develop three or more loose stools in a 24-hour period ‚Äì especially if associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, or blood in stools ‚Äì should be treated by a doctor and may benefit from antibiotics, usually given for 3‚Äì5 days. Alternatively, a single dose azithromycin or levofloxacin may be prescribed. If diarrhea persists despite therapy, travelers should be evaluated and treated for possible parasitic infection. Cryptosporidium can be quite dangerous to patients with compromised immune systems. Alinia (nitazoxanide) is approved by the FDA for treatment of Cryptosporidium. ==Epidemiology== The risk of acquiring infectious diarrhea in the wilderness arises from inadvertent ingestion of pathogens. Various studies have sought to estimate diarrhea attack rates among wilderness travelers, and results have ranged widely. The variation of diarrhea rate between studies may depend on the time of year, the location of the study, the length of time the hikers were in the wilderness, the prevention methods used, and the study methodology. The National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS), which emphasizes strict hand-washing techniques, water disinfection and washing of common cooking utensils in their programs, reports that gastrointestinal illnesses occurred at a rate of only 0.26 per 1000 program days. In contrast, a survey of long-distance Appalachian Trail hikers found more than half the respondents reported at least one episode of diarrhea that lasted an average of two days. (Infectious diarrhea may last longer than an average of two days; certain forms of non-infectious diarrhea, caused by diet change etc., can be of very brief duration). Analysis of this survey found occurrence of diarrhea was positively associated with the duration of exposure in the wilderness. During any given four-week period, as many as 7.2% of Americans may experience some form of infectious or non- infectious diarrhea. A number of behaviors each individually reduced the incidence of diarrhea: treating water; routinely washing hands with soap and water after defecation and urination; cleaning cooking utensils with soap and warm water; and taking multi-vitamins. A variety of pathogens can cause infectious diarrhea, and most cases among backpackers appear to be caused by bacteria from feces. A study at Grand Teton National Park found 69% of diarrhea affected visitors had no identifiable cause, that 23% had diarrhea due to Campylobacter and 8% of patients with diarrhea had giardiasis. Campylobacter enteritis occurred most frequently in young adults who had hiked in wilderness areas and drunk untreated surface water in the week prior. Another study tested 35 individuals before and after a trip to the Desolation Wilderness of California. Giardia cysts were found in fecal samples from two people after the trip, but they were asymptomatic. A third person was empirically treated for symptoms of giardiasis. Fecal-oral transmission may be the most common vector for wilderness acquired diarrhea. There are differing opinions regarding the importance of routine disinfection of water during relatively brief backcountry visits. ===Backcountry water quality surveys=== Infection by fecal coliform bacteria, which indicate fecal pollution, are more common than giardiasis. Risks are highest in surface water near trails used by pack animals and cattle pastures. Most samples of backcountry water in the Desolation Wilderness in California have found very low or no Giardia cysts. The infectious dose of giardia, however, is very low, with about 2% chance of infection from a single cyst. Also, very few studies have addressed the issue of transient contamination. According to one researcher, the likely model for the risk of Giardia from wilderness water is pulse contamination, that is, a brief period of high cyst concentration from fecal contamination. ==Terminology== Diarrhea acquired in the wilderness or other remote areas is typically a form of infectious diarrhea, itself classified as a type of secretory diarrhea. These are all considered forms of gastroenteritis. The term may be applied in various remote areas of non-tropical developed countries (U.S., Canada, western Europe, etc.), but is less applicable in developing countries, and in the tropics, because of the different pathogens that are most likely to cause infection. ==See also== * Wilderness medicine * Traveler's diarrhea ==FootnotesReferences== * ==External links== * Category:Diarrhea Category:Camping Category:Conditions diagnosed by stool test Category:Drinking water Category:Foodborne illnesses Category:Hiking Category:Symptoms and signs: Digestive system and abdomen Category:Waterborne diseases Category:Wilderness ","title":"Wilderness-acquired diarrhea"},{"id":"2216607","text":"Emaj√µgi (; meaning \\"Mother River\\") is a river in Estonia which flows from Lake V√µrtsj√§rv through Tartu County into Lake Peipsi, crossing the city of Tartu for 10 km. It has a length of 100 km. The Emaj√µgi is sometimes called the Suur Emaj√µgi (\\"Great Emaj√µgi\\"), in contrast with the V√§ike Emaj√µgi (\\"Little Emaj√µgi\\"), another river which flows into the southern end of Lake V√µrtsj√§rv. Emaj√µgi is the second largest river in Estonia by discharge and the only fully navigable river. ==Course== The source of Emaj√µgi is at the northeastern shore of V√µrtsj√§rv at Rannu-J√µesuu, from where the river follows a roughly eastward course towards Lake Peipsi. The course of Emaj√µgi is divided into 3 distinct sections. dead link In the upper course, from V√µrtsj√§rv to K√§revere bridge, the river flows through large, flat and marshy areas, which are part of Alam- Pedja Nature Reserve. In this heavily meandering section, Emaj√µgi lacks a clearly defined floodplain ‚Äì the flooded area spans several kilometres at times and has no definite borders. In the middle course from K√§revere to Kavastu through Tartu, Emaj√µgi follows a straighter course and flows in a clearly defined, shallow valley mostly a maximum of 10 m deep. The width of the valley in the middle course is 1‚Äì1.5 km; in Tartu, it narrows to 800 m. The narrowest section of the valley (400‚Äì600 m) is located in the end of the middle course near Kavastu. In the lower course, the river flows through a swampy lowland ‚Äì Emaj√µe Suursoo ‚Äì before emptying into Lake Peipsi at Praaga. The length of the river is . In 1927, its length was measured to be . This may have changed somewhat in the 1930s, when the river's meandering upper course was straightened to allow for easier navigation. ==History== A modern replica of the historic lodi The Emaj√µgi has been widely used as a waterway and trade route for centuries. In the past, it has also been an obstacle for land transport between Northern and Southern Estonia, because the river flows in a low-lying and swampy valley. Of the few suitable locations for crossing the river, Tartu has the most favourable conditions. Due to its location on the crossing of land and water routes, Tartu became an important trading center in Ancient Estonia. In the 19th century, Emaj√µgi was actively used for transporting different cargo to Tartu ‚Äì firewood, timber, hay, fish, and so on. The main type of vessel used was the lodi, a small river barge or sailing ship adjusted for navigation on Lake Peipsi and Emaj√µgi. Up to 200 barges were anchored in Tartu port at the time. The first steam paddler appeared on Emaj√µgi in 1843; there were six by 1900. The last river barges disappeared by the mid-20th century. Several new ships were brought to the river in the Soviet era to continue navigation to Pskov, Piirissaar, among other destinations. Fast hydrofoils, which were first introduced in 1960s, operated daily on the Tartu-Pskov route. Traffic on the route ended in 1992. Though attempts have been made to restart it since 1997, it remains closed. ==Crossings== Arch Bridge) in Tartu J√§nese railway bridge in Vorbuse.

It is meant to reflect on the role of law in the foundation of the country and to recognize its importance for society. ==History== Before President Dwight D. Eisenhower declared May 1 to be Law Day, U.S.A., the first day of May was known in some parts of the world as May Day: a day to remember the struggles of workers in their fight for better wages and working conditions. Law Day was originally the idea of Charles S. Rhyne, Eisenhower's legal counsel for a time, who was serving in 1957‚Äì1958 as president of the American Bar Association.ABA Journal, May 2008.

But on February 5, 1958, President Eisenhower recognized the first Law Day when he proclaimed that henceforth May 1 of each year would be Law Day in the United States. He stated: \\"In a very real sense, the world no longer has a choice between force and law.

Today, many local bars and legal education associations, such as the Florida Law Related Education Association and the New York State Bar Association, use Law Day as a legal education tool, especially for students. The day has been criticized as being intended to reduce the influence of May Day, a holiday that originated with a workers revolt in the 1800s. Like Earth Day, Law Day is not a government holiday. To celebrate Law Day, some local bar associations hold a luncheon, featuring speakers who discuss topics such as justice or the liberties provided for by the United States Constitution. Also, attorneys might visit schools and talk to students about the American legal system. The American Bar Association designates a theme to highlight an important issue relating to the law or legal system. The 2014 theme was American Democracy and the Rule of Law: Why Every Vote Matters. The theme reflects the importance of voting rights, ballot box accessibility and voter engagement.

Route 96 maintains a straight east-west routing between these two points except at the very east end before the intersection with 171 and I-49 Business. At Carthage, 171 meets its \\"parent\\" route, US 71, along with I-49. 171's \\"southern\\" terminus and I-49 Business' northern terminus are here while the northern terminus of Route 571 approaches from the east. Route 96 continues through this interchange. This results in three x71's meeting in the same location. Route 171 was once Route 57. That was changed when I-57 was established on the eastern side of the state. Kansas did not change K-57's number to match until 2004, when it became K-171 after it was decided to shorten K-57 because it had numerous concurrencies along its routing. ==Interstate 49== It is suggested that Missouri Route 171 east of MO 249 will eventually be a part of Interstate 49. ==Major intersectionsReferences== 171 Category:Transportation in Jasper County, Missouri ","title":"Missouri Route 171"},{"id":"2216647","text":"In common law jurisdictions, a misrepresentation is an untrue or misleading R v Kylsant [1931] statement of fact made during negotiations by one party to another, the statement then inducing that other party to enter into a contract.In Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co[1951] Ms Curtis took a wedding dress with beads and sequins to the cleaners. They gave her a contract to sign and she asked the assistant what it was. The assistant said it merely covered risk to the beads, but in fact the contract exempted all liability. The dress was stained but the exclusion was ineffective because of the assistant's misrepresentation, and the claim was allowed.Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co [1951] 1 KB 805 The misled party may normally rescind the contract, and sometimes may be awarded damages as well (or instead of rescission). The law of misrepresentation is an amalgam of contract and tort; and its sources are common law, equity and statute. The common law was amended by the Misrepresentation Act 1967. The general principle of misrepresentation has been adopted by the USA and various Commonwealth countries, e.g. India. ==Representation and contract terms== A \\"representation\\" is a pre-contractual statement made during negotiations.For the purposes of \\"offer and acceptance\\", a representation may serve a further function such as an \\"offer\\", \\"counter- offer\\", \\"invitation to treat\\", \\"request for information\\" or \\"statement of intention\\" If a representation has been incorporated into the contract as a term,A contractual term may be a warranty, condition or innominate term. then the normal remedies for breach of contract apply. Factors that determine whether or not a representation has become a term include: * The relative expertise of the parties.Oscar Chess v Williams (1957) Dick Bentley v Harold Smith Motors (1965) * The reliance that one party has shown on the statement.Bannerman v White (1861). * The reassurances given by the speaker.Schawel v Reade (1913) * The customary norms of the trade in question.Ecay v Godfrey (1947) * The representation forms the basis of a collateral contract.Andrews v Hopkinson (1957)Shanklin Pier v Detel Products (1951)Evans v Andrea Merzario (1976)Heilbut, Symons & Co. v Buckleton [1913] A.C. 30 HLHoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer [1919]. Otherwise, an action may lie in misrepresentation, and perhaps in the torts of negligence and deceit also. Although a suit for breach of contract is relatively straightforward, there are advantages in bringing a parallel suit in misrepresentation, because whereas repudiation is available only for breach of conditionA \\"condition\\" is a term whose breach denies the main benefit of the contract to the claimant., rescission is prima facie available for all misreps, subject to the provisions of s.2 of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, and subject to the inherent limitations of an equitable remedy.\\"Inherent limitations\\": equitable remedies are only ever discretionary; and one must \\"come to equity with clean hands\\". == Duties of the parties== For a misrepresentation to occur, especially a negligent misrepresentation, the following elements need to be satisfied. * A positive duty that exists to ascertain and convey the truth to the other contracting party, * and subsequently a failure to meet that duty, and * ultimately a harm must arise from that failure. ===English contract law=== There is no general duty of disclosure in English contract law, and one is normally not obliged to say anything.However, EU Law has introduced a \\"right of reasonable expectation\\". - Marleasing Ordinary contracts do not require \\"good faith\\" as such,\\"Good faith in English contract law?\\" and mere compliance with the law is sufficient. However in particular relationships silence may form the basis of an actionable misrepresentation:.See, e.g., Davies v. London & Provincial Marine Insurance Co (1878) 8 Ch. D. 469, 474. Justice Fry commented on the responsibilities of a fiduciary \\"...they can only contract after the most ample disclosure of everything...\\" *Agents have a fiduciary relationship with their principal. They must make proper disclosure and must not make secret profits.Lowther v Lord Lowther (1806) 13 Ves Jr 95, the plaintiff handed over a picture to an agent for sale. The agent knew of the picture's true worth yet bought it for a considerably lower price. The plaintiff subsequently discovered the picture's true worth and sued to rescind the contract. It was held that the defendant was in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff and accordingly assumed an obligation to disclose all material facts. Accordingly, the contract could be rescinded. * Employers and employees have a bona fide duty to each other once a contract of employment has begun; but a job applicant owes no duty of disclosure in a job interview.In Fletcher v Krell (1873) 2 LJ (QB) 55, a woman who was appointed to the post of governess failed to reveal that she had previously been married. (The employer favoured single women). It was held that she had made no misrepresentation.Spice Girls v Aprilia World Service CHD 24 FEB 2000http://swarb.co.uk/spice-girls-ltd-v-aprilia-world-service-bv- chd-24-feb-2000/ * A contract uberrimae fidei is a contract of 'utmost good faith', and include contracts of insurance, business partnerships, and family agreements.Gordon v Gordon (1821) 3 Swan 400, two brothers had reached an agreement regarding the family estate. The elder brother was under the impression that he was born out of wedlock and thus not their father's true heir. The agreement was reached on this basis. The elder brother subsequently discovered that this was not the case and that the younger brother had knowledge of this during the negotiation of the settlement. The elder brother sued to set aside the agreement and was successful on the grounds that such a contract was one of uberrimae fidei and the required disclosure had not been executed. When applying for insurance, the proposer must disclose all material facts for the insurer properly to assess the risk.In insurance the insurer agrees to indemnify the assured against losses proximately caused by insured perils, and the insurer is thus entitled to know full details of the risk being transferred to him.Lord Blackburn addressed the issue in Brownlie v Campbell (1880) 5 App Cas 925 when he noted \\"...the concealment of a material circumstance known to you...avoids the policy.\\"In the 1908 case of Joel v Law Union [1908] KB 884 the de minimis rule was applied in a life assurance policy. Despite minor omissions, the assured had made a sufficiently substantial disclosure of material facts that the insurer knew the risk, and the policy was validlex non curat de minimis - the law does not concern itself with trifles In the UK, the duty of disclosure in insurance has been substantially amended by the Insurance Act 2015. ==The \\"untrue statement\\"== To amount to a misrepresentation, the statement must be untrue or seriously misleading. A statement which is \\"technically true\\" but which gives a misleading impression is deemed an \\"untrue statement\\".In Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd, Krakowski agreed to enter into a contract to buy a shop premises from Eurolynx as long as a 'strong tenant' had been organised. The contract proceeded on the grounds that such a tenant had been arranged. Unbeknown to Krakowski, Eurolynx had entered into an additional agreement with the tenant to provide funds for the first three months rent to ensure the contract went ahead. When the tenant defaulted on the rent and subsequently vacated the premises, Krakowski found out about the additional agreement and rescinded the contract with Eurolynx. It was held that Eurolynx's failure to disclose all material facts about the 'strong tenant' was enough to constitute a misrepresentation and the contract could be rescinded on these grounds. If a misstatement is made and later the representor finds that it is false, it becomes fraudulent unless the representer updates the other party.Lockhart v. Osman [1981] VR 57, an agent had advertised some cattle as being \\"well-suited for breeding purposes\\". Later on, it was discovered that the stock had been exposed to a contagious disease which affected the reproductive system. It was held that the agent had a duty to take remedial action and correct the representation. The failure by the agent to take such measures resulted in the contract being set aside. If the statement is true at the time, but becomes untrue due to a change in circumstances, the representor must update the original statement.With v O'Flanagan [1936] Ch. 575, the plaintiff entered into a contract to purchase O'Flanagan's medical practice. During negotiations it was said that the practice produced an income of ¬£2000 per year. Before the contract was signed, the practice took a downward turn and lost a significant amount of value. After the contract had been entered into, the true nature of the practice was discovered and the plaintiff took action in misrepresentation. In his decision, Lord Wright said, \\"...a representation made as a matter of inducement to enter into a contract is to be treated as a continuing representation.\\".With v O'Flanagan [1936] Ch. 575, 584. Actionable misrepresentations must be misstatements of fact or law:Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council [1999] 2 AC 349, abolished a bar on mistake of law bar and Pankhania v Hackney LBC [2002] EWHC 2441 (Ch) held the same went for misrepresentation under Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1) where agents of a land seller incorrectly said that people running a car park on some property were licensees rather than protected business tenants. misstatements of opinionBisset v Wilkinson [1927] AC 177 PC or intention are not deemed statements of fact;See Achut v Achuthan [1927] AC 177.. but if one party appears to have specialist knowledge of the topic, his \\"opinions\\" may be considered actionable misstatements of fact.See Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon [1976] 2 Lloyd's Rep 305.Smith v Land & House Property (1884) 28 Ch D 7 CA For example, false statements made by a seller regarding the quality or nature of the property that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation.Smith v Land & House Property (1884) 28 Ch D 7 CA * Statements of opinion Statements of opinion are usually insufficient to amount to a misrepresentation as it would be unreasonable to treat personal opinions as \\"facts\\", as in Bisset v Wilkinson.Bisset v Wilkinson [1927] AC 177. Exceptions can arise where opinions may be treated as \\"facts\\": \\\\- where an opinion is expressed yet this opinion is not actually held by the representor, \\\\- where it is implied that the representor has facts on which to base the opinion,See, e.g., Smith v Land & House Property Corp (1884) 28 Ch. D. 7. \\\\- where one party should have known facts on which such an opinion would be based.See, e.g., Esso Petroleum v Mardon [1976] QB 801. * Statements of intention Statements of intention do not constitute misrepresentations should they fail to come to fruition, since the time the statements were made they can not be deemed either true or false. However, an action can be brought if the intention never actually existed, as in Edgington v Fitzmaurice.In Edgington v Fitzmaurice (1885) 29 Ch. D. 459, company directors seeking a loan \\"intended to develop the business\\" always intended to use the cash to repay debts. The state of mind is an existing fact, therefore, a false presentation of an existing fact, so that the contract was voidable. * Statements of law For many years, statements of law were deemed incapable of amounting to misrepresentations because the law is \\"equally accessible by both parties\\" and is \\"...as much the business of the plaintiff as of [the defendants] to know what the law [is].\\".Beattie v Lord Ebury (1872) LR 7 Ch App 777, 803. This view has changed, and it is now accepted that statements of law may be treated as akin to statements of fact.See, e.g., ; see also . While dealing with a mistake of law, similar reasoning should apply to a misrepresentation of law. As stated by Lord Denning \\"...the distinction between law and fact is illusory\\".Andre & Cie v Ets Michel Blanc & Fils [1979] 2 Lloyds LR 427, 430. * Statement to the misled An action in misrepresentation can only be brought by the misled party, or \\"representee\\". This means that only those who were an intended recipient of the representation may sue, as in Peek v Gurney,Peek v Gurney (1873) LR 6 HL 377 where the plaintiff sued the directors of a company for indemnity. The action failed because it was found that the plaintiff was not a representee (an intended party to the representation) and accordingly misrepresentation could not be a protection. It is not necessary for the representation to have been be received directly; it is sufficient that the representation was made to another party with the intention that it would become known to a subsequent party and ultimately acted upon by them.See, e.g., . However, it IS essential that the untruth originates from the defendant. ===Inducement=== The misled party must show that he relied on the misstatement and was induced into the contract by it. In Attwood v Small,(1838) 6 Cl&F; 232 the seller, Small, made false claims about the capabilities of his mines and steelworks. The buyer, Attwood, said he would verify the claims before he bought, and he employed agents who declared that Small's claims were true. The House of Lords held that Attwood could not rescind the contract, as he did not rely on Small but instead relied on his agents. Edgington v Fitzmaurice(1885) 29 Ch D 459 confirmed further that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract, for a remedy to be available, so long as it is an influence.A Burrows, A Casebook on Contract (Hart, Oxford 2007) 355Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corp (No 2) [2002] UKHL 43, damages for deceit cannot be reduced for contributory negligence.Gran Gelato Ltd v Richcliff (Group) Ltd [1992] QB 560see Smith v Hughes (1871) LR 6 QB 597 A party induced by a misrepresentation is not obliged to check its veracity. In Redgrave v Hurd (1881) 20 Ch D 1 Redgrave, an elderly solicitor told Hurd, a potential buyer, that the practice earned ¬£300 pa. Redgrave said Hurd could inspect the accounts to check the claim, but Hurd did not do so. Later, having signed a contract to join Redgrave as a partner, Hurd discovered the practice generated only ¬£200 pa, and the accounts verified this figure. Lord Jessel MR held that the contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, because Redgrave had made a misrepresentation, adding that Hurd was entitled to rely on the ¬£300 statement.The case also makes clear that, the circumstances having altered, Redgrave was under a duty to inform the Hurd of the changes. By contrast, in Leaf v International Galleries,Leaf v International Galleries [1950] 2 KB 86 where a gallery sold painting after wrongly saying it was a Constable, Lord Denning held that while there was neither breach of contract nor operative mistake, there was a misrepresentation; but, five years having passed, the buyer's right to rescind had lapsed. This suggests that, having relied on a misrepresentation, the misled party has the onus to discover the truth \\"within a reasonable time\\". In Doyle v Olby [1969],Doyle v Olby1969 2 QB 158 CA a party misled by a fraudulent misrepresentation was deemed NOT to have affirmed even after more than a year. ==Innocent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent misrepresentation== A chart of the 3 types of misrepresentation, with definitions and remedies ===Australian law=== Within trade and commerce, the law regarding misrepresentation is dealt with by the Australian Consumer Law, under Section 18 and 29 of this code, the ACL calls contractual misrepresentations as \\"misleading and deceptive conduct\\" and imposes a prohibition. The ACL provides for remedies, such as damages, injunctions, rescission of the contract, and other measures.https://www.artslaw.com.au/images/uploads/NEW_ACL_and_other_legal_actions_07.01.2016.pdf ===English law=== In England, the common law was codified and amended by the Misrepresentation Act 1967. (Although short and apparently succinct, the 1967 Act is widely regarded as a confusing and poorly drafted statute which has caused a number of difficulties, especially in relation to the basis of the award of damages.Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson [1991] 2 QB 297 It was mildly amended by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and in 2012, but it escaped the attention of the consolidating Consumer Rights Act 2015). Prior to the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the common law deemed that there were two categories of misrepresentation: fraudulent and innocent. The effect of the act is primarily to create a new category by dividing innocent misrepresentation into two separate categories: negligent and \\"wholly\\" innocent; and it goes on to state the remedies in respect of each of the three categories.Nowhere in the 1967 Act are the words \\"negligent misrepresentation\\" to be found; that terminology was established by practising and academic lawyers. The point of the three categories is that the law recognises that the defendant may have been blameworthy to a greater or lesser extent; and the relative degrees of blameworthiness lead to differing remedies for the claimant. Once misrepresentation has been proven, it is presumed to be \\"negligent misrepresentation\\", the default category. It then falls to the claimant to prove that the defendant's culpability was more serious and that the misrepresentation was fraudulent. Conversely, the defendant may try to show that his misrepresentation was innocent. * Negligent misrepresentation is simply the default category.There is no specific relationship between negligent misrepresentation and the tort of negligence and the duty of care under Donoghue v Stevenson or Hedley Byrne v Heller. ::Remedy: The misled party may rescind and claim damages under s.2(1) for any losses. The court may \\"declare the contract subsisting\\" and award damages in lieu of rescission, but s.2(3) prevents the award of double damages. * Fraudulent misrepresentation is defined in the 3-part test in Donohoe v Donohoe , where the defendant Donohoe was categorically declared completely fraudulent as he: :(i) knows the statement to be false,R v Kylsant or :(ii) does not believe in the statement,A defendant honestly believing his statement to be true is not fraudulent: \\"Honesty of belief in the truth of a warranty is no defence to a breach of warranty, whereas it is a complete defence to a charge of false representation. If a statement is an honest expression of opinion, honestly entertained, it cannot be said that it involves a fraudulent misrepresentation of fact.\\" or :(iii) is reckless as to its truth. ::Remedy: The misled party may rescind and claim damages for all directly consequential losses. Doyle v Olby [1969] * Innocent misrepresentation is \\"belief on reasonable grounds up till the time of the contract that the facts represented are true\\". (s.2(1)of the Act). ::Remedy: The misled party may rescind but has no entitlement to damages under s.2(1). However, the court may \\"declare the contract subsisting\\" and award damages in lieu of rescission.The victim of an innocent misrepresentation who wishes to affirm the contract has no legal right to damages. Of course, the misled party may seek to negotiate a compensation payment, but the other party need not comply; and if the misled party litigates to seek \\"damages in lieu\\", but the court holds that the contract must subsist, the misled party will lose the case and be liable for costs. (By contrast, the victim of a breach of warranty in contract may claim damages for loss, but may not repudiate)Hong Kong Fir Shipping v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha ==Negligent misstatement== Negligent misstatement is not strictly part of the law of misrepresentation, but is a tort based upon the 1964 obiter dicta in Hedley Byrne v Heller Hedley Byrne v Heller [1964] A.C. 465 where the House of Lords found that a negligently-made statement (if relied upon) could be actionable provided a \\"special relationship\\" existed between the parties.In Hedley Byrne v Heller, the \\"special relationship\\" was between one bank who gave a financial reference to another bank. Subsequently in Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon,Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon [1976] Q.B. 801 Lord Denning transported this tort into contract law, stating the rule as: ...if a man, who has or professes to have special knowledge or skill, makes a representation by virtue thereof to another‚Ä¶with the intention of inducing him to enter into a contract with him, he is under a duty to use reasonable care to see that the representation is correct, and that the advice, information or opinion is reliable'. ==Remedies== Depending on the type of misrepresentation, remedies such as recission, or damages, or a combination of both may be available. Tortious liability may also be considered. Several countries, such as Australia have a statutory schema which deals with misrepresentations under consumer law.http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00003/Html/Volume_3#param46 * Innocent misrepresentation Entitlement to rescission of the contract, but not damages * Negligent misrepresentation Entitlement to damages or rescission of the contract * Fraudulent misrepresentation Entitlement to damages, or rescission of the contract ===Rescission=== A contract vitiated by misrepresentation is voidable and not void ab initio. The misled party may either (i) rescind, or (ii) affirm and continue to be bound. If the claimant chooses to rescind, the contract will still be deemed to have been valid up to the time it was avoided, so any transactions with a third party remains valid, and the third party will retain good title.For legal reasoning application of the difference see Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson [2004] 1 AC 919; Brooks, O & Dodd, A ‚ÄòShogun: A Principled Decision‚Äô (2003) 153 NLJ 1898 Rescission can be effected either by informing the representor or by requesting an order from the court. Rescission is an equitable remedy which is not always available.\\"He who comes to equity must come with clean hands\\". Rescission requires the parties to be restored to their former positions; so if this is not possible, rescission is unavailable.See Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co (1878) 3 App. Cas. 308. A misled party who, knowing of the misrepresentation, fails to take steps to avoid the contract will be deemed to have affirmed through \\"laches\\", as in Leaf v International Galleries;Leaf v International Galleries 1950] 2 KB 86See Long v. Lloyd [1958] 1 WLR 753. See also .in Long v Lloyd Mr Long bought from Mr Lloyd a lorry advertised as being in ‚Äòexceptional condition,‚Äô said to do 40 mph and 11 miles to the gallon. When it broke down after two days and was doing 5 miles to the gallon, Mr Long complained. Mr Lloyd said he would repair it for half the price of a reconstructed dynamo. Because Mr Long accepted this, when it broke down again, Pearce LJ held the contract had been affirmed. It was too late to escape for misrepresentation. A more lenient approach may now exist. As Slade LJ pointed out in Peyman v Lanjani,[42] actual knowledge of the right to choose to affirm a contract or rescind is essential before one can be said to have \\"affirmed\\" a contract. and the claimant will be estopped from rescinding. The time limit for taking such steps varies depending on the type of misrepresentation. In cases of fraudulent misrepresentation, the time limit runs until when the misrepresentation ought to have been discovered, whereas in innocent misrepresentation, the right to rescission may lapse even before the represent can reasonably be expected to know about it.See Leaf v International Galleries [1950] 2 KB 86. Sometimes, third party rights may intervene and render rescission impossible. Say, if A misleads B and contracts to sell a house to him, and B later sells to C, the courts are unlikely to permit rescission as that would unfair impinge upon C. Under Misrepresentations Act 1967 s. 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the court has discretion to award damages instead of rescission, \\"if of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party.\\" ===Damages=== \\"Damages\\" are monetary compensation for loss. In contractHadley v Baxendale and tort,The Wagon Mound damages will be awarded if the breach of contract (or breach of duty) causes foreseeable loss. * By contrast, a fraudulent misrepresenter is liable in the common law tort of deceit for all direct consequences, whether or not the losses were foreseeable.Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd [1969] 2 QB 158] *For negligent misrepresentation, the claimant may get damages as of right under s.2(1) and/or damages in lieu of rescission under s.2(2). * For innocent misrepresentation, the claimant may get only damages in lieu of rescission under s.2(2). Given the relative lack of blameworthiness of a non- fraudulent defendant (who is at worst merely careless, and at best may honestly \\"believe on reasonable grounds\\" that he told the truth) for many years lawyers presumed that for these two categories, damages would be on a contract/tort basis requiring reasonable foreseeability of loss. In 1991, Royscot Trust Ltd v RogersonRoyscott Trust v Rogerson [1991] 3 All ER 294 CA changed all that. The court gave a literal interpretation of s.2 (which, to paraphrase, provides that where a person has been misled by a negligent misrepresentation then, if the misrepresentor would be liable to damages had the representation been made fraudulently, the defendant \\"shall be so liable\\"). The phrase shall be so liable was read literally to mean \\"liable as in fraudulent misrepresentation\\". So, under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, damages for negligent misrepresentation are calculated as if the defendant had been fraudulent, even if he has been merely careless.Royscott Trust v Rogerson is arguably per incuriam as the court failed to pay attention to the definition of fraudulent misrep in Derry v Peek. Had the court done so, it would have held that the misrep in this case was fraudulent rather than negligent. Although this was almost certainly not the intention of Parliament, no changes to the law have been made to address this discrepancy: the Consumer Rights Act 2015 left the 1967 Act intact. This is known as the fiction of fraud and also extends to tortious liability.Tortious liability has a wider scope than usual contractual liability, as it allows the claimant to claim for loss even if it is not reasonably foreseeable, which is not possible with a claim for breach of contract due to the decision in Hadley v Baxendale. Inclusion of the representation into the contract as a term will leave the remedy for breach in damages as a common law right. The difference is that damages for misrepresentation usually reflect the claimant's reliance interest, whereas damages for breach of contract protect the claimant's expectation interest, although the rules on mitigation will apply in the latter case. In certain cases though, the courts have awarded damages for loss of profit, basing it on loss of opportunity: see East v Maurer [1991] 2 All ER 733. S.2 does not specify how \\"damages in lieu\\" should be determined, and interpretation of the statute is up to the courts. ==Vitiating factors== Misrepresentation is one of several vitiating factors that can affect the validity of a contract. Other vitiating factors include: * Mistake * Undue influence *Duress ** Duress in English law ** Duress in American law ==See also== * Embezzlement * False pretenses‚Äîrelated criminal law term * Tort of deceit ==Bibliography == ;Books and chapters *PS Atiyah, Introduction to the Law of Contract (4th edn Clarendon, Oxford 1994) *H Beale, Bishop and Furmston, Cases and Materials on Contract Law (OUP 2008) *A Burrows, Cases and Materials on Contract Law (2nd edn Hart, Oxford 2009) ch 11 *H Collins, Contract law in context (4th edn CUP, Cambridge 2004) *E McKendrick, Contract Law (8th edn Palgrave, London 2009) ch 13 *E Peel, Treitel: The Law of Contract (7th edn Thompson, London 2008) ch 9 *M Chen-Wishart, Contract Law (6th edn OUP 2018) ch 5 ;Articles *PS Atiyah and G Treitel, 'Misrepresentation Act 1967' (1967) 30 MLR 369 *PS Atiyah, 'Res Ipsa Loquitur in England and Australia' (1972) 35 Modern Law Review 337 *R Taylor, 'Expectation, Reliance and Misrepresentation' (1982) 45 MLR 139 *R Hooley, 'Damages and the Misrepresentation Act 1967' (1991) 107 LQR 547,Hooley argues that fraud and negligence are qualitatively different and should be treated differently in order to reflect fraud's greater moral culpability. He says the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1) establishes only liability in damages but not their quantum, so Royscott was a poor decision. *I Brown and A Chandler, 'Deceit, Damages and the Misrepresentation Act 1967, s 2(1)' [1992] LMCLQ 40 *H Beale, ‚ÄòDamages in Lieu of Rescission for Misrepresentation‚Äô (1995) 111 LQR 60 *J O'Sullivan, 'Rescission as a Self-Help Remedy: a Critical Analysis' [2000] CLJ 509 *W Swadling, ‚ÄòRescission, Property and the Common law‚Äô (2005) 121 LQR 123, suggests the reasoning on recovery of property should not merge the issues of validity of contract and transfer of title.Swadling controversially says the two are separate (i.e. he is in favour of the ‚Äòabstraction principle‚Äô). So Caldwell should not have got his car back. Rights in property are passed on delivery and with intent to pass title. This is not dependent on the validity of the contract. In short, he argues for the abstraction principle. *B H√§cker, ‚ÄòRescission of Contract and Revesting of Title: A Reply to Mr Swadling‚Äô [2006] RLR 106, responds to Swadling's argument.

For example, the flash EEPROM of certain models of the DEC Multia, which was a small, personal Alpha AXP workstation designed to run Windows NT, was only large enough to hold a single firmware. The SRM console is capable of display on either a graphical adapter (such as a PCI VGA card) or, if no graphical console and/or local keyboard is detected, on a serial connection to a VT100-compatible terminal. In this way the SRM console is similar to the Open Firmware used in SPARC and Apple PowerMac computers, for example. Upon system initialization, an Alpha AXP computer set to boot from the SRM console displays a short report of the software version of the firmware, and presents the \\"three chevron prompt\\" consisting of three greater-than signs: Digital Personal WorkStation 433u Console V7.2-1 Mar 6 2000 14:47:02 >>> Several commands are available by typing them at the prompt, and a list of possible commands is available by entering the command \`help\` or \`man\` at the prompt. Various system variables for establishing automatic boot settings, parameter strings to be passed to an operating system and the like may also be set from the SRM prompt. The SRM firmware contains drivers for booting from boot media including SCSI hard disks and CD-ROM drives attached to a supported SCSI adapter, various IDE ATA and ATAPI devices, and network booting via BOOTP or DHCP is possible with supported network adapters. When an appropriate disk boot device is available, the SRM console locates and loads the target primary bootstrap image using information written in the target disk boot block; in logical block zero. The boot block contains the disk location and block size of the target primary bootstrap image file, and SRM will load that into memory and will then transfer control to it. == External links == * Red Hat Documentation: The SRM Firmware Console * SRM Console Reference * Alpha SRM Console for Alpha Microprocessor Motherboards User‚Äôs Guide * What is SRM? * SRM Firmware Howto SRM Category:Firmware Category:OpenVMS ","title":"System Reference Manual"},{"id":"2216651","text":"Location in Estonia Lake V√µrtsj√§rv (; ) is a lake in southern Estonia with an area of 270 km¬≤ (104 mi¬≤). It is the second largest lake in Estonia (behind Lake Peipus),Facta 2001, part 18, page 525 and the largest lake situated entirely within Estonia. The shallow lake is 33.7 m (111 ft) above sea level. The river Emaj√µgi flows from Lake V√µrtsj√§rv to Lake Peipus. ==History== The lake basin existed before the Last Ice Age, but was then transformed by moving ice sheets which partly eroded the lake wall and partly filled the depression with deposits. In its present form the lake has existed since the Middle Holocene. It was first mentioned in the Livonian Chronicle of Henry, where it is called Worcegerwe. ==Geography== The relatively low shores of the lake are swampy in the south and sandy in the north. On the eastern shore, there is a coastal abrasion near the village of Tamme; these cliffs have yielded a number of fossils of Devonian fish, which have been compared to similar fossils found in Scotland. There are a few small islands in the southern part of the lake. Of these only Tondisaar and P√§hksaar are permanent islands, while Ainsaar becomes a peninsula during low water and Heinassaar is submerged at high water. This is because of the lakes fluctuating water level, which changes with a mean annual amplitude of 1.4 m; this is about half of its 2.8 m average depth. From around November to April, the lake is covered with an ice sheet. Situated northeast of the lake is the Alam-Pedja Nature Reserve, the largest nature reserve in Estonia. ==Ecology== Around 35 species of fish are found in the lake, a few of which are commercially important. After a decline of valuable species during the 1950s and 1960s, some conservation measures were enforced which lead to an improvement in the situation. Today, around 400 t of fish are caught annually. Lake V√µrtsj√§rv is the main catchment area for eel in Estonia. However, fishing is entirely dependent on restocking with farmed glass eels, as eels are migratory and do no longer return in sufficient quantities to Europe. Due to declining numbers of natural eel, in 2017 the European Union's Agriculture and Fisheries Council decided on a three-month ban of eel fishing in the Baltic Sea during eel migratory season. Eel caught in the Baltic Sea had only accounted for a mere 700 kg the year before, as opposed to an average of 10.2-13.3 t per year in Lake V√µrtsj√§rv. The lake and the nearby wetlands are also an important breeding ground for birds, as well as a staging area for migratory birds. In total, 213 bird species have been recorded around the lake. In recent decades, eutrophication of the lake has increased, with detrimental effects on biological diversity. This is thought to be mainly caused by a combination of poorly treated wastewater influx as well as phosphorus and nitrate runoff from agriculture. In addition, climatic fluctuations seem to have a stronger influence on the lake due to its shallow depth. ==Tourism== The region is little known as a tourist destination internationally, and the deteriorating water quality has posed a problem for both fishing and tourism development. However, V√µrtsj√§rv was voted European Destination of Excellence in 2010. There is a visitor centre and museum on the east shore of the lake.

The station is owned by Sam Poulten through the holding company Merrimack Valley Radio, LLC. The station's studios are located on Market Street in Lowell. ==History== WCAP began commercial broadcasting in 1951 after a five-year licensing odyssey that saw the station's city of license, proposed hours of operation, output power and call letters changed at various points during the proceedings. Station head Israel \\"Ike\\" Cohen established Northeast Radio Inc. in 1946. He sought a license at 1210 kHz in Lawrence and was granted the call letters WABW. However, when the call letters WCAP became available, Cohen took those calls, and later won approval to amend his application to seek 980 kHz, which was ultimately granted a construction permit in the spring of 1949 as part of a regional arrangement under which the Brockton Enterprise won approval to increase the power of its WBET from 250 to 1,000 watts at 990 kHz (the station later moved to 1460 to add nighttime service), and a mutually exclusive application for 980 in Newport, Rhode Island was denied and dismissed for reasons including lack of candor on the part of that applicant. When the family that owned the Lawrence Daily Eagle and Evening Tribune newspapers appeared poised to win approval for an upgrade of its station, WLAW, to 50 kW on 680 kHz (now occupied by WRKO), Cohen sought and received approval to move the station license from Lawrence to Lowell, which at the time was home to only a 250-watt station, WLLH. The original investors in WCAP were Cohen and his brothers Theodore and Maurice, each with 20%, Ray Goulding, of Bob and Ray fame, and his brother Philip, an announcer at WMGM in New York City, where Israel Cohen worked as an engineer, each with 5% and engineer Ralph Floyd, 30%. Ray Goulding was station manager and Phillip Goulding served as program director. Ray hosted occasional afternoon programs. Ray Goulding was active in working to get the station on the air, appearing at a meeting of the Lowell Planning Board to advance an argument in favor of a transmitter and studio location that was rejected. The Gouldings were ousted from their positions in a stockholders meeting on September 10, 1951, three months after the station went on the air. Phillip Goulding was quoted by the Lowell Sun newspaper of September 11, 1951 as saying the ousters came as a shock, and the brothers planned to contest it, however they sold their interest in the station to the Cohen brothers.https://newspaperarchive.com/lowell-sun/1951-09-11/page-24/ The newspaper reported that the day following the firing of the Gouldings, the daytime-only station signed on two hours late as employees staged a sick-out. Ray, who had been born in Lowell, pulled the first air shift on WCAP, and Ike Cohen kept a signed copy of the program log in his office for the rest of his life. It was Goulding's first on-air appearance on a Lowell station under his real name; he had previously worked at WLLH as Dennis Howard, taking the air name to avoid confusion with Phillip, who was an established news announcer in Boston at the time. The station was the third to bear the call letters WCAP, the original sign-on for both of the others, in Asbury Park, New Jersey (now WADB) and in Washington D.C. (now defunct) were voiced by sportscaster Ted Husing. Israel Cohen, at the time a broadcast engineer at WMGM in New York, secured Husing's services for the third WCAP sign-on. Israel Cohen ran the station until his death in 1994 and was succeeded by his brother Maurice. A deal to sell the station was made in August 2007, approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on September 25, 2007, and the transaction was consummated on November 21, 2007. The station is now owned by Merrimack Valley Radio, LLC.http://www.broadcastideas.com/wcap-news.htm In early 2011, the two primary partners in the station, Clark Smidt and Sam Poulten, were involved in a legal dispute over operation of the station, with both claiming that the other partner put WCAP in financial danger. The dispute ended on June 28, when Poulten agreed to purchase Smidt's 55-percent stake in the station, giving him full ownership. After having operated from studios on Central Street in Lowell since its 1951 sign-on, WCAP moved to a street-level studio on Market Street in 2019, because of the effects on employees repeatedly partaking of lunch at Cappy's Copper Kettle, the bar and lounge at which city and business leaders would congregate, located directly below the radio station. The Cohen brothers were well known for annually buying a round \\"for the house\\" on every June 10. ==Programming== During the week, WCAP broadcasts a news/talk radio format including both local talk programs and the nationally syndicated progressive talk shows The Thom Hartmann Program and The Stephanie Miller Show. Nights and weekends, the station broadcasts an oldies format called \\"Beatles & Before\\". WCAP's seasonal programming also includes live broadcasts of Lowell Spinners baseball, high school football and basketball matchups, and UMass Lowell River Hawks hockey. The station conducts an annual radiothon to benefit the Salvation Army each December. ==References * Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1951 Category:Mass media in Middlesex County, Massachusetts CAP (AM) Category:1951 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"WCAP (AM)"},{"id":"2216678","text":"In universal algebra and mathematical logic, a term algebra is a freely generated algebraic structure over a given signature. For example, in a signature consisting of a single binary operation, the term algebra over a set X of variables is exactly the free magma generated by X. Other synonyms for the notion include absolutely free algebra and anarchic algebra. From a category theory perspective, a term algebra is the initial object for the category of all algebras of the same signature, and this object, unique up to isomorphism, is called an initial algebra; it generates by homomorphic projection all algebras in the category. A similar notion is that of a Herbrand universe in logic, usually used under this name in logic programming, which is (absolutely freely) defined starting from the set of constants and function symbols in a set of clauses. That is, the Herbrand universe consists of all ground terms: terms that have no variables in them. An atomic formula or atom is commonly defined as a predicate applied to a tuple of terms; a ground atom is then a predicate in which only ground terms appear. The Herbrand base is the set of all ground atoms that can be formed from predicate symbols in the original set of clauses and terms in its Herbrand universe. These two concepts are named after Jacques Herbrand. Term algebras also play a role in the semantics of abstract data types, where an abstract data type declaration provides the signature of a multi-sorted algebraic structure and the term algebra is a concrete model of the abstract declaration. ==Decidability== Term algebras can be shown decidable using quantifier elimination.

It can be argued as a defense, and if raised successfully can lead to the agreement in question being found void ab initio or voidable, or alternatively an equitable remedy may be provided by the courts. Common law has identified three different types of mistake in contract: the 'unilateral mistake', the 'mutual mistake' and the 'common mistake'. The distinction between the 'common mistake' and the 'mutual mistake' is important. Another breakdown in contract law divides mistakes into four traditional categories: unilateral mistake, mutual mistake, mistranscription, and misunderstanding. The law of mistake in any given contract is governed by the law governing the contract. The law from country to country can differ significantly. For instance, contracts entered into under a relevant mistake have not been voidable in English law since Great Peace Shipping v Tsavliris (International) Ltd (2002). == Examples == Mistake can be: * Mistake of law, or * Mistake of fact Mistake of law: when a party enters into a contract, without the knowledge of the law in the country, the contract is affected by such mistakes but it is not void. The reason here is that ignorance of law is not an excuse. However, if a party is induced to enter into a contract by the mistake of law then such a contract is not valid.Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council Illustration: Harjoth and Danny make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred by the Indian law of Limitation; the contract is not voidable. Mistake of fact: Where both the parties enter into an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is voidable. Explanation: An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject-matter of the agreement is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact. Illustration: Lady found a stone and sold it as a Topaz for $1 ($25 today). It was a raw uncut diamond worth $700 (today $17,000). The contract is not voidable. There was no mistake because neither party knew what the stone was.Wood v. Boynton (WI) Anti-illustration: A sells a cow to B for $80 because it is an infertile cow. The cow is actually pregnant and worth $1000. The contract is void.Sherwood v. Walker (MI). ==Unilateral mistakes== A unilateral mistake is where only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter contained in a contract. This kind of mistake is more common than other types of mistake. One must first distinguish between mechanical calculations and business error when looking at unilateral mistake. Ordinarily, unilateral mistake does not make a contract void. Traditionally this is caveat emptor (let the buyer beware), and under common law caveat venditor (let the seller beware). ===Exceptions=== A contract might be voidable from unilateral mistake for any of the following: :(1) One party relied on a statement of the other about a material fact that the second party knew or should have known was mistaken by the first party. :(2) ‚Äúclerical error that did not result in gross negligence‚Äù ::For mechanical calculations, a party may be able to set aside the contract on these grounds provided that the other party does not try to take advantage of the mistake, or 'snatch up' the offer (involving a bargain that one did not intend to make, betrayed by an error in arithmetic etc.). This will be seen by an objective standard, or if a reasonable person would be able to know that the mistake would not make sense to one of the parties. Unless one of the parties 'snatched up' the one-sided offer, courts will otherwise uphold the contract. :(3) The mistake was ‚Äúunconscionable‚Äù, i.e. so serious and unreasonable to be outrageous. ==Mutual mistake versus failure of mutual assent== A mutual mistake occurs when the parties to a contract are both mistaken about the same material fact within their contract. They are at cross-purposes. There is a meeting of the minds, but the parties are mistaken. Hence the contract is voidable. Collateral mistakes will not afford the right of rescission. A collateral mistake is one that 'does not go to the heart' of the contract. For a mutual mistake to be void, then the item the parties are mistaken about must be material (emphasis added). When there is a material mistake about a material aspect of the contract, the essential purpose of the contract, there is the question of the assumption of the risk. Who has the risk contractually? Who bears the risk by custom? Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 154 deals with this scenario. This is easily confused with mutual assent cases such as Raffles v Wichelhaus. In Raffles, there was an agreement to ship goods on a vessel named Peerless, but each party was referring to a different vessel. Therefore, each party had a different understanding that they did not communicate about when the goods would be shipped. In this case, both parties believed there was a \\"meeting of the minds,\\" but discovered that they were each mistaken about the other party's different meaning. This represents not a mutual mistake but a failure of mutual assent. In this situation, no contract has been formed, since mutual assent is required in the formation stage of contract. Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 20 deals with this scenario. ==Common mistake== A common mistake is where both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts. The House of Lords case of Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd. established that common mistake can void a contract only if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible. Later in Solle v Butcher, Lord Denning added requirements for common mistake in equity, which loosened the requirements to show common mistake. However, since that time, the case has been heavily criticized in cases such as Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd.. For Australian application of Great Peace Shipping (other than in Queensland), see Svanosio v McNamara. For Queensland, see Australian Estates v Cairns City Council. Those categories of mistake in the United States exist as well, but it is often necessary to identify whether the error was a \\"decisional mistake,\\" which is a mistake as a matter of law (faced with two known choices, making the wrong one), or an \\"ignorant mistake,\\" unaware of the true state of affairs. The difference is in the extent to which an innocent in the information chain, passing along or using or processing incorrect information, becomes liable. There is a principle that an entity or person cannot be made more liable merely by being in the information chain and passing along information taken in good faith in the belief that it was true, or at least without knowledge of the likelihood of falsity or inaccuracy. ===Roswell State Bank v. Lawrence Walker Cotton Co.=== Under New Mexico law a bank, title company, document processing firm, or the like is not liable for false information provided to it, any more than a bank was liable for false information from a trusted customer turned embezzler who drew an unauthorized cashier‚Äôs check. Roswell State Bank v. Lawrence Walker Cotton Co., 56 N.M. 107, 240 P.2d 143 (1952): ‚ÄòA thing is done ‚Äúin good faith‚Äù within the meaning of this act, when it is in fact done honestly, whether it be done negligently or not. ‚Äò‚Ä¶ ‚Äò‚Ä¶[a] transferee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in transferring the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary unless he takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.‚Äô 56 N.M. at 112-113 (quoting from the Uniform Fiduciaries Act). ===Davis v. Pennsylvania Co. 337 Pa. 456=== Roswell was the case of first impression on this issue in the state of New Mexico, and drew on cases in other jurisdictions interpreting the same language, most notably Davis v. Pennsylvania Co. 337 Pa. 456, 12 A.2d 66 (1940), which on similar facts to Roswell came to the same conclusion and exonerated the innocent actor in favor of shifting any responsibility for the loss to tortfeasors and those who enabled them to act by giving them unjustified authority. 56 N.M. at 114. The Davis case leads into another good analysis, in a case relied upon by Davis: :‚ÄòAt what point does negligence cease and bad faith begin? The distinction between them is that bad faith, or dishonesty, is, unlike negligence, wilful. The mere failure to make inquiry, even though there be suspicious circumstances, does not constitute bad faith, unless said failure is due to the deliberate desire to evade knowledge because of a belief or fear that inquiry would disclose a vice or defect in the transaction, ‚Äì that is to say, where there is an intentional closing of the eyes or stopping of the ears.‚Äô === French Bank of California v. First National Bank of Louisville === In Kentucky, it was held that in French Bank of California v. First National Bank of Louisville, money received by mistake does not have to be returned if there is an irrevocable change in position. It held that mistakes do not need to be rectified except by court order or indemnities being issued. ===Union Bank & Trust Co.v. Girard Trust Co.=== Union Bank & Trust Co.v. Girard Trust Co., 307 Pa. 468, 500-501, 161 A.2d 865 (1932). :A firm processing information in order to transfer title using information provided by customers lacked the intent to commit illegal or improper acts when the information furnished to it was wrong. It was not part of its job description to know better, and it did not know better, and charged only a nominal fee for the clerical work, clearly not including any investigation. Further, it could not be in a conspiracy with another party or several parties who knew the information was wrong but failed to inform the title firm. The title firm could not unknowingly become part of a conspiracy of which it was never informed, and from which it could derive no benefit. The attempt to enhance liability or shift blame by filtering data through an innocent party has been tried before, but where the conduit providing document preparation does not know more than its informants, and was not hired or paid to investigate, it is not liable in their place for using their bad facts without guilty knowledge. ===Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. v. United States=== The law governing record-keeping mistakes and how they are corrected has been gathered by the U.S. Court of International Trade in Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. v. United States, 414 F. Supp. 2d 1317 (C.I.T. 2006), in which the Court was faced with application of a tariff which had been calculated at the wrong rate by a customs clerk. To enforce \\"anti- dumping\\" legislation against foreign-made goods (in this case, Korean electronic components) made using cheap labor and undercutting American industry, a regulatory scheme was implemented under which such imports were charged a ‚Äúliquidation duty‚Äù at a rate to be found on a schedule. The schedule had been made up by a panel of experts using standards for adjusting the price differential in the overseas goods. The custom clerk used the wrong category of goods and overcharged the duty, and by the time Hynix figured out what had happened, part of a very short statute of limitations on protest had expired. Hynix nevertheless prevailed and received the correction in its tariff rate by showing that such an error ‚Äú‚Ä¶was correctable under 19 U.S.C. ¬ß 1520(c) as a mistake of fact or clerical error not amounting to an error in the construction of a law, and because the failure to file a protest within ninety days of the liquidation of the entries is without legal consequence in this context ‚Ä¶‚Äù Id. at 1319. The Hynix court explains the difference between a mistake of law ‚Äú‚Ä¶where the facts are known but the legal consequences are not, or are believed to be different than they really are‚Ä¶,‚Äù Century Importers, Inc. v. United States, 205 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed.

Hynix, in reviewing the tariff application to the facts, also provided a guided tour of the different kinds of mistake and how they are treated in the federal court system. The key distinction is between ‚Äúdecisional mistakes‚Äù and ‚Äúignorant mistakes.‚Äù Id. at 1326; G & R Produce Co, v. U.S., 281 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1331 (2003); Prosegur, Inc. v. U.S., 140 F.

He also spent time living in a van with his father before they were both cast in an infomercial, which led to more acting jobs for Giuseppe. Director Adam Rifkin has said of Andrews \\"Giuseppe Andrews is the most ferociously original filmmaker working in cinema today. No matter what new things he tries, everything is always signature Giuseppe Andrews. He is a true auteur.\\" Andrews reprised his role as a sheriff's deputy in the Cabin Fever sequel Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever (2009). He also appeared in the ninth season of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, in the episode titled \\"Let It Bleed\\". Andrews has entirely disappeared from the public eye as of 2015. He was last seen in a local bar he frequented acting erratic and out of sorts. He left his trailer to formerly homeless actor and friend, Walt Dongo. No one is sure of the whereabouts of Andrews nor his girlfriend Mary Beth. Andrews' website has been deactivated since 2015, and it's been reported that all his personal films have been destroyed as well. As of 2020, he is living in Nevada, no longer with Mary Beth, and just wants to be left alone. ==FilmographyDirector=== * Touch Me in the Morning (1999) * In Our Garden (2002) * Trailer Town (2003) * Dad's Chicken (2003) * Air Conditioning (2003) * Wiggly Harris (2003) * After School Specials (2003) * Monkey (2004) * Actor (2004) * Babysitter (2004) * The Date Movie (2004) * Who Flung Poo?

Some English translations say that it was used for the steps rather than the pillars See Holman Christian Standard Bible and New King James Version and biblical commentators Keil and Delitzsch suggest \\"we should have to think of steps with bannisters\\" to make sense of the text.Keil and Delitzsch OT Commentary on 1 Kings 10, accessed 10 October 2017 It is likely that the wood was brought by the ships of Tarshish, sent from the Red Sea port of Ezion- Giber, from the distant country of Ophir, and was very valuable. ==Botanical classification== The botanical identity of algum is not known for certain, though some references suggest it may be juniper (Juniperus). Several species of juniper occur in the Middle East region, including Juniperus excelsa (Greek juniper), Juniperus foetidissima (stinking juniper), Juniperus phoenicea (Phoenician juniper), and Juniperus drupacea (Syrian juniper). It is likely that the woods of these species, which are all very similar in woodworking properties, would have not been distinguished from each other in the wood trade. The difficulty in identifying this wood is due in part to uncertainty over the location of the biblical city of Ophir. If Ophir is located in India, as some think, the wood likely would be red sandalwood or Pterocarpus santalinus. ==References== Category:Books of Kings Category:Wood Category:Books of Chronicles Category:Plants in the Bible ","title":"Algum"},{"id":"2216709","text":"A mistake of fact may sometimes mean that, while a person has committed the physical element of an offence, because they were labouring under a mistake of fact, they never formed the required mens rea, and so will escape liability for offences that require mens rea. This is unlike a mistake of law, which is not usually a defense; law enforcement may or may not take for granted that individuals know what the law is. ==Discussion== Most criminal law systems in developed states exclude mistake of law as a defense, because allowing defendants to invoke their own ignorance of the law would breach the public policy represented by the Latin maxim: ignorantia legis neminem excusat. But someone operating under a mistake of fact will not generally be liable, because, although the defendant has committed the actus reus of the offense, the defendant may honestly believe in a set of facts that would prevent him or her from forming the requisite mens rea required to constitute the crime. For example: A defendant goes into a supermarket and places eight items in a basket which is presented to the cashier for payment in the usual way. Both honestly believe that all eight items have been scanned, and the defendant pays the sum shown on the bill. A store detective, however, notices that a mistake was made by the cashier so that only seven items were priced. This detective arrests the defendant after leaving the store. Since the defendant honestly believes that he has become the owner of goods in a sale transaction, he cannot form the mens rea for theft (which is usually dishonesty) when he physically removes them from the store. There is a complex question as to whether the defense of 'mistake' applies to crimes that do not specify a mental element - such as strict liability offences and manslaughter by criminal negligence. In Australia, the High Court's 2005 ruling in R v LavenderR v Lavender (2005) HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 - via AustLII. Retrieved 20 March 2019. prevents the use of any 'reasonable mistake of fact' defense in cases of involuntary manslaughter. However, the defense of mistake is available to offences of strict liability such as drunk driving: see DPP v Bone [2005] NSWSC 1239. And it is the very availability of the defense of 'mistake' that distinguishes between offences of strict and absolute liability. Mistake of fact is unavailable in respect to absolute liability offences. ==AustraliaFederal criminal law=== The Australian federal law's Criminal CodeThe Australian Federal Criminal Code is contained in the Schedule to the 1995 Commonwealth Criminal Code Act. Division 9 of Section 3 of this Schedule deals with \\"circumstances dealing with mistake or ignorance\\" including mistakes of fact where there are fault elements other than negligence (subsection 9.1) and in circumstances of strict liability (subsection 9.2). Ignorance of statute law and of subordinate legislation are not defences under subsections 9.3 and 9.4, respectively. describes most Federal crimes, many of which were transferred from the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). However, the Crimes Act does still define some Federal crimes and others have been added in separate legislation for a variety of reason. For example, to override State or Territory laws, as with the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1994 (Cth) that used the external affairs power to override the sodomy laws of the State of Tasmania, or with the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 (Cth)Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 (Cth) that recriminalised euthanasia in the Northern Territory. Separate legislation has also been used when powers have been transferred from the States to the Commonwealth, such as with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that includes penalties for misconduct by company directors, and in implementing international treaties, such as with the International Criminal Court Act 2002 (Cth) that implemented the Rome Statute into Australian law. The Criminal Code contains specific provisions dealing with ignorance and mistakes, which permits acquittal in cases of mistakes of fact but not of law. Further, it mandates that a mistake of fact need not be reasonable for the defense to be available, but allows a jury to consider whether a fact is unreasonable in determining whether the person did actually believe the mistake being claimed.Schedule to the ==Canada== The leading Supreme Court of Canada case on the mistaken belief is R v Park,R v Park [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836 - full text via CanLII. Retrieved 20 March 2019. in which it was held that even unreasonable beliefs must be left to a jury to consider. The issue in most states is the extent to which the test of belief should be subjective or objective. ==England and WalesMistake of fact=== Mistake of fact may be a defence in criminal law if it is genuine, whether or not it is reasonable. In DPP v Morgan[1976] AC 182, [1975] 2 WLR 913, [1975] 2 All ER 347, 61 Cr App R 136, [1975] Crim LR 717, HL an RAF officer told three other officers to have sex with his wife, and that she would pretend to refuse just to be stimulating. They pleaded mistake, and the jury did not believe them. The House of Lords held that the judge had wrongly directed the jury that the mistake must be a reasonable one; the correct legal test was whether the defendants had honestly believed the wife was consenting, not whether they reasonably believed this. However, on the facts the House of Lords held the conviction was nonetheless safe despite the misdirection. R v Williams (Gladstone) confirmed the principle stated in Morgan that a belief that a certain set of facts are true does not need to be reasonable to operate under the defence of mistake. It merely needs to be genuine. However, the reasonableness of that belief is material in the jury deciding whether the defendant had actually held that belief.R v Williams (Gladstone), (1983) 78 Cr App R 276, [1984] Crim LR 163, CA (28 November 1983) An exception to this appears to be bigamy (see R v Tolson (1889) 23 QBD 168). The Sexual Offences Act 2003 has introduced a hybrid test of reasonable belief as to consent. The defendant must now be seen to have taken steps to ascertain clearly whether the \\"victim\\" was consenting in all the circumstances. This abolishes the defence of a genuine though unreasonably mistaken belief as to the consent. ===Mistake of law=== Mistakes about the criminal law It is not a defence that the defendant held an honest and reasonable belief that what he was doing was not criminal.Johnson v Youden [1950] 1 KB 544 at 546, [1950] 1 All ER 300, 66 TLR, (Pt. I), 395, DC Where the defendant is a foreigner, and the offence is not criminal in his own country, the fact of such a belief is still not a defence.R v Esop (1836) 7 C & P 456, (1836) 173 ER 203; R v Barronet and Allain (1852) Dears 51, (1852) 169 ER 633, (1852) 1 E & B 1, (1852) 118 ER 337, (1852) 22 LJMC 25, (1852) 17 Jur. 184 It is not a defence that the defendant believed that he would not be prosecuted for what he was doing.R v Arrowsmith [1975] QB 678, 60 Cr App R 211, [1975] 2 WLR 484, [1975] 1 All ER 463, [1975] Crim LR 161, CA =Offences created by statutory instruments= Section 3(2) of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 provides: (Words in brackets inserted by section 1(1)(a) of the Statutory Instruments (Production and Sale) Act 1996, as read with section 1(2)) Mistakes about the civil law A mistake about the civil law may have the effect of negativing the mens rea for an offence.

That is, it is defined as the number :\\\\begin{align}\\\\zeta(3) &= \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{1}{n^3} \\\\\\\\\\\\&= \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{1^3} + \\\\frac{1}{2^3} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{n^3}\\\\right)\\\\end{align} where is the Riemann zeta function. It has an approximate value of : . The constant is named after Roger Ap√©ry. It arises naturally in a number of physical problems, including in the second- and third-order terms of the electron's gyromagnetic ratio using quantum electrodynamics. It also arises in the analysis of random minimum spanning trees and in conjunction with the gamma function when solving certain integrals involving exponential functions in a quotient which appear occasionally in physics, for instance when evaluating the two-dimensional case of the Debye model and the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law. ==Irrational number== was named Ap√©ry's constant after the French mathematician Roger Ap√©ry, who proved in 1978 that it is an irrational number. This result is known as Ap√©ry's theorem. The original proof is complex and hard to grasp, and simpler proofs were found later.; . Beukers's simplified irrationality proof involves approximating the integrand of the known triple integral for \\\\zeta(3), :\\\\zeta(3) = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\int_0^1 \\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{1}{1-xyz}\\\\, dx\\\\, dy\\\\, dz, by the Legendre polynomials. In particular, van der Poorten's article chronicles this approach by noting that :I_3 := -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_0^1 \\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{P_n(x) P_n(y) \\\\log(xy)}{1-xy}\\\\, dx\\\\, dy = b_n \\\\zeta(3) - a_n, where I \\\\leq \\\\zeta(3) (1-\\\\sqrt{2})^{4n}, P_n(z) are the Legendre polynomials, and the subsequences b_n, 2 \\\\operatorname{lcm}(1,2,\\\\ldots,n) \\\\cdot a_n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} are integers or almost integers. It is still not known whether Ap√©ry's constant is transcendental. ==Series representationsClassical=== In addition to the fundamental series: :\\\\zeta(3)=\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{k^3}, Leonhard Euler gave the series representation: :\\\\zeta(3)=\\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{7} \\\\left( 1-4\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {\\\\zeta (2k)} {2^{2k}(2k+1)(2k+2)} \\\\right) in 1772, which was subsequently rediscovered several times. Other classical series representations include: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\zeta(3) &= \\\\frac{8}{7} \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{(2k+1)^3} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\zeta(3) &= \\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^k}{(k+1)^3} \\\\end{align} ===Fast convergence=== Since the 19th century, a number of mathematicians have found convergence acceleration series for calculating decimal places of . Since the 1990s, this search has focused on computationally efficient series with fast convergence rates (see section \\"Known digits\\"). The following series representation was found by A. A. Markov in 1890, rediscovered by Hjortnaes in 1953, and rediscovered once more and widely advertised by Ap√©ry in 1979: :\\\\zeta(3) = \\\\frac{5}{2} \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty (-1)^{k-1} \\\\frac{k!^2}{(2k)!k^3} The following series representation gives (asymptotically) 1.43 new correct decimal places per term: :\\\\zeta(3) = \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty (-1)^{k-1} \\\\frac{(k-1)!^3(56k^2 - 32k + 5)}{(2k-1)^2(3k)!} The following series representation gives (asymptotically) 3.01 new correct decimal places per term: :\\\\zeta(3) = \\\\frac{1}{64} \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (-1)^k \\\\frac{k!^{10}(205k^2 + 250k + 77)}{(2k+1)!^5} The following series representation gives (asymptotically) 5.04 new correct decimal places per term:; . In his message to Simon Plouffe, Sebastian Wedeniwski states that he derived this formula from . The discovery year (1998) is mentioned in Simon Plouffe's Table of Records (8 April 2001). :\\\\zeta(3) = \\\\frac{1}{24} \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (-1)^k \\\\frac{(2k+1)!^3(2k)!^3k!^3(126392k^5 + 412708k^4 + 531578k^3 + 336367k^2 + 104000k + 12463)}{(3k+2)!(4k+3)!^3} It has been used to calculate Ap√©ry's constant with several million correct decimal places.; . The following series representation gives (asymptotically) 3.92 new correct decimal places per term: :\\\\zeta(3) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^k(2k)!^3(k+1)!^6(40885k^5 + 124346k^4 + 150160k^3 + 89888k^2 + 26629k + 3116)}{(k+1)^2(3k+3)!^4} ===Digit by digit=== In 1998, Broadhurst gave a series representation that allows arbitrary binary digits to be computed, and thus, for the constant to be obtained in nearly linear time, and logarithmic space. ===Others=== The following series representation was found by Ramanujan:. :\\\\zeta(3)=\\\\frac{7}{180}\\\\pi^3 -2 \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{k^3 (e^{2\\\\pi k} -1)} The following series representation was found by Simon Plouffe in 1998: :\\\\zeta(3)= 14 \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{k^3 \\\\sinh(\\\\pi k)}-\\\\frac{11}{2}\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{k^3 (e^{2\\\\pi k} -1)}-\\\\frac{7}{2} \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{k^3 (e^{2\\\\pi k} +1)}. collected many series that converge to Ap√©ry's constant. ==Integral representations== There are numerous integral representations for Ap√©ry's constant. Some of them are simple, others are more complicated. ===Simple formulas=== For example, this one follows from the summation representation for Ap√©ry's constant: :\\\\zeta(3) =\\\\int_0^1\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\int_0^1\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{1}{1-xyz}\\\\, dx\\\\,dy\\\\,dz . The next two follow directly from the well-known integral formulas for the Riemann zeta function: :\\\\zeta(3) =\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{x^2}{e^x-1}\\\\, dx and :\\\\zeta(3) =\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{x^2}{e^x+1}\\\\, dx . This one follows from a Taylor expansion of about , where is the Legendre chi function: :\\\\zeta(3) =\\\\frac{4}{7}\\\\int_0^\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} x \\\\log{(\\\\sec{x}+\\\\tan{x})}\\\\, dx Note the similarity to :G =\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_0^\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\log{(\\\\sec{x}+\\\\tan{x})}\\\\, dx where is Catalan's constant. ===More complicated formulas=== Other formulas include: :\\\\zeta(3)=\\\\pi\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{\\\\cos(2\\\\arctan{x})}{\\\\left(x^2+1\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\cosh\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\pi x\\\\right)^2}\\\\, dx, and, :\\\\zeta(3) =-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_0^1 \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{\\\\log(xy)}{\\\\,1-xy\\\\,}\\\\, dx \\\\, dy = -\\\\int_0^1 \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{\\\\log(1-xy)}{\\\\,xy\\\\,}\\\\, dx \\\\, dy, Mixing these two formulas, one can obtain : :\\\\zeta(3) =\\\\int_0^1 \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{\\\\log(x)\\\\log(1-x)}{\\\\,x\\\\,}\\\\, dx , By symmetry, :\\\\zeta(3) =\\\\int_0^1 \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{\\\\log(x)\\\\log(1-x)}{\\\\,1-x\\\\,}\\\\, dx , Summing both, \\\\zeta(3) =\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_0^1 \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{\\\\log(x)\\\\log(1-x)}{\\\\,x(1-x)\\\\,}\\\\, dx . Also, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\zeta(3) &= \\\\frac{8\\\\pi^2}{7}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int_0^1 \\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{x\\\\left(x^4-4x^2+1\\\\right)\\\\log\\\\log\\\\frac{1}{x}}{\\\\,(1+x^2)^4\\\\,}\\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\&= \\\\frac{8\\\\pi^2}{7}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\int_1^\\\\infty \\\\\\\\!\\\\frac{x\\\\left(x^4-4x^2+1\\\\right)\\\\log\\\\log{x}}{\\\\,(1+x^2)^4\\\\,}\\\\, dx\\\\end{align}. A connection to the derivatives of the gamma function :\\\\zeta(3) = -\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\Gamma'(1)+\\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\Gamma'(1)\\\\Gamma(1)- \\\\big(\\\\Gamma'(1)\\\\big)^3 = -\\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\, \\\\psi^{(2)}(1) is also very useful for the derivation of various integral representations via the known integral formulas for the gamma and polygamma-functions. ==Known digits== The number of known digits of Ap√©ry's constant has increased dramatically during the last decades. This is due both to the increasing performance of computers and to algorithmic improvements. {  style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\\" + Number of known decimal digits of Ap√©ry's constant !

The group was part of a network of about 100 fighters, who committed nearly all acts of armed resistance in the Paris metropolitan region between March and November 1943.Ars√®ne Tchakarian: Les franc-tireurs de l'affiche rouge, Messidor/√âditions sociales, 1986 Its membership included men of different backgrounds. 22 of them were Poles, five Italians, three Hungarians, two Armenians, three Spaniards, 1 French man and a Romanian woman; eleven members of them were of Jewish.Laurent L√©vy, \\"M√©moire du groupe des √©trangers: √Ä propos d‚Äôune chanson c√©l√®bre\\", Les mots sont important, Septembre 2009, accessed 3 Sep 2010 origin After having been tortured and interrogated for three months, the 23 were tried by a German military court. To discredit the Resistance, the authorities invited French celebrities (from the world of the cinema and other arts) to attend the trial and encourage the media to give it the widest coverage possible. All but one of the Manouchian Group's members were executed before a firing squad in Fort Mont-Val√©rien on 21 February 1944. Olga Bancic, who had served the group as a messenger, was taken to Stuttgart, where she was beheaded with an axe on 10 May 1944. In the spring of 1944, the Vichy authorities launched a propaganda campaign, designed to discredit the Manouchian Group and defuse public anger over their execution. They created a poster, which became known as , due to its red background. It featured ten men of the group, with nationality, surnames, photos and descriptions of their crimes; the Germans distributed an estimated 15,000 copies of the poster. Along with these posters, the Germans handed out flyers that claimed the Resistance was headed by foreigners, Jews, unemployed people, and criminals; the campaign characterized the Resistance as a \\"foreigners' conspiracy against French life and the sovereignty of France\\": > \\"Si des Fran√ßais pillent, volent, sabotent et tuent... Ce sont toujours des > √©trangers qui les commandent. Ce sont toujours des ch√¥meurs et des criminels > professionnels qui ex√©cutent. Ce sont toujours des juifs qui les inspirent. > C‚Äôest l‚Äôarm√©e du crime contre la France. Le banditisme n‚Äôest pas > l‚Äôexpression du Patriotisme bless√©, c‚Äôest le complot √©tranger contre la vie > des Fran√ßais et contre la souverainet√© de la France.\\" Although the poster attempted to depict the group as \\"terrorists\\", the campaign seems to have had the effect of highlighting the feats of people whom the general public considered to be freedom fighters.Film documentary on the website of the Cit√© nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration Legend has it that supporters scribbled the words MORTS POUR LA FRANCE across the posters (\\"They died for France\\" - the phrase used on official monuments to soldiers of France who died in combat) and put flowers beneath some of the posters. In 1975, historian Philippe Ganier Raymond claimed that there was no historical record of such activity.Philippe Ganier Raymond, L'Affiche rouge: La v√©rit√© sur les partisans sacrifi√©s, Fayard, 1975 But more recent research has in fact confirmed that such additions by residents took place. == Legacy == Memorial to the Manouchian GroupIn 1955, Louis Aragon wrote a poem memorializing the Manouchian Group, \\"Strophes pour se souvenir\\". The poem was published in 1956 in Le roman inachev√©. In 1959 L√©o Ferr√© set it to music and recorded it as . Rouben Melik and Paul √âluard also wrote poems in honour of the Manouchian Group.R√©sistance. Rouben Melik, \\"l‚ÄôAffiche rouge Fusill√©s\\" , reprinted, L'Humanit√©, 21 February 2004 Paul √âluard, \\"L√©gion\\" (poem) , in L'Humanit√©, 21 February 2004 In 1997, at the prompting of Robert Badinter, a French senator and former Minister of Justice, the French Parliament authorized a monument to commemorate the execution at Mont-Val√©rien of 1,006 citizens and members of the French Resistance, including the Manouchian Group, between 1940 and 1944. The sculptor Pascal Convert was commissioned to create the monument and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin dedicated it on 20 September 2003. == Controversy == In the 1980s, some French political factions suggested that, because of political infighting, some members of the Resistance had been complicit in the capture of many of the members of the Manouchian Group. A film documentary by St√©phane Courtois and Mosco Boucault, Des terroristes √† la retraite, broadcast by Antenne 2 in 1983, included interviews of surviving FTP-MOI members and families of the victims. Bouscault accused the French Communist Party (PCF) of having deliberately sacrificed the fighters in the power struggle with the Gaullists for control over the National Council of Resistance (CNR). He suggested this was done because the fighters' foreign origins undermined French depictions of the Resistance as a native patriotic movement. The film was rebroadcast in 2001, minus 12 minutes deleted to reflect more recent historical research.\\"Avec ou sans guillemets\\" , L'Humanit√©, 18 February 2004 La traque de l'Affiche rouge, a documentary produced by Denis Peschanski and Jorge Amat, broadcast by France 2 on 15 March 2007, refuted Courtois and Boucault's allegations.Denis Peschanski ‚Äì Jorge Amat, La traque de l‚ÄôAffiche rouge, 72 minutes, compagnie des Phares et Balises en collaboration avec la Fondation Gabriel P√©ri et L‚ÄôHumanit√©, 2006. Resume of the film \\"Les h√©ros de l‚ÄôAffiche rouge\\" , L'Humanit√©, 13 February 2007 Quoting the historian Denis Peschanski, who had access to new documents from the Russian, French and German archives, the new documentary alleged that the fall of the Manouchian Group had been due exclusively to the French police. The two newly created branches of the Renseignements g√©n√©raux (RG) intelligence agency‚Äîthe Brigades sp√©ciales 1 and 2‚Äîhad trailed the R√©sistance fighters for months. On 28 September 1943, Marcel Rayman, with several others, shot and killed the SS General Julius von Ritter.Susan Zuccotti, The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews, University of Nebraska Press, 1999, p. 270; Jewish partisans in France , United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Accessed 2013-02-02. Ritter organized the forced labor of the Service du travail obligatoire (STO). At that time, Rayman had already been under surveillance for two months. The French Milice arrested and dismantled the Manouchian Group after the attack, aided by information given by some members under torture. In September 2009, the dramatic film L'Arm√©e du crime opened in France, featuring the story of the Manouchian Group. Directed by Robert Gu√©diguian, a Marseille-based filmmaker of German and Armenian parentage, it was adapted from a story by Serge Le P√©ron. It reflects some of the divisions among the R√©sistance.STEPHEN HOLDEN, \\"'The Army of Crime': Outsiders in French Society, Battling Occupiers and Collaborators\\", New York Times, 19 Aug 2010, accessed 17 Nov 2010 In association with the film's release, reporters interviewed the last surviving member of the FTP-MOI group, Ars√®ne Tchakarian.

The Hermit Trail, a hiking trail that extends to the Colorado River, begins about mile beyond the shuttle bus stop at Hermits Rest. Hermits Rest also represents the western terminus of the Rim Trail. The location was named for Louis Boucher. Around 1891, Boucher - a Canadian-born prospector - staked claims below present-day Hermits Rest. With help, Boucher carved the aforementioned trail into the canyon, and for years lived alone at nearby Dripping Springs. The main structure currently standing at Hermits Rest was designed by architect Mary Colter. Hermits Rest is the westernmost point on the canyon's south rim that is accessible by paved road. It was built as a rest area for tourists on coaches operated by the Fred Harvey Company on the way to the now-vanished Hermit Camp. The building was designed to appear to be a natural stone formation, closely tied to the land. Colter selected furnishings that are included in the National Historic Landmark designation. Hermits Rest is one of four Mary Jane Colter Buildings that, as a set, were added to the National Register of Historic Places and declared to be a National Historic Landmark in 1987. All were designed by Colter and were built for the Fred Harvey Company, which operated restaurants and hotels under contract with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, parent of the Grand Canyon Railway. Fireplace inside Hermit's Rest ==Description== Hermits Rest stands a few feet from the rim of the Grand Canyon, partly buried in an earth mound. The exposed portions of the structure are designed to look like a natural rock formation, apart from the prominent rubblestone chimney. The structure is approached by a path that passes (and originally ran through) a stone arch decorated with a broken bell that Colter salvaged from a Spanish mission in New Mexico. A small porch supported by peeled log posts stands to one side of the outside observation area that overlooks the canyon rim. The low porch roof extends into the interior, which opens up to a double-height space. Opposite the entry, the south wall houses a semi-circular alcove with a fireplace and a raised floor. A snack bar opens on the west side of the space, and the \\"rug room,\\" where native crafts were sold, is on the east side with its own fireplace. The interior furnishings throughout were chosen by Colter and are part of the historic designation. The overall impression imparted by Colter's design is one of antiquity. Colter, when kidded by AT&SF; executives about the dark, antique-looking interior, retorted \\"you can't imagine what it cost to make it look this old.\\" ==Historic designation== Hermits Rest is a component of the multi-site Mary Jane Colter Buildings National Historic Landmark, It was incorporated into the National Historic Landmark group on May 28, 1987. ==See also== * List of National Register of Historic Places entries * National Register of Historic Places ==Notes== Entry arch ==External links== * Parkitecture in Western National Parks: Hermit's Rest * M.E.J.

It is above sea level, Although Bluff Knoll is sometimes claimed to be the highest point in Western Australia, the highest peak is actually Mount Meharry in Karijini National Park in the Hamersley Range, which is above sea level. Local Aboriginal people, from the Qaaniyan and Koreng groups (or tribes), who wore kangaroo skin cloaks in cold weather, called the mountain Pualaar Miial, meaning \\"great many-faced hill\\" or place of \\"many eyes\\". The Noongar people treat it with foreboding and prefer to avoid its rocky ridges, which are woven with tales of malevolent witches. The mountain is often shrouded in a mist which curls around the peaks and floats into the gullies. Local people believed this to be a spirit named Noatch (literally meaning \\"dead body\\" or \\"corpse\\"). Climbing Bluff Knoll, a round trip of about , takes three to four hours, and can be achieved by anyone with a reasonable level of fitness. The path from Bluff Knoll summit. The view from the summit encompasses the Stirling and Porongurup mountain ranges, as well as the coast near Albany. The lower slopes are dominated by young Eucalypts which can catch fire following lightning strikes such as one that set the forest alight in 2010. The mountain as well as the rest of the Stirling Range were formed as Australia broke away from Antarctica. When both the continents began to separate a rift gradually opened. In the first stage of rifting, it began to open in the west, then later the eastern section began to open. The two continents pivoted slightly at a point in the west, which squeezed the sediments at the western end of the break against the Yilgarn block, which forced the sediments up to form the range. The sedimentary rocks that were folded up are 1.2 billion years old. The rocks on the range are mostly sedimentary such as sandstone, quartzite, slate and shale. The peak was given its name by Governor James Stirling as the highest point in the Stirling Range. == Climate == Bluff Knoll is one of only a few places to experience regular snowfalls in Western Australia, with some snow reported in most years. Snow on 20 April 1970 was recorded in Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) records. A heavy snowfall was recorded on 6 October 1992 when 20 centimetres of snow fell and light snow was seen at the base, at . Snow fell on three occasions in 2016 after only falling once in 2015. A flurry was recorded on the peak after 2:00pm on 19 April 2019.

Historically Earnley was situated in the hundred of La Manwode or Manwood, now known under the form Manhood. The name La Manwode means 'the common wood' and extended round Hundredsteddle Farm, where the boundaries of the Witterings, Birdham, and Earnley coincide. Hundredsteddle was the meeting place for the hundred moot and other hundred business. The name Hundredsteddle refers to the floor on which the Hundred court would have sat. It lay in the ancient pre-Conquest division of Sussex known as the Rape (county subdivision) of Chichester. The Domesday survey does not include Earnley, however it is possible that at that time it was included in Wittering.

The series centered on the U.S. Supreme Court. Like another 2002 series, The Court, it was inspired by the prominent role the Supreme Court played in settling the 2000 presidential election. However, public interest in the high court had receded by the time the two shows premiered, and neither was successful. ==Premise== Created by JAG creator Donald P. Bellisario and Paul Levine, the show aired on CBS from January until May 2002. The name First Monday is a reference to the first Monday in October, which is when each Supreme Court term begins. Joe Mantegna starred as moderate Justice Joseph Novelli, who is appointed to a Supreme Court evenly divided between conservatives and liberals. The show examined how the law clerks and justices dealt with issues and cases that came before the highest court in the United States. First Monday generally dealt with two issues per episode. Earlier in the series, that tended to be two cases. Later in the series, that tended to be one case and one personal issue. ==Characters== The main cast of First Monday. Clockwise from bottom right are: Joe Mantegna, James Garner, Joe Flanigan, Hedy Burress, Randy Vasquez, and Christopher Wiehl. ===Main=== * Justice Joseph Novelli (Joe Mantegna) was a newly appointed moderate Supreme Court Justice. * Chief Justice Thomas Brankin (James Garner) was the football- obsessed, conservative Chief Justice of the United States. * Justice Henry Hoskins (Charles Durning) was Brankin's best friend and a conservative justice, who often spouted limericks during conversation. * Miguel Mora (Randy Vasquez) was Novelli's conservative law clerk. * Ellie Pearson (Hedy Burress) was Novelli's liberal law clerk. * Jerry Klein (Christopher Wiehl) was Novelli's moderate law clerk. * Julian Lodge (Joe Flanigan) was Brankin's law clerk. ===Other Supreme Court Justices=== * Justice Esther Weisenberg (Camille Saviola) was a liberal justice. * Justice Jerome Morris (James McEachin) was a liberal justice. * Justice Michael Bancroft (James Karen) was a liberal justice. * Justice Deborah Szwark (Gail Strickland) was a conservative justice. * Justice Theodore Snow (Stephen Markle) was a liberal justice. * Justice Brian Chandler (Lyman Ward) was a conservative justice. ===Novelli's family=== * Sarah Novelli (Linda Purl) was a real estate agent and Justice Joseph Novelli's wife. * Andrew Novelli (Brandon Davis) was Justice Joseph Novelli's son. * Beth Novelli (Rachel Grate) was Justice Joseph Novelli's daughter. ===Others=== * Charles Bierbauer (himself) was host of Curveball, a political talk show. * Senator Edward Sheffield (Dean Stockwell) was a liberal U.S. Senator who plotted to get Novelli impeached.

The Jenkins Activity Survey is a psychometric survey of behavior and attitude designed to identify persons showing signs of Type A behavior. The test is multiple choice and self-administered. It was published in 1979 by C. David Jenkins, Stephen Zyzanski, and Ray Rosenman. The terms Type A and Type B personality were originally described in the work of Rosenman and Friedman in 1959. The Jenkins Activity Survey was developed in an attempt to duplicate the clinical assessment of the Type A behavior pattern by employing an objective psychometric procedure. Individuals displaying a Type A behavior pattern are characterized by extremes of competitiveness, striving for achievement and personal recognition, aggressiveness, haste, impatience, explosiveness and loudness in speech, characteristics which the Jenkins Activity Survey attempts to measure. A popular sub-form of the Jenkins Activity Survey is form T, created to analyze Type A and Type B behavior in students as opposed to the original survey created with questions pertaining to the workforce. == JAS-T == Form T of the Jenkins activity survey is a subform of the original Jenkins activity survey that utilizes the same methods and procedures as the Jenkins activity survey Form B, the adult version, but with questions altered to relate to student life as opposed to questions relating to occupational work (Bishop, 1989). This form was created in 1974 by Krantz, Glass, and Snyder to distinguish between Type A and Type B students and the differences among them relating to their school performance as well as gender differences and countless others. This form has been used in research not only to find information from students (Rainey, 1985) but also to test the reliability of Form T and subsequently the Jenkins Activity Survey as a whole (Bishop, 1989). Testing the reliability of this form is fundamental because although the changes made from the original survey were minor they could still have large effects in the overall scores and findings of the research. Research conducted by Bishop, Hailey, and O‚ÄôRourke in 1989 built off of previous research through using scores of those that were not found to be strongly Type A or Type B. In these cases, individuals who scored one standard deviation above the mean were classified as Type A and those one standard deviation below Type B. In this research, that utilized a test-retest approach, they were able to find reliable and statistically significant correlations between the first test and subsequent tests administered at the beginning of each of four semesters. These findings conclude the reliability of the test and add to other findings of the reliability of the overall Jenkins activity survey. == See also == * Personality test * Psychometrics ==References *Further information Category:Psychometrics ","title":"Jenkins activity survey"},{"id":"2216804","text":"Yauna refers to variously * a Tucanoan language spoken in Colombia: Yauna language * an alternation spelling of Yona * ‚Äî Old Persian name of the Ionians and Greeks, extended from the name Ionia, see names of the Greeks.

He is a novelist who is about to direct the screen adaptation of his most recent bestseller; she is an actress he has opted not to cast in the lead role, despite the fact it's partly based on her, because he feels she's too old for the part. This decision, coupled with an ongoing dispute about their barking dog Otis with their strait-laced, non-industry neighbors, clean- and-sober writer Ryan and interior decorator Monica Rose, has resulted in an undercurrent of tension between the two as they prepare for the arrival of their guests. Among them are aging actor Cal Gold, Sally's co-star in the romantic comedy film she presently is shooting, his wife Sophia, and their two young children; director Mac Forsyth, who is helming Sally and Cal's film, and his anorexic, neurotic wife Clair; photographer Gina Taylor, whose relationship with Joe prior to his marriage and ongoing close friendship since troubles Sally; business manager Jerry Adams and his wife Judy; eccentric violinist Levi Panes; Jeffrey, Joe's roommate - and lover - at Oxford; and up- and-coming actress Skye Davidson, whom Joe has cast in the role Sally believes deservedly is hers. In an effort to dispel the simmering animosity between them and their neighbors, Sally and Joe have invited the Roses as well. The early part of the evening is devoted to charades and lighthearted entertainment. Following a series of toasts offered by the guests, Joe distributes the ecstasy Skye brought them as a gift. As it begins to take effect, the night deteriorates, accusations are made, secrets are revealed, and relationships slowly unravel. Complicating emotions triggered by the drug are the disappearance of Otis and a phone call from Joe's father bringing tragic news about his beloved sister Lucy. ==Cast== * Jennifer Jason Leigh as Sally Nash * Alan Cumming as Joe Therrian * Kevin Kline as Cal Gold * John C.

Because of conflicting schedules, there was a period of only 19 days in which the entire cast‚Äîconsisting of friends and actors with whom Leigh and Cumming previously had worked‚Äîwould be available for filming. This prompted the decision to film using digital video, which Leigh felt also added a sense of immediacy and intimacy that would draw the audience into the action as party guests observing everything from the sidelines. The order in which the toasts were made was determined before the scene was filmed, although with the exception of that offered by Skye, they were improvised rather than scripted. Retired actress Phoebe Cates returned to acting for this one film, as a favor to director Leigh, her best friend. ==Soundtrack== The film's soundtrack includes \\"I Know a Place\\" by Petula Clark, \\"I May Never Go Home Anymore\\" by Marlene Dietrich, \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" by Mel Torm√©, \\"There Is No Greater Love\\" and \\"A Lot of Livin' to Do\\" by Sammy Davis Jr., \\"Stealing My Love from Me\\" by Lulu, \\"Troubles\\" by Blair Tefkin and the Adagio from the Sonata No. 1 in G minor by Johann Sebastian Bach. ==Release== The film premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival in May prior to its limited release in the US the following month. It grossed $4,047,329 in the US and $884,559 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $4,931,888. ==Critical reception== In his review in The New York Times, Stephen Holden called it \\"an articulate, acutely observant film [that] makes you realize how starved Hollywood movies are for great ensemble acting . . . the movie has such finely woven performances that the best scenes project a convincing illusion of spontaneity . . . Ms. Leigh and Mr. Cumming's screenplay does an amazing job of creating about a dozen fully rounded, nuanced characters with a minimum of words. The dialogue, though it comes quickly and in scraps, is so juicy that the zest with which the actors bite into it suggests they invented it themselves . . . This isn't Chekhov, by any stretch of the imagination. The empathy the film extends to its characters may be evenly distributed, but it isn't all-embracing. Yet despite its shortcomings, this smart, caustic movie is easily the most incisive and realistic comedy of manners to emerge from Hollywood in quite a while, and that's saying a lot.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, \\"The appeal of the film is largely voyeuristic. We learn nothing we don't already more or less know, but the material is covered with such authenticity and unforced natural conviction that it plays like a privileged glimpse into the sad lives of the rich and famous. We're like the neighbors who are invited. Leigh and Cumming...are confident professionals who don't indulge their material or themselves. This isn't a confessional home movie, but a cool and intelligent look at a lifestyle where smart people are required to lead their lives according to dumb rules.\\" In the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle said, \\"Leigh and Cumming save the best roles for themselves, and both their roles reach major emotional crescendos. Yet to their credit, with all the video in the world at their disposal and nobody to rein them in, they don't indulge themselves. They're both brilliant, spot-on and wonderfully true. The Anniversary Party is probably one of those miracles that can happen only once. Still one can't help hoping that Leigh and Cumming collaborate on another film.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone stated, \\"The final result should be a self-indulgent mess - and, in truth, the final third of the film comes close. But until Leigh and Cumming let their actorly urge for high drama blunt their flair for bracing wit and subtle feeling, they turn what could have been an acting stunt into an intimate and compelling study of bruised emotions . . . [They] were fortunate to secure the services of master cinematographer John Bailey, who brings textured marvels of light and shadow to digital camerawork that is often crude in lesser hands. It's only when the guests head for the pool to play truth games on Ecstasy while Leigh and Cumming head for the hills for a Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? sparring match that the movie collapses under the weight of its artsy-fartsy ambitions. My advice on how to get the most from this Party is: Leave early.\\"Rolling Stone review In Variety, Todd McCarthy said the film \\"is well observed in many particulars but is too familiar in its basic trajectory to be fresh or compelling . . . All the roles are in good hands, and it's mildly amusing in a voyeuristic way to watch the likes of Paltrow behave as we might imagine stars do at a party . . . Although the digital video imprint is still evident, ace vet lenser John Bailey has gone a long way toward making this look like a celluloid-shot picture, most successfully in the bright, daytime scenes, less so at night or under low lighting conditions, where the images sometimes appear washed out.\\" The Anniversary Party currently holds a 61% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 112 collected reviews with the consensus \\"This Party features a killer cast and many funny scenes, but the movie feels like nothing more than an excuse for the actors to emote.\\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anniversary_party/ ===Awards and nominations=== * Independent Spirit Award for Best First Film (nominee - lost to In the Bedroom) * Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay - Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming (nominee - lost to Daniel Clowes and Terry Zwigoff for Ghost World) * Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor - John C.

He is remembered for his work on the stratigraphy of the Himalayas. He helped establish geological studies and investigations in India, specifically at the Institute of Himalayan Geology, which was renamed in 1976 after him as the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology. His textbook on the Geology of India, first published in 1919, continues to be in use. ==Early life== Wadia was born at Surat in Gujarat, the fourth of nine children of Nosherwan and Gooverbai Wadia on 23 October 1883. They belonged to Parsi family who had traditionally been shipbuilders and another member of this community included Ardaseer Cursetjee, the first Indian elected Fellow of the Royal Society. Nosherwan Wadia worked as a station master in the Indian Railways at Bombay, Baroda and Central India. Young Wadia received his early schooling in a private school at Surat and later at Sir J. J. English School before the family moved to Baroda in 1894 where he went to Baroda High School. The interest in science was instilled by his oldest brother, Munchershaw N. Wadia who was an educationist in the princely state of Baroda. At 16 years, he moved to Baroda College, where he was influenced by Adarji M. Masani the professor of natural history and Aravind Ghosh. He obtained a BSc degree in 1903 in botany and zoology and another BSc degree in 1905 in botany and geology. A noted educationist in Baroda State, who gave him his abiding love of science, devotion to knowledge, and a rational outlook upon human relationships, all of which were to dominate his subsequent career. The study in geology was helped by the geological collections that were made under Maharaja Sayaji Rao Gaekwar. In 1905 he graduated with a M.A. in biology and geology and began to teach undergraduates. Education in geology in India at that time was restricted to the Universities of Calcutta and Madras where officers of the Geological Survey of India sometimes acted as part-time lecturers. At the age of 23, Wadia obtained the post of a Professor of Geology at the Prince of Wales College at Jammu and continued to work there for the next fourteen years. ==Work at Jammu== Wadia found the college very supportive. The location also allowed him to make geological studies in the adjoining region. In 1909 he married Miss Alan G. Contractor. They had a daughter who died in infancy. He spent vacations in the Himalayan region, collecting rocks and fossils. In 1919 he published a textbook of Geology for students, the first new work after the Manual of geology in India which had been revised in 1893. Several editions (sixth in 1966) were to be produced later and this continues to be a major text in Indian geology. In 1925 he discovered tusks and fragments of the extinct elephant-like animal already described as Stegodon ganesa. ==Geological Survey of India== In 1920, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) expanded from 20 to 32 scientific officers. In 1921, a post was offered to Wadia, then aged 37. He was not the first Indian to join the Survey, but was the first who did not have a degree from a European university. His early work was on the geology of the Himalayas and it involved careful field work and mapping. He collected numerous Middle and Upper Cambrian trilobites which were studied by F R C Reed in 1934. He also found Upper Triassic plant fossils and Eocene Foraminifera leading to revisions of the map of the region. When he visited the Survey headquarters at Calcutta, he lectured at the Presidency College, then under the University of Calcutta. After G. E. Pilgrim's retirement in 1928, Wadia became the Paleontologist at the GSI and continued in that post until 1935. When Wadia left the GSI in 1938, it was in the rank of Assistant Superintendent, the same one in which he had joined. ==Ceylon== After retiring from the GSI in 1938, Wadia took up an offer from the Government of Ceylon for the post of Mineralogist. This position had earlier been held by J.S. Coates but not filled since 1935. He worked on many aspects of the geology of Sri Lanka. Wadia's first wife, Alan (married in 1909), daughter of G.P. Contractor, died in Kashmir in the mid 1930s and he married Meher Gustadji K. Medivala at Colombo in 1940. ==Return to India== Wadia returned to India in 1945. In 1947, he became and advisor to the government led by Jawaharlal Nehru. At a meeting he suggested that India should move away from a \\"lukewarm, hesitating and even patronising\\" attitude to science and bring about co-operation among Indian scientists to help in tapping \\"the basic sources of wealth and well-being, yet imperfectly tapped in land, man-power, its rivers, forests, minerals and electric power\\". In 1948, Homi Jehangir Bhabha who was associated with the creation of the Indian Atomic Energy Act invited Wadia in 1949 to help survey for raw materials for use in reactors.atomic energy. This led to the extraction of thorium and uranium ores in Kerala, Bihar and Rajasthan. ==Other contributions== Wadia worked on Himalayan stratigraphy, dating various sections and understanding the age and origin of the ranges. He studied the fossils of the Siwaliks, examining the collections at the British Museum along with A T Hopwood and W E Swinton around 1926‚Äì27. The Trigonometrical Survey of India had found discrepancies in measurements based on triangulation and those made using astronomy observations. This was described in 1855 by Archdeacon J. H. Pratt of Calcutta and is now called the Bouguer anomaly which he explained on the basis of isostasy. Others like Airy suggested that it was due to light rocks below the Himalayas while Glennie suggested a crust warp as a cause in 1930. Wadia reviewed this matter in 1938 and suggested that it required further work to resolve the debate. Another topic that interested him was the age of the Salt Range which had been suggested as either Cambrian, Pre-Cambrian or Eocene. Birbal Sahni and his fellow researchers reported angiosperms and insect fossils. Wadia suggested that there was some thrust of Cambrian plates over Eocene plates in some areas. Wadia took an interest in soil science. In 1954, he suggested that the Pleistocene Ice Age of the northern hemisphere was a time of great rainfall (the Pluvial Age) in the semi-tropical and tropical latitudes. One of his early contributions was to explain the knee-bend or syntaxis in the mountain ranges around Nanga Parbat. ==Honours and awards== Wadia presided over numerous committees and was on the editorial board of several journals. Wadia received numerous awards for his work. The Back Award from the Royal Geographical Society in 1934, the Lyell Medal from the Geological Society of London in 1943, the Joyakishan Medal from the Indian Association for the Advancement of Science in 1944, the Jagdish Bose Memorial Medal from the Royal Asiatic Society in 1947, an honorary degree of D.Sc. from the University of Delhi in 1947, the Nehru Medal of the National Geographic Society and the Padma Bhushan from India in 1958. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1957. In 1951, a 2 Anna Indian postage stamp to commemorate the centenary of the Geological Survey of India illustrated Stegodon ganesa was released. In 1984 an Indian postal stamp with a portrait of Wadia was issued. ==References *Geology of India for students (1919) *Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology *Biography at Vigyan Prasar *Biographical sketch Category:1883 births Category:1969 deaths Category:People from Surat Category:Gujarati people Category:Indian geologists Category:Parsi people Category:Lyell Medal winners Category:Recipients of the Padma Bhushan in science & engineering Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:University of Calcutta faculty Category:Scientists from Gujarat Category:20th-century Indian earth scientists Category:20th-century geologists ","title":"Darashaw Nosherwan Wadia"},{"id":"2216816","text":"Aburi is a town in the Akuapim South Municipal District of the Eastern Region of south Ghana famous for the Aburi Botanical Gardens and the Odwira festival.Touring - Eastern Region . touringghana.com. Aburi has a population of 18,701 people as of 2013. ==TransportRoad=== A street in the town of AburiAburi is north east of Accra, and the journey from Accra to Aburi is about 45 mins (will be less when the dual carriage road from Tetteh Quarshie Circle to Adenta Barrier is completed by 2014). Due to the altitude of Aburi, the climate is a lot cooler than neighbouring Accra. The road which climbs the hillside to Aburi is a toll road, with the current toll being 0.50 Ghc for a car, 1.00 Ghc for a 4x4. There is a higher charge for vans and lorries. From the road most of Greater Accra is visible below, although the one stopping space for pictures on this section of road has a \\"No Stopping\\" sign. ==Education== Aburi has several primary education, secondary education, higher education and further education institutions and Aburi is home to Aburi Presbyterian Technical Secondary School, which is linked to The Sixth Form College, Farnborough in Hampshire, England.

For post secondary education, you can find the Presbyterian women's college of Education, formally known as PWTC Training college. ==History and economy== Aburi Botanical Gardens The name Aburi is the adulterated version of ABUDE by the European missionaries and traders. Because of Aburi's location in the mountains of Ghana and its proximity to the coast of Ghana, an agricultural research farm was set up near Aburi by British residents in 1891. The area of the garden originally consisted of 20 hectares, in 1901 there were 17.8 hectares and in 1902 came to more than 40 hectares of new acquisitions, which was discovered during the last expansion with considerable resistance. Ultimately, the expansion could take place only through the application of governmental authority over state expropriation. The purpose of the Botanical Garden was originally to test field-building opportunities and to develop, which contributes to greater financial independence of Ghana. The focus of the garden was primarily in culture experiments with indigenous crops such as cocoa, rubber plants and cola. In addition, there were also ornamental and fruit plants grown of various kinds and small field trials with cotton and spices, vanilla and pepper mainly on cardamom and nutmeg. An inventory, dated 21 July 1900, lists 350 different plant species grown in Aburi. In addition, there was in 1903 in the center of the garden, a sanatorium. In 1901 the expenditure was for the garden equivalent of 44,312 marks (then German marks). Especially for the cotton experiments, a cotton planter expert from the United States (Texas) named Edmund Fisher, was employed, and who was, however, unfavorable for cotton in the rain forest, which is located in Aburi, which had only a few small test plots. A larger cotton research station was built on Edmund Fisher's recommendation in the grasslands by the Volta River built, and grown where cotton is the native culture from time immemorial and the cotton were made into clothing. It is not only an experimental farm that was established, but also tries to cheer up the locals to expand their cotton production. The latter was accomplished mainly through the distribution of seeds to the chiefs in connection with a purchase guarantee for all cotton harvested in a central market in buying at (9 ' N, 0 ¬∞ 6 ' O) on the Volta, where the cotton could be accommodated easily by water. In the Volta River could then also be the removal of the cotton. The most distant of the cotton growing area in Eastern region, is the landscape area which is about 13‚Äì15 km from the Volta River. It has also been used for treatment of raw cotton and where the Ginstation was built. Today, on the grounds of the only botanical garden in Aburi, Ghana, is mainly home to many plants that were not originally native to Eastern region, but there is a collection of tropical plants that have been added. ==Tourism== Aburi is host to one of the finest wood markets not only in Ghana but in Africa. Aburi has been rumoured that goods manufactured at the Aburi markets have found their way to South Africa to be sold on to tourists. Aburi Botanical Gardens is result of a well known Ghanaian tourist destination. ==Hotels and lodges== Aburi is home to many resorts and lodges for visitors.

The spot was close to the Eriksgata, the road that the king travelled after having been elected at the Stone of Mora, in order to be accepted by his subjects. The stone was sold for 50 Swedish kronor in 1896 to the founder of Skansen, Artur Hazelius, where it was moved. It remains at Skansen to this day. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as the Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The inscription is signed by the runemaster √Ösmund K√•resson, who was active during the first half of the eleventh century in Uppland. Over twenty other inscriptions are listed in Rundata as being signed by √Ösmund including U 301 in Sk√•nela, the now-lost U 346 in Fr√∂sunda, U 356 in √Ñngby, the now-lost U 368 in Helg√•by, U 824 in Holm, U 847 in V√§ster√•ker, U 859 in M√•sta, U 884 in Ingla, U 932 at Uppsala Cathedral, U 956 in Vedyxa, U 969 in Bolsta, the now-lost U 986 in Kungsg√•rden, U 998 in Sk√§ller√∂, U 1142 in √Öbyggeby, U 1144 in Tierp, U 1149 in Fler√§ng, U Fv1986;84 in Bo g√•rd, U Fv1988;241 in Rosersberg, Gs 11 in J√§rvsta, Gs 12 in Lund, and Gs 13 in S√∂derby. √Ösmund signed with the statement en Asmundr hio or \\"and √Åsmundr cut,\\" words that he also used on U 969. In 1991, the Swedish Rune authority had the stone colorized as an experiment to see how well it protects the stone from moss and the weather. It is believed that the colorization of the stone will protect this stone for at least 50 years to come. ==Transliteration of runic text into Latin letters== :binrn ' au√æulfr ' (k)unor ' hulmtis ' ---u ri-o stin √æino ' ifti Ä ' ulf ' kinlauha Ä buanta ' in osmuntr hiu == Gallery == Image:Upplands Runinskrift 871 2.jpgDetail from the U 871 runestone. ==References *Photograph of U 871 in 1991 - Swedish National Heritage Board Uppland Runic Inscription 0871 ","title":"Uppland Runic Inscription 871"},{"id":"2216840","text":"Headbangers Ball was a music television program consisting of heavy metal music videos airing on MTV, MTV2 (its sister channel), MTV Australia, MTV Rocks (formerly known as MTV2 Europe), MTV Adria (the MTV subsidiary covering the former Yugoslavia), MTV Brand New, MTV Portugal, MTV Finland, MTV Arabia, MTV Norway, MTV Sweden, MTV Denmark, MTV Greece, MTV T√ºrkiye, MTV Israel, MTV Hungary, MTV Japan; MTV Brasil aired a program with a similar premise, named F√∫ria Metal. The show began on MTV on April 18, 1987, playing heavy metal and hard rock music videos late at night, from both well-known and more obscure artists. The show offered (and became famous because of) a stark contrast to Top 40 music videos shown during the day. However, with the mainstream rise of alternative rock, grunge, pop punk and rap music in the 1990s, the relevance of Headbangers Ball came into question, and the show was ultimately canceled in 1995. Over eight years later, as new genres of heavy metal were gaining a commercial foothold and fan interest became unavoidable, the program was reintroduced on MTV2. It has remained in varying degrees on the network's website, but is no longer shown on television. Many of the videos that aired on the first incarnation of the series would find a home on the similarly themed Metal Mayhem on sister channel MTV Classic. ==HistoryHosts=== \\"The Ball,\\" as it is commonly called, replaced Heavy Metal Mania (which began airing monthly in June 1985), helmed by Dee Snider of Twisted Sister fame. In doing so, MTV expanded the format and added more live interviews with bands. At its premiere it was hosted briefly by Kevin Seal, then by VJ Adam Curry, before ultimately settling on Riki Rachtman, who to many viewers became the most identifiable host of the show. ===Popularity and influence=== The name \\"Headbangers Ball\\" was originally invented and used by DJ John Brent of Bury, Lancashire and was used on his rock and metal roadshows from 1980 onwards and toured throughout the UK with great success. John's Headbangers Ball Rock charts were also regularly featured in the pages of Rock publications Kerrang! and Sounds along with many features on the show in local periodicals. Headbangers Ball was one of the most popular music shows ever to air on MTV, on the air for nearly 8 years, and for a time, it was one of the network's flagship shows. For some time in 1988 and 1989, the show was increased to 3 hours. One hour added, plus Hard 60, a daily version of the ball that aired for an hour every weekday afternoon. Its influence was made widespread with the rise of heavy metal in the 1980s and early 1990s. While the program primarily showed videos from the mainstream friendly \\"hair metal\\" during the 1980s, it gave an equal amount of time to the often more aggressive-sounding heavy metal music scene active in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This level of popularity also resulted in North American tours presented by Headbangers Ball; one took place in 1987 and featured Helloween, Armored Saint and Grim Reaper, while the lineup of the 1989 tour consisted of Anthrax, Exodus and Helloween, and the 1992 version had Megadeth and Suicidal Tendencies. These events were likely the inspiration for the European MTV Headbangers Ball tours, which have taken place since the late 2010s. Heavier alternative acts, spearheaded by the likes of The Cult, Faith No More, Primus and Jane's Addiction, were finding increased residence on Headbangers Ball at the turn of the decade, but it was early into the 1990s that grunge and alternative rock bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains began to uproot the \\"hair metal\\" scene and led to its final decline. Bands such as Stone Temple Pilots, White Zombie, Tool and Blind Melon would follow suit, resulting in a major shift in identity for the show, where metal mainstays such as Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera, Testament, Suicidal Tendencies and Dream Theater shared airspace with the new crop of alternative hard rock acts. Several punk rock bands, including the Ramones, The Offspring, Rancid, Bad Religion and Sick of It All, also received airplay on the show, which, by 1995, would continue to focus on less mainstream forms of heavy metal. Other notable TV programs have emulated Headbanger's Ball, such as Fuse TV's Uranium and VH1's Rock Show. The popularity and effectiveness of Uranium in the early 2000s may have been cited as a strong influence to the revival of The Ball in 2003. ===Road trips=== Bands would visit the set for interviews, and in some instances, the show would follow bands on trips to assorted locations across the world. Memorable road trip episodes include the Moscow Music Peace Festival with Ozzy Osbourne, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Bon Jovi, Skid Row, Cinderella and Gorky Park, Monsters of Rock in Donington, Alice in Chains' trip to Action Water Park, bowling with Soundgarden, skydiving with Megadeth, Oktoberfest in Munich with Danzig, and Van Halen's adventure at Cabo Wabo. ===Death of The Ball=== The show remained on the air until January 1995, when MTV abruptly canceled the show without any prior warning to viewers, host Riki Rachtman, or the production staff. The European version, hosted by Vanessa Warwick, was on the air until 1997, but limited to an hour and a half (as opposed to the three hours given in past years). Rachtman was informed of the cancellation days afterward when, after filming what would end up being the final episode, he was simply informed via phone call that he would not have to show up to work the following week. No official reason was given for the show's cancellation, but it is suspected to be because MTV was then playing grunge and alternative more often during its main programming, although they did not play a lot of metal or interview the bands. Many MTV fans were outraged at the show's abrupt cancellation, as well as denying Rachtman and the production staff the chance to inform viewers that the show was going off the air, or to allow them to put together a \\"farewell show\\" for the loyal viewers of Headbangers Ball. Some regular-citizen critics of MTV even cite the cancellation of Headbangers Ball as one of the key decisions which caused the network to \\"jump the shark\\". The demise of The Ball also came in at #4 on VH1's 40 Least Metal Moments in 2005.http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/the_greatest/86677/episode_featured_copy.jhtml In mid-February The Ball would be replaced by the short lived Superock, a show featuring videos and interviews with metal, alternative and rap artists. Over the years, MTV Europe attempted to fill the void left by the cancellation of Headbangers Ball with other rock-themed block programs such as the Julia Valet hosted Superock, but all have failed for various reasons ‚Äì including MTV Europe's addition of pop, dance and alternative videos to some of the shows which made them not much different from the rest of the day. ===Rebirth=== Headbangers Ball volume 2 logo After nearly a decade of the show being off the air, MTV2 started up the series again on Saturday, May 10, 2003 at 11 p.m. The revived Headbangers Ball initially had the same type of playlist as its latter \\"sister shows\\" in MTV Europe, as well as interviews with metal artists (current and classic). The debut episode was hosted by Metallica,New Headbangers Ball RoughEdge.com (2003). a trend which continued with various artists. Later on, Hatebreed vocalist Jamey Jasta became a permanent host. However, the show still continued to have guest host artists at times. The show eventually returned to its roots (in types of music) of showing underground music, as well as metalcore, death metal and thrash. During VH1's 40 Least Metal Moments countdown, musicians criticized the 2003 incarnation of Headbangers Ball in comparison with the original, citing its \\"scripted\\" studio feel and lack of excitement. The new version mostly shows only music videos and in-studio interviews, which was not true of the original show. When asked in September 2015 about a possible return of Headbangers Ball, former host Riki Rachtman stated, \\"It's not gonna happen. I tried, I told them I would do it for free, they never even returned my calls.\\" Although the show is currently no longer on the air, there have been European tours called \\"MTV Headbangers Ball\\" since 2016, with the exception of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; this tour package traditionally takes place from late November to mid-December, and features four metal bands. The European \\"MTV Headbangers Ball\\" tour has included mostly thrash metal bands such as Exodus, Overkill, Death Angel, Voivod, Exciter, Sodom, Vio-lence, Artillery and Suicidal Angels ‚Äí as well as other acts like Max + Igor Cavalera, Iced Earth, Kataklysm, Insomnium, Ensiferum, Unearth, Deserted Fear, Whitechapel, Fleshgod Apocalypse and Dyscarnate ‚Äí as a headlining or opening act; the only band so far that has taken part of the tour more than once is Kataklysm. The concept of the MTV Headbangers Ball Tour in Europe was possibly inspired by the 1989 US tour with the same name that included Anthrax, Helloween and Exodus. Removal of the show from Headbangers Ball Since the January 13, 2007, episode, Headbangers Ball simply became the title for a block of metal videos, rather than an actual show. However, the June 23, 2007, episode went behind the scenes of the induction of Pantera guitarist \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell Abbott at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, including segments covering the event in between music videos. Also, brief interview segments still frequently air before and after commercial breaks, typically re-airing on several consecutive episodes for a long period. On April 14, 2007, MTV2 began to air the show from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. and put Saturday Rock the Deuce, a hard rock‚Äìalternative show, at 10. The week's episode was also re-aired on Tuesday mornings from 4:00 to 6:00 a.m.MTV2 Weekly Schedule Starting in 2008, Headbangers Ball had been aired erratically, sometimes airing several hours later than its normal airtime or not being aired at all. Its last on-air time slot was Tuesdays 3AM-4AM. Since July 21, 2011, Jose Mangin took over as host of Headbangers Ball, which is now a web only show. ==Discography== Headbangers Ball labeled products, including a guitar tabs book and three CD sets including artists such as Hatebreed, Opeth, DevilDriver, God Forbid, Chimaira, Dirge Within, Sevendust, Lacuna Coil, Atreyu, Mushroomhead, Shadows Fall, Children of Bodom, Lamb of God, A Life Once Lost, Cradle of Filth, Deftones, and Godsmack have also been sold. Each album has at least one live song. The first Headbangers Ball compilation featured \\"Raining Blood\\" by Slayer as its live track, the second compilation used an in-studio performance of \\"My Tortured Soul\\" by Probot, and the latest compilation had two live tracks: \\"A Bid Farewell\\" by Killswitch Engage and \\"Now You've Got Something To Die For\\" by Lamb of God. The earliest-released CD has famous bands, and the second has obscure ones. Songs featuring Slipknot band members Corey Taylor and Joey Jordison appeared on all three CDs through their other bands. Other bands that have appeared on all three compilations include Killswitch Engage, Lamb of God, and In Flames. * MTV2 Headbangers Ball (2003) * MTV2 Headbangers Ball Volume 2 (2004) * MTV2 Headbangers Ball: The Revenge (2006) ==References External links == * Official show sites ** United States ** UK ** Denmark ** Finland ** Sweden ** Australia * Official site for albums spawned from Headbangers Ball * ** * * Jump The Shark - Headbangers Ball Category:MTV original programming Category:Heavy metal television series Category:1987 American television series debuts Category:1980s American music television series Category:1990s American music television series Category:2000s American music television series Category:1995 American television series endings Category:2003 American television series debuts Category:2007 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:American television series revived after cancellation ","title":"Headbangers Ball"},{"id":"2216841","text":"WBDT, virtual channel 26 (UHF digital channel 31), is a CW-affiliated television station serving Dayton, Ohio, United States that is licensed to Springfield. The station is owned by Vaughan Media, LLC; Nexstar Media Group, which owns Dayton-licensed NBC affiliate WDTN (channel 2), operates WBDT under a local marketing agreement (LMA). The two stations share studios on South Dixie Drive in Moraine (with a Dayton mailing address). However, master control and some internal operations for WBDT and WDTN are based within centralcasting facilities of former sister station WISH-TV in Indianapolis, Indiana. There is no separate website for WBDT; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station WDTN. WBDT, along with unrelated Richmond, Indiana- licensed Ion Television owned-and-operated station WKOI-TV (channel 43), share WDTN's digital channel from WDTN's transmitter facility on Frytown Road in southwest Dayton. On cable, WBDT is available on Charter Spectrum channel 13. The station also serves as the default CW affiliate for the Lima market, which had been served by cable-only affiliate West Central Ohio CW until early 2010. ==HistoryPrior history of channel 26=== Channel 26 first appeared in southwest Ohio on July 14, 1968 as independent WSWO-TV, under the ownership of Southwestern Ohio Television. WSWO-TV ran a local live version of Bozo the Clown (portrayed by announcer Dave Eaton, who was previously with the former WKTR-TV in Kettering, now PBS member station WPTD [channel 16]), as well as other local shows. The station suddenly went dark on June 19, 1970, after it lost a bid to obtain the ABC affiliation for Dayton to WKEF (channel 22); it soon thereafter filed for bankruptcy. WSWO-TV briefly returned to the air on June 17, 1972 under the ownership of Lester W. White, but fell silent again at the beginning of December after White defaulted on a loan. White was additionally discovered to have stolen equipment from multiple television stations, most notably WHIZ-TV in Zanesville, and arrested two days before a court ordered the station closed. ===Current license=== The current incarnation of channel 26 dates from September 7, 1980, when Miami Valley Christian Television (MVCT) returned it to the air as a Christian-oriented station under the call sign WTJC (for Witnessing 'Til Jesus Comes). WTJC aired religious programming during most of its daytime and weekend schedule (including The 700 Club, PTL and Jerry Falwell) although it also aired lifestyle programming such as The Joy of Gardening, cartoons, and children's programming in late weekday afternoon slots (including The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, Porky Pig, The Great Space Coaster and New Zoo Revue). There were also family-friendly reruns in early evenings (among them Leave It to Beaver, Sergeant Preston of the Yukon and Lassie) and a local newscast. WTJC's Saturday schedule included westerns, sportsmen/hunting/wildlife shows (including Wild Kingdom) and The Lawrence Welk Show. When WRGT-TV signed on in 1984, MVCT sold most of its secular programming inventory to that station, and switched WTJC to a mostly-religious format (with the exception of a few children's shows, and Saturday morning sporting and hunting shows). Over the next few years, several ministries that bought time on WTJC became involved in scandals. Due to the scandals, donations to the ministries, and to MVCT, declined. The primary owner of MVCT, Marvin Sparks, bought out his partners' shares in 1991 and in turn sold them to Video Mall Communications. WTJC then aired home shopping and paid programming eighteen hours a day, with religious shows the rest of the broadcast day. In the mid-1990s, Abry Communications (which had purchased WRGT-TV's owner, Act III Broadcasting) approached MVCT with a proposal to manage WTJC for 18 hours a day. MVCT declined and chose instead to sell the station to Paxson Communications in 1995. Paxson kept a similar lineup for WTJC, airing religious programming in early mornings, infomercials for most of the day and worship music overnight. On January 20, 1998, WTJC's call sign was changed to WDPX (for Dayton PaX TV). Accordingly, on August 31 of that year, the station became a charter affiliate of Pax (now Ion Television). In June 1999, Paxson sold the station to ACME Communications, which dropped half of Pax‚Äôs programming for a primary affiliation with The WB, along with syndicated programming. The previous WB affiliate was station WUCT- LP (now WRCX-LP); WB programming in the Dayton area could also be seen on the WGN cable channel and on Columbus WB affiliate WWHO. On June 9, 1999, ACME also changed WDPX's call sign to the current WBDT. ACME ran the station as a dual WB and Pax affiliate, signing a five-year affiliation deal with Pax upon the sale of the station from Paxson. As a dual WB and Pax affiliate, WBDT aired a mix of syndicated programming, WB network programming, and Pax TV programming (such as Touched by an Angel, Diagnosis Murder, Encounters with the Unexplained, Promised Land, Mysterious Ways, and later Doc and Candid Camera). WBDT maintained a secondary affiliation with Pax until mid-2004 at the latest, airing its primetime lineup on weekday mornings from 9 a.m. to noon, early Sunday mornings from 1 to 4 a.m., and early Monday mornings from midnight to 4 a.m. In the station's early days as a WB affiliate, Pax's flagship Touched by an Angel continued to air at its regularly scheduled time of 7:00 p.m., leading into WB primetime programming. In 2004, Diagnosis Murder was moved to 1 p.m., while the remainder of Pax's programming was moved to overnights. The station finally dropped the remainder of Pax's programming in September 2004, filling the morning hours previously programmed with the network's programming with off-network sitcoms, talk shows, infomercials, and court shows. On September 18, 2006, WBDT became the market's CW outlet after The WB and UPN merged. It became a strong affiliate with the new network in terms of primetime ratings‚Äîstrong enough for The CW to designate WBDT the \\"#1 CW affiliate\\" in the nation in March 2007. In that same month, the station became the first in the area (and one of the few in the entire country) to broadcast in a 1080i high definition 16:9 format 24 hours a day, broadcasting on digital UHF channel 18. On June 4, 2010, it was announced that the LIN TV Corporation (owner of WDTN) would begin to operate WBDT through shared service and joint sales agreements.\\"LIN, ACME Share Services in Three Markets\\", from broadcastingcable.com, 6/4/2010\\"LIN and ACME in 3 new SSA Deals\\", from tvnewscheck.com, 6/4/2010 WBDT was to leave its longtime studios on Corporate Place, off Byers Road in Miamisburg, in October and move to WDTN's facility in Moraine. As of January 27, 2013, the former WBDT studio facility is now occupied by Sinclair Broadcast Group's duopoly of ABC affiliate WKEF and Fox affiliate WRGT-TV (the move made them the last network-affiliated stations in Dayton to have upgraded their local programming, including newscasts, to high definition). Three months after ACME and LIN TV reached their operations and sales agreements, LIN TV exercised an option to purchase WBDT along with another LIN TV-operated ACME station, fellow CW affiliate WCWF in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\\"LIN Buys Pair of Acme Stations\\", from broadcastingcable.com, 9/2/2010 LIN TV requested that WBDT's license be assigned to a subsidiary of Vaughan Media (owner of Austin, Texas CW affiliate KNVA, which is also operated by LIN TV).

The FCC approved the merger on December 12, 2014, but a condition of the deal requires Media General to end the JSA between WBDT and WDTN due to tighter scrutiny such deals are getting by the FCC.

The station's digital signal relocated from its pre- transition UHF channel 18 to channel 26 for post-transition operations.CDBS Print Initially, WBDT aired a standard definition simulcast of its HD programming on its DT2 subchannel. After several months, this subchannel was dropped. On September 26, 2011, WBDT began airing Bounce TV on DT2, becoming a charter affiliate of the network. On November 30, 2015, WBDT added a third subchannel to carry Ion Television (the network was also added by other Media General stations); the station had carried Pax, the forerunner of Ion Television, as a secondary affiliate, ending in 2004. On February 1, 2018, Ion Television was moved to sister station WDTN's DT3 subchannel, replacing the Justice Network; WBDT's third subchannel was dropped. ===Spectrum reallocation=== On April 14, 2017, it was reported that WBDT's over-the-air spectrum had been sold in the FCC's spectrum reallocation auction, fetching $27.3 million, with the FCC listing the station as set to go off the air. However, Joe Abouzeid, president and general manager of the station, characterized the auction as an \\"engineering exercise\\" and stated that the station would not go off the air or move to a new channel. In spite of the station manager's earlier denial, WBDT began sharing sister station WDTN's digital channel on June 29, 2018. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 26. ==Programming== Starting with the April 9, 2016 home opener, Dayton Dragons telecasts will appear on WBDT, which will air 25 home games per season. ==Newscasts== On September 16, 2002, the nationally syndicated morning show, The Daily Buzz, premiered from WBDT's studios. The program, then produced by then-parent ACME Communications, remained based at the station until its August 2004 move to the facilities of former sister station WKCF in Lake Mary, Florida near Orlando. On August 18, 2007, WDTN began to produce a nightly half-hour primetime newscast for WBDT known as 2 News at 10 on Dayton's CW. On the 26th day of its broadcast, this show achieved higher ratings than WRGT-TV's nightly primetime news (produced by WKEF) in Dayton's metered market households. On July 21, 2012, WDTN began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. The WBDT shows were included in the upgrade. On January 7, 2013, WBDT began airing a weekday news program from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m., called 2 News Today on Dayton's CW. Since the cancellation of The Daily Buzz, the station also simulcasts the 5:00 to 7:00 a.m. WDTN edition as well.

As such, it is derived from an Old English compound name composed of earn meaning eagle combined with leah meaning wood. The name's meaning is interpreted as signifying a place to which eagles resort. The earliest forms noted are Earneleach, Earnaleagh, Earnelegh found in a document dated 780 during the reign of Oslac, duke of the South Saxons. A later form, Earneleia, derives from a charter of England's King Aethelstan dated 930. Other English place names deriving from the same two words are thought to include Earley, Berkshire and Areley Kings (otherwise Areley-on-Severn), formerly called Ernley, Worcestershire. The latter place is connected with Layamon, poet and historian, one of the earliest writers in the English tongue (The Beginnings of English Literature, C.M. Lewis, 1900, p. 66): About the year 1205 an English 'Brut' was written. This was the work of Layamon, a parish priest of Ernley in Worcestershire. The opening lines give us the best information we have about him. Their metre should be noted. It is a relic of the Old English verse, each half-line (or each line, as here printed) containing two principal accents, and being more or less closely connected with its fellow. The poet, however, often omitted the alliteration; and the scribe, who attempted by marks of punctuation to show which half-lines belonged together, seems in consequence to have sometimes lost his way. An preost wes on leoden La»ùamon wes ihoten. He wes leouena√∞es sone, li√∞e him beo drihten. He wonede at ernle»ùe, at √¶√∞elen are chirechen. vppen seuarne sta√ûe, sel √ûar him √ûuhte. on fest Radestone √ûer he bock radde. Hit com him on mode, & on his mern √ûonke. [translation into Modern English] A priest was among the people who was called Layamon. He was Levenath's son. Gracious to him be the Lord. He dwelt at Ernly, at a noble church upon Severn's bank. Well there to him it seemed, fast by Radestone. There he read books. ===Geographical: Parochial versus manorial extent=== The parish of Earnley lies on the southern coast of England in the county of Sussex, 4 miles (6.4 km) south-west of Chichester, the local cathedral city. It formed part of the hundred of La Manwode or Manwood, now found under the form Manhood, which in turn took its name from a locality in the parish of Earnley. The parish and hundred lie in the original pre-Conquest Saxon division of Sussex known as the Rape of Chichester. The boundaries of the manor of Earnley and the parish of the same name are not strictly coterminous, as the manor itself was not contained within the parish borders, but included part of the neighbouring parish of West Wittering. Also, the parish of Earnley was enlarged in 1524, absorbing the former parish of Almodington, now a hamlet of Earnley parish. The resulting parish, held by a rector, is formally referred to as Earnley with Almodington. During the Civil War and Interregnum, the parish of Earnley was united with East Wittering for the purposes of officially countenanced Presbyterian worship and oversight during the official suppression of Anglicanism. At the Restoration, which saw not just the return of the monarchy, but also of the Anglican Settlement, the parishes reverted to their separate status as in pre-Commonwealth times. ===Historical=== Historians trace the origins of this Sussex landed family to the latter part of the twelfth century. About 1190, Bertha de Lancinges confirmed an earlier charter for lands amounting to a quarter of a knight's fee less one virgate at Earnley, Sussex granted about a generation earlier, that is, circa 1166, by her father William de Lancinges and his wife Maud to his uncle, Lucas de Ernle. This name simply means Luke of Earnley. This man, whom historians call Luke de Ernle, is the first known member of the family, and is the probable progenitor of all subsequent Ernles, though it is not known whether he was actually the first person to be known by this designation. Since he is denominated as de Ernle in this document, it is quite likely that he or his family was already known and distinguished from others by the use of that sobriquet or surname. Since the grant of lands was given to him by a family member, it appears logical to assume that his own connexion to the place, like theirs, dated to an earlier period. As for the de Lancinges family itself, to whom Luke de Ernle was kin: they were supporters of the Arundel earls of Sussex who were descended from Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, a major feudal baron who was granted large tracts of Sussex known as the Rape of Arundel in 1067 or 1068 from his kinsman, William I of England. ===Ethnic=== It is not now known whether Luke de Ernle was of Norman, Saxon, or other, origin, these events having occurred a century after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The designation de Ernle occurs very early in the history of the adoption of hereditary surnames in England, a phenomenon which began along the south-eastern coast of England among the feudal manorial lords (of the greater and lesser nobility) whose members were mostly drawn from the descendants of the Norman invaders and their allies. ===Heraldic=== The ancient coat of arms or heraldic shield of the Ernle family was not used pursuant to specific rights described in an extant grant of arms from one of the royal officers of arms, but appears to have been borne by the head of the family through prescriptive right having been adopted in time immemorial. The contents of the shield reflect a knowledge of the name's original meaning, resort of eagles, that is, a place where eagles congregate. As such, the coat could be said to fall into the category of canting arms. The blazon is Argent, on a bend sable, three eagles displayed or which means that on a heater shield coloured silver appears a wide sash-like strip of black running diagonally from the top left toward the bottom right of the escutcheon on which is placed a row of three golden eagles with their wings open and bodies showing. According to Burke's General Armory (1884) and Burke's General Armory Two (1974), this basic coat of arms, sometimes varying in one detail or another, accompanied by various crests or none, was used over the centuries by the branches of the family, who, by the similarity of their descriptions, claim descent from a shared origin in the same Sussex locality, Earnley, from which they derive their surname. These armigerous branches of the family, whose current fate is not always known, with their various differences or departures from the original paternal coat, taken as denoting cadency, were in alphabetical order: (From Burke's General Armory, 1884, p. 312, col. 2) 1\\\\.

The elder of these brothers was John Ernle, Esq., of Fosbury and Bishop's Cannings, Wilts., esquire. He was the progenitor of the Wiltshire line, and thus the 17th century Chancellor's direct ancestor, while the younger of them, known to history chiefly as Sir John Ernley, was the Lord Chief Justice. This latter personage was, moreover, not as the post-nominal letters K.B. denote, a Knight of the original Order of the Bath, but rather a simple knight, formerly called a banneret, or knight of the field, or what would now be termed a Knight Bachelor, or, in casual usage, a carpet knight. 8\\\\.

It is of interest to heraldists also to note that apparently no motto accompanied any of these coats-of-arms. ===Status=== As an armorial family whose original status derives from ancient landed property, the Ernle family belonged to the class known as the gentry. As gentlemen with a coat-of-arms, or armigers, the heads of the family were hereditary esquires, and the younger sons and their cadets all gentlemen, and their daughters all gentlewomen. The family were thus all of gentle birth, and were classed as members of what has been termed the minor or lesser nobility, corresponding to what the Germans term, Uradel, which the French call noblesse de race, or ancient nobility. Though they never achieved the ranks of the greater nobility which, in England, was confined to members of the peerage, at least one branch of the family did accede to the ranks of hereditary knighthood, created by King James I of England, and known as the baronetage. In the 20th century, a female-line descendant, Rowland Prothero, was granted an hereditary peerage as Lord Ernle, though that title only existed from 1919 to 1937, due to the early death, in action, during World War I, of his only son, who would have been heir to the peerage, had he outlived the hostilities. As can be seen in the case of the cadet lines of its male descendants, junior members of the family sometimes ceased to live as gentry. In England, as opposed to the Continent, where one observes that the legal penalty for d√©rogeance resulted in the legal loss of nobiliary status due to the failure of someone of gentle or noble blood to live as a noble, this, however, led to no automatic legal denial of their ancient gentility of blood. So, even if living in reduced circumstances, and performing manual labour, such English gentlefolk did not suffer from any deprivation, withdrawal, or removal of their hereditary gentle status. It is possible, however, that some sank so far from their gentle origins and the former lifestyles of their ancestors that all memory of their family's former rank, privileges, precedence, and armigerous status was lost. On the other hand, while no one could deny their abiding gentle status, they might be subject to popular derision if they asserted it without the means of living up to it by the 'port (i.e. deportment), manner, or reputation' of a gentleman. By the time this decline began to be observed among the junior-most cadet branches of the family, both the senior male line of the family and their surviving next principal male cadet branch in Wiltshire (see Ernle of Brembridge) had died out (in the late 18th century - in fact, within a year of one another). It is not known if anyone is now entitled to claim a male-line descent from this ancient noble family, and thereby lay claim to use the undifferenced coat-of-arms borne by the head of the Ernle family since time immemorial. The undifferenced arms are, however, quartered in the armorial bearings of the extant Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax family. ==Ernle of Earnley, Sussex, and the Manor of Earnley== This family derived from Luke de Ernle who was confirmed in his de Lancinges nephew's earlier grant to him of almost a quarter of a knight's fee by his de Lancinges great-niece in 1166. Historians' attempts to trace this family over later centuries have met with only partial success, though the continuity of the descent of the manor of Earnley among people bearing that early surname is thought to indicate that successive manorial lords all belonged to the same family. The evidence recited in the published account of the manor of Earnley cites a later lord of the manor living around 1260 whose name was also Luke de Ernle (in this instance, the documentary spelling is de Ernele, and that account favours this spelling of the name). Next, John de Ernle son of Luke held the manor in 1284. A man who may be this John or his younger son, John, received a grant of free warren at Earnley in 1318. In 1337, mention is made of John and Richard de Ernele, and of Joan daughter of John de Ernele in connexion with the recovery of the nearby manor of Almodington by Robert de Almodington. The next two citations from the 1340s probably pertain to one or other of the two men called John de Ernele mentioned in 1337. According to the Sussex Archaeological Collections (1865, p. 248): John de Ernele (Ernley), one of the Coroners for Sussex in 1343, being found inefficient, another was ordered to be elected by the County in his place. (Rot. Cl. 17th Edward III.) A fine dated 1347 names John de Ernele of La Manwode. The place referred to here can be either the name of the hundred in which the parish of Earnley was situate, or an actual locality within the parish of Earnley which happens to have given its name to the hundred, probably because it was the usual meeting-place for the whole hundred when it gathered to conduct business. Thereafter, almost a century elapses before there is a mention of John Ernle conveying the manor of Earnley to John Michelgrove and his wife, Joan, in 1427. In 1428, 1431 and 1432, however, William Ernele held the manor. A generation later, in 1467, there is record of the manor being settled on John Lunsford and Margaret his wife, who was the widow of John Ernele. The descent hereafter is paralleled by the account of the family cited in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography to be found under the heading, Sir John Ernley, Chief Justice. At this juncture, in her proof of coming of age, Elizabeth Michelgrove, wife of John Shelley (both direct ancestors of the poet, Shelley), it is stated that she was baptised at Earnley parish church on 28 March in the 39th year of the reign of King Henry VI of England, that is 1461, and that her godfather was John Ernle and her godmother, Joan Ernle (see Inq. 15 Ed. VI, no. 66), her kinsfolk as the Dictionary of National Biography, under the entry for her son, Sir William Shelley, asserts. Elizabeth was the sole child and heir of her father John Michelgrove alias Fauconer, Esq., of Michelgrove, parish of Clapham, Sussex, and his wife, Agnes or Ann, sometimes called Mary, daughter of William Sydney, of Penshurst, Kent. It would appear from her pedigree that the connexion was probably through the parties mentioned in the 1427 manorial transfer, and that there may have been a blood tie between the Michelgrove alias Fauconer family and that of Ernle, in addition to the one of spiritual kinship deriving from the Michelgrove heiress's baptism. John Ernele, Ernle, or Ernley, Solicitor General, then Attorney General of England and, finally, Chief Justice, is mentioned in 1480 as passing the manor to others of his kinsmen, John Clerkson, the elder, and John Inglere, who were great-grandsons of his own forebear, an earlier John Ernele. This is a curious reference as this particular John Ernley was born in 1464 or 1465, and so was not of age to make a conveyance. Moreover, he had an elder brother, also called John, whom historians refer to as John Ernle, The Elder, Esq., of Fosbury and Bishop's Cannings, Wilts., to distinguish him from his younger brother of the same name. This elder brother John would normally have been the heir to their father, John Ernle, Esq., of Sidlesham, Sussex who died in 1465. Thereafter, whoever the John Ernle of the 1480 conveyance may have been, the manor passed to people of other names who may or may not be connected by blood or marriage to the Ernle family of Earnley. In 1564, the manor was once again conveyed to Richard Ernle (Erneley in the documentation in this case), indicating that it may, for a time, have been held in trust for the right Ernle heir, and then returned at an appropriate date. At any rate, the connexion between the descent of the manor of Earnley and the family of the name Ernle ended finally when a later Richard Erneley sold it to Richard Taylor in 1630. Thereafter, the family of Ernle, as distinct from the manor of the same name, became attached to the episcopal manor of Cackham in West Wittering, a place close to their original home at Earnley in West Sussex. Despite their proximity to their ancestral lands, the Sussex branch of the Ernle family's close ties with the manor and parish from which they derived their surname, seem, however, to have been severed finally in the first third of the 17th century, after the space of nearly 500 years of continuous manorial tenure. Evidence of the eclipse of the Sussex branch of the Ernle family by their Wiltshire kinsmen is seen in the lifetime of the immediate heir of the Sussex line's most successful member: \\"In Sussex, William Earnley was the son of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; in contrast to most of his colleagues, who had at least ¬£40 a year with an average of ¬£100, he had only ¬£26 produced by a medley of very small properties, in addition to which he leased Cakeham manor from the Bishop of Chichester.\\" One of the latest references to a member of this branch playing a prominent role in the affairs of the county dates from December 1624: Justices warrant to apoynte a Provost Marshall and to sett Watch & Ward December 1624 After our very harty comendacons : Whereas we have lately receaved Letters from the Lords of his Ma[jesty's] most hon[ourable] Privy Councell directed to us the Justices of Peace of this County; wherein theire Lo[rdships] require for the better secureinge of high wayes and the more safety of places wh. about this season of the yeare are usually offended by idle and loose p'sons and at this tyme is more to be suspected than at other tymes in respect of the great leavyes of Souldiers lately made and to be made who are to be conducted through this County that there should be provost Marshalls stirringe and therefore we have thoughte good to apoynte you Mr Earnely of Cr. [i.e. Chichester] to be provost Marshall for the Rape of Cr. [Chichester] & p'sently to take uppon you the said office And we have thought it fitt and convenient, that you should make choyse of vj or viij of the substantiallest yeomen to be well armed to attend you at such tymes as yo¬∞ doe apoynte to make your p'ambulacon W[ithin] that rape by such convenient division thereof as to yo'selves shall seeme best to app'hend all idle and loose persons and other dangereuse people or vagabonds that are to be suspected of any fellonyes or other disorders. That they may be brought to the next Justice of Peace (if Cause require) or otherwise to be committed to the constable to be justified accordinge to the Lawe, And that you do continue this course iij tymes in the weeke at the leaste and afterwards as you shall hand have further directions ; and so not doubteinge of yor good care accordingly, we bid you heartely farewell. This reference to Mr Earnely of Chichester in 1624, appears to have been one of the last times a male Ernle was alive and active in the county. By the time of the 1634 heraldic Visitation of Sussex, the remaining Sussex Ernle heritage was represented by Bridget, da. of Richard Ernley and wife of Richard Stanney. Reference to the records of the Archbishop of Canterbury's testamentary jurisdiction provides the final evidences of the extinction of the Sussex line: \\"Abstracts of Probate Acts in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, volume 1, 1630-34\\", p. 146 Anno 1632 ERNLE, Richard, of Cackham (Cakeham, p. West Wittering), Sussex, Esq. Will [66 Audley] pr. June 16 by rel. Susan. P.r. ELIZ. RISHTON'' \\"Abstracts of Probate Acts in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, Supplement. Sentences and complete index nominum, 1630-1639\\", p. 32 ERNLE, Richard, of Cackham, Sussex, Esq. Extrix. v. sister BRIDGET STANNY Sent. pro. val. test., June 16, 1632 [66 Audley] Will [66 Audley] pr[oved] same date. Thus we see why the 1634 Sussex Visitation showed Bridget Stanney as the representative of the Ernle family in Sussex, for her brother had died sometime before the final disposition of his worldly estate by will and sentence of 16 June 1632. It is not surprising, then, that, when the 1662 heraldic Visitation of Sussex was made, no further pedigree was recorded for the ancient Sussex family of Ernle, and what Ernle blood remained in the county was inherited via the female line, as in the case of the Stanney or Stanny and Rishton families. Thus was extinguished one of the ancient historic surnames of the county of Sussex. The Sussex Ernle family might have deserved some place in Sir J. Bernard Burke's chronicle of the rise and fall from prominence of old names, The Vicissitudes of Families, though he chiefly concerned himself with the demise of families comprising the greater nobility of the realm. ==Rise from local to national prominence under the Tudors== The Ernle family maintained their manorial demesne at Earnley on the Sussex coast for centuries. In the early Tudor period, the original, or Sussex branch, of the Ernle family gave rise to Sir John Ernle (or Ernley), Knight, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas (1519‚Äì1520), whose career, begun during the reign of King Henry VII of England reached its height in the reign of his son and successor, King Henry VIII of England. Sir John Ernley's legal and judicial career and family connexions are detailed in the DNB and its successor, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Sir John's descendants remained in Sussex through the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods maintaining their connexion with the manor of Earnley until its sale in 1630, during the first years of the reign of King Charles I. Thereafter, it becomes harder to trace the descent of the Sussex branch of the family, though there are traces of it in Sussex in the 17th and 18th centuries as well as in neighbouring Hampshire. In 1538, under Henry VIII, William Ernle, son of Sir John Ernle, Lord Chief Justice, was sent to Chichester cathedral as a royal commissioner along with Sir William Goring to take down the Shrine of St Richard of Chichester located there. As Chichester cathedral was the chief church of the diocese where their estates lay, and St Richard was a local saint whose Shrine was decorated by pilgrims and members of the local gentry for over 250 years during the pre-Reformation period, this task was partly a test of the Sussex Ernle family head's loyalty to the new religion, the Church of England, whereof, on earth, the king had declared his royal supremacy supplanting the authority of the pope. Local legends at West Wittering in Sussex (a place where the Ernle family also held lands at this time) which claim that the bones of St Richard were hidden in a tomb there give rise to the possibility that this William Ernle or someone closely associated with him managed to secure the saint's relics for posterity when the removal and destruction of the ornaments and relics of St Richard's Shrine took place partly under Ernle's direction. William Ernle and Elizabeth his wife's tombs with their partially destroyed inscriptions are considered by historians to lie in West Wittering parish church, so the connexion, if true, was close. Be that as it may, later generations of Sussex Ernles appear to have conformed to the Church of England more enthusiastically. In 1564, Mr Richard Ernlie (misprinted as Crulie), of Cackham (now Cakeham), Sussex, son of William, the royal commissioner of 1538, is listed as being one of the gentlemen of Sussex who was designated as being among the \\"favourers of godlie procedinges\\", indicating that he was by then a staunch, if rather sobre, Anglican, when such a description was a mark of approval from Church and State alike. ==Migration to and proliferation in WiltshireMigration=== In the 18th century, the senior Wiltshire branch of the Ernle family claimed that they had established themselves in Wiltshire and abandoned their ancestral lands in Sussex in order to avoid any further exposure to England's seafaring enemies caused by their estate's proximity to the Sussex coast. Examination of their published pedigree reveals that, in fact, the two branches of the family, seated in Sussex and Wiltshire, existed simultaneously for over a century. By the 17th century, however, the name Ernle seems virtually to have disappeared from Sussex, while the branch established in Wiltshire by John Ernle, The Elder, Esq., of Fosbury, Wiltshire and Bishop's Cannings, Wiltshire (born 1464/5), elder brother of Sir John Ernle, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas (1519‚Äì1520), or his ancestors, continued to flourish in its new home. Recorded in the Visitation of Wiltshire in 1565, and, again, in 1623, the main seat of the family in Wiltshire was at Bourton manorhouse, said to be a former priory in the parish of Bishop's Cannings, but the initial connexion of the family with Wiltshire seems to have stemmed not from this estate but from the marriage in the first third of the 15th century of a Sussex Ernle to the heiress of an old Wiltshire manorial family, Malwyn (or Malwain) of Etchilhampton (alias Ashlington). In contrast, the following account given by Archdeacon Macdonald in the Wiltshire Arch√¶ological and Natural History Society Magazine (1860) reflects the traditional view of how the connexion of the Ernle family was forged with Wiltshire: \\"Tything of Bourton and Easton (Consolidated).\\" \\"Bourton was one of the seats of the ancient family of Ernle, who came into possession of this property in the time of Henry VIII; John son of William de Ernle having purchased the estate on the dissolution of the monasteries; the land being said to have been Priory property, but for this we have only vague traditional authority, no account of any religious house there, being to be found in any of the best works on the subject. The Ernle property at Echilhampton [Etchilhampton] belonged to the ancient family of Malwyn, came into the Ernle family with Joan Best wife of John Ernle...\\" This tradition needs to be examined carefully, for it contains two sections that require separation so that its true significance is understood. First, the acquisition of the lands at Bourton could not have occurred in the lifetime of William de Ernle's son John Ernle because he died in 1417 according to a Sussex inquisition post mortem. The period of monastic dissolution occurred over a century later in the period 1538 to 1541. As an aside, this may also be the reason why no one has been able to find a record of the sale of Bourton as a monastic property in the latter period. Secondly, a better idea of when the Ernle link with Wiltshire was forged can, however, be gleaned from the latter half of the foregoing account. The aforementioned heiress of the Malwyn family, Joan Best (daughter of Simon Best and his wife Agnes, daughter of John Malwyn or Malwain, Esq., lord of the manor of Etchilhampton) must have married John Ernle of Sussex, not later than about 1430, for their son, another John Ernle (of Sidlesham and Earnley, Sussex), was already a father of young sons himself, when he died in 1465, naming his mother Joan (born circa 1410 to 1415) and wife, Margaret (n√©e Morley, of Glynde Place, Sussex) in his will dated that year. The Ernle family, however, did not inherit Etchilhampton until several intervening heirs of the Malwain's property had first occupied it and then died themselves before Joan Best's senior heir, her grandson, John Ernle of Fosbury, Wiltshire, finally gained possession of the estate many years after his grandmother's death. Before their eventual inheritance of these lands in Wiltshire, it is not surprising then that the Ernle family concentrated their activities on Sussex, while maintaining a presence in both counties. Christopher Whittick's DNB account of Sir John Ernley's career has this to say about Ernle family two-county history: The family had been lords of the manor of Earnley near Chichester since the 13th century [sic, properly since the 12th]...the acquisition by marriage of lands and a parliamentary seat in Wiltshire in the 1430s, and legal preferment in Sussex after the Yorkist victory in 1460... culminated, in terms of the early modern period, in the career of the Lord Chief Justice Ernle under the first two Tudor monarchs. Supportive of these statements is the following evidence that the head of the Sussex family of Ernle, William Ernle, esq., of Earnley, is named both in Sussex and in Wiltshire as holding lands by the same source, which shows him as having interests in both counties in the same year, viz.: Inquisitions and assessments relating to feudal aids: with other analogous documents preserved in the Public Record Office, A. D. 1284-1431, vol. 5 p. 155 A.D. 1428 [page heading] [section covering the county of Sussex] Rapus Cicestrie Hundredum de Manewode WILLELMUS de ERNLE tenet iiijtam partem j.f. in ERNLE quondam JOHANNIS ERNLE, subsidium xx.d.

[rendered into English from Latin as follows] WILLIAM ERNELEY holds through subinfeudation, but from whom exactly is unknown, various lands in Yatesbury which were formerly held by Agnes Burdon, by the service of one f. m. Provided, of course, that these references do indeed relate to the same William ERNLE, this seems to indicate that while based at La Manwode in the parish of Earnley in Sussex in 1428, where, by being the first named, he would appear to have been the chiefmost resident (as holder of the manor of Earnley), he also held lands formerly in the possession of Agnes Burdon (widow of Nicholas, elsewhere recorded as Durdon, apparently erroneously) at Yatesbury in Wiltshire. The significance of this connexion between EARNLEY, Sussex and Yatesbury, Wiltshire‚Äîwhile not as obvious as the one with Fosbury, Wiltshire with which John ERNLE, The Elder, was later associated‚Äîis not, however, to be glossed over lightly. For, whereas Fosbury, and later Bishop's Cannings in Wiltshire, became the main seat of the ERNLE family; significantly, they also held Yatesbury for centuries, perhaps starting in or before 1428 (and no earlier than 1412 when no ERNLE is recorded in an early subsidy roll for Wiltshire). For example, Francis ERNLE, third son of John ERNLE, of Burton in Bishop's Cannings (d. 1572), was described as gentleman, of Yatesbury in his will, and his children retained the connexion. In 1412, however, we see that while the ERNLE family was present as major landholders in Sussex, they had not yet forged their connexion with Wiltshire, viz.: Inquisitions and assessments relating to feudal aids : with other analogous documents preserved in the Public Record Office, A. D. 1284-1431, vol. 6. p. 520 Sussex A.D. 1412 p. 522 [same county] WILLELMUS ERNELE habet maneria etc. cum pertinenciis, que valent xxi. li. xiij. s. videlicet terras etc. in MANWODE apud ERNELE xx. li., et terras etc. in MENESSE liij. s. iiij. d.

And that these lands etc.... According to the Wiltshire section of the book, p. 541, Yatesbury was then held by Henricus Thorp, while, John MALWAIN or MALWYN, of Etchilhampton, Wilts., a later ERNLE ancestor (see additional references earlier in this section) appears on p. 540, as: Johannes MALWAYN habet terras etc. qui valent etc. xxv. li., videlicet in ECHELHAMPTON, WODHAMPTON, ERCHESFONTE, et CONOK xx. li. et apud MERTON, c. s. [translated from Latin into English follows] John MALWAYN has lands etc. which are valued etc. at 25 pounds, that is to say, in ECHELHAMPTON, WODHAMPTON, ERCHESFONTE (modern Urchfont, Wilts.), and CONOK (modern Conock in the parish of Chirton), worth 20 pounds, and in and about MERTON, 50 shillings. (If not in Wiltshire, this Merton may refer to the one in Surrey, in which case it was probably acquired through the family's known London mercantile interests. The other localities are all in Wiltshire). The dual presence of the ERNLE family in Sussex and Wiltshire seems to have been maintained for some generations as is evident from the fact that John ERNLE, The Elder, Esq., of Fosbury, was appointed as one of the four commissioners for Wiltshire in the 13 Hen. VII (1496) parliament, as Johes. ERNLEY (along with Christopher Tropnell, Cristoforus Tropynell, John Gawen Johes Gawen, and George Chatterton, Georgius Chaderton), while some 9 years later, his younger brother, the confusingly- named John ERNLE (later Sir John ERNLE, Knight, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Commons Pleas), sat as one of the ten Members of Parliament allotted to the county Sussex in the 19th year of Henry VII's reign [1505] as John ERNLY, Gentilman [denoting the rank he held as an Esquire's younger son] found in the circle of his Sussex kin and neighbours (Thomas Fynes [Fiennes], Knight; John Coke [Cooke], Esquyer; John Goryng [Goring], Esquyer; and Roger Leykenour [Lewknor] of Tangermer), and significantly found listed here in the company of the ill-fated Edmond Dudley, Esquyer, recent Speaker of the House of Commons, and leading minister to the king, to whom ERNLE owed so much of his later rise to prominence, while fortunately avoiding the fate of his ill- starred patron. Indeed, after Dudley's execution in 1510, the younger John ERNLE appeared in the rolls of Parliament for 1513 as one of the 15 M.P.s for Sussex (among them a brace of Lewknors, two Fiennes, a Covert, all neighbours and kin), and, notably on the rise, as attorney to an approving master, the King, viz.: Joh'es ERNLEY, Attorn. Regis [i.e. John ERNLEY, King's Attorney] (see Rotuli Parliamentorum : ut et petitiones et placita in parliamento, vol. 6, pp. 518 & 541; vol. 7, p. 36) ===Proliferation of the Wiltshire Ernle family=== Nonetheless, the fortunes of the Sussex branch of the family went into a slow decline under the heirs of Sir John Ernley (died 1520): his son William Ernle, M.P., of Cakeham, Sussex, (died 1545), and grandson Richard Ernle (died 1577). Wiltshire, however, proved to be fertile ground for the expansion of the family over successive generations. John Ernle of Fosbury (fl. 1507) had three sons: John his heir (died 1556), Anthony, of Laverstoke, Wilts. (died 1530), and William, a Fellow of New College, Oxford, and later parish priest of Yatesbury, Wilts. John Ernle (died 1556), in turn, had a son and heir John Ernle (died 1572) and William Ernle, founder of the Dorset branch of the family. John Ernle (died 1572), married Mary, daughter of William Hyde, Esq., of Denchworth, Berkshire, and had three sons: Michael his heir (d. 1593/4); Thomas (died 1595), of Brembridge manor, Dilton, Westbury, Wilts., and Francis, of Yatesbury, Wilts. John and Mary also had one daughter, Anne, who married Robert Partridge (or Partrydge) (d. 1600), of Wishanger manor, Miserden, Gloucestershire, in about 1566. The proliferation of cadet branches in Wiltshire, however, arose chiefly from the two marriages of Michael Ernle (died 1593/4), first to the heiress of the Whetham House estate, Mary Finnemore, and, secondly, to Susan Hungerford, the daughter of Sir Walter Hungerford by his second wife, Anne Dormer. From these two marriages, there were ten children giving rise to a number of cadet branches of the family seated throughout the county. The chief (senior-most) of these lived at Whetham House in the parish of Calne, Wiltshire. There were also branches at Conock, parish of Chirton, Wiltshire, All Cannings, Wiltshire, Etchilhampton alias Ashlington, Wiltshire, Brimslade Park, parish of Brimslade, Wiltshire, and Burytown, Bury Blunsdon, parish of Highworth, Wiltshire. Baronetcy Of these, the most prominent was the branch descended from Edward Ernle, son of Michael Ernle, Esq., of Bourton (died 1595), by his second wife, Susan Hungerford, daughter of Sir Walter Hungerford, Kt, of Farley Castle, Somerset, a granddaughter of the executed Walter, Lord Hungerford. Baptised at Calne in 1587, Edward Ernle, and his wife Gertrude St Lowe, were progenitors of the Ernle Baronets of Etchilhampton, alias Ashlington, Wiltshire, and the 'self- styled' Ernle baronets of Brimslade Park. It was their son, Sir Walter Ernle, Knight, of Etchilhampton, who was created a baronet shortly after the Restoration by King Charles II on 2 February 1660/1, as Sir Walter Ernle, 1st Baronet. Passing first through his own heirs, the baronetcy was used, with doubtful authority, according to The Complete Baronetage, by the Brimslade Park branch of the family established by his younger brother, Michael Ernle, gent., of Brimslade. That line, too, died out, and the soi-disant baronet's dignities, real or imagined, were finally extinguished with the death in 1787 of the Reverend Sir Edward Ernle, 7th Baronet, the Anglican rector of Avington, Berkshire, without issue, at the age of 75. Cadet lines In addition, cadet branches stemming from Michael Ernle's forebears include those derived from his father John Ernle's second son, Thomas Ernle, gent., of Brembridge manor, Dilton, Westbury, Wiltshire (died 1595), and his third and youngest son, Francis Ernle, gent., of Yatesbury, Wiltshire. Earlier still, a cadet line derived from Michael Ernle's uncle, William Ernle, had established itself at Sutton Benger, Wiltshire, and later at Chalbury in Dorset. Brembridge or Bremeridge manor line at Dilton, an 18th-century survival This line was established by Thomas Ernle (I), gent. (died 1595), second of the three sons, with one daughter, of John Ernle, Esq., of Bourton Priory, Bishop's Cannings, Wiltshire, by his wife, Mary, daughter of William Hyde, Esq., of Denchworth, Berkshire. The Brembridge or Bremeridge manor branch of the family proliferated through the fourteen children - no fewer than ten sons and four daughters - of Thomas Ernle (died 1595) and his wife Bridget (died 1610), daughter of Richard Franklin, of Overton, Wilts. The eldest son, Thomas Ernle (II), gent. (died 1639), married Praxed or Praxeda Lambe, a daughter of John Lambe (d.v.p. 1615), a son of the lord of the manor of Coulston, Wiltshire. Thomas (II) became lessee of the manor of Abingdon Court, Cricklade St Sampson, Wiltshire, in succession to his father, and held the advowson of St Sampson's parish church, Cricklade. From him was descended the Ernle family of Braydon and Purton, Wiltshire, continued by Thomas (II)'s son, Thomas (III), gent., of Braydon, Purton (1614‚Äì1694), and his wife, Jane, daughter of the Antwerp-born naturalised London merchant, Philip Jacobson, gent., King's Jeweller, to James I of England and Charles I of England, and fee-farmer of estates in Braydon Forest, Wiltshire. Other sons of the line's founder established themselves elsewhere: Edward Ernle, gent., (1577‚Äì1655) at Bath, Somerset; Francis Ernle, gent. (born 1577) in the parish of St John Zachary in London; William Ernle, gent. (1583‚Äì1663) at Bideford in Devon. The line at Bremeridge itself was continued by Richard Ernle, gent. (1584‚Äì1650), seventh son of the original Thomas Ernle (I) (died 1595). He married Elizabeth Cogswell, a member of the wealthy family of clothiers in Westbury parish, Wiltshire, and their line continued until the last scion of that family, another Richard Ernle, was buried at Old Dilton chapelry, Westbury, Wiltshire, in 1786, aged 84. Distaff relatives: female lines Today the surname Ernle only survives as an inheritance via the female line, employed by the Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax family of Charborough House, Dorset, whose head is the Westminster M.P., Richard Drax, otherwise Richard Grosvenor Plunkett- Ernle-Erle-Drax, Esq., but there are few mentions of the Ernle women over the centuries. Most Ernle daughters made suitable marital alliances with members of other gentry families, but it can still be difficult to trace their posterity beyond the first or second generation. Often all that is known of an Ernle wife is her name, her father's name, and his rank and the name of the place where he had his estate or resided. One slight exception is noteworthy simply due to the paucity of other material. It comes from an epitaph and extols the chief adornment that any lady of good family in times past could bring to her husband besides a dowry of money and land: physical beauty. The quotation comes from John Aubrey's Collections for Wiltshire, under the section on the parish of Calne: Here under liethe the body of Lady Frances Mildmay, wife to Sir Thomas Mildmay. She dyed in the faith of Christ the ninth of December, 1624. She was daughter to Sir Jno. Ernle of Whetham, and was a very rare beauty. == New national prominence: Civil War, Anglo-Dutch Wars, and the later Stuarts == The senior line at Whetham House, Calne, Wiltshire, gave rise to the Right Honourable Sir John Ernle (1620‚Äì1697), Knight, P.C., M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer to kings Charles II and James II from 1676 to 1689, whose biography is given in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Another member of the Whetham line, Sir Michael Ernle (1599-?1645), Knight, uncle to the Chancellor, was a royalist commander during the English Civil War. His end is unclear, as John Aubrey's Natural History of Wiltshire, points out: > Sir Michael Ernele, Knight, was second son of Sir John Ernele, of Whetham in > the County of Wilts. After he had spent some time at the University of > Oxford, he betooke himself to a militarie life in the Low Countries, where > he became so good a proficient that at his return into England at the > beginning of the Civill warres, King Charles the First gave him the > commission of a Colonell in his service, and shortly after he was made > Governour of Shrewsbury, and he was, or intended to bee, Major Generall. He > did his Majesty good service in the warres, as doth appeare by the Mercurii > Aulici. His garrison at Shrewsbury being weakened by drawing out great part > of them before the battle at Marston Moore, the townesmen plotted and > betrayed his garrison to the Parliament soldiers.

His name is included in the list of > those who were made prisoners when the town surrendered.‚ÄîJ. B.] Sir John Ernle, R.N. (1647‚Äì1686), Knight, of Burytown, Bury Blunsdon (otherwise Broad Blunsdon in Highworth parish), Wiltshire, eldest son of the foregoing Chancellor of the Exchequer, was an English naval officer during the Anglo-Dutch Wars, notably commanding H.M.S. Dover at the Battle of Solebay at the start of the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672. He is also mentioned in John Aubrey's Natural History of Wiltshire > Sir John Ernele, great-grandson of Sir John Ernele above sayd, and eldest > son of Sir John Ernele, late Chancellour of the Exchequer, had the command > of a flagship, and was eminent in some sea services. He married the daughter > and heir of Sir John Kerle [modern, Kyrle] of .... [Much Marcle] in > Herefordshire. His son, John Kyrle Ernle, Esq. (1683‚Äì1725), of Whetham, Calne, Wiltshire, and Much Marcle, Herefordshire, entertained Queen Anne at Whetham. ==Devon== William Ernle (1583‚Äì1663), gent., sixth of the tens sons, with four daughters, of Thomas Ernle, gent., of Bremeridge manor, Dilton, Wiltshire, and his wife, Bridget, daughter of Richard Franklin, established himself as a merchant at Bideford, Devon. He married Philippa, a daughter of Edmund Tremayne, by his wife, Elizabeth St Ledger. He is mentioned in a work on the Bideford Witch trial, one of the last such events in England. In that text, the connexion to the Ernle at Newburgh Park, Coxwold, Yorkshire, is established from contemporary documents. ==Dorset== In the 17th century, a cadet branch of the Wiltshire-based family also established itself in Dorset, a county to the south-west of Wiltshire, where it was recorded in the Visitation of Dorset of 1623. Seated first at Sutton Benger, Wiltshire, it later became associated with Chalbury in Dorset. The published registers of the University of Oxford, Foster's Alumni Oxonienses show that members of the family persisted there, and elsewhere in Dorset, until well into the 18th century. ==Yorkshire== The Life of Marmaduke Rawdon notes that in the 17th century, one John Ernle (here recorded as Mr. John Earneley) was chiefe gentleman in the service of Lord Falconbridge (modern Fauconberg), whose seat was at Newburgh Park, near Coxwold, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. At that period, members of the lesser gentry often served the greater gentlefolk, which is to say, the nobility, a practice which gave rise to the expression, a gentleman's gentleman. Information about Ernle of Bideford, Devon shows that this Yorkshire gentleman belonged to the family of Ernle of Brembridge. In 1670, Mary, one of the daughters of John Earnley of Alne, gent. [Yorkshire] accused Anne Wilkinson, widow, of having used witchcraft against her and two of her sisters, allegedly causing the death of her sister, Eleanor. This anecdote serves to show the links not only between the Ernle family in Devon and Yorkshire, but also to demonstrate the shadow cast in both counties by the witchcraft hysteria then so prevalent. > LXXIX.

Though apparently extinct in the male line in the United Kingdom, its current use as an ancient English surname has been actively maintained by its inclusion as the second component of the quadruple-barrelled patronymic, Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax (see double-barrelled surname), borne by descendants of John William Plunkett, 17th Baron of Dunsany, whose wife was Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Ernle-Erle- Drax, n√©e Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Burton (1855‚Äì1916), who was doubly descended, both in the female line, from members of the Wiltshire Ernle family. As demonstrated in the foregoing passage, the name Ernle, Ernley (also Ernl√©, Ernl√®, Ernly, and Ernleigh) is also employed by descendants of the family and others as a given name. Examples include Ernle Bradford (1922‚Äì1986), the writer, and Alfred Ernle Montacute Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield, PC (1873‚Äì1967), and his son Ernle David Lewis Chatfield, 2nd Baron Chatfield (born 1917), (see also Baron Chatfield), and Sir Ernley Blackwell, KCB, legal assistant under-secretary of State at the Home Office (1906‚Äì1931). The British Conservative politician and writer Ernle Money was given the name at birth in 1931. Additionally, it was also used as the name for the barony granted to Rowland Edmund Prothero (1851‚Äì1937), who was created the 1st Baron Ernle, on 4 February 1919, for whose career and family history consult L.G. Pine's New Extinct Peerage. == References == *Burke's Commoners (short title for A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, enjoying territorial possessions or high official rank), vol. 3, p. 619, vol. 4, p. 209 *Burke's Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies (see Ernle of Etchilhampton, pp. 186‚Äì187) *Burke's General Armory [short title], being The General Armory of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, Sir John Bernard Burke, Ulster King of Arms, reprint of last edition, 1884, by The Genealogical Publishing Company, Baltimore, Maryland, 1969. *Burke's General Armory Two being Alfred Morant's Additions and Corrections to Burke's General Armory.
