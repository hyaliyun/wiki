Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, Nick began drawing and art at an early age. Nick designed the Iroquois Brewery logo and associated marketing materials, and his work was seen on millions of beer bottles. ==Life== Artist Nick J Schwab Jr at work in his studio ===Early years=== Nick J Schwab Jr. was born on April 24, 1912, in Buffalo New York, to Nicholas J Schwab and Clara M Schwab, born Hofmeyer. Nick was baptized Francis X Schwab, being named after his one of his six uncles. His interest in painting began at an early age, after submitting a drawing of a Native American as an entry to a Courier-Express sponsored contest. Nick won the contest, and its associated prize of $1, and his lifelong love of painting and drawing, with an emphasis on Native Americans, took hold. ===Marketing years=== Schwab was the Vice President of Advertising and Sales promotion for Iroquois Breweries. In 1938 Nick re-created the Iroquois Brewery Indian Head trademark/logo, changing it from a European style Indian Head, to a more accurate depiction of a Native American, Iroquois Indian chief. ===World War II=== In 1943, during World War II, Schwab painted one of his most recognizable works, \\"Jungle Soldier\\". His paining was recognized by the Treasury War Finance Division, and considered for use as a poster in the Fifth War Loan Drive. The painting was used by the American Red Cross, and won Schwab national acclaim. A contemporary of Norman Rockwell, Schwab spent time with the famous illustrator, and received helpful criticism and encouragement from him. ===Later career=== Depiction of Kiontwogky by Nick J Schwab Jr After nearly 20 years of leading the marketing and advertising initiatives of Iroquois Breweries, Schwab moved to Cincinnati, in 1965. He became director of research and development for the American Sign and Display Company. His passion for painting and drawing never waned, as he continued to paint until his death. ====Death==== Schwab died on December 17, 1982, at the age 70 in Cincinnati, Ohio.

He went to school in Gelsing√∏r and then moved to Copenhagen where he apprenticed as a carpenter and studied at Copenhagen Technical College until 1875. He then enrolled at the Roydal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from where he graduated as an architect in June 1881. ==Career== Wright initially worked for Hos H. Chr. Hansen, Vilhelm Friederichsenm Johannes Emil Gnudtzmann and Johan Daniel Herholdt. He worked for Copenhagen Municipality from 1884 and from 1886 under city architect Ludvig Fenger. He headed the department of building maintenance from 1899. When city architect Ludvig Fenger died in 1904, Ludvig Claussen, his intended successor, had recently died. Wright was therefore appointed as acting city architect. The appointment of a new city architect was delayed by the city's considerations about discontinuing the office to rely on private architects but these plans were abandoned and in 1907 Wright was appointed on a permanent basis. His work comprises large residential developments in N√∏rrebro and Vesterbro, public schools and bath houses, and technical installations. ==Personal life== Wright married Louise Gustave Dorothea Hildegard von Bauditz (1861-1935), a daughter of actuary and later hospital manager in Helsing√∏r Carl Adolph Valentin von B. and Elisabeth Jeanette Carlsen, on 1 May 1886 in Helsing√∏r. == List of works== ===Private practice=== * M.

Although women had recently been enfranchised in France, the lack of time to prepare a new voter roll meant that female suffrage was not introduced for the 1945 elections in New Caledonia. Despite not being able to vote, women were allowed to run as candidates, and two were nominated by the Social Progress bloc. ==Campaign== A total of 50 candidates contested the 15 seats in the first round, five of whom were independents. Seventeen withdrew prior to the second round. The candidates were from three main groupings; the Comit√© Caledonien led by Pierre Berg√®s, Social Progress (also known as the Labour group) led by Florindo Paladini and the Union Party (also known as the Conservatives or Ballande Party due to its association with Maison Ballande, the main commercial company in the territory). The Union Party represented commercial and financial sectors and put forward a manifesto calling for autonomy in the areas of customs and economic and financial policy. The Social Progress group called for the breakup of large agricultural estates and improved job opportunities for the local population. Prior to the elections, eleven Comit√© Caledonien members published an advertisement in the local media naming four of the Union Party candidates as supporters of Philippe P√©tain.Election Skirmishes in New Caledonia Pacific Islands Monthly, February 1945, p28 ==Results== Voter turnout in the first round was around 50%. Berg√®s was the only candidate elected in the first round. Prior to the second round, the Comit√© Caledonien and Social Progress blocs formed a Popular Front alliance to run against the Union Party. The Comit√© Caledonien and Union Party drew most of their support from rural areas, whilst the Social Progress group's voter base was concentrated in Noum√©a. { class= style=text- align:right !rowspan=2Party !colspan=3First round !colspan=3Second round !rowspan=2Total seats - !Votes!!%!!Seats!!Votes!!%!!Seats - align=leftUnion Party10,523 0  22 - align=leftComit√© Caledonien8,452 1  78 - align=leftSocial Progress8,417 0  55 - align=leftIndependents  0  00 - align=leftTotal  1  1415 - align=left colspan=8Source: Pacific Islands Monthly } ==References== New Caledonia Category:Elections in New Caledonia Category:1945 in New Caledonia ","title":"1945 New Caledonian legislative election"},{"id":"60251110","text":" HMS Etrusco was launched in 1789 at Rhode Island as President Washington.

During this time he took several surveys and rendered some services to the British East India Company, which were officially acknowledged. In December 1791 he purchased at Calcutta and fitted out an American ship, President Washington, at a cost of about ¬£20,000. He named his purchase Etrusco, transferring to President Washington the name and papers of his previous ship. She therefore sailed under the flag of the Duke of Tuscany.House of Commons (1813) The Parliamentary Debates for the Year 1803 to the Present Time, Volume 25, pp.1039‚Äì1040. Popham sailed Etrusco to China and took on board a cargo valued at ¬£50,000, the property of himself and two merchants, apparently French. He also took on the freight charge, which he valued at ¬£40,000. Etrusco arrived at Ostend in July 1793, where the English frigate seized her and then brought her back to England. Etrusco was claimed as a prize for having French property on board, and condemned as a droit of admiralty for infringing the British East India Company's (EIC) monopoly by bringing tea from China.

Her timbers were already in a poor state before she had left the West Indies and after the storm and the loss of her masts she was now leaking. She progressed under jury rig but on 15 August, the transfer of the last of her crew to and was complete. Commander Reynolds fired three of her 6-pounder guns downwards through her bottom to scuttle her and then left her.

Painting of a Man In the Snow by Lady Eveline Marie Alexander ==Biography== Alexander n√©e Michell was born on 16 April 1821 in Nantes, France. Her father was Colonel Charles Collier Michell, who was born on 29 March 1793 in Exeter, Devon. Her mother was Anne D'Arragon, who was born in Spain in 1799. She was promptly born after her parents got married on 17 September 1814. Her father, was a member of the Royal Artillery. While there is little known about Lady Eveline Marie Alexander, she is now well known for being an amateur painter whose primary skills were in oil and watercolor. The exact way she learned how to paint is still unknown. She had no official training, it is believed she learned from her father, who was a military drawing master at Royal Military College. In 1837, she married Sir James Edward Alexander and the couple had five children. She accompanied her military husband on a Canadian tour of duty from 1841 to 1849, when she settled in London, Ontario. In 1843 she painted a scene of a military steeple chase, which was turned into a popular lithograph. Alexander died on the Isle of Wight in 1906. == Artwork == Grand Military Steeple Chase by Lady Eveline Marie Alexander Lady Eveline was also known for her sleighing scenes in art. She was associated with this name due to the winter sleighing scene which was completed in watercolor and is theorized to have been given to the Bells as a keepsake of the \\"Sleigh Society.\\" She had a tendency to often paint or draw winter scenes. An example of this is one of her drawings of an indigenous man trudging through a snowstorm. In 1841 through 1849, Lady Eveline joined Sir James Edward Alexander while he was being stationed in London, Ontario during his Canadian tour. During this time her husband was in the 14th Regiment of Foot and aide-de-camp to Sir Benjamin D'Urban and Sir William Rowan. While stationed during the Canadian tour, she created a sketch depicting her surroundings which was of the military steeplechase and was lithographed. This came to be one of her most known works, the first military steeplechase to occur North America in May 1843. It was titled Grand Military Steeple Chase, and is considered to be a rare print. During her time it was a popular collector's item in England. Her prints can now be found in museums mainly in Canada, where she drew her most famous artwork. ==References== ==External link== * Category:1821 births Category:1906 deaths Category:Canadian women artists Eveline ","title":"Lady Eveline Marie Alexander"},{"id":"60251320","text":"Frederick C. \\"Fritz\\" Mackey (April 30, 1904 ‚Äì July 2, 1987) was an American football and baseball player and coach.

Since 1971, he has been executive of The Italian Tribune, a Newark-based publication focused primarily on Italian American culture. In 1977, Fortunato, a resident of Glen Ridge, was elected to the General Assembly from the 27th district encompassing the northern suburbs of Essex County. He came in second place behind incumbent Republican Carl Orechio. In the next election in 1979, Fortunato placed first in the election ahead of Orechio. After redistricting in 1981, the northern Essex district was slightly reconfigured and renumbered the 30th district. Fortunato came in first in the 1981 election ahead of Republican John V. Kelly. He again was reelected in 1983 but for the first time his Democratic running mate, Steve Adubato Jr., was also elected. During the 1984‚Äì1985 Assembly session, he was chairman of the Committee on Independent Authorities and Commissions and vice chair of the Transportation and Communications Committee. In April 1985, he was indicted on allegedly accepting a bribe of $2,000 in exchange for getting the sons of Clifton resident Vito Maglione jobs at the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. The indictment plus the strong coat tails of Republican Thomas Kean in the gubernatorial election led to the defeat of Fortunato and Adubato by Republicans Kelly and Marion Crecco. Fortunato was later acquitted of the bribery charges in 1987 and attempted to stage a comeback to the Assembly in 1989. However, he was narrowly defeated in the general election by Kelly and Crecco. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Rider University alumni Category:People from Glen Ridge, New Jersey Category:People from Orange, New Jersey Category:American newspaper publishers (people) Category:American people of Italian descent Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:New Jersey Democrats ","title":"Buddy Fortunato"},{"id":"60251627","text":"Self-Portrait (Inn of the Dawn Horse) is a painting executed by the English artist Leonora Carrington and is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She began the painting in London in 1937 and completed it in Paris in 1938.Aberth, Leonora Carrington, 30. It is one of her most recognized works and has been called her \\"first truly Surrealist work.\\"Grimes, \\"Leonora Carrington Is Dead at 94.\\" == Description == Self- Portrait features an interior space consisting of two walls meeting at a corner, a ceiling, a tiled floor, and an ornately curtained window that reveals a lush, green forest view and a white horse galloping in the distance. Carrington depicted herself seated on a chair in the foreground, gesturing to a lactating hyena on her right. Her wild tresses appear to mimic a horse's mane and the hyena's fur color. Above her head is a floating white rocking horse. The white of her breeches mirrors the white color of both the rocking horse and the horse seen in the distance, and her green jacket reflects the forest exterior. She gazes out to the viewer directly and sternly. == Symbolism and interpretations == ===Horses=== Horses, in Carrington's work, appeared frequently and as early as 1929; they represented an aspect of her animal self as symbols of freedom and liberty.Aberth, Leonora Carrington, 32-33 Because of Carrington's interest in Celtic mythology, she would have been familiar with the Celtic goddess Epona, who appeared before her followers on a white horse. The white rocking horse floating above Carrington is most likely a reference to P√©n√©lope, a play Carrington wrote about a young girl who is in love with her rocking horse Tartarus (or Tartar as he is known in the French version)Colvile, \\"Beauty and/Is the Beast,\\" 162-163. ===Hyena=== The inclusion of the hyena may suggest an \\"intrusion of the wild into a domestic space,\\" which Carrington is ultimately aligning herself with as noted by her gesture towards the female hyena and their mirrored stares towards the viewer.Aberth, Leonora Carrington, 32. Carrington often identified with the hyena, in the same way she identified with horses, saying in an interview from 1999, \\"I'm like a hyena, I get into the garbage cans. I have an insatiable curiosity.\\"Carrington, interview. == Provenance == At the beginning of World War II, Carrington left the painting with German artist Max Ernst, who took it to New York in 1941. He gave it to art dealer Pierre Matisse, the youngest son of French painter Henri Matisse, sometime after December 1942, and upon his death, the painting was transferred to his widow Maria-Gaetana Matisse. In 2002, Self-Portrait was gifted to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by the Pierre and Maria-Gaetana Matisse Foundation.Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Pierre and Maria-Gaetana Matisse Foundation, web page. == Exhibition history== * New York.

It also reported that she underwent a good repair in 1785.Lloyd's Register (1786), Seq.‚ÑñH261.

A compendium of vessels on the Liverpool Registry in 1786‚Äì88 yielded nothing. The report that she underwent a good repair in 1785 suggests that she may have been a naval vessel, though they were rarely built in Liverpool, or possibly a government transport, perhaps sailing under another name, but prepared for sale.

Hope succeeded in capturing Haasje on 22 May and sending her into the Cape. Hope returned to the Cape on 23 October 1797. She then disappears from online records. Hope did not possess a letter of marque, and so the capture of Haase was by a non-commissioned vessel. Hence the prize became a Droits of Admiralty.

The country had elections in 2013, which international observers declared legitimate. Monaco has established policy that protects human rights. Nevertheless, there has been pressure from various parties to improve said rights in the country. There have been several recent cases of prisoner mistreatment in Monaco, including prison facilities that have allegedly failed to provide sufficient recreation time for prisoners. In addition, several large organizations such as the Council of Europe's European Committee for the Prevention of Torture have been active in reviewing the prison system in the country. Other issues include the preservation of national security, wherefore the country maintains voice recordings of anybody engaged in organized crime. Today, a constitutional monarchy regulates the country, which associates with France as a protectorate. ==Civil liberties== ===Freedom of expression=== The country supports freedom of expression of its citizens, a right that is protected by the Constitution. Government authorities generally respect this right. However, the Monegasque Penal Code prohibits, inter alia, any public criticism of the ruling family. ===Freedom of religion=== Cathedral Roman Catholicism is the official religion of the state, with about 95% of Monegasques following the faith. Monaco is part of the Diocese of Gibraltar. The law allows full freedom of religion. The state has one cathedral, a synagogue, and five Catholic churches. ===Freedom of movement=== For the most part, residents of Monaco can move freely within the small area comprising the country. Certain regulations concern the right of Monegasques to work in adjacent countries. The Monegasque enjoy special rights relating to repatriation and the acquisition of foreign citizenship. As an example, while the state can revoke the nationality of a Monegasque for cause, such as naturalization in a foreign country, the prince has the power to restore citizenship after consulting with the Crown Council. As to refugees, the government applies the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol. Monaco has several arrangements with France regarding political asylum of refugees, subject to French constitutional stipulations. ==Criminal justice system== ===Trial=== There are three levels of judicial power in Monaco, which handle both civil lawsuits and criminal law. They include: * Jurisdiction of First Instance- this jurisdiction is divided into offices of the Justice of the Peace, the Court of First Instance, and various other tribunals. * Court of Appeal- the court of appeal reviews the judgments of appeal cases. The court of First Instance may also hear appeals, subject to government rules. * The Court of Revision ‚Äì this Court works as a secondary platform for deciding cases. It ensures that lower court levels apply the law appropriately. The Court may also decide to approve or quash an appeal, or may remand a case sua sponte for additional investigation. * The Supreme Court of Monaco has specific jurisdictions. This includes: ** Constitutional matters- the Supreme Court may review cases of annulment, legal compensations cases, and infringements of constitutional rights. ** Administrative affairs- these include review of the actions of administrative authorities, as well as activities that involve annulment. ==Constitutional Rights in Monaco== The Constitution of Monaco protects its citizens from arbitrary arrests or trial, and from detention when a person is not suspected of a crime. Basic rights include a requirement that law enforcement authorities bring a person charged with a crime in front of a court of law within 24 hours. Monaco releases a significant portion of its detainees without bail. The investigating magistrate, though, may order the detention of an individual for as many as 120 days, based on investigative factors. Further, Monaco does not force its nationals into exile when suspected of a crime. ===Prisons=== The prison system of Monaco has drawn criticism from various quarters worldwide. Though Monaco endeavors to provide suitable resources for criminals, shortcomings have been alleged regarding the country‚Äôs correctional facilities. International human rights agencies have criticized Monaco for sending all long-term prisoner citizens to France, as well as the conditions in which prisoners detained more than 24 hours have been held. These include a lack of sufficient outdoor exercise or space for recreation; a lack of access to sunlight; and insufficient space for prisoners to keep their personal property. The prison system in Monaco is controlled by independent, non-governmental parties such as CPT, which conducts regular appraisals of the prisons in Monaco. From these examinations, relevant prison officials are tasked with maintaining and supporting human rights within the correctional system. ==Protection== The judiciary and Constitution of Monaco address instances of abuse, and provide solutions thereto. The constitution also grants certain rights to the 5,000 residents classified as Monegasque nationals: free education, financial help for those in need, and the right to elect officials and hold positions of national office. ==Children's rights== Monaco's government generally supports children's rights and welfare. Health care programs for the young are plentiful. Demographic studies conducted in 2010 showed that the mortality rate for children under five years had fallen below 4%. Furthermore, 97% of children have access to resources such as clean drinking water. Children also receive sufficient vaccination against diseases. Abortion, legalized in Monaco in 2009, is restricted to cases involving severe health problems. The state has universal, mandatory public education for children. Reports from UNICEF state that the educational system needs to further respect human rights, as well as comply with the convention against discrimination in schools. The United Nations has made several recommendations for Monaco regarding legislation that further protects the rights of children. Monaco actively promotes the right of children to not be enlisted in the military. ==References== Monegasque society Category:Monegasque law ","title":"Human rights in Monaco"},{"id":"60251825","text":"Museo del Oro Precolombino, San Jose, Costa Rica.

In Bribri and Cab√©car culture, Sib√∂ is seen as the \\"owner\\" or \\"guardian\\" (Bribri: wak) of humanity, as he created the first human beings out of corn seeds. == Family == * S√¨itami - mother of Sib√∫ * Sib√∂k√µm√µ - father of Sib√∫ * N√£m√£it√£mƒ©, also called Tapir - Sib√∫'s sister, mother of Ir√¨ria * Ir√¨ria, also called Sul√°ra, la Ni√±a Tierra, or tapir girl - Sib√∫'s niece * Sul√° - father of Ir√¨ria, lord of the underworld * Bikakra - grandmother of Ir√¨ria * S√≥rkura or S√≥rkuLa - grandfather (in some sources, grand-uncle) of Sib√∫ * Tsuru' - Sib√∫'s wife, goddess of cacao == Birth of Sib√∫ == There are different versions about the birth of Sib√∫ (Sib√∂), but all agree that, before the god came to earth, the world was ruled and inhabited by a race of devils, the S√≤rburu, headed by his grandfather S√≥rkura. S√≥rkura had a son, Sib√∂k√µm√µ or Sib√∂k√£m√£, who was a great healer. Once, Sib√∂k√µm√µ went to work as an Aw√° (shaman) in the lower world, that of the S√≤rburu, and took with him his niece S√¨itami. === First version: Sib√∂ as a magic stone === Sib√∂k√µm√µ, like all aw√°, possessed magical stones called sƒ©√£' or sƒ©√µ: three male and one female. One day, one of those male stones (which was Sib√∫), the one used to heal, was lost: it was inside S√¨itami. Sib√∂ did this because he knew that men could not reproduce alone. Thus, Sib√∂ was born, and the god thought: \\"I am an older person, only in a small body. I hope my mother asks my father for a little ripe banana or a bit of corn dough.\\" And S√¨itami asked Sib√∂k√µm√µ to bring her those things to feed the child. Then Sib√∂ thought: \\"I wish my mother would tell my father to purify me and build a small ranch near the house.\\" So he did, and Sib√∂k√µm√µ took care of the boy, and healed him for two nights while he purified him. When S√¨itami returned to the house four days later, Sib√∂ was able to stand, and by eight days he was already a man. Then, he began to create all things. === Second version: The escape to D√¨ratuaa L√≥ratuaa === When Sib√∫ was born, a rooster that had never sung began to sing. Then the S√≤rburu knew that Sib√∫ was born, and since they did not want anyone else there, they looked for the boy to kill him. S√¨itami realized, and began to look for someone to accompany her to the higher world, which she knew from her trips with Sib√∂k√µm√µ. Akura, the termite, offered to move them from one place to another by building a tunnel. Thus, the mother and child came to D√¨ratuaa L√≥ratuaa, where the house of the ants is, who hid them. There Sib√∫ grew up. === Third version: The boy from the river === Once, Sib√∂k√µm√µ went fishing with a spear, and found Sib√∂ as a baby on the bank of a river. Then, he picked up the boy, took him to his house, and gave him to his wife S√¨itami, presenting him as his son. The child was born with a shell (in a skin bag, that is, an amniotic sac), so his father purified it; but the baby did not stop crying, although Sib√∂k√µm√µ had already cut her navel and cleaned it of the impurity of the birth . The child did not want to suckle, nor eat or drink water. Then S√¨itami ground cacao and put the soft dough in his mouth, which made the baby happy. With only that food Sib√∂ grew up and managed to think of all the things in the universe. == Myths about Sib√∫ == === The war with the S√≤rburu === It may be difficult to understand why the S√≤rburu would want to kill Sib√∫, them being his relatives. However, for the Bribri kinship is transmitted matrilineally, and it was Sib√∂komo who was related to the devils. In the legends several reasons for the S√≤rburu wanting to kill Sib√∂ are mentioned: * They did not want more people in their place. * They were jealous of his power. * They coveted his magical objects. * They hated him because he had created the seeds (dits√∂). * They did not want him to create the world. * They did not want him to take away the power. * S√≥rkura wanted to be king of men. * They just wanted to kill him. In the version of Sib√∂'s birth that talks about the flight to D√°turaa L√≥ratuaa, it is said that when Sib√∂ grew up, he told his father that he wanted to return to the lower world, to meet the S√≤rburu and to know why they did not believe it. Sib√∂komo then tells him to do it, but be careful, because they wanted to kill him. This is when Sib√∂ returns to the lower world. Once there, he found two S√≤rburu who were working in their lands. The devils heard a strange sound, wek, wek, wek! and went to see what it was, but they did not find anyone. Hanging over a hearth was a half-cooked gray fox, the food of the S√≤rburu. Then Sib√∂ came, blew on the fox and revived it; the animal got down and began to sing and play the drum, while Sib√∂ accompanied him playing maracas. Seeing this, the two devils left their hiding place and stabbed at Sib√∂ with a spear, but he jumped and they could not hurt him. Sib√∫'s first feat was frightening the S√≤rburu by resurrecting a gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) While they fought, the fox again hung over the stove. The S√≤rburu were furious, because they believed that this was a bad omen and that they were going to die. So they grabbed the fox, chopped it up and threw it out. This is why the fox is not eaten by the Bribri. After that, Sib√∂ spent all his time bothering the devils and making bad omens, collected in humorous tales such as those mentioned below. === The resurrected chicken === One day, Sib√∂ was walking, blowing his conch shell and his horn, when he met the S√≤rburu. The god made the devils have a vision in which he would grab some chickens, kill them, cook them and serve them for food. The devils had not recognized him, and he sat down, pretending to eat with them. Then, one of the chickens that was already cooked got up and sang three times (which for the devils was a prophecy of death). Sib√∂ did this because he knew they wanted to kill him, and he blew on the chicken to make it fly away. === The kidnapping in S√≥rkura's house === Another day, Sib√∫ decided to let himself get caught, so he went to S√≥rkura's house, carrying honey, a conch, a horn, his staff, his shield and a skirt of a plant called '. The S√≤rburu asked Sib√∂ if he was a god, and although he denied it, the S√≤rburu caught him and took his possessions. But Sib√∂ escaped, and the next day he was transformed into a well-dressed old man. He asked the devils if it was true that they had trapped Sib√∂. The devils said yes, and showed him each of the things that the god had been carrying, which the old man tried out. When they reached the place where they had put Sib√∂, the god turned into wind and left. === The raid on the house of the S√≤rburu === The S√≤rburu had in their house some drums, foxes in the form of maracas and some macaws. All of these animals were dead. When the devils were out of the house, Sib√∂ entered, resuscitated the animals and together they began to make a lot of noise: the macaws sang, the foxes played the maracas and Sib√∂ played the drums. As the S√≤rburu were nearby, they returned immediately to try to catch the god, but he had disappeared, and the macaws and foxes were dead and hung over the stove. The next day, Sib√∂ arrived pretending to be a visitor, and asked if it was true that the god had been there. The devils said yes, and entrusted him with their plans to kill him. Having learned their plans, Sib√∂ let himself be caught another day, and the S√≤rburu tied him up and started to shoot him, but in the night the god escaped. === The death of S√≥rkura === Sib√∂ knew that S√≥rkura wanted to kill him, so every time he met him on the way, he became another being, sometimes a hummingbird that was flitting past the S√≤rburu. The devil got fed up, and told his relatives that he was going to kill Sib√∂, and that when he did he would blow his horn so that they would arrive and celebrate the death of the god. One day Sib√∂ found himself face to face with S√≥rkura, who threw all his spears at him, never hitting the mark. Sib√∂ then took one of those weapons, and on the first shot, he killed his grandfather. Then, the god took the appearance of S√≥rkura, and sounded the devil's horn. At once the other S√≤rburu arrived, who rejoiced, believing that it was Sib√∂ who had died, and convinced by the god, they dismembered and roasted the corpse. Then Sib√∂ made himself known, and threw the pieces of S√≥rkura into the air, where they were transformed into signs of ill omen. === Creation of the earth === Tapirus bairdii, the only tapir species in Costa Rica Before the creation of human beings, Sib√∂ created the sky and the earth, but the earth was only barren rock on which nothing would grow. The Bribri creation myth relates how Sib√∫'s sister, N√£m√£it√£mƒ© (also called Tapir), had a daughter named Ir√¨ria. Sib√∫ sent Duk√∫r Bulu, a vampire bat, to bite Ir√¨ria to see if she could become the earth. When Duk√∫r Bulu returned to Sib√∫, his excrement began to grow vines and bushes, indicating that Sib√∫'s plan would work. Sib√∫ sent the bat a second time to suck the blood of Ir√¨ria, and again the bat's excrement grew trees. The third time that Sib√∫ sent Duk√∫r Bulu, the King of Pita (Agave americana) was waiting for him, transformed into a fine thread across the doorway. When Duk√∫r Bulu flew into the room where Ir√¨ria was sleeping, the thread cut him in two. His top half (with the head and wings) flew back to Sib√∫, who wrapped the wound with cotton, blew on it, and advised Duk√∫r Bulu to hang upside-down to heal more quickly. A traditional Bribri palenque. Talamanca, Costa Rica. Sib√∫ sent his pe√≥n (servant) to visit the tapir family and invite them to a festival, but they refused to come until Sib√∫ came to invite them in person. Sib√∫ invited Bikakra, Iriria's grandmother, to perform corn and chocolate ceremonies at a festival to inaugurate a great conical house for the clans at Sul√°yum, the center of the world to the Bribri people. He also invited the devils to dance the Sorb√≥n dance, since they had helped in the building of the house. At the festival, everyone danced the Sorb√≥n. During the fourth dance, Ir√¨ria fell to the ground and her blood spilled across the floor. All the devils danced on her body and trampled her until she became pure earth. In another myth, Sib√∫ planned to marry off his sister in exchange for a wife of his own, but she refused. Sib√∫ sent some of her spirit to earth for the Bribri to hunt. Because of this, the Bribri consider the tapir a sacred animal and only consume it in special rituals. === Creation of Human Beings === Sib√∂ had brought seeds of corn from suLa'kaska, The Place of Destiny. The seeds were different colors, which is why the indigenous peoples of Talamanca have different skin tones. Sib√∂ kept the corn seeds in a basket, and gave different names to the different seeds, which became the names of clans. Later he divided the seeds into groups, and warned that people should not marry within their own clan. He also taught some to be aw√°pa (shamans), and others to be bik√°kla, sts√∂k√∂l, and √≥kum, the officiants of funeral ceremonies. The Bribri relate that Sib√∂ created white people, s√≠kwa, from the pl√©kek√∂L (leafcutter ants). Sib√∂ told the people that he would also create white people, called s√≠kwa, from the pl√©kek√∂L (leafcutter ants). Pl√©kek√∂L was Sib√∂'s relative, the King of the Leaf-cutter Ants, and white people originated from him. Sib√∂ created indigenous people at night, but created white people during the day. Some Bribri say that this is why white people are \\"more scientific\\", because Sib√∂ taught them different things than the indigenous people. However, like the leafcutter ants, the white people cut down and destroy everything in their path, leaving no vegetation behind. ==== The UsekLa Clan ==== In ancient times, all of Sib√∂'s relatives were allowed to eat Sib√∂'s possessions on Earth, including the indigenous people. To protect his people, Sib√∂ gave them the UsekLa clan, celestial beings from another world, not made from corn like the other people. Sib√∂ gave them magic stones to cure illnesses, and they fought against the Owners of diseases, plagues, hunger, and storms. The Bribri say that they were unable to defeat the Owners of the flu, measles, and the common cold, however, explaining why so many indigenous peoples died from introduced diseases after the Columbian exchange. The only ones allowed to interact with the UsekLa were men of the royal Salkwak clan, who acted as intermediaries between the UsekLa and the rest of the people. === Creation of the Siak√∂Ldi === The Bribri people of the K√©k√∂ldi reserve in Talamanca relate a story about the creation of the Siak√∂ldi, a branch of the K√©k√∂ldi River: When Sib√∫ was walking by the creek, carrying cassava dough to make chicha, he became tired. He used the water of the creek to wet the dough and make chicha to refresh himself. He threw the cassava pulp into the creek, where it turned into sacred white stones called sƒ©√£'. Mount Chirrip√≥, the highest mountain in Costa Rica (3,821 m), is considered the home of Sib√∫ by the Bribri. == References == == Sources == * == Further reading == * Category:Central American mythology Category:Creator deities Category:Wisdom gods Category:Costa Rican folklore Category:Trickster gods Category:Talamancan mythology ","title":"Sib√∫"},{"id":"60251832","text":"Marie Ozanne (1906‚Äì1943) was a major in The Salvation Army, and publicly protested about the treatment of prisoners of war as slave labourers by the German army during World War II. ==Early life== Ozanne was born on Guernsey in 1906.

Linden, and established under the Ontario Public Inquiries Act (1990), which culminated in a four volume 1,533-page Ipperwash Inquiry Report released on May 30, 2007. The inquiry was established by then Premier Dalton McGuinty shortly after he took office after winning the Ontario general election on October 23, 2003. On November 12, 2003 the Liberals called for an inquiry with a twofold purpose, to investigate events surrounding the death of 38-year-old Dudley George, who was shot and killed by an OPP officer at Ipperwash Provincial Park in September 1995, and to make recommendations to prevent the escalation of violence that took place during the Ipperwash Crisis. According to the report, George was the \\"first aboriginal person to be killed in a land-rights dispute in Canada since the 19th century.\\" The report found that \\"the appropriation of the Stony Point reserve by the Government of Canada in 1942 was unprecedented in Canadian history.\\" ==Public judicial inquiry== The public judicial inquiry was funded by the Government of Ontario under the Ontario Public Inquiries Act (1990). In the introduction of Volume 3 of his final report, Linden explained how public inquiries are \\"established by government, and their objective is to fulfill the mandate set out in an order-in-council, yet they are independent of government.\\" He wrote that a \\"public inquiry can be called to uncover the truth about a specific matter... and to propose policy reform\\" as was the case with the Ipperwash inquiry. It was led by a neutral third party, Sidney B. Linden, \\"pursuant to his powers as commissioner established under the Ontario Public Inquiries Act.\\" The inquiry culminated in a four volume 1,533-page Ipperwash Inquiry Report released on May 30, 2007. The public inquiry was funded by the Government of Ontario but conducted by a neutral third party, Linden, was a neutral third party \\"pursuant to his powers as commissioner established under the Ontario Public Inquiries Act\\". ==Mandate== The inquiry had a twofold mandate, set out by the order in council, \\"to look into and report on events surrounding the death of Dudley George and to make recommendations focused on the avoidance of violence in similar circumstances.\\" ==Landmark inquiry== The Ipperwash inquiry has been called a landmark by Amnesty International Canada. According to a June 1, 2007 article in The Toronto Star, the Law Society of Upper Canada described it as \\"a landmark report on Aboriginal, police and government relations.\\"According to The Star, Sidney Linden, \\"as \\"head of the judicial inquiry into the Dudley George shooting, Linden spent two years listening to 139 witnesses, 229 days of testimony and was presented with 23,000 documents.\\" ==Ipperwash Inquiry Report== The inquiry culminated in the four volume 1,533-page Ipperwash Inquiry Report released on May 30, 2007. Full report According to the report, George was the \\"first aboriginal person to be killed in a land-rights dispute in Canada since the 19th century.\\" The full report consisted of 4 volumes. Volume 1 covered \\"Investigation and Findings\\", Volume 2 was on Policy Analysis, Volume 3 was on Inquiry Process, and Volume 4 included the Executive Summary. According to the section \\"OPP Prepare for Park Occupation\\" in Volume 2, on August 29, 1995, OPP Incident Commander John Carson contacted RCMP Inspector Dave Guy in British Columbia about possible similarities with the Gustafsen Lake standoff where the RCMP had been \\"subject to gunfire\\". ==Background== For ten years Dudley George's brother Sam George fought \\"for justice\\" calling for an inquiry into Dudley's death. In 2008, a year after the report was released, Sam George was inducted into the Order of Ontario. The man who nominated George, Wayne Samuelson, said that, \\"Sam George did not seek revenge ‚Äì he sought justice. Sam is a man of peace, a shining example for us all. Debewin is the Ojibway word for truth. It means the truth is supposed to heal us all. That‚Äôs what Sam set out to do.\\" In 2003 Amnesty International renewed its call for an inquiry. Alex Neve, secretary-general of Amnesty International Canada said that \\"[e}Eight years is simply too long to wait for answer\\" and that governments at the federal and provincial level had \\"ignored their responsibilities\\" and defied a 1999 request from the United Nations. He added that this was \\"hurting Canada's efforts to pressure other countries on human rights and cited this country's dispute with Iran over the death of Iranian-Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi as an example.\\" According to a 2015 history of the Ontario Court of Justice, for many years the family of Dudley George, especially his brother Sam George had called for an investigation, questions had continued to be raised in the Ontario Legislature, and journalists had continued their investigations. On November 12, 2003, the Liberal government that had just won the Ontario general election on October 23, 2003, under Premier McGuinty, called for an inquiry.The Ipperwash crisis and the tainted water crisis in Walkerton improved McGuinty's chances of replacing the Conservative government that had been in power under Mike Harris from 1995 through 2002 and under Ernie Eves from 2002 through 2003. ==Original land claim== In Volume 1, in the section \\"History of Stoney Point and Kettle Point\\", Joan Holmes reported that in 1937 the Chief and Council of the Kettle and Stony Point Band had requested that the provincial government preserve an old Indian burial ground at Ipperwash Beach by fencing it to protect it. This section of the report described in detail the discovery and authentication of burial sites, the appropriation of land containing the burial sites, and the unrelenting efforts on the part of the Kettle and Stony Point Band to have this site protected. It also described the establishment of Ipperwash Provincial Park in 1936 and the ongoing efforts of the First Nations to protect the burial sites. Stony Point of According to a September 20, 2015 CBC News report twenty years after the Ipperwash Crisis, the land dispute dated back to 1942, when the federal government appropriated Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation's land to build Camp Ipperwash, a military base, under the War Measures Act and relocated 16 First Nation families and their homes. The land was supposed to be used as a base only during the war and with a promise of compensation. After World War II, the land was not returned to the First Nation, Camp Ipperwash was used for training cadets until 1995. The First Nations claimed that Sandy Point was a sacred burial site. By 1993, members of the First Nation began to occupy Camp Ipperwash while the military was using the land for training army cadets. In 1995 the military withdrew. A group of 30 First Nations protesters marched into Ipperwash Provincial Park and took up occupation on September 4, 1995. ==Conclusions== The report found that \\"the appropriation of the Stony Point reserve by the Government of Canada in 1942 was unprecedented in Canadian history.\\" The inquiry \\"found that the OPP, the provincial government led by Premier Mike Harris, and the federal government all bore responsibility for the events that led to George‚Äôs death. Linden also called on the federal government to issue a public apology and return Camp Ipperwash ‚Äì along with compensation ‚Äì to the Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation.\\" In Volume 1 of the report it was noted that, Premier Harris's \\"comments\\" and \\"generally the speed at which he wished to end the occupation of Ipperwash Park, created an atmosphere that unduly narrowed the scope of the government's response to the Aboriginal occupation.\\" Volume 1 The report made 100 recommendations. ==Responses== ===In reference to the Aboriginal occupation of land in Caledonia=== The Ipperwash inquiry proceedings were taking place at the same time as the Caledonia land dispute also known as the Grand River land dispute. In 2006, members of the Six Nations of the Grand River took control of a disputed parcel of land in Caledonia, Ontario, in Haldimand County known as the Haldimand Tract. The Caledonia occupation resulted in a successful $20 million lawsuit by Caledonia residents against the Crown. The University of Western Ontario's political science professor, Andrew Sancton wrote in his 2012 article, that the case for Caledonia residents would have been weaker if the Crown had implemented Linden's \\"democratic policing\\" model.

Peterson has been profiled (and her work featured) in the Times Colonist and Tofino- Ucluelet Westerly News. == Life == Peterson spent her early years on a farm in Scotland. She attended Strathaven Academy. In 1957 (when she was 20 years old) she and her family immigrated to Kingston, Ontario, Canada. She went to school at Kingston Business College before taking a secretarial position at Queen's University. She married Ray Peterson in 1963, and in 1965 the Petersons moved together across Canada to Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1972, the Peterson familythen with three children: Karen, John, and Craigmoved to Port Alberni on Vancouver Island. == Career == After moving to the Alberni Valley, Peterson got involved in the local arts and culture scene. She exhibited her own paintings throughout the 1970s, and also served as president of the Alberni Valley Community Arts Council. During her tenure, in 1977, Peterson oversaw the transformation of a heritage home into the Rollin Art Centre, a fine arts gallery, gift shop, classroom, and office dedicated to enriching the cultural environment of the Alberni Valley. She served on the BC Arts Board from 1979‚Äì1981, and continued to participate in art shows and various exhibitions in the Alberni Valley, Nanaimo, and Victoria. During this time, Peterson was also writing about the arts. She produced press releases about local art events, and published the Alberni Valley Community Arts Council's newsletters. From 1981 to 1987, Peterson worked as a reporter for the Alberni Valley Times. While working at the newspaper, she won a Jack Wasserman Memorial Award for outstanding journalism. In 1987, a health issue pulled Peterson away from her work for a two-year period. It was during this time that she was inspired to begin researching and writing about the history of Vancouver Island. In 1996, she retired to Nanaimo, continuing her research into the history of Vancouver Island. She completed a historical trilogy about her new home city, publishing Black Diamond City: Nanaimo - The Victorian Era (2002), Hub City: Nanaimo, 1886-1920 (2003), and Harbour City: Nanaimo in Transition, 1886-1920 (2006). The three books chart the city's foundation, growth, and development, also telling the stories of its citizens. In 2004, Peterson self-published her first book about Scotland, Listen Tae Yer Granny. Primarily a collection of Scottish rhymes, proverbs, and folklore, the book also includes stories from her own family's history. 2008 saw Peterson working with the Nanaimo Museum to publish A Place in Time: Nanaimo Chronicles. She donated the book's proceeds to the museum. Peterson's next book, Kilts on the Coast:The Scots Who Built BC, published in 2012, is a profile of Scottish settlers, including James Douglas, William Fraser Tolmie and Robert Dunsmuir, who came to Vancouver Island in 18481854 primarily to work in the Hudson's Bay Company's fur trade and coal mining ventures. Realising the lack of records of the city's history after the amalgamation of twin cities Alberni & Port Alberni, Peterson returned to the Alberni Valley for the subject of her 10th non-fiction book, Port Alberni: More Than Just a Mill Town, which was released in 2014. In 2017, Peterson published Mark Bate: Nanaimo's First Mayor as her first historical biography. The book closely follows the life of Mark Bate, covering not only his years acting as the manager of Nanaimo's first coal mine, but also his sixteen terms as city mayor. The book includes many excerpts from Bate's own journals and letters, and it offers insight into the drama that arose among him and other prominent coal-men-turned-politicians (including the future premier of British Columbia, Robert Dunsmuir) Peterson has worked with many community organisations devoted to arts, culture, education, and history. These include the Nanaimo Historical Society, the Nanaimo District Museum Society, the Nanaimo Community Archives Society, the Friends of North Island College, the Alberni District Historical Society, the Alberni Valley Community Arts Council, the Alberni Valley Chamber of Commerce, and the Alberni Valley Museum Advisory Board. She holds honorary lifetime memberships in both the Alberni District Historical Society and the Alberni Valley Community Arts Council. She has repeatedly been recognised for her community service and her contributions to the historical record of Vancouver Island, including: 1997 and 1999 Certificates of Honour from the British Columbia Historical Federation; a Canada 125 medal for community service; a certificate of appreciation from the City of Port Alberni for historical research; and a Heritage Award from the Alberni Valley Museum & Heritage Commission. In 2018, the City of Nanaimo awarded her the inaugural Honour in Heritage Award, recognising her outstanding support, advocacy, promotion, and interpretation of Nanaimo's heritage and history. == Books == * The Albernis: 1860-1922 (1992) * Twin Cities: Alberni-Port Alberni (1994) * Cathedral Grove: MacMillan Park (1996) * Journeys Down the Alberni Canal to Barkley Sound (1999) * Black Diamond City: Nanaimo - The Victorian Era (2002) * Hub City: Nanaimo, 1886-1920 (2003) * Listen Tae Yer Granny (2004) * Harbour City: Nanaimo in Transition, 1886-1920 (2006) * A Place in Time: Nanaimo Chronicles (2008) * Kilts on the Coast:The Scots Who Built BC (2012) * Port Alberni: More Than Just a Mill Town (2014) * Mark Bate: Nanaimo's First Mayor (2017) == References == Category:1937 births Category:People from Strathaven Category:20th-century Canadian women writers Category:21st-century Canadian women writers Category:Canadian women historians Category:People from Port Alberni Category:Living people ","title":"Jan Peterson"},{"id":"60252076","text":"Anglo-Jordanian relations refers to the relationship between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Two countries share a relatively close tie owning by the Hashemites, which received British helps to overthrow the Turkish rule in the country at the World War I, but also sometimes suffered tensions. Nonetheless, two countries were able to secure a strong relationship. Jordan has an embassy in London. The United Kingdom has an embassy in Amman. ==History== During World War I, the Hashemites requested help and support from the British Empire throughout its official Near East headquarter administration in Cairo to fight against the Ottomans, which was materialized after 1916. The sudden revolt led by the Hashemite family, while not be able to secure total support from other Arab tribes, played an instrumental role on the collapse of the Ottoman rule in there. However, the main goal of Hashemite's led-revolt, a complete unity and independence for an Arab state spanned from modern-day Iraq and Syria to further south of Yemen excluding Aden, was not honored by London and its French ally. Eventually, as an apology to the failure, Britain placed Sharif Abdullah as ruler of the Emirate of Transjordan hoping to de-fuel tensions. Until 1956, the Emirate, while governed by the Hashemites, didn't have a complete independent administration. British Government still exercised influences across the Emirate. John Bagot Glubb, known as Glubb Pasha, was the de facto ruler in charge of the country, laid the foundation of Arab Legion, which would be known in the future as the Jordanian Armed Forces. Meanwhile, Glubb Pasha played a controversial role, which is still on debate in the history of modern Jordanian Kingdom. At the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War of 1948, Britain secretly favored a total Jordanian invasion of West Bank hoping to wipe out a possible creation of a Palestinian state led by Amin al-Husseini, in which, it was a success and secured British influence within Transjordan although their role has created an unwanted consequence in the future of the Middle East. Britain would be later continuing to support Jordan at the Black September against the PLO, though its support was questionable after its comment in distrust of the future of King Hussein. Britain also secretly supported Israeli jets to fly in Jordan when Syria sent troops to invade the country, forcing the Syrians to retreat. King Hussein himself married Antoinette Gardiner, a British woman who later gave birth to Abdullah II of Jordan. As for the result, Abdullah II has a British descent throughout his mother. ==Modern ties== Thanked for this strong kinship and the later marriage between Hussein and Muna, Jordan and the United Kingdom maintain a strong relationship. British PM Theresa May considered Jordan as a noteworthy ally, and was responded with the same mutual trust from the Jordanian PM. Two countries also set to expand their bilateral ties. Both also involved at small-scale in the peace talk between Israel and Palestine as negotiator and urged for peace talk between. According from King Abdullah II, the relationship has already reached a high point to become true partnership. ==References== ==Further reading== * Alon, Yoav. \\"‚ÄòHeart-Beguiling Araby‚Äô on the Frontier of Empire: Early Anglo-Arab Relations in Transjordan.\\" British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies 36.1 (2009): 55-72. * Ashton, Nigel J. \\"‚ÄòA ‚ÄúSpecial Relationship‚Äù sometimes in spite of ourselves‚Äô: Britain and Jordan, 1957‚Äì73.\\" Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 33.2 (2005): 221-244. * Oren, Michael B. \\"A Winter of Discontent: Britain's Crisis in Jordan, December 1955-March 1956.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 22.2 (1990): 171-184. * Ovendale, Ritchie. \\"Great Britain and the Anglo-American invasion of Jordan and Lebanon in 1958.\\" International History Review 16.2 (1994): 284-303. * Tal, Lawrence. \\"Britain and the Jordan Crisis of 1958.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 31.1 (1995): 39-57. * Wilson, Mary Christina.

Among their obligations are the following: * Maintain a musical presence at military parades * Honoring foreign heads of state on their state visits to Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur * Support the everyday ceremonial activities of the Regiment * Support the all ceremonial activities of the state * Performing drill at military tattoos domestically and internationally In 2008, the PPRAMD was invited to perform in the United Kingdom, performing at Royal Tattoo at Windsor Castle, at the Household Division Beating Retreat on Horse Guards Parade, and the mounting of the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace. Domestically, the PPRAMD was responsible for according state visits for foreign leaders, such as King Salman, President Emmanuel Macron, and President Barack Obama.https://www.nst.com.my/node/215482/amp During all of the arrival honors for the mentioned leaders, Menjunjung Duli was played by the PPRAMD during the inspection of the guard of honour. In supporting all events of national importance, the PPRAMD is always seen at high level occasions, such as the Installation of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the Opening of Parliament. == Organization == * Unit HQ * Marching Band * Brass fanfare section * Corps of Drums * Symphonic Band * Pipe band * Big band === Pipes and Drums === The Pipes and Drums of the Central Band are made up of personnel who belong to the Malacca-based 5th Battalion, RMR and is platoon-sized. It was founded in 1953 when an officer of the King's Own Scottish Borderers (an affiliated British Regiment) was seconded to form a pipe platoon. The officer, who was in fact Scottish himself, introduced the ethnically Malay members of the regiment to bagpipe training. At present, the pipes and drums of the current Royal Regiment of Scotland and the RMR have maintained their historical alliance alongside the larger regiment. The platoon has done many events, being invited to the Edinburgh Festival many times, with the last time being in January 1990, on the occasion of the KOSB‚Äôs 300th regimental anniversary.http://army.mod.gov.my/buletin_td/news_item.asp?NewsID=225 == References == == External links == * Bands performances of the Malay Regiment at Buckingham Palace, London * Askar Melayu Pancaragam Melaka Parade * The PPRAMD in a concert setting Category:Military units and formations of Malaysia Category:Military bands Category:Malaysian Army ","title":"Central Band of the Royal Malay Regiment"},{"id":"60252158","text":"Yushui Subdistrict () is a subdistrict in Dejiang County, Guizhou, China. , it has 7 residential communities and 6 villages under its administration. == See also == * List of township-level divisions of Guizhou == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Guizhou Category:Dejiang County ","title":"Yushui Subdistrict"},{"id":"60252167","text":"The Edward Yeakel House, at 116 Decatur St. in Brandenburg, Kentucky, was built around 1885 to 1990 It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

The son of portrait painter and professor August Eisenmenger, he attended the University of Vienna and became the personal physician of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Eisenmenger's syndrome ‚Äì a phenomenon in which longstanding heart defects affect the blood flow to a person's lungs ‚Äì is named in his honor. ==Early life== Eisenmenger was born in Vienna in 1864, the son of portrait painter August Eisenmenger and his wife Emma. August Eisenmenger became known for his work on the ceiling panels at Vienna's Musikverein, and he was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where his students included Rudolf Ernst. Victor Eisenmenger had two brothers, a well-known engineer named Hugo and a civil servant in finance named Ewald. Eisenmenger enjoyed art and natural science, but, as he put it, \\"An artistic career and a study of natural science were both denied to me, the former because my talent was not sufficiently pronounced, the latter because I was forced to earn my living as soon as possible. Thus, I decided to study medicine.\\" He hoped that a medical career would satisfy his curiosity in science and also allow him to teach others. He graduated from medical school at the University of Vienna in 1889. ==Medical career== ===Early career=== After beginning his career as an unpaid assistant surgeon at a Viennese clinic, Eisenmenger secured a position at the laryngology clinic of Leopold von Schr√∂tter in 1894. By the following year, Eisenmenger was suffering from poor health. von Schr√∂tter, who had become something of a father figure to Eisenmenger, arranged for him to become the personal physician to the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who had just been diagnosed with tuberculosis. von Schr√∂tter thought that such a position would be less physically taxing for Eisenmenger than other positions in medicine. ===Service to Archduke Franz Ferdinand=== Eisenmenger was the personal physician to the archduke as well as to Charles I of Austria. He worked for the archduke from about 1895 until Ferdinand's assassination in June 1914. \\"You and the valet are my only friends,\\" Ferdinand once told Eisenmenger. Eisenmenger wrote Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand (Archduke Franz Ferdinand), a 200-page memoir published by about his time spent with the Archduke. The book was rather critical of the Archduke. Even before it was published, the work generated some controversy among Viennese physicians because Eisenmenger included information that was thought to violate standards of doctor-patient confidentiality. Eisenmenger married the former Anna Hoberg, and they had two daughters, Anna and Hilde. Eisenmenger's wife was also connected to royalty. When Archduchess of Austria Infanta Maria Theresa of Portugal arranged to sell the Napoleon Diamond Necklace (worth US$450,000 at the time) in the U.S., she received only a few thousand dollars in return, so she sent Anna Hoberg Eisenmenger to the U.S. to recover the necklace. Archduke Leopold of Austria, Prince of Tuscany was jailed on a grand larceny charge in the matter, but he was acquitted at trial. ===Eisenmenger's syndrome=== In an 1897 article in a German medical journal, Eisenmenger described signs of low blood oxygen levels (including a bluish hue to the skin and nail clubbing) in a 32-year-old man who had been born with a ventricular septal defect. Eisenmenger had seen the patient during his time working with von Schr√∂tter. Since the 1950s, as the understanding of heart and lung disease has evolved, Eisenmenger's syndrome is the name given to the situation in which a cardiac defect causes too much blood flow to the lungs, which in turn causes changes to the blood vessels in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) and a reversal of blood flow so that now there is insufficient flow to the lungs. ==Later life== Eisenmenger died in 1932. He was buried at Ottakringer Friedhof in Vienna. Forty-five years later, he was reinterred in his father's tomb at the Vienna Central Cemetery. ==References== Category:1864 births Category:1932 deaths Category:Austrian physicians Category:University of Vienna alumni ","title":"Victor Eisenmenger"},{"id":"60252399","text":"Dashu Township () is a township under the administration of Dongxiang Autonomous County, Gansu, China. , it has 10 villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Gansu Category:Dongxiang Autonomous County ","title":"Dashu Township, Gansu"},{"id":"60252401","text":"Mother Court may refer to: * United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, nickname * The Mother Court, a book about the S.D.N.Y. court ","title":"Mother Court"},{"id":"60252410","text":"Edith Chase (25 November 1924 ‚Äì 13 June 2017) was an American environmental activist and community leader. ==Early life and education== Edith Chase was born on 25 November 1924 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her parents were Floyd Cates and Aimee n√©e Fisher Cates. Chase attended Antioch College, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in chemistry in 1945. She then earned a Master of Science in chemistry from the University of Minnesota. ==Environmental science and activism== Chase moved to in Kent, Ohio in 1958 and ended up residing there for over fifty years, during which she was involved in environmental study and protection.

The result is notable as one of the biggest shocks in football history, as the Faroe Islands were playing their first ever competitive match and had a team composed of amateur players, while Austria played at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy less than three months earlier. ==Background== The Faroe Islands Football Association became a member of FIFA on 2 July 1988 and joined UEFA that year, on 18 April 1990. Austria, in turn, played at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy less than three months earlier and were eliminated in the group stage. Because the Faroe Islands didn't have a suitable football stadium, their national team chose to play its matches in Sweden, using Landskrona IP as their home ground. ==Match== ===Details=== { width=92% -   } { style=\\"width:100%;\\" -  style=\\"vertical-align:top; width:40%;\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1 Jens Martin Knudsen - RB 5 Julian Hansen - CB 4 Mikkjal Danielsen - CB 2 J√≥annes Jakobsen (c) - LB 3 Tummas Eli Hansen - RM 6 Allan M√∏rk√∏re  - CM 9 Abraham Hansen - CM 10K√°ri Reynheim  - CM 8 Jan Dam - LM 7 Torkil Nielsen - CF 11Kurt M√∏rk√∏re  - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3 P√°ll Gu√∞laugsson } valign=\\"top\\"300px style=\\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\\" { style=\\"font- size:90%; margin:auto;\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Michael Konsel - CB 3 Robert Pecl - CB 5 Michael Streiter  - CB 4 J√ºrgen Hartmann - RM 2 Kurt Russ - CM 6 Heinz Peischl - CM 8 Manfred Linzmaier (c) - LM 10Andi Herzog   - RW 7 Gerhard Rodax - CF 9 Toni Polster - LW 11Andreas Reisinger   - colspan=3Substitutions: - MF 14Gerald Willfurth   - FW 15Peter Pacult   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=3Josef Hickersberger } } { style=\\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\\"  Assistant referees: Kjell Nordby (Norway) Roy Helge Olsen (Norway) Fourth official: Peter Mikkelsen (Denmark) style=\\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\\" Match rules *90 minutes. *Maximum of two substitutions. } ==Aftermath== Austria coach Josef Hickersberger resigned the day after the loss. In the return fixture, played on 22 April 1991 at Salzburg, Austria beat the Faroes 3‚Äì0.

Husband and wife has same name as Jaratkaru. He appears as a subordinate character in the tales of Manasa and Astika. Jaratkaru is described as a great learned sage who practises severe asceticism. Though he wants to remain celibate, he marries Manasa on persuasion of his dead ancestors, who are doomed to fall to hell if he does not procreate. The marriage fails, with hardly any emotional bond between the couple. Jaratkaru finally forsakes Manasa when she wakes him up from his deep slumber and he feels insulted. However, he impregnates her before leaving her forever. Manasa gives birth to Astika in his absence. Little is known about his early life before meeting Manasa or his later life, after abandoning her. ==Background== Jaratkaru appears in the tales of Astika and Manasa in the Hindu scriptures Mahabharata, the Devi Bhagavata Purana, and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana. The tale of Astika is narrated twice in Astika Parva chapter of the first Book of the Mahabharata, Adi Parva. He is also a character in folk tales related to the worship of his wife, the snake goddess. The Hindu epic Mahabharata narrates that Jaratkaru was born in the lineage of the Yayavara Brahmins and was the only heir of the clan. The etymology of his name is explained in the epic. Jara means \\"consumption\\" and Karu is \\"monstrous\\"; the sage had a huge body, which he reduced (consumed) by austerities. Thus, he was called Jaratkaru. In the first, shorter telling, Jaratkaru is described as being as powerful as a Prajapati, having performed severe tapas (austerities) and practised the vow of celibacy (Brahmacharya).van Buitenen pp. 69-71 In the second version, Jaratkaru is called a scholar of the Vedas and its branches, \\"controlled, great-spirited\\", and observant of great vows and austerities. ==Meeting with the manes== The \\"great ascetic\\" has wandered the world and visited various pilgrimage spots and sacred bodies of water. He has even renounced food and sleep, and survives only on air. He has become old. Once on his journey, he saw his emaciated ancestors hanging upside down with their heads in a hole that led to hell, with the grass rope that was holding them steadily being eaten by a rat. The manes cursed Jaratkaru's foolishness to be an ascetic and end his lineage of the Yayavaras. They begged him to marry and beget children so that they could attain heaven. While Jaratkaru resented the idea of taking a wife initially, he agrees to the following conditions: He will only take a virgin with the same name as his, who is given as alms to him by her family, notwithstanding his poverty. He moves ahead on his journey, having given this promise to his forebears. The second Mahabharata version adds two additional conditions: that the namesake woman should marry him of her own free will, and that he will not support his wife.van Buitenen pp. 103-108 The poor and aged sage wanders the world in vain in search of a bride but does not find a suitable one. Once, in the forest, recalling the promise to his manes, he prays three times for a bride. In the second version, he cries out loud in frustration and sorrow over his futile efforts. ==Marriage== Vasuki, the king of Nagas (serpents), awaits the arrival of the sage. As advised by the god Brahma, Vasuki has planned the marriage of his younger sister (known as Manasa in later texts) to Jaratkaru, the great seer in order to counter the curse given by the mother of the snakes, Kadru. She had cursed the snakes to be burnt at the yajna (fire-sacrifice) of Janamejaya. Brahma prophesied that the son of Jaratkaru and Manasa would stop the sacrifice, rescuing the serpents. Vasuki has also appointed serpents to keep a watch on the sage and report back to him when the sage decides to marry.van Buitenen pp. 95-97 Vasuki emerges and offers his younger sister Manasa to the sage, who accepts her after cross- checking with his criteria. Vasuki also promises to support Manasa. After the marriage, Jaratkaru lives in the abode of the serpents with his new wife. Jaratkaru warns his new wife that he will abandon her and his home if she ever displeases him, so she serves her eccentric husband dutifully. In due course, Jaratkaru unites with Manasa, making her pregnant. The Brahma Vaivarta Purana portrays Manasa as the daughter of the sage Kashyapa, who is the one who betroths her to Jaratkaru. The marriage is never consummated as Jaratkaru even refuses to touch Manasa and sleeps separately under a fig tree.McDaniel pp. 153-4 ==Abandonment of his wife== Manasa with her son Astika on her lap. The Mahabharata continues in its longer telling: Soon after Jaratkaru impregnates his wife, the fatigued sage sleeps in his wife's lap. As sunset nears and it is time for evening worship, Manasa faces the dilemma whether to disturb the peaceful slumber of her husband or let him sleep and thus risk him losing the merit of the obligatory worship. She weighs her options and chooses the former. She whispers in his ears to awaken him so that he can perform his ablutions and light the Agnihotra flame. The sage is enraged and feels insulted. He says that the sun will not dare to set before he performs his rituals. He forsakes her, though the \\"innocent\\" wife begs his pardon and justifies her decision. She reveals to him the true purpose of their marriage, the birth of their son - saviour of the serpents - and asks him to wait until that purpose is fulfilled. The sage assures her that his seed is in her and that she will deliver a learned son. Jaratkaru leaves to perform his austerities again, never to return again to his family. The Brahma Vaivarta Purana narrates that Jaratkaru oversleeps and misses the time of his morning rituals. The agitated sage threatens to banish Manasa to the hell for disobedient wives. The Sun steps in and placates the sage, praising him as a powerful sage, but Jaratkaru has made up his mind to abandon his wife. The god Brahma intervenes and states that it will be inappropriate to abandon her, unless he grants her a child. Jaratkaru touches Manasa's abdomen and impregnates her. Then he departs, foretelling that Manasa will give birth to a renowned sage. The Manasa Vijaya (1495) by Bipradas Pipilai, a devotional paean to Manasa from the Mangal-KƒÅvya genre, describes how Jaratkara (Jaratkaru) abandons his wife on their wedding night itself. Manasa is a daughter of the god Shiva, who is hated by Shiva's wife and her stepmother Chandi. Shiva marries Manasa to Jaratkara. Chandi does not want Manasa to have a happy married life and thus asks her to wear serpent ornaments on her wedding night. While Manasa sleeps in peace, Jaratkara stays awake in fear of the snakes. In the middle of the night, Chandi throws a frog in the room, which causes the snakes to hiss and swarm around the room in pursuit of the frog. A terrified Jaratkara runs away from the house and hides in a conch in the ocean. Further, he becomes scared of the snake goddess and refuses to stay with her. However, he spends a few nights with her and impregnates her and thus performs his \\"husbandly duty\\".McDaniel pp. 149-150 Little is told about the sage after his exit from Manasa's life and the main story. In due course, a son named Astika is born to the couple. Astika stops the sacrifice of Janamejaya and rescues the serpents. The ancestors reach heaven as Jaratkaru did procreate. The first telling in the Mahabharata says that after a long life, Jaratkaru dies and also attains heaven. ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Hindu sages Category:Characters in the Mahabharata ","title":"Jaratkaru"},{"id":"60252492","text":"Azovsky () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Razdorsky Selsoviet, Kamyzyaksky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

As a child, while his classmates spent their free time playing, Chaim went to the synagogue to study Torah, and to learn how to serve G-d. As a teenager, on Shabbat, he would climb into the pulpit and give sermons on the Torah portion (the parashah), on the laws related to Jewish festivities, and give on Musar (Jewish ethics). == Career == After becoming a Rabbi, HaKohen moved to the city of Safed. There he studied with the rabbi and kabbalist Chaim Vital for three years. From Safed, HaKohen moved to Aram Tsoba, located near Aleppo, Syria, where he settled permanently. He was elected rabbi, replacing Mordechai HaKohen, son-in-law of Shmuel Laniado (Baal HaKelim). Under Rabbi HaKohen Torah study flourished, even more than in Aleppo. New Talmudic schools and academies were established, and more benches were added to the synagogue. HaKohen served the Aleppo community as rabbi and head of the rabbinical court for decades. With exhaustive knowledge, he answered complex rabbinical questions, sometimes sent by members of distant Jewish communities. Eventually, he decided to organize his writings and publish books, especially his commentaries on Shulchan Aruch, the legal code that was written by his teacher's teacher, rabbi and kabbalist Joseph Karo. Rabbi HaKohen wrote many other works. These include his commentaries on the Song of Songs (Shir HaShirim), the Book of Lamentations, the Book of Ruth, the Book of Daniel, and many other manuscripts. The printing press had not yet arrived in Aleppo and books were reproduced by hand. The best printers of the time were in Venice, Italy, where half of European books were published during most of the 16th century. The first edition of the Babylonian Talmud was printed there, along with the first edition of Shulchan Aruch, by the rabbi and kabbalist Joseph Karo. Rabbi HaKohen sent his commentary on the Book of Esther to Venice. As time passed and the book did not appear, Rabbi HaKohen decided to travel to Venice, and personally oversee its printing. Together with his son they traveled by sea carrying all the Rabbi's manuscripts. His ship was attacked by Maltese pirates. As the pirates boarded the ship, HaKohen and his son jumped into the sea, but their books remained on the ship. The rabbi prayed to G-d, and asked him for help to retrieve his valuable books, or to help him write them again by heart. G-d granted the second request. Rabbi HaKohen spent several years in Italy, rewriting his lost books. The first book that he was able to print, with the help of Moses Zacuto, was entitled Torat Chacham (The Teaching of the Wise). This book was a collection of the rabbi's sermons on the weekly sections of the Torah. The book was published in Venice in 1654. His next book was Mekor Chaim (The Source of Life). This book is a commentary of Shulchan Aruch, consisting of several volumes. The first volumes were published in Venice, also in 1654. To print the second volume of his book Pitda, the rabbi travelled to Livorno, Italy, where he died in 1655. After his death, some of his pirated books were recovered. == Legacy == Rabbi Yosef Jaim David Azulai (Hida), in his chronicle book Shem HaGuedolim, states that he had in his hands HaKohen's manuscript Ateret Zahab, a commentary on the Book of Esther. Migdal David, a commentary on the Book of Ruth, was also found. The book was printed in Amsterdam in 1680 by an impostor who falsely claimed authorship.

After his death, in 1714, Vinkabnden was sold at auction. The buyer was Torsten Thorsen Hedeland, an innkeeper and bargeman. The 8-bay, timber-framed building was completely destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728. The site was 17.5 m wide and 54 m deep at the deepest place. ===After the Copenhagen Fire of 1728=== The house was soon rebuilt and now consisted of a building towards the street and an L-sjaped building to the west and north while the courtyard was open to the east (towards No. 18). Vinkanden was at some point renamed Dannebrog. Towards the end of the century other tenants in the complex included a joiner named Kaar√∏e, a furnituremaker named Fjellerup, a butcher's widow named Andersen, a tobacco manufacturer named Lind and a button maker named Rudolff. The building was again destroyed by fire if the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. ===After the Copenhagen Fire of 1795=== The current house at the site was built by Anton Christopher Wilcken (ca.1760-1816). in 1797-98. In 1809,. it was owned by merchant J. F. Stubs. The guesthouse was operated by Hans Madsen and the tenants were a shoemaker named Feinwaldt, a manager named Conrad, two joiners named Goetsche and Lehmann, a district physician named Jacobsen and a beer merchant named Nielsen. The names Rudolff, Conrad, Feinwaldt, Goetsche and Lehmann reflects the high number of German immingrants that had settled in Copenhagen during the 18th century. In 1844, the owner of the property was E.C. Fenger from Store Kongensgade. The tenants were an assessor, a volunteer in the Treasury (Rentekammeret)m a joiner, two merchants and the innkeeper. The building was in the 1860s owned by Fritz Dithmer. Urtekr√¶mmer C. L. Nielsen operated a shop in the basement and lived with his family on the first floor. J. F. Johansen, a pub owner and restaurateur, lived in the ground floor. His apartment was later taken over by D. C. Grandjean who operated a guesthouse in the rear wing. A joiner had his workshop on the second floor. A glazier and a house painter were based on the second and third floors of the side wing. N. F. Munch, a trading house, was in the 1870s based in the ground floor. A wholesaler named Trier and a lawyer (overretsprokurator) were tenants on the first and second floors. J. E. Felumb's piano factory J. E. Felumb, a piano maker, purchased the entire building in 1882 and converted it into a piano factory and piano shop. Emil Felumb had been born in 1842 as the son of a goldsmith. He was educated as a pianoforte builder in Copenhagen, London, Paris and Switzerland. In 1872, he developed a special piano that Niels W. Gade was very fond of. He then started his own company in Magstr√¶de which later moved to Vester Voldgade and then to the building in Vestergade. Iron and timber was stored and processed on the two lower floors. Four to five pianos left the factory every week in the period from 1882 to 1904. The daily operations were overseen by Felumb's nephew A. Theuerkauf. The courtyard with a sign advertising N. Eriksen's Guesthouse, 1014 The guesthouse continued its operations in part of the rear wing. A physician had his clinic on the first floor and a joiner who possibly worked for theb piano factory was based on the second floor. The grocery store was also still located in the basement. The physician on the first floor was eventually succeeded by two lawyers. The second floor was also taken over by a law firm and in the 1920s by Jens Tofts Frihavnen's coffee company. Sophus Schou operated a shirt and tie manufactory on the third floor. He later also rented the basement in the front wing. The company continued operations in the building until the 1970s. The piano factory sold the building after 1915. The new owner was Br√∏drene Justesen, a wholesaling company from Randersm which had established in Copenahgen in 1889. The company was also the owner of the neighbouring building at No. 18 and Studiestr√¶de 37. The factory space was let out to Br√∏drene Corell, a pipe factory. The basement was now turned into a wine store. A manufacturer of textile shoes, Thor, opened in the rear wing. It was later succeeded by a manufacturer of straw hats. A non-alcoholic restaurant was also operated in the building. Br√∏drene Justesen was based at the site until it was absorbed by Dagrofa in 1983. Minerva Reproduktioner, a manufacturer of silk prints, opened on the second floor in the A Building in circa 1950. They remained in the building at least until the 1970s. The next owner of the building was A/S Det k√∏benhavnske Ejendoms Societet. Ekstra-Bladet rented part of the third floor when nearby Politikens Hus became too small in the early 1990s. ==Architecture== The building is five bays wide. The three central bays are slightly recessed. A gateway in the east side of the building opens to a central courtyard. The westernmost bay is placed in an arched niche similar to that of the gateway to create an impression of summetry. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places. ==Ciltural references== In Ludvig Holberg's play ‚ÄùDen ellevte Junii‚Äù,, it is mentioned that it is possible to stay in the Dannebrog in Vestergade for 2 skilling a night. ==References== Category:Listed buildings and structures in Copenhagen Category:Neoclassical architecture in Copenhagen ","title":"Vestergade 20"},{"id":"60252708","text":"\\"Aankh Maarey\\" () is a Hindi-language song, originally composed by Viju Shah and sung by Kumar Sanu and Kavita Krishnamurthy for the 1996 Bollywood film Tere Mere Sapne, as picturized on Arshad Warsi and Simran.

It reached #20 on the U.S. pop chart in 1965. It was featured on their 1966 album Lies and is famous for often being mistaken for a Beatles track due to its similarities to their style and harmonies. The song does feature a few screams, and an ad-lib of \\"Yes it is\\", that is reminiscent of Paul McCartney, but does not feature a guitar solo having a similar sound to George Harrison's style of playing. The lyrics tell about a love relationship which has been destroyed by lies the girl has been telling. The man states how she is breaking his heart but, while she will end up the lonely one, he knows that one day he will find happiness with another. Here is what original Knickerbockers member Beau Charles said about the song's behind-the-scenes story: \\"We desperately tried to write something that sounded like the British Invasion'. We wrote 'Lies' in less than one half hour. We demo-ed it in New York.\\" After a Jerry Fuller inspired re-arrangement, the track was recorded at Sunset Sound in West Hollywood with Bruce Botnick as the Engineer. Things were not quite right, so the multi-track master was taken to Leon Russell's house in Hollywood Hills. Jerry Fuller knew Leon and \\"Leon had this great little studio - just a four track\\". The band recorded the vocals there and overdubbed a new guitar part that was recorded from a beat up old Fender guitar amp that gave the guitar sound a meaty, edgy feel\\".Retrieved June 4th,2019 ==Other versions== *The Ventures on their 1965 album Where the Action Is. *Nancy Sinatra on her 1966 album Boots. *The T-Bones on their 1966 album No Matter What Shape (Your Stomach's In). *Gary Lewis & the Playboys on their 1967 album Gary Lewis & the Playboys. *Lulu on her 1966 album From Lulu...with Love. *Styx on their 1974 album Man of Miracles. *Tarney/Spencer Band on their 1979 album Run for Your Life. *Linda Ronstadt on her 1982 album Get Closer. *The Delmonas on their 1985 album Dangerous Charms. *The Undead on their 1986 album Never Say Die! *The Landlords on their 1987 EP Our Favorite Songs! *The Basement Wall on their 1993 compilation album There Goes the Neighborhood!

The church has been a Grade I listed building since 1967 and comes under the Diocese of Canterbury. The church stands on a hill and its tower commands impressive views of the surrounding countryside. For this reason it was a major surveying point in the Anglo-French Survey (1784‚Äì1790) to measure the precise distance and relationship between the Paris Observatory and the Royal Greenwich Observatory, supervised by General William Roy. ==History== View down the nave towards the east William Campion (1640‚Äì1702) The first mention we have of a church at Goudhurst is in 1119 when Robert de Crevecoeur gave his church at Goudhurst to Leeds Priory at Leeds in Kent. This St Mary‚Äôs church would have been a small building probably covering the site of the present South chapel and part of the South aisle. At this time the monks at Combwell Priory acted as chaplains. It was not until about 1300 that one of them signed himself Peter ‚Äì the Vicar.The Nation's Favourite Churches, Andrew BarrSt. Mary's Church ‚Äì The Goudhurst & Kilndown Local History Society ==Design== A large 13th-century sandstone church with aisles to the naves and side chapels in the chancel, the church has been altered and restored many times over the centuries. The 115 feet tall spire and the tower were destroyed by lightning in 1637. In 1638 three London masons Edmund Kinsman, James Holman and John Young rebuilt the west tower in a truncated Classical/Gothic style.Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600‚Äì1840, 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Edmund Kinsman\\", \\"John Young\\". The clock face is early 20th- century. Inside there is simple arched piscina and a hollow chamfered ambry in the largely 19th-century chancel (built based on excavations made during the Victorian restoration) which has a fine 19th-century altar rail with iron- twist uprights to the Sanctuary. Attached to the tower and the vestry is a spear-head railed enclosed area for footstones to the Bathurst family. The nave is of five-bay arcades while the rood screens to the North and South chapels incorporate 14th or 15th-century panelling with the upper section of the screen to the South chapel carved as a memorial to the First World War. The pulpit with its brass candlesticks and book rest stands on an octagonal stone base and steps with iron and brass rails. The body of the pulpit is 13th-century with figures of the apostles and evangelical symbols carved in relief. The brass lectern is 19th-century while the font in the nave has a 19th-century bowl with evangelical symbols and stands on a medieval (probably 15th-century) base. Another medieval bowl is located in the north aisle decorated with arcading and crosses. From 1865 to 1870 the church was restored by the architects William Slater and Richard Carpenter, the alterations being supervised by Ewan Christian. A further restoration by Carpenter alone in 1877 included the building of a vestry and a large part of the South aisle. The church contains a remarkable painted wood and gesso effigy to Sir Alexander Culpeper (d.1537) and his wife Constance. ==Monuments== Memorial to William and Rachel Campion In the north chapel are monuments to Edmond Roberts (died 1627), Richard Pack (died 1838) and Edward Lewis Miller (1831‚Äì1846), who died in a fall from a cliff on the Isle of Wight.

The Lenten sacrifice refers to a pleasure or luxury that Christians (especially Anglicans, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Moravians and the Reformed) give up for the liturgical season of Lent, which starts on Ash Wednesday annually. The tradition of the Lenten sacrifice has its roots in Jesus fasting for forty days in the Jud√¶n desert. When Lent is over and Easter Sunday arrives, the faithful are able to indulge in what they sacrificed during the Lenten season. Common Lenten sacrifices include giving up chocolate, soft drinks, and sweets. Some Christians choose to practice temperance throughout the Lenten season, thus giving up alcoholic beverages; in light of this, temperance drinks experience a surge of popularity during the Lenten season. Others, on the first day of Lent, pledge to give up sinful behaviours, such as swearing, and hope to permanently rid themselves of these habits even after the arrival of Eastertide. While making a Lenten sacrifice, it is customary for Christians to pray for strength to keep it; many often wish others for doing so as well, e.g. \\"May God bless your Lenten sacrifice.\\" Many Christians sacrifice the eating of meat and commit to Christian vegetarianism for the entire Lenten season. It is commonplace for Anglican, Methodist, and Roman Catholic Christians to observe the Friday Fast throughout Lent, which includes abstaining from meat on the Fridays of Lent. Christian clergy, both Roman Catholic and Methodist, have encouraged the faithful not to give up social media for Lent as they believe that Christians can use social media for evangelism. In addition to making their Lenten sacrifice, many Christians choose to add a Lenten spiritual discipline, such as reading a daily devotional or praying through a Lenten calendar, to draw themselves nearer to God. == See also == *Black Fast *Christian Vegetarian Association *Pioneer Total Abstinence Association == References == == External links == *Could you go alcohol-free for Lent? - The United Methodist Church *Veg for Lent - Christian Vegetarian Association *Some Christians Give Up Alcohol for Lent - The Christian Post *Lenten Devotions - Lutheran Hour Ministries *After Giving up Alcohol, I‚Äôm Addicted to Lent - Sojourners *102 Things You Should Really Give Up For Lent - Life Teen Category:Christian behaviour and experience Category:Christian fasting Category:Lent ","title":"Lenten sacrifice"},{"id":"60252945","text":"Decaisnea paradoxa, or blue sausage fruit, is a member of the family Lardizabalaceae, and is native to Nepal, Tibet and China.

It is part of the Scottish Episcopal Church, under the governance of the United Diocese of Moray, Ross and Caithness. Designated as a category A listed building, it was originally built in the 1830s by Archibald Simpson under the patronage of the last Duchess of Gordon. Extensively renovated by Alexander Ross in the 1870s, it features the largest collection of Pre-Raphaelite stained glass windows in Scotland. ==History== The church was built at a cost of ¬£900 from 1832 to 1834, according to a design by the noted Scottish architect Archibald Simpson, who was responsible for the construction of many of the notable buildings in nearby Aberdeen. The building was paid for by Elizabeth Brodie, wife of the fifth Duke of Gordon. Gordon Castle, which was the principal seat of the Dukes of Gordon, is near Fochabers, but only partly survives. The first floor chapel was dedicated on 12 August 1834, some three months after a school had opened on the ground floor of the building, in the space that was later to become the parsonage. Elizabeth Brodie was an Episcopalian at the time the church was built, but since she was born in London and her household, servants and many of her visitors were from England, she favoured services that followed the English Book of Common Prayer over the Scottish Episcopal liturgy. Controversies around this, and over whether it should be subject to the 'government and inspection' of the Scottish church, eventually resulted in Brodie deciding to close the church in 1848. Local Episcopalians, now without a place to worship and concerned that the building should fall into disrepair, petitioned her in 1852 to allow them use of the building again. Brodie, who by this time had joined the Free Church of Scotland, agreed to make the church and school over to her Episcopalian nephew, Charles Gordon-Lennox, the Duke of Richmond, and the church was reopened. Gordon-Lennox was succeeded by his son (also Charles) in 1860, who commissioned substantial improvements and renovations to the building by Alexander Ross, including the installation of a hammerbeam roof. The building remained in the hands of the Gordon-Lennox family until 1937, when it was sold by the ninth Duke to the Crown Estate. Worship in the building was suspended during the second world war, and at one point troops were billeted within it; after the war, the Crown Estate considered selling it to house a cinema, but the congregation managed to raise the funds to purchase the building in 1950, and its use as a place of worship recommenced. The building was again subject to renovation work from 2008, when all its windows were removed for safekeeping and restoration during the construction of a bypass road nearby. They were reinstalled and the building reopened in 2012. ==Design== The building is a two-level gothic design, with the parsonage (originally a school) on the ground floor and the chapel itself on the floor above that. It is oriented north-south, with the main entrance, leading onto Castle Street, on the south end which is faced with ashlar sandstone, while the rest of the building is harled. A projection in the north-west corner was originally a private entrance for the Gordon family. The chapel boasts the largest collection of Pre-Raphaelite stained glass windows in Scotland, produced by Morris and Co, some designed by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. These include depictions of the Crucifixion (1874), Saint Cecilia (1879), Saint Ursula (1887), the archangel Raphael (1902), Christ as the Good Shepherd (1903) and the archangel Michael (1914). The St Michael window is dedicated to Bernard Charles Gordon-Lennox, third son of the seventh Duke of Richmond, who was killed in fighting near Ypres in November 2014, aged 36, during the First World War. ==Current usage== The church is still an active place of worship, and is part of the Diocese of Moray, Ross and Caithness of the Scottish Episcopal Church, with weekly services celebrated by Rev Michael Last. The chapel is accessed by a flight of stairs, but services are relayed by CCTV to the chapel room on the ground floor to allow people with mobility issues to partake in them. == References == == External links == * Gordon Chapel website Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Scotland Category:Episcopal church buildings in Scotland Category:Churches in Moray Category:Category A listed buildings in Moray Category:Listed churches in Scotland ","title":"Gordon Chapel"},{"id":"60253171","text":"Juda Na Hona (previously titled Parwarish) is a 2019 Pakistani television series.

Blinn was a native of Providence, Rhode Island, and began his career apprenticed first to a tailor and then to a jeweler in that city. In 1838 he joined the Shaker community in Canterbury, New Hampshire, where he would remain for the rest of his life. In 1841 he became boys' caretaker, a job he was forced to give up in 1849 when he was assigned to the print shop. Soon he returned to the caretaker position, only to leave it in 1852 upon his appointment as Second Elder under Robert Fowle. Three months later he became a member of the Ministry as second to Elder Abraham Perkins. He became First Elder of the Church Family in November 1865, and took charge of the public meeting in 1865, remaining in that role until public meeting at Canterbury ceased in 1889. During his life Blinn occupied various roles including printer, typesetter, publisher, writer, teacher, beekeeper, dentist, tailor, tinware maker and repairer, and cabinetmaker. He edited the Shaker Society's monthly journal, The Manifesto, and chronicled the community's history. He was also a maker of illustrated maps, although only three examples are known from his hand. They depict Canterbury and two communities in New York, Watervliet and New Lebanon, and are counted among the most important of their type. The image of Canterbury, made in 1848, is the largest and most elaborate of all such Shaker maps at nearly seven feet in length. As a printer he produced, among other things, a pair of miniature books for children, The Little Instructor and Dew Drops of Wisdom. He also edited two hymnals, A Sacred Repository of Anthems and Hymns of 1852 and A Collection of Hymns and Anthems Adapted to Public Worship of 1892. Blinn was a mentor to Cora Helena Sarle in her early years at Canterbury, and was responsible for introducing her to the art of botanical illustration. Blinn's 1839 map of New Lebanon is currently owned by the American Folk Art Museum. Several pieces of his cabinetry survive as well, including a sewing desk of about 1870, a dining table, a slant-front desk, and a large secretary, among other surviving pieces. Several items by his hand, including copies of the miniature books, are in the collection of the Mount Lebanon. ==References== Category:1824 births Category:1905 deaths Category:American male painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:19th-century American male writers Category:19th-century American non-fiction writers Category:Writers from Providence, Rhode Island Category:People from Canterbury, New Hampshire Category:Writers from New Hampshire Category:Artists from Providence, Rhode Island Category:Painters from New Hampshire Category:Religious leaders from Rhode Island Category:Religious leaders from New Hampshire Category:Painters from Rhode Island Category:Shaker members ","title":"Henry Clay Blinn"},{"id":"60253485","text":"The Park Ridge Youth Campus, or just The Youth Campus, was a school and orphanage in Park Ridge, Illinois from 1908 to 2012. The campus is on the National Register of Historic Places as the Illinois Industrial School for Girls, and was also known as the Park Ridge School for Girls. The campus is now Prospect Park and owned by the Park Ridge Park District. ==History== ===Evanston=== The Youth Campus traced its foundation to 1877 as the Industrial School for Girls Also . in what was then South Evanston, Illinois. The organization received its charter on January 9 and opened on November 1 in a building formerly used as a soldiers' home, with of land. It was the first such school for girls in Illinois. In 1879, Illinois General Assembly passed a general law to allow industrial schools for girls, and on October 1, 1879, the school reorganized with a corporate charter under the new law. An 1882 lawsuit challenged the constitutionality of such schools in Illinois, but the court ruled in favor of the school's existence, judging it to be \\"of the same character\\" as the power of parens patriae already in the common law, and that the school was not a prison and committing a child to the school was not imprisonment. After some complaints of mismanagement in 1894 and 1895, Illinois governor John P. Altgeld attempted to discharge all 105 girls, but they refused to leave. As early as 1903 there were calls to move and reorganize the school on the \\"cottage plan\\": for example by a T.H. MacQuerary, of the Chicago Parental School, in the American Journal of Sociology. In 1906, a scandal over placement of some girls into poor homes, and the mismanagement of money, caused a change in leadership. After the directors were reorganized, Jane Addams served on the school's board of directors. In early 1907, the Board of Directors announced that they planned to leave Evanston and relocate to a new rural location in Park Ridge. With 125 girls and mounting financial difficulties, the school arranged for a charity baseball game that included a semi-professional team run by Cap Anson to be played at West Side Park. ===Park Ridge=== The facility was relocated to Park Ridge in 1908 and renamed the Park Ridge School for Girls in 1913. Several of the buildings were funded by Julius Rosenwald, and were designed by Holabird & Roche, the same firm which designed the Chicago Board of Trade Building and Soldier Field. Eight of the campus buildings are contributing elements of the campus' listing on the National Register of Historic Places. When boys were first admitted in 1980, the facility was renamed the Park Ridge Youth Campus, before being simply renamed The Youth Campus in the 1990s. By the 2011 the school services were being provided by Maine Township High School District 207. Solomon Cottage in 2012 ===After school=== The Youth Campus closed in the summer of 2012. The organization merged into the existing Chicago not-for-profit organization Children's Home + Aid. The campus itself was split into parcels, with plans to sell the north part, approximately 60%, to Mark Elliott Corporation for housing development, and the south part, approximately 40%, to the Park Ridge Recreation and Park District for $6.4 million. The Park District voters approved a referendum in April 2013 for a $13.2 million bond for the purchase and conversion to a park. The Park District's property was re-opened as Prospect Park in May 2016. Except for Emery Cottage, Solomon Cottage, and Wohlers Hall, the Park District had the campus buildings torn down in March 2015; in exchange for allowing demolition, the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency required that the demolished buildings be recorded with architectural details, that Solomon Cottage and Wohlers Hall be restored, and that Emery Cottage also remain preserved. The Solomon Cottage, built in 1908, was leased on a long-term basis to the Park Ridge Historical Society in 2016, and renovated in 2017 to become the historical society's Park Ridge History Center. ==References== ==External links== * -- former official site ** * Park Ridge History Center -- official website of the Park Ridge Historical Society located on campus site * Prospect Park -- park summary and amenities list on the Park Ridge Park District website * Park Ridge School for Girls at the Ryerson & Burnham Archives of the Art Institute of Chicago -- photographs Category:1877 establishments in Illinois Category:1900s architecture in the United States Category:2012 disestablishments in Illinois Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1908 Category:Campuses Category:Defunct schools in Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cook County, Illinois Category:Orphanages in the United States Category:Park Ridge, Illinois Category:Parks in Cook County, Illinois Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois ","title":"Park Ridge Youth Campus"},{"id":"60253489","text":"Alice Garcia Reyes (born October 14, 1942) is a Filipina dancer, choreographer, teacher, director and producer. The founder (together with Eddie Elejar) of Ballet Philippines, she received last June 20, 2014 from President Aquino the highest award in the Arts, National Artist of the Philippines. She was chiefly responsible in popularizing contemporary dance with the Alice Reyes Dance Company which staged the first modern dance concert at the Cultural Center of the Philippines Main Theater on February, 1970. It was this company that later became Ballet Philippines. She is best known for \\"Bungkos Suite\\", \\"Carmen\\", \\"Carmina Burana\\", \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", \\"Rama Hari\\", \\"Cinderella\\", \\"Amada\\", \\"Itim-Asu\\", and \\"Tales of the Manuvu\\"‚Äîall nuanced with Filipino culture, gesture and grace. ==Early life and education== Reyes was born in October 1942. At a very young age, Reyes took up lessons in classical ballet under Rosalia Merino while studying at Maryknoll College where she completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Foreign Services. Soon after, she took post-graduate studies at Ateneo de Manila University. She further trained under the guidance of Leonor Orosa Goquingco and Ricardo Casell of the Philippine Women's University (PWU). In addition, she took up folk dance at the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company. Thinking of deepening her professional studies, she went to America and enrolled in formal courses in modern dance and jazz. In New York, she took the opportunity to take more formal studies at Sarah Lawrence College in Westchester County, New York. ==First marriage and divorce== Reyes was once married to Dick Upton, the current treasurer of Ballet Philippines, but they divorced in 1982. Upton later came out as gay and married his partner Elmer. ==Retirement== Reyes retired from Ballet Philippines in 1985 but still served as its artistic director until 1989. Her decision was motivated mainly by her desire to live with her second husband Ted Van Doorn and their family in California. She started using her married name, Alicia Van Doorn, when credited for her artistic efforts during this time. She resumed using her maiden name after officially becoming a National Artist. After Reyes left, Ballet Philippines went through a string of artistic directors, most notably Paul Alexander Morales, who served for more than 8 years, and Alan Hineline, a choreographer and dancer who was born in Franklin, Ohio but is now based in New York. Hineline also served chief operating officers of Ballet Philippines, overseeing a complete rebranding of the organization. ==Return to Ballet Philippines== In 2017, Reyes was brought back on as the artistic director of Ballet Philippines (BP), just in time for the company‚Äôs 50th year anniversary. Her permanent residence was still in the US so she flew in and out of the Philippines for her occupation as artistic director. ==BP exit and controversy== On February 6, 2020 the board of trustees of BP concluded a months-long search for a new artistic director and decided to go with renowned Russian ballet dancer Mikhail \\"Misha\\" Martynyuk. He was favored by the BP board over a handful of other candidates, including two who were personally endorsed by Reyes herself. These were Adam Sage, an American who had danced with BP in the late 1970's and came back as associate artistic director in 2017, and Ronelson Yadao, a dancer and choreographer who was being groomed by Reyes as the next associate artistic director for Sage. The two were not able to make it on the day of their interviews with BP for the artistic director position because of prior commitments and were denied to reschedule. Reyes learned of Martynyuk's appointment after the BP board issued a circular and shared Martynyuk's credentials on an internal bulletin board. At this time, Reyes wrote to the board, congratulating the search committee on their decision. She added that she was looking forward to meeting her successor. As news of Martynyuk's appointment and Reyes's subsequent replacement came out, along with the notion that it caught her off guard, various individuals expressed disapproval online and called for the appointment to be revoked.

The album was recorded inside Blackburn Castle in New South Wales over the first half of 2010, and was produced with the help of Burke Reid. Its minimal, \\"austere\\" and \\"meandering\\" acoustic songs instrumentally consist entirely of Liddiard's guitar-playing, and are topped with his versatile and heavily-accented vocals. Exploring themes such as isolation, jealousy, guilt, colonialism, wartime collaborationism, radicalism and many others, its detailed, narrative-based lyrics have been characterized as \\"dark and grinding\\", and are set in various periods of time as well as locations. Released through Shock Records and ATP Recordings, the album received critical acclaim from the Australian press, and (despite being scant) a very favourable critical reception outside of Australia. Its closing track \\"The Radicalisation of D\\", in particular, garnered a lot of praise and has been called the album's magnum opus. The album earned Liddiard a nomination for an ARIA Award for Best Male Artist at the 25th ARIA Music Awards, and was itself nominated for the Australian Music Prize. ==Content== === Style === Daniel Baker of The Quietus described the album as \\"a deceptive subversion of rockist dogma.\\" He describes the tracks as \\"sprawling venom inflected dioramas existent in their own haunted ecology.\\" \\"With his first solo album,\\" wrote Bernard Zuel of Sydney Morning Herald, \\"Liddiard puts aside the physical presence of the Drones, forgoing that capacity for movement as well as variation in favour of none-more-bare presentations of voice and guitar. These are in effect spoken-word pieces with minimalist backing or, given their lyricism and focus, books on tape \\"read\\" by a man whose nasally, insistent voice is never going to be mistaken for that of a choir boy.\\" Tim Dunlop of Crikey characterized it as \\"dark and grinding [...] Strange Tourist consists of [...] long songs with clever lyrics documenting the political and the personal.\\" \\"Liddiard's characters and their world are invoked with such eye for nuance and detail [...]\\" writes Zuel, \\"that you feel covered in the tangy sweat of fear or frozen in the same miasma of indecision and enervation as his protagonists.\\" Liddiard's vocals have been described as a \\"snarling Ocka drawl [...] He sings with a half-spoken, often crowded cadence, elongating or truncating words and hinting at hidden meanings through sudden flights of possessed semi-wails. While the music remains crystalline and austere in its unhurried strums and cliff edge teetering, Liddiard's voice is capable of a more satisfying versatility\\". Musically, Everett True wrote that the music reminded him of Joseph Spence's \\"killer early Folkway [sic] Recordings\\" and \\"John Fahey's more muted work\\", noting also that Liddiard had been listening to Toumani Diabat√© around the time that the album was made. A Sputnikmusic staff reviewer compared the \\"collection of stripped-back, meandering acoustic songs\\" to \\"post-Red House Painters Mark Kozelek\\", albeit \\"decidedly more abrasive and more dogmatic\\", with Liddiard presenting himself \\"as a thoughtful, meditative minstrel ‚Äì offering his subjects the space they needed to go about their rituals unencumbered by a scorning, the space to make their mistakes freely (‚ÄúI swear I did not know, you lay with dogs, you catch their fleas‚Äù). And on the off chance he did inject himself into the narrative, he was just as flawed as the flaw itself, just as complicit in pushing the cart past the point of no return.\\" === Songs === \\"The Radicalisation of D\\" is based on the life of David Hicks The track \\"Blondin Makes an Omelette\\" is \\"an existential rumination on the nature of the public's adoration for Charles Blondin, [...] [w]ritten from the perspective of his faithful assistant\\". It has been described as \\"an often ambiguous interpretation of the psychology of those who gawk at risk takers [...] [j]ust enough information is withheld yet it's tenderly methodical and filled with enough pathos for it not to collapse under the weight of didacticism.\\" Zuel notes a \\"carny bitterness\\" in the track. In an interview with Polaroids Of Androids, Liddiard stated that the song was a metaphor for colonial inferiority, where \\"Blondin is the colonizer and the guy complaining is the colony.\\" \\"You Sure Ain't Mine Now\\" shows \\"Liddiard's voice [as being] capable of a more satisfying versatility [...] during which he delivers the refrain in a canine falsetto.\\" The \\"arresting\\" title track features \\"fizzing rough hewn picking and yearningly apocalyptic imagery\\" and has been singled out as being the closest to Liddiard's work with The Drones. The lyrics describe \\"one man's experiences with destitution, smack, war, arrest and Scientology\\" whilst the track itself has been described as \\"Stilnox-and-speed-jacked\\". \\"The Collaborator\\" highlights the albums \\"once removed, personalized microcosms of anger [...] with a brusque politicisation\\" where the \\"lurking paranoia of [a] wartime populous attempting to unearth evidence of those who aided the invaders, accusations and defensive rebuttals crowed back and forth\\" is \\"carried along by Liddiard's flinty, nasal declamations.\\" The lyrics of the song are set in 1941 France and it \\"explores decidedly non-pop territory of accommodation and justification, of guilt and evasion and anger\\". \\"Did She Scare All Your Friends Away\\" is \\"not much less intense [...] weakness is paramount in a man who had \\"retired into a well of sweet vermouth\\", a rorting defence lawyer who's a \\"liberating angel with a clothes peg on his nose\\" or the narrator, whose explanations are rough and double-edged.\\" The final track, \\"The Radicalisation of D\\" is based on the life of David Hicks with several details incorporated from Liddiard's own childhood. Characterized as a bildungsroman, it has been called \\"a superbly engaging quarter of an hour\\" and \\"the album's magnum opus\\". The song \\"brims with a novelist's attention to character-forming minutiae, winding through a life of oppression, abuse, and social ostracisation, culminating in a damning cultural cadence as Liddiard howls over and over 'you are living in a nightmare'.\\" \\"The grim horror of what is about to unfold,\\" writes Parker, \\"[is] humanized implicitly by Liddiard's unhurried use of authentic Australian motifs (hills hoists, ging's). It's a piece of songwriting that genuinely attempts to understand why some people become susceptible to extremism. More uncompromisingly, it suggests that they may have a point.\\" \\"[T]he vast expanse of the\\" song's \\"perspective on a home-grown terrorist burns you.\\" Manish Agarwal of Mojo finds Liddiard's \\"demand[s]\\" of \\"the listener's full attention\\" to be rewarded \\"most notably\\" on this track, which he describes as \\"feel[ing] all too real\\". ==Release== The album was released on CD through Shock Records in 2010, and on both CD and double LP through ATP Recordings in 2011. The latter label released the album in the UK. ===Touring=== Shortly after the album's release, Liddiard embarked on a solo Australian tour. The Sydney Morning Herald observed that the shows \\"sometimes went on until Liddiard ran out of material or the venue turned on the lights\\". In March the following year, he'd embarked on another 12-date national solo tour supported by Dan Kelly, and proceeded to play a few dates around Europe. According to Reverb, these performances were also very well-received, noting that most of the shows on the East coast had sold out. ===Videos=== Videos were made for different versions of both the title track and \\"Blondin Makes an Omelette\\", and were released on YouTube through ATP Recordings' channel. ===Reissues=== In 2017, Poison City Records reissued the album as a double LP. In a Reddit AMA session held by Tropical Fuck Storm in April 2020, Liddiard stated his plan to reissue the album again towards the end of the year \\"coz theres fuk [sic] all else to do\\" due to the Coronavirus pandemic. ==Reception== ===National=== The album was acclaimed by many Australian critics. The Age, naming it their \\"Album of the Month\\", compared Liddiard to Paul Kelly and Don Walker and called the album \\"really exceptional\\".The Age, September 2010 issue Rolling Stone Australia called the album his \\"bleak solo masterpiece\\" and compared it to a Cormac McCarthy novel in that it \\"lingers long after the final note has been played\\". Sydney Morning Herald called the album \\"compelling\\" and \\"[s]omething very special.\\" Conversely, an article by Richard Guilliatt for The Monthly criticizing the modern \\"troubadour\\" songwriter (other examples included Will Oldham, Bill Callahan and Keaton Henson) picked the reception to the album as an example of the \\"unseemly [,] [...] profligate doling out of four-star reviews by rock critics, who, as a breed, are notoriously susceptible to any songwriter who brings a whiff of literary cred to their disreputable world.\\" He writes of \\"The Radicalisation of D\\": \\"it doesn't actually have a chorus, or a tune to speak of. In an earlier era, some porcine record exec would no doubt have demanded that Liddiard go back and write a couple of songs for FM radio. I'm beginning to miss those days.\\" ===International=== The album also received very positive reviews from critics in Europe, where it was released in the UK through ATP Recordings. Mojo called the album \\"[s]uperlative\\", writing that it \\"reveals [...] [The Drone's] distinctively accented singer/guitarist [to be] just as potent in acoustic settings\\". The Quietus writes that despite the album not being \\"totally immersive\\" (citing the track \\"Did She Scare All Your Friends Away\\" as \\"cumbersome\\") and that the record \\"requires patience, demands concentration\\", the \\"mercurial\\" and \\"magnificent\\" \\"The Radicalisation of D\\" \\"more than justifies those efforts.\\" Greil Marcus, writing for The Believer, called the album \\"over an hour's worth of a man sitting in a room, hitting notes on an acoustic guitar, meandering through tales of one defeat after another, with alcohol leaving tracks on the songs like a snail. [...] Here, in a quiet, artless, shamed, constricted way, a person emerges: a fictional construction, someone without a flicker of belief or, for that matter, interest in redemption, cure, or another life, against all odds, especially across the more than sixteen minutes of ‚ÄúThe Radicalisation Of D,‚Äù the final track, he makes you want to know what happens next.\\" Muzikalia called it \\"a unique album\\" that could appeal to listeners who may not be familiar with The Drones, praising Liddiard's songwriting talent & \\"strange\\" guitar-playing style. A more mixed response came from British journalist Everett True, who reviewed the album for the Australian magazine Mess+Noise. He compared the album unfavorably to Liddiard's work with The Drones (\\"Australia's greatest fucking rock band living [...]\\") and wrote that the songs \\"are not Drones songs. [...] These songs are Gareth Liddiard songs.\\" He criticized the length of the songs as being \\"about five minutes too long\\", the lack of variety in them, and whilst he praised the lyrics, he criticized the music as being \\"rambling, unfocused, the guitar all plucked arpeggios and breaks for reflection, but not in a meaningful way\\", using the track \\"Blondin Makes an Omelette\\" as an example of the latter two. Despite this, he praised \\"The Radicalisation of D\\", \\"which has dynamics, and power, and the odd scream, and pretty much everything else you'd expect from The Drones‚Äô frontman\\", as \\"16 minutes of genius that gradually sucks you in until you're tightly bound to what's unfolding in front of your ears [...]\\". ===Awards=== The album earned Liddiard a nomination for an ARIA Award for Best Male Artist at the 25th ARIA Music Awards. In response to the nomination, Liddiard stated: \\"It's just for wankers, snorting coke and getting drunk. It's just not on my radar and I'm just not interested. The ARIAs don't really mean anything to me.\\" The album was also nominated for the Australian Music Prize of 2010 (losing out to Bliss Release by Cloud Control), making it the fourth project involving Liddiard to have been nominated for the prize since its inception. ==Legacy== ===Accolades=== In November and December 2019 respectively, Junkee included the album on two different lists: \\"The 25 Most Underrated Albums Of The Decade\\" and \\"The 50 Best Australian Albums Of The Decade\\". The entry for the former reads as follows: \\"A Gareth Liddiard acoustic record almost seems like a contradiction in terms ‚Äî this is a man who has spent his career wielding instruments like broken bottles in a bar fight. But Strange Tourist, his singularly inspired solo record, has all the power and energy of his electric work. ‚ÄòBlondin Makes An Omlette‚Äô, a gnostic story of wire-walkers and alcoholics, might be the best thing that he's ever done.\\" The following year, Double J included \\"The Radicalisation of D\\" on their list \\"13 of the best long songs ever recorded\\", calling it \\"[c]hilling, masterful songwriting.\\" ===Influence=== Artist Jason Benjamin - whose oil-on-linen portrait of Liddiard titled It‚Äôs not all Henry bloody Lawson was one of the finalists for the 2011 Archibald Prize \\\\- praised the album as being \\"fantastic\\" & claimed that he'd listened to it \\"over and over\\" on his way down to Liddiard's home in Havilah, New South Wales to make the painting. Rob Snarski (lead guitarist/vocalist and founding member of The Blackeyed Susans and Chad's Tree) cited the album as an inspiration on his solo album Sparrow And Swan, commenting that \\"[h]e really lifted the bar on songwriting for Australian singer-songwriters.\\" In an interview with Short List, British actor George MacKay stated that both the album and Liddiard himself were a big inspiration for his titular role in the 2019 film True History of the Kelly Gang \\"in terms of voice and look\\". ‚ÄúHe did this one solo album called ‚ÄòStrange Tourist‚Äô\\" he continued, \\"which is him and an acoustic guitar and there's these kinds of noodling poems of songs. His way of talking is very easy, very cool, but he sits back. That's what we wanted with this version of Ned.

ETA killed him on November 9, 1978, in the town of Anzuola. He was married, and he had three children. === Murder === Luis Candendo was killed on his way home. His spouse used to give him his lunch outside of their home. The murder occurred while she was delivering the food. A terrorist started to shot from the right side of the windshield. At that moment, Luis Candendo tried to escape while his spouse took refuge inside the home's doorway. When he tried to open the door of the vehicle, a second guy shot against him. Both individuals immediately run away. Eight of the shoots reached the body of Luis Candendo. The investigators found out that the vehicle used to commit the attack was an orange-pink Simca 120. The car was stolen at gunpoint near the football ground of the same locality that had placed the attack, and it was later found in Vergara. The owner of the car was told to not advise the police until 22:00 p.m. Luis Candendo was the first attack against UCD's militant. Subsequently, other militants of the same formation would be murdered, abducted or would be wounded by ETA's attack. ETA's military claimed this murder two days later through a release. In this statement, the terrorist group accused Luis of being a confident and collaborator of the repressive forces of Basque Country. There is no evidence of the existence of any condemnation for this attack. According to the Ministry of Peace and Coexistence of the Basque Government, the procedural status of the offence is in provisional dismissal. == References == * MERINO, A., CHAPA, A., Ra√≠ces de Libertad. pp. 17‚Äì23.

The terrorist organization ETA murdered Luis Mar√≠a on September 29, 1979. == Biography == Luis Uriarte Mar√≠a Alzaa, native of Durango, but resident in Vedia was murdered on September 29, 1979, when he was 55 years old. He was married and had three kids. He had been mayor of Vedia for 11 years and Provincial Deputy for Vizcaya. He was one of the founding members of Alianza Popular in Biscay and vocal in their first Board of Directors. At the time of his murder, he had resumed his work as a manager in a few workshops. === Murder === On Saturday, September 29, 1979, Luis Mar√≠a Uriarte came out of his home, the Caser√≠o Ibarra of Vedia, heading to his job. It was 8 a.m. when Luis Maria read the newspaper in his vehicle parked in front of the shop before he began the workday. At that moment, two members of ETA left the stairs located metres away and approached the car, a meter and a half of it, they fired two- shot of a gun and, later, a burst of a machine gun. As a result of the shooting, Luis Mar√≠a Uriarte fell wounded in the car. An employee of the workshop and several passers-by came to his aid and requested an ambulance. He was transferred to the Hospital in a very critical condition. Luis Mar√≠a received nine bullet impacts in different parts of the body: two in the arm, two in the chest, three in the stomach, one in the leg and another one in the testicles. The Guardia Civil would find eleven caps 9 mm calibre bullet parabellum, although it is estimated that the two ETA's members made 20 shots. Luis Maria underwent surgery for more than 5 hours in the Hospital. He died on October 5 at 9 a.m. The autopsy concluded that he died by a traumatic shock as a result of the shots received during the attack. In addition to the two terrorists who were directly against Luis Maria there was a third person who awaited them in a yellow Renault vehicle. They scaped towards Amorebieta. The car used by ETA was stolen in Galdakao. The individuals who stole the car were not using a mask to cover their faces. They approached the priest who was driving the car around 6:30 a.m. on the same day of the attack. The priest was native of Amorebieta, who worked as a sales promoter of Egin newspaper. The Court of the first instance and instruction No. 1 of Durango decreed the provisional dismissal of these proceedings on December 20, 1979, due to lack of evidence. As for the authorship, the military branch of ETA claimed it on October 2, 1979. == References == * MERINO, A., CHAPA, A., Ra√≠ces de Libertad. pp. 43‚Äì48.

The battle took place from 13 to 18 February 1951 north of the South Korean town of Wonju. While the Korean People's Army (KPA) achieved some initial successes, their attacks petered out in the face of strong UN defences and as their supply lines became overstretched and by 18 February they had begun to withdraw across the entire front. ==Background== As UN forces reeled under the attack on Hoengsong by the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) XIII Army Group and KPA V Corps, on 12 February U.S. X Corps commander General Edward Almond met with Eighth Army commander General Matthew Ridgway and advised him that he planned to give up Hoengsong and defend Wonju. His formal order issued late in the day called for the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, with the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team attached, to defend a long line which from an anchor on the west at Chip‚Äôyong- ni stretched out to the southeast and east, passing north of Wonju and continuing beyond the town. In the right portion of the Corps' sector, the ROK 3rd and 5th Infantry Divisions were to stand between Route 29 and the Corps' east boundary some farther north. Placing the South Koreans on this forward line would tie the X Corps to the left of the ROK III Corps, whose line now bulged out to the north far beyond the X Corps front. To back up the South Koreans and secure the Corps' east flank in depth, the 31st Infantry Regiment of General Ferenbaugh‚Äôs 7th Infantry Division was to occupy positions at Todon-ni, a road junction below Pyongchang. Ferenbaugh's 32nd Infantry Regiment, still holding positions between Chech‚Äôon and Yongwol, would lend further depth, and the 17th Infantry Regiment, now scheduled to assemble in Corps reserve near Wonju, could be committed to help. To improve control, Almond requested that the ROK I Corps headquarters be attached to X Corps to take charge of the ROK 3rd and 5th Divisions. General Kim Hong-il and his staff, by virtue of past service under Almond in northeastern Korea, were experienced in joint operations and were well acquainted with the X Corps staff. Ridgway approved. He arranged to have General Kim and a partial staff flown into the X Corps sector on the 13th and to have Kim's remaining staff follow by truck. The ROK Capital Division, in the meantime, was to pass to ROK III Corps control. ==Battle== Along the northwestern portion of the Wonju defenses, just inside the corner position of the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, PVA coming out of the Hoengsong area meanwhile hit the 38th Infantry Regiment. The assaults forced a short withdrawal by the attached Netherlands Battalion on the 38th's left and penetrated the 3rd Battalion on the regimental right, but counterattacks restored the lost ground before noon. Captives identified the force moving on Wonju to be in division strength and to comprise two regiments of the PVA 120th Division and one of the 117th Division. The bulk of this force was sighted from the air moving in several columns across the Som River northwest of Wonju. Taken and kept under air and massed artillery attack, the PVA at first ignored losses and continued toward Wonju. But as casualties mounted the Chinese faltered, and most turned southwest before reaching the Wonju defenses. By 15:00 the air strikes and artillery fire stopped the PVA movement altogether. The ROK 3rd and 5th Infantry Divisions, ordered by General Almond on the 13th to withdraw into positions between Wonju and Pyongchang, continued to withdraw on the 14th somewhat below that line. KPA V Corps forces caught up with both divisions during the afternoon of the 14th and briefly engaged each. The ROK 3rd, missing its 18th Regiment and otherwise hurt by casualties, nevertheless managed to put up fair defenses slightly southeast of Wonju and above Chech‚Äôon. But the ROK 5th, next east, became even more disorganized as it withdrew and at dark on the 14th was still assembling around Chuch‚Äôon-ni, above Chech‚Äôon. Its artillery was intact, but it had lost half its other crew- served weapons and could muster only the equivalent of four infantry battalions. This left the division scarcely fit to establish defenses before Chech‚Äôon, let alone send a regiment northeast to Malta-ri (), as Almond had directed, to help tie the X Corps line to the extended position of the ROK III Corps. Left with a west flank neither tied to the X Corps nor solidly manned, and feeling some pressure on this flank from KPA II Corps forces, especially at Malta-ri, General Yu ordered the ROK 7th and 9th Infantry Divisions at the left and center of the ROK III Corps sector to withdraw near noon on the 14th. The ROK 7th Division moved toward positions adjacent to General Ferenbaugh's 31st Infantry Regiment below Pyongchang, the ROK 9th Division toward positions at the ROK 7th Division's right. General Ridgway earlier had recognized that the enemy attacks in the X Corps sector and the X Corps withdrawals might compel some adjustment of the ROK III Corps position. Preempting to a degree the authority he had given General Almond to coordinate ROK III Corps movements during Operation Roundup, Ridgway on the 12th permitted General Yu to halt the ROK III Corps advance pending the outcome of the attack against Almond's forces. On the 13th, after X Corps had pulled back some , he authorized Yu to withdraw his three divisions into defenses along a general southwest-northeast line between Pyongchang and Gangneung on the coast. But he intended that Yu withdraw only as a result of enemy pressure and then only in a well-fought delaying action, whereas Yu's order on the 14th appeared to be an unnecessary surrender of east shoulder territory. To prevent future ROK withdrawals that did not punish and delay enemy forces, Ridgway directed the Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG) chief, General Farrell, to make a habit of posting himself with major ROK units when they were withdrawing and to ensure personally that they stayed in contact. In response to the latest ROK III Corps move, he flashed a reminder to Yu on the 15th that any general withdrawal not forced by enemy pressure violated standing instructions. Yu received the admonition in time to hold the bulk of the ROK 9th Division generally in its original position. But the ROK 7th Division and 30th Regiment of the ROK 9th had completed their withdrawals, the regiments of the ROK 7th Division standing along Route 60 from a point above Yongwol north to Pyongchang, the 30th Regiment extending the line to the northeast. Since KPA II Corps forces from the 9th and 27th Divisions were then approaching Pyongchang from the northwest, Yu attached the 30th Regiment to the ROK 7th Division and left the force where it was. The ostensible aim of the KPA moving on Pyongchang was to drive Yu's forces out of the town and back from Route 60, thereby opening the road for a strike south against Yongwol. From late afternoon on 15 February through early morning on the 18th, the 9th and 27th Divisions launched repeated company and battalion assaults, seized Pyongchang itself, and, in their best effort, drove down Route 60 within of Yongwol. On the 16th, after it was clear that Yu would not be able to return the ROK 7th Division and 30th Regiment to their former positions to the north, General Ridgway allowed him to pull the remaining ROK III Corps units to the Pyongchang-Gangneung line and gave him specific instructions to stand fast in the Pyongchang area and keep the KPA out of Yongwol. Yu consequently placed a second regiment in the Pyongchang area as he brought the rest of his forces south. The KPA units, still worn from previous operations, could not sustain their drive against the strong South Korean position, lost most of their gains to ROK counterattacks, and finally withdrew. By evening of the 18th Yu's line units were reporting no contact. In the adjacent X Corps sector KPA V Corps forces pushed toward Chech‚Äôon on 15 February, hitting hard at the 22d Regiment in the right half of the ROK 3rd Division's sector. The regiment gave way some on the east but with fire support from 7th Division artillery near Chech‚Äôon otherwise stoodits ground. With no serious results, a few KPA reached Chuch‚Äôonni to the southeast and briefly fired on the ROK 5th Division, which was still assembling straggling forces and feebly attempting to establish defenses centered on the town. Under the arrangements made on 12 February by General Almond and General Ridgway, the ROK I Corps headquarters took control of the ROK 3rd, 5th, and 8th Divisions at 14:00 on the 15th. Almond directed General Kim, the ROK I Corps commander, to defend the Wonju-Pyongchang line, a large order given the debilitated condition of the ROK 5th and 8th Divisions and the presence of KPA forces below that line. Because of the current threat to Chech‚Äôon, Kim's initial act was to form a provisional battalion from the remnants of the ROK 8th Division as Corps reserve, which he assembled north of Chup‚Äôo-ri behind a gap between the two forward divisions. Additional KPA V Corps forces from the 6th, 7th and 12th Divisions meanwhile massed in front of the ROK I Corps and early on the 16th opened strong assaults against both forward divisions. The ROK 3rd Division, after the 22nd Regiment on the right lost some ground, contained the attack in its sector; but the ROK 5th Division, having been able to organize only fragile positions at Chuch‚Äôon-ni, withdrew after KPA forces penetrated the 36th Regiment on the division left. KMAG advisors with the 5th Division and ROK I Corps headquarters notified General Almond that the division's units were not being hit especially hard but were being outmaneuvered and in the process were disintegrating. Before the KPA attack diminished in the evening, the division had fallen back five miles and, in the judgment of the KMAG advisors, was no longer to be counted as an effective force. To ease the danger to Chech‚Äôon, only behind the ROK 5th Division, Almond directed General Ferenbaugh's U.S. 7th Infantry Division to move the 31st Infantry Regiment from the Pyongchang area, where the ROK 7th Division was holding its own, to a position behind the ROK 5th Division. While the KPA threat remained potentially serious, the 31st Regiment in its new position and the 32nd Infantry Regiment in and around Chech‚Äôon itself considerably increased Almond's chances of holding the KPA out of the town and off the main X Corps supply route. Further improving the defense of Chech‚Äôon, the tail-end battalion of the 17th Infantry Regiment, which had been moving up Route 29 to the regimental assembly at Wonju, halted along the road behind the ROK 3rd Division. In addition, General Kim shaped another provisional battalion from ROK 8th Division remnants and started it forward to assemble with the one he had formed the day before below the gap between the two forward divisions. That gap had opened to when the ROK 5th Division withdrew. An even wider gap of about had opened between the right of the ROK 5th Division and the nearest ROK III Corps position to the northeast. Although General Yu's left flank forces were handling the KPA II Corps units attempting to push down Route 60 into Yongwol, the gap offered the KPA opposite the ROK 5th Division an opportunity to sweep around Yu's flank. Yu, his leftmost forces well occupied and anyway obliged by General Ridgway's orders of the 16th to stand fast in the Pyongchang area, could do nothing about filling the gap; neither could any of the weak ROK divisions in the X Corps sector. Ridgway on 17 February consequently directed Almond to push American troops northeast to clear out the KPA and establish firm contact with the ROK III Corps. As Ridgway acted to cover the gap between Corps, it began to appear that the hard assaults on the ROK 3rd and 5th Divisions on the 16th had spent the KPA V Corps. ==Aftermath== Though General Almond, expecting a strong Chinese strike south of the Hoengsong, had emphasized the defense of Wonju, enemy forces made no concerted effort to seize the town after failing to do so on the 14th. Local skirmishes occurred along the Wonju front on the 15th, but on the 16th contact lightened and faded out. Infiltration and assaults harassed both South Korean divisions on the 17th and 18th but failed to yield any permanent gain, and on the 18th even the weak ROK 5th Division was able to make one short advance. As contact diminished on the 18th, a battalion from the 31st Infantry patrolled ahead of ROK lines before encountering a KPA position. The KPA may have backed off only to reorganize for new attacks; but in light of what had taken place in the meantime along the X Corps‚Äô west shoulder, their move was more likely part of a general withdrawal. Following the defeat of the PVA at Chipyong-ni and the PVA/KPA on the Wonju line, it became apparent that the PVA/KPA forces were retiring from the salient they had created in the central region in the Chinese Fourth Phase Offensive. The withdrawal fit the pattern of PVA/KPA operations observed before, in which assault forces were obliged to pause for refitting after a week or so of battle. During the evening of 18 March General Ridgway planned an advance designed to deny the PVA/KPA any respite in which to prepare new attacks and, in particular, designed to destroy those enemy forces moving north out of the Chech‚Äôon salient. He intended that two principal thrusts by American forces, up Route 29 from Wonju beyond Hoengsong and up Route 60 from Yongwol beyond Pyongchang, would block the main paths of PVA/KPA withdrawal. Other forces were to move through and clear the adjacent ground. Given the particular purpose of the attack, he called it Operation Killer. ==See also== * Operation Roundup * Operation Killer ==References== Category:Conflicts in 1951 Category:1951 in Korea Category:Battles of the Korean War Category:Battles involving North Korea Category:Battles involving South Korea Category:Battles of the Korean War involving China Category:Battles of the Korean War involving the United States Category:February 1951 events ","title":"Third Battle of Wonju"},{"id":"60253683","text":"National Highway 727B, commonly referred to as NH 727B is a national highway in India.

At least 113 people were killed in the two events. ==Events== The flash flooding, which struck the Sentani district of Jayapura Regency, was triggered by torrential rainfall followed by landslide. The event occurred around 21:30 WIT (12:30 UTC) on 16 March, and sudden influx of water was expected to have originated from the Cyclops Mountains, which according to BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho was likely caused by a landslide forming a dam blocking the headwaters of a river, which then burst resulting in the torrential flow. The floodwaters swept away with it significant amounts of material, including uprooted trees and boulders. An increase in the water depth of the local Kemiri River was reported shortly afterwards, resulting in buildings near the river being inundated. Jayapura regent Mathius Awoitauw stated that the flooding was caused by environmental damage in the Cyclops Mountains. Separately, around 00:15 WIT on 17 March, a landslide occurred in the city of Jayapura. The second event was similarly attributed to the torrential rainfall. ==Casualties== By afternoon of 17 March, the Papua regional police had confirmed 70 fatalities, 63 of which were in Jayapura Regency while 7 were in the city of Jayapura. A total of 105 were confirmed to have been injured, with 75 being classified as \\"lightly injured\\" and 30 as \\"heavily injured\\". Later that day, the death toll was updated to 73, of which 66 were in the Regency, with 60 reported to be missing. The most- affected area is Sentani, where at least 51 people are reported to have been killed. Most of the victims' bodies were brought to the Bhayangkara Hospital in Jayapura for identification and collection by relatives. On evening the following day, 89 people had been confirmed killed: 82 due to the flash flooding and 7 from the landslide. 159 injuries (84 classified as \\"heavy\\" and 75 as \\"light\\") were also confirmed, with 74 reported missing. By 19 March, the death toll was further updated to 92 dead. On Wednesday, 20 March, the death toll was further increased to 104 killed with 79 missing, and 40 of the unidentified victims were to be buried in a mass grave. On 26 March, the death toll rose to 113.Grim search for survivors continues after floods kill 113 people in Indonesia ==Impact== Over 11,000 people from across the regency were displaced due to the flooding, spread across 28 sites, with 11,725 households impacted across three districts. The flooding affected nine villages and damaged three bridges, submerging more than 150 houses. The administrative villages of Dobonsolo, Doyobaru and Hini Kumbi were the most affected. Papua's police recorded that 350 houses were heavily damaged, with additional damages to drainage systems and other public facilities. The Sentani‚ÄìKemiri road was blocked due to the flooding. Sentani's Adventis Doyo airstrip was also struck by the flooding, damaging a helicopter and a Twin Otter aircraft parked there at the time of the disaster. Operations of the nearby Sentani Airport remained normal, despite its surrounding areas being impacted by the flooding. According to PLN, the transmission of around 5.2 MW of electricity was disrupted. Total damage of the flooding in Sentani topped at Rp454 billion (US$31.8 million). ==Response== The emergency response headquarters, which also acted as a temporary shelter, were established at the Jayapura Regent's office complex. Papua's provincial government declared a 2-week emergency response period following the disaster. Kodam XVII/Cenderawasih deployed the equivalent of 2 engineering platoons and 6 infantry companies to aid with evacuation and disaster management. In total, around 1,900 emergency workers and volunteers were deployed to the area. ==References== Category:2019 disasters in Indonesia Jayapura Category:Floods in Indonesia Category:Jayapura Category:March 2019 events in Indonesia ","title":"2019 Jayapura flood and landslide"},{"id":"60253731","text":"STD-SLR gen 9 toy rifle, powered by gearbox piston A two gel blasters. The top one is based on HK416 while the below is based on ACR rifle. Gel blasters, also known as gel guns, gel shooters, gel markers, hydro markers or gelsoft, are toy guns similar in design to airsoft guns, but it shoots diameter superabsorbent polymer water beads (most commonly sodium polyacrylate, colloquially called water beads, hydrogel balls, gel balls, water bullets or simply gels) as projectiles, which are often sold commercially as garden moisture retainers. Gel blasters are often played in CQB-style shooting skirmishes similar to paintball by squads or local clubs of enthusiasts often referred to as \\"gelballers\\", but follows an airsoft-like honor-based gameplay umpiring system. MilSim games involving players wearing camouflage and dump pouches are very popular, while \\"SpeedGel\\" players are more casual with team jerseys and often wear paintball masks. In addition to safety gear such as eye protections, the sport is heavily regulated on the field and players must adhere to safety rules. == Design == The general design of gel blasters are very similar to airsoft guns, usually comprising a coil spring-loaded piston air pump, with a T-piece ahead of the pump outlet to feed gel beads. The spring-piston pump is either manually cocked (like a spring-piston gun) or more commonly driven by an electric motor-gearbox assembly powered by batteries (like airsoft automatic electric guns (AEG)). However, unlike the plastic airsoft pellets or the gelatin paintball capsules, the gel beads are very frangible and will simply fragment if any high pressure is introduced, so the propelling pump is small with a very low pressure output. As a result, gel blasters have a much lower muzzle energy, and hence shorter effective range and worse accuracy than most paintball guns, although recently muzzle-mounted frictional \\"hop-up\\" devices have been introduced to impart backspin on the gel beads and try increasing the range and precision. This nature of the beads' external and terminal ballistics make them much safer to play with (although protective eyewear is still recommended) and very unlikely to cause any property damage. The gel beads are also very cheap, easily transported in packets and only require soaking in water for a few hours prior to playing. Another feature is the ease of cleaning, since the gel beads are made up by water in over 98% of mass and volume, and will break upon impact and simply dehydrate into tiny biodegradable slush powder fragments afterwards. Originally, gel blasters used paintball-style top-mounted hoppers (often disguised as fake optical sights) that relied on gravity to load the gel beads when shooting, because the water beads were typically too fragile to withstand even the pressure exerted by a follower spring. However, in late 2016, bottom- mounted magazines with inbuilt motors were introduced, which draw power from the main batteries (via contact points at the top) to drive a cogwheel that gently pushed the beads up a feeding tube. This gave a lot more realism than previously and triggered a huge surge in the popularity and market of gel blasters. The recent proliferation of more hardy gel beads on the market has also introduced magazines using the traditional spring follower. === Gas blowback blasters === In early 2020, \\"Kublai P1\\", a gas-powered version modelled after the Glock pistol, started to appear on the market. The P1 is essentially the same in design to gas blowback airsoft pistols, and uses refrigerant gas (such as R-134a or HFC-152a) or propane to charge a gas canister built within a spring-follower magazine. The original version is fully polymer, but an upgraded version with metal slide and barrel is available for sale by retailers in Australia. == Accessories == There are a variety of products made and produced to complement gel blasters, which feeds from ordinary gel ball ammunition. === Grenades === Gel grenades are essentially a bottle with an internal spring mechanism. When the safety clip is pulled and the lever is relaxed, a sear mechanism is released and allows three trapdoor-like hatches on the external shell to spread open, followed by the release of three spring-loaded hinged flaps underneath that \\"flick out\\" out any gel beads stored within the cavity between the hatches and the flaps, causing a \\"shower\\" of gel beads in all directions. The sear can be designed to release in a delayed fashion, or in response to vibrations caused by impacts. === Anti-personnel mine === Gel mines are essentially plastic clamshell containers shaped like the M18 Claymore, with a pair of spring-loaded internal hinged flaps connected end-to-end by a looping piece of canvas. When the mine is loaded, the two flaps are folded down and trapped by the locked-shut clamshell enclosure, and gel beads are stored into the space within the canvas loop via a small feeding window on the front enclosure. The locking mechanism of the clamshell enclosure can be released manually by a tripwire, or by a remote control. When released, the clamshell enclosure opens up, allowing the two spring flaps to flip out like a french door, stretching and flattening the canvas between them, which will launch out all the stored gel beads towards the front direction. === Launchers === In March 2020, a gel blaster version of the M203 grenade launcher is introduced to the Chinese market by MAX SUN, which is designed to mount on the underside of another gel blaster's handguard via a Picatinny rail interface. It uses a rechargeable aluminium gas canister shaped like a 40 mm grenade, whose cap portion has six tubular holes each capable of holding numerous 7mm gel balls. Instead of actually launching the \\"grenade\\", the launcher actually functions like a shotgun. When the trigger is pulled, the launcher's spring-loaded hammer strikes a valve at the center of the \\"grenade\\" base and allows the canister's stored gas to be released through its cap holes, propelling and spraying out a shower of gel balls towards the target. Another Chinese company called LDT also introduced a similar \\"grenade launcher\\" in the shape of the Milkor MGL, which uses a mainspring-driven revolver-like mechanism that needs to be manually wound before use, and can hold a total of six canistes for repeated discharges. == Legality == First introduced in China as an airsoft substitute (as airsoft is banned in Mainland) and as a better alternative to foam dart guns, gel blasters have become increasingly popular in regions with airsoft-unfriendly laws such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and particularly Australia, where they quickly gained a massive enthusiast following in states like Queensland and South Australia. As the gel beads (which are commonly sold in gardening and household hardware stores) are not legally regarded as ammunitions, gel blasters are classified as toys by the ACCC ASN/NZ 8124 in Australia and used to be legal for sale, but they are now banned having been ruled 'firearms' by the government. Some toy importers/merchants, such as Brad Towner from Armored Heaven in New South Wales and Peter Clarke from Tactical Edge in Queensland, have been subjected to shipment seizures by the Australian Border Force and prosecuted for \\"firearm offences\\" but had the lawsuits ruled in their favor. DJI's popular remote controlled toy ground drone, the RoboMaster S1, was almost banned from import into Australia because it had a blaster gun for competitive tag matches, and as of early 2020 is still not available for sale in Victoria and New South Wales in order to \\"comply with local laws and regulations\\". == See also == *Airgun *Airsoft gun *Laser Tag *Nerf *Paintball gun ==References== Category:Toys Category:Pneumatic weapons ","title":"Gel ball shooter"},{"id":"60253732","text":"Masidwola (, meaning \\"of the Mehsuds\\"), Mehsudi, or Maseedwola is a dialect of Waziristani. ==Background== Waziristani is an east-central Pashto dialect spoken in South Waziristan, Southeastern parts of North Waziristan, parts of Bannu and Tank in Pakistan, and in certain adjacent districts of Paktika, Khost and Paktia provinces of Afghanistan. The Masidwola dialect is almost identical to the dialect spoken around Urgun (eastern Paktika province) Wazirwola dialect and the Bannuchi dialect of Bannu, somewhat resembles the dialect spoken by Khattaks in Karak and has distant resemblance with Afridi dialect . The dialects of Loya Paktia like Zadrani are also very closely related, except that they are of the harsh northern variety. ==Phonology== Masidwola differs significantly in pronunciation and grammar from the standard literary Pashto based on the larger Kandahar, Kabul and Yousafzai dialects. The vowels [a], […ë], [u] and [o] of standard Pashto yield […ë], [o], [i] and [e] respectively, so [pa Çto] becomes [p…ë…ïte] in Masidwola. A special feature of Waziristani is that the phonemes [ É] and [ Ç], along with their voiced counterparts, [ í] and [ ê], have merged into the phonemes […ï] and [ ë], both of which also exist in the nearby Ormuri or Warmuri language of Burkis of Kaniguram, South Waziristan.Rozi Khan Burki. \\"Dying Languages; Special Focus on Ormuri\\". Originally published in Pakistan Journal of Public Administration; Volume 6. No. 2 in December 2001. Khyber.ORG. The Pashto alphabet has no symbol for their expression and the regular symbols of ⁄ò and ÿ¥ may be used. ==Lexicon== The standard Pashto word for \\"boy\\", \\"ŸáŸÑ⁄©\\" [hal…ôk], is rarely heard in Masidwola. Instead, \\"Ÿà⁄ì⁄©ÿß€å\\" [wu…ªkai] meaning \\"little one\\" is used. The word \\"l…ôshki\\" [l…ô…ïki] is used instead of the standard \\"ŸÑ⁄ñ\\" [l…ô ê], \\"a little bit\\". The pronoun ŸÖ€å⁄ñ ([mu ê] or [mung]), meaning \\"we\\", is pronounced [mi ëh] in Masidwola. ==Orthography== Masidwola, like many other obscure Pashto dialects, is almost never written, and its speakers may use standard Pashto as a literary language. Masidwola Pashto is spoken by various tribes, by the Burki and Dawarwola by the Dawari. There are slight differences in pronunciation, for example, the phonemes [tÕ°s] and [dÕ°z] can become [s] and [z], or even [tÕ° É] and [dÕ° í], depending on the tribe or area the speaker is from. ==See also== *Waneci ==Notes== *Linguist List *Lorimer, John Gordon (1902).

He lived in Baracaldo, where he ran an office of the Banco Hispano Americano. He had attended as a candidate for the Congress of the Deputies of the coalition Uni√≥n Foral del Pa√≠s Vasco, occupying the second position of the list. Modesto had suffered an attack prior to his murder. On January 27. He was the victim of a robbery and kidnapping at the hands of ETA, which it took place in the branch of Banco Hispano Americano, where he was working. In that attack, four members of the terrorist group entered into the office, which were made with ten million pesetas. The ETA members took Modesto to Baracaldo's station and introduced him in a train with destination to Bilbao. Once they were there, they freed him in a bar, but not before warning him to stay there until nine a.m. The objective of taking him hostage was that the employees of the branch delayed the report of the theft === Murder === On September 13, 1979, Modesto left his house around 8 a.m., going to the Banco Hispano Americano‚Äôs office. Three members of ETA participated in this attack, of whom two had hidden in the stairs that were going down to the basement of his home. Modesto used to descend the stairs on foot. He was approached next to the elevator, where he was subsequently shot four times from close range, two hitting the head and two the stomach. There were no eyewitnesses of the facts even though his neighbours and relatives listened to the four detonations with clarity. The employees from a bank branch located in the adjoining portal came to help him, he was found with one hand on the stomach. Jos√© Reparaz Fern√°ndez also went to his aid, a doctor and neighbour of the deceased, who had heard the shots in a kiosk near the place of the scene. Shortly after his own wife came down, alerted by the gunshots. He was taken by ambulance to the hospital of Cruces, where he entered without life. The assassins had stolen at gunpoint a white Seat 127 in the town of Portugalete, Biscay, about an hour before the attack. The owner was forced to give them the keys and received orders not to give an account of the events until a few hours has passed. It was in this car that the third individual was waiting for them to flee after making the shots. After the attack, this vehicle was found by the National Police in Portugalete. After the murder, the Modesto Carriegas's family received a letter from ETA in which they were required to leave Baracaldo. Concerning the procedural situation of this murder, the National Court declared the summary and dismissal concluded provisionally on December 26 of the same year of the crime, considering that the relevant investigations were not fruitful. ETA's military branch claimed responsibility for this murder two days later through a communiqu√©. The procedural situation of this assassination is of provisional dismissal. Therefore, the material authors of the attack have not been condemned, nor have been an investigation that attributes these facts to any member of the terrorist group ETA. == Bibliography == * MERINO, A., CHAPA, A., Ra√≠ces de Libertad. pp. 29‚Äì39.

She is the author of three scientific mystery novels under the pseudonym B.B. Jordan. She was the founding editor of the journal Traffic. == Education == Brodsky earned her B.Sc. in biochemistry from Harvard University in 1976. She received a Marshall Scholarship to study in the UK and performed research in the laboratory of Walter Bodmer at Oxford University, obtaining a D. Phil.

In 1987, she returned to academia as an assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the University of California, San Francisco. Brodsky's work straddles the interface of immunology and cell biology. She developed some of the first monoclonal antibodies to the major histocompatibility complex, a protein that is central to the immune system. She became interested in clathrin, a protein that is key to both inward and outward membrane trafficking in cells, shortly after its isolation by Barbara Pearse. She used monoclonal antibodies to map the structure of clathrin and to probe its assembly into its characteristic polyhedral structures. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is involved in the uptake of antigens from outside the cell that are eventually presented on the surface of the cell by the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II). Brodsky discovered that the pathway of MHC class II export meets the antigen import pathway in a specialized endocytic compartment where antigens can be processed into peptides and loaded onto the MHC class II molecule for presentation. She also identified the site at which peptides are loaded onto MHC class I proteins. Brodsky has been a leader in analyzing the regulation of clathrin assembly and the adaptor proteins that help capture specific cargoes in clathrin-coated vesicles. She has identified roles for clathrin isoforms in diseases such as diabetes and myopathies, and in controlling immunoglobulin class switching. In 2000, she founded Traffic: The International Journal of Intracellular Transport with Mark Marsh, Sandra Schmid, and Thomas Kreis, with the goal of creating ‚Äúa central journal to gather together publications that are of most interest to those working on intracellular trafficking‚Äù. In 2007, she stepped aside from the role of co-Editor to become Reviews Editor of Traffic.

He also said: \\"we warned the members of Alianza Popular that of following Olarra with their position of not negotiating with their workers, within a week we will begin to execute members of A.P. for their identification with his ideological approaches. Therefore, we accuse them directly of the decisions taken by Olarra about it\\". Four days after the attack, on November 18, 1980, Egin published a story that ETA had reaffirmed its authorship of this killing through a statement. In this statement, ETA's military insists that \\"they interrogated Vicente Zorita before they killed him \\"and warns\\" the Alianza Popular's group and the oligarchic sector to which he lends his political support so that they abandon their authoritarian position to blackmail, threaten and wield repressive strategies against the just claims of the class worker, and finally end by renouncing the policy of abuse and arbitrariness to which they are subjecting the movement worker and the politician of decapitalization and economic chaos in which they want to flood the South Euskadi \\". At the moment, the identity of the material authors of this murder is unknown. == References == == Bibliography == * MERINO, A., CHAPA, A., Ra√≠ces de Libertad. pp. 83‚Äì91.

His obituary in The Canberra Times described him as \\"one of Australia's greatest political, business and sporting figures\\". ==Early life== Snow was born in Ballarat, Victoria, to Emily (n√©e Piper) and John Snow. He was educated at Ballarat College. His father ran John Snow & Co., a drapery emporium, while his brother Sir Gordon Snow ran Snows Men's Wear. ==Business career== In 1912, Snow moved to Sydney and established Sydney Snow Limited with the help of his father and a business partner W. V. Manton. He opened a softgoods store on the corner of Pitt Street and Liverpool Street, opposite the Anthony Hordern & Sons department store. His business grew and flourished, surviving both world wars, the Great Depression, and increased competition from smaller retailers. He eventually opened a second store in Camperdown in 1951, but retired in 1954 and sold the company to Cox Bros (Australia) Limited for over ¬£1,250,000. It was reportedly \\"one of the biggest cash deals in Australian history\\". Snow developed wide commercial interests. In the 1920s, he was a director of Yellow Cabs of Australia Limited and Sun Newspapers Limited; he was later deputy chairman of Associated Newspapers Limited after it acquired the latter in 1929. In the 1930s he served on the boards of Broken Hill South Limited, General Industries Limited, H. B. Dickie Limited, the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Company, and Commonwealth Industrial Gases Limited. He became president of the Retail Traders' Association of New South Wales in 1937. ==Politics and public service== During the Great Depression, Snow helped establish the All for Australia League and was a member of its provisional executive, elected in January 1931. In October, Smith's Weekly reported that he had lent the league ¬£1,000 to pay its debts, but in exchange demanded that the league unite with the Nationalist Party. Previously the league had opposed a merger. The two organisations co- operated at the 1931 federal election and subsequently merged into the New South Wales branch of the United Australia Party (UAP) in early 1932. He was initially deputy state president of the UAP, and later chairman of its executive and council until his retirement in 1942. During World War II he served on the State Recruiting Committee. He donated his mansion \\"Bonnie Brae\\" in Wahroonga to the Red Cross for use as a convalescent home for soldiers. ==Personal life== Snow married Ruby Dent Davies in Ballarat in 1913, with whom he had three children. His daughter Mary married Kenneth Asprey. Snow was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1936. He was a co-owner of Peshawar, the racehorse that won the 1953 Caulfield Cup. ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Australian company founders Category:People from Ballarat Category:Australian corporate directors Category:Australian Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Australian businesspeople in retailing Category:United Australia Party ","title":"Sydney Snow"},{"id":"60254287","text":"The Princess on Broadway is a 1927 American silent comedy drama film directed by Dallas M.

He owned a construction company and served as the leader of the Movimiento Nacional in Guip√∫zcoa, as well as city councilor in the municipality of Azkoitia during the final years of Francoist Spain. During the Spanish Transition he became a member of the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD). A native of Azkoitia, following the second attempt on his life he moved to Logro√±o, where he worked as a District Court Official. At the time of his murder he was married with three children. == Previous assassination attempts == Before his murder, Jose Larra√±aga Arenas had been the target of two other assassination attempts. The first attempt occurred on April 13, 1978, when he was attacked at 11:30 p.m. Two people shot at him from a vehicle using a 9mm semi-machine gun. At least 11 shots were fired, with 3 shots striking his left leg, fracturing his fibula. Almost two years later, on the night of 10 April 1980, Jos√© Larra√±aga Arenas was again the victim of an assassination attempt. Arenas had just bid a friend farewell and had nearly arrived home when a group of men in a Chrysler or Renault opened fire. After the burst of machine-gun fire the car immediately fled. Arenas was struck only once, and was able to walk to a nearby restaurant and get assistance. First- aid was administered by a doctor who happened to live near the restaurant, and he was taken to a nearby hospital where he was placed in intensive care. He had been shot in his right arm, with the bullet going though one of his lungs and exiting from his sternum. Following the attack, the ETA claimed responsibility in a statement to several media outlets. == Death == Jos√© Tom√°s Larra√±aga Arenas was assassinated by the ETA on December 31, 1984, in Azkoitia. Following the multiple attempts on his life, he had moved from his hometown, but had a habit of spending New Year's in Azkoitia. On the night of December 31, 1984 he, along with his wife and brother-in-law came to the city, and he spent the evening with several lifelong friends, including the mayor of Azcoitia, Rom√°n Sodupe and Jos√© Mar√≠a Sudupe, brother of the president of Executive Committee of the Partido Nacionalista Vasco. He met with friends at a bar in Azkoitia to celebrate the New Year. Upon becoming aware of his presence in the bar, ETA members Miguel Angel Gil Cervera, alias \\"Kurika\\", Ignacio Bilbao Beascoechea, alias \\"I√±aki de Lemona\\", and Antonio L√≥pez Ruiz, alias \\"Kubati\\" hijacked a car at gunpoint and waited for him to leave the bar. As soon as they saw him leave, \\"Kurika\\" and \\"I√±aki de Lemona\\" exited the car, approached him from behind, and shot him twice in the head, and once in the chest, killing him instantly. After his body hit the ground, they continued to fire several rounds into his body. For their role in the murder, Ignacio Bilbao Beascoechea and Miguel Angel Gil Cervera were later sentenced to 39 years in prison, and were also ordered to pay 50,000,000 pesetas in compensation to his widow. Following his murder, on 1 January 1985, the municipality of Azkoitia convened an extraordinary plenary session to denounce his assassination. The newspaper Egin said that on January 2, 1985, they received a release from ETA's military claiming responsibility for Jose's murder. The statement said: \\"He was conscious that ETA had decided to attack him, and therefore decided to move away from the south of Basque Country. He tried to prevent our actions with his displacement, but despite everything that happened he did not resign from continuing his fascist and anti-Basque work. He continued serving fascist structures and making trips to the south of Basque country.\\" == References == == Bibliography == * MERINO, A., CHAPA, A., Roots of liberty. pp. 99‚Äì115.

While working in his Jussieu chemistry laboratory, in 1973 Henri identified asbestos in the white dust falling from the ceiling. After examining the literature on this silicate and discovering its carcinogenic character, he reported this to an inter-union collective on safety. == Career == In 1978, he supported the workers at the Amisol factory in Clermont-Ferrand. Henri's later activism with the Anti-Asbestos Committee Jussieu and Ban Asbestos France led France to ban asbestos in 1997. After his retirement, Henri continued to raise awareness around carcinogenic pollutants. In 1999, he launched the Vincennes Pediatric Cancers Case, alerting the Director General of Health with a letter describing a spatiotemporal aggregate (cluster) of childhood cancers at the Franklin Roosevelt kindergarten, built on the old industrial wasteland left by Kodak factories.

He was one of the best British-trained two-year-olds of 2016 when he won the Gimcrack Stakes and was placed in the Richmond Stakes, Middle Park Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes. In the following year he developed into a high class sprint horse, taking the Pavilion Stakes and Bengough Stakes as well as running third in the Commonwealth Cup. As a four-year-old in 2018 he recorded his first Group 1 success in the King's Stand Stakes. In 2019 he won three races in Dubai including the Al Quoz Sprint before recording a double at Royal Ascot, taking the King's Stand Stakes for the second time and winning the Diamond Jubilee Stakes. ==Background== Blue Point is a bay horse with a white star and a white sock on his left hind leg bred in Ireland by Oak Lodge Bloodstock. As a foal in November 2014 he was put up for auction at Tattersalls where he was sold for 110,000 guineas to Ebor Bloodstock. In October 2015 the yearling returned to the Tattersalls sales ring and was bought for 200,000 guineas by John Ferguson Bloodstock, acting on behalf of Godolphin. The colt was sent into training with Charlie Appleby at Godolphin's British base in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was ridden in most of his races by William Buick. He was from the eighth crop of foals sired by Shamardal whose wins included the Dewhurst Stakes, Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix du Jockey Club and St James's Palace Stakes. His other offspring have included Able Friend, Mukhadram, Lope de Vega and Casamento. Blue Point's dam Scarlett Rose demonstrated little racing ability, failing to win in thirteen starts, but did better as a broodmare, producing the Railway Stakes winner Formosina. She was a half-sister to the Horris Hill Stakes winner Tumbleweed Ridge and, as a descendant of the broodmare Grand Peace, was distantly related to the Ascot Gold Cup winner Sagaro and the Lockinge Stakes winner Sovereign Path. ==Racing career== ===2016: two-year-old season=== Blue Point began in his racing career in a minor race over six furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse on 9 June and started the 6/4 second favourite in a six-runner field. He took the lead a furlong out and despite hanging left in the closing stages he won \\"readily\\" by half a length from the favoured Tafaakhor. On 14 July, with James McDonald in the saddle, the colt started odds-on favourite for a similar event at Doncaster Racecourse and won impressively, coming home eleven lengths clear of his five opponents. Two weeks later the colt was stepped up in class and started 5/6 favourite for the Group 2 Richmond Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Ridden by James Doyle he led for most of the way but after hanging to the right in the closing stages he was beaten by a neck by the July Stakes winner Mehmas. On 20 August at York Racecourse, Blue Point contested the Group 2 Gimcrack Stakes and was made the 11/4 favourite ahead of nine opponents including The Last Lion, Mokarris (Rose Bowl Stakes) and Ardad (Windsor Castle Stakes). He raced just behind the leaders before going to the front in the last quarter mile and accelerated away from his rivals in the closing stages to win by three lengths. On 24 September Blue Point stepped up to Group 1 class for the Middle Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse and started the 11/10 favourite against nine opponents. He was always in contention but although he made progress in the last quarter mile he was never able to catch the front-running The Last Lion and was beaten three quarters of a length into second place. At the same track two weeks later, the colt was moved up to seven furlongs for the Dewhurst Stakes and finished third behind Churchill and Lancaster Bomber, with Thunder Snow and Rivet in fourth and fifth. In the official European Classification of two-year-olds for 2016 Blue Point was given a rating of 116, making him the fifth best juvenile colt of the season, six pounds behind the top-rated Churchill. ===2017: three-year-old season=== Blue Point began his second campaign in the Pavilion Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot Racecourse on 3 May and started the 13/8 favourite in a ten- runner field which included Harry Angel, Mokarris, Yalta (Molecomb Stakes) and Sir Dancealot (Rockingham Stakes). After racing in third place he took the lead approaching the final furlong and kept on well to win by one and a half lengths from Harry Angel in a track record time of 1:11.05. Charlie Appleby said \\"I'm not going to start changing my opinion of him ‚Äì he's the quickest horse in the yard and always has been. The horse has wintered well. A couple of people have said he's not the biggest, but for me he's got a great chest on him and plenty of strength\\". In the Commonwealth Cup over the same course and distance on 23 June he was always and contention and before challenging for the lead in the last quarter mile and finishing third, beaten three quarters of a length and half a length by Caravaggio and Harry Angel. After a break of two and a half month the colt returned on 9 September in the 32Red Sprint Cup on heavy ground at Haydock Park. Ridden by James Doyle, he raced in second place for most of the way but was outpaced in the closing stages and came home fourth behind Harry Angel, Tasleet and The Tin Man. For his final start of the season, Blue Point was dropped back in class for the Group 3 Bengough Stakes at Ascot in October and went off the even money favourite. He led from the start and opened up a three length advantage approaching the final furlong but then came under pressure before holding on to win by half a length from the four-year-old gelding Projection. William Buick, who was returning to the saddle after a serious back injury, said \\"It's fantastic and I have to thank a lot of people. First of all, Sheikh Mohammed who has been very supportive all along and this horse is not a bad ride to come back on, so my thanks to Charlie and all the team at home\\". In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Blue Point was rated the 183rd-best horse in the world with a rating of 116. ===2018: four-year-old season=== In the winter of 2017‚Äì2018 Blue Point was sent to be trained at Godolphin's base in Dubai. On his seasonal debut he contested the Group 2 Meydan Sprint over 1000 metres at Meydan Racecourse in February and finished strongly to take second place, beaten a head by the seven-year-old Ertijaal. He was then sent to Hong Kong for the Chairman's Sprint Prize at Sha Tin Racecourse in April but made little impact and came home last of the nine runner behind Ivictory. On his first appearance of the year in Europe Blue Point was one of fourteen sprinters to contest the Group 1 KIng's Stand take over five furlongs at Royal Ascot on 19 June and went off the 6/1 third choice in the betting behind Lady Aurelia and Battaash. The other contenders included Mabs Cross, Kachy (Molecomb Stakes), Washington, D.C. (Windsor Castle Stakes), Different League (Albany Stakes), Finsbury Square (Prix du Gros Ch√™ne) and Gifted Master (Pavilion Stakes). After tracking the leaders Blue Point moved up alongside the front-running Battaash a furlong out before gaining the advantage in the closing stages and drawing ahead to win by one and three quarter lengths. After the race William Buick said \\"I'm very, very pleased for the horse; he deserves it. He's a very quick horse, I was always very comfortable where I was and I always knew he would see the race out better than Battaash and it was just a case of whether I would be close enough.\\" In the July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket Blue Point started the 5/2 favourite but never looked likely to win and came home seventh of the thirteen runners, beaten four and three quarter lengths behind the winner U S Navy Flag. The colt was brought back in distance for the Nunthorpe Stakes over five furlongs at York in August and produced a much better performance to finish third behind Alpha Delphini and Mabs Cross. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Blue Point was given a rating of 122, making him the 42nd best horse in the world and the third-best sprinter in Europe. ===2019: five-year-old season=== ====Dubai campaign==== As in the previous year, Blue Point began his season at Meydan Racecourse in Dubai. In the Meydan Sprint on 14 February he started the 1/4 favourite and won \\"easily\\" by five lengths from Australian gelding Faatinah. Three weeks later Blue Point contested the Nad Al Sheba Turf Sprint and was made the odds-on favourite against ten opponents. He took the lead 400 metres from the finish and drew away to record another easy win, coming home three lengths clear of Ekhtiyaar. On 30 March Blue Point contested the Group 1 Al Quoz Sprint and was made the 4/6 favourite ahead of twelve opponents including Brave Smash (Manikato Stakes), Sands of Mali, Stormy Liberal, Ekhtiyaar and The Right Man (winner of the race in 2017). After racing in second place behind the American-trained mare Belvoir Bay he took the lead 100 metres from the finish and won \\"comfortably\\" by one and a quarter lengths. Buick commented \\"The horse has so much confidence. It makes me very confident; we were in great shape throughout. That was nice and straightforward, and the horse deserved it... He travelled really strongly and has again shown a great turn of foot. When he gets to the front he knows he has done enough. It is great at the age of five he is showing everyone just how good he is\\". ====Royal Ascot==== On 18 June at Royal Ascot, Blue Point was ridden by Doyle as he attempted to repeat his 2018 success in the King's Stand Stakes and started the 5/2 second favourite behind his old rival Battaash. The other ten runners included Mabs Cross, Imprimis (Shakertown Stakes), Fairyland, Sergei Prokofiev (Cornwallis Stakes), Soldier's Call (Flying Childers Stakes), Houtzen (P J Bell Stakes) and Signora Cabello (Prix Robert Papin). In a race run in heavy rain Blue Point was always among the leaders, went to the front two furlongs out and kept on \\"gamely\\" to win by one and a quarter lengths from Battaash, with Soldier's Call taking third place ahead of Mabs Cross. After the race Appleby said \\"To do back-to- back wins in this race is fantastic, as I knew he's going to have a great career at stud when he retires at the end of the season. During the winter we saw how much more professional he was. He's strengthened and when William got off him after his first start in Dubai he said he was a different animal. He's the finished article now.\\" Four days later Blue Point attempted to become the first horse since Choisir to win Royal Ascot's two big weight-for-age sprint races when he started favourite for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes over six furlongs. His seventeen opponents included Bound For Nowhere (Shakertown Stakes) from the United States, City Light (Prix de Saint-Georges) from France, Invincible Army (Duke of York Stakes), Sands of Mali, The Tin Man and the Singapore challenger Lim's Cruiser. He raced just behind the leaders before taking the lead a furlong out and held off a late challenge from Dream of Dreams to win by a head. Appleby commented \\"we've always known it's when he comes to Ascot that he really brings his 'A' game. I got a bit too excited too soon today. The way he traveled and picked up, I thought he'd put it to bed. Through the last 50 yards, I was holding my breath\\". Two days after his win in the Diamond Jubilee it was announced that Blue Point had been retired from racing. Appleby said \\"To do what he did within five days was the pinnacle of his career and he couldn't have done any more. He retires fit and well to Dalham Hall... we don't think he has anything else to prove\\". In November Blue Point was named Champion Sprinter at the Cartier Awards for 2018. In the 2019 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Blue Point was given a rating of 124, making him the 12th best racehorse in the world. ==Stud career== In 2020 Blue Point commenced shuttle stallion duties in Victoria, Australia at Darley Northwood Park for a service fee of A$44,000. ==Pedigree== == References == ==External links== * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart ‚Äì Blue Point Category:2014 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 4-l Category:Cartier Award winners ","title":"Blue Point (horse)"},{"id":"60254480","text":"Tommy Madden (born April 23, 1997) is an American soccer player who plays as a midfielder. ==Career== Madden attended the University of North Carolina at Charlotte where he played college soccer for four years between 2015 and 2018, making 72 appearances, scoring 7 goals and tallying 9 assists.

Her research areas are pornography and sexual representations, queer culture, queer activism, and queer kinship. Because of her activism and research, Ziv is considered a prominent member of the LGBTQ and feminist communities in Israel. == Academic career and activism == Ziv is one of the most noted figures in feminist and queer history in Israel. She was one of the founders of Hazman Havarod (Pink Times), the pioneering LGBT newspaper. In the 1990s, Ziv wrote about LGBT and feminist topics in mainstream newspapers and journals. She also wrote and published her poetry. Some of her poems were set to music and recorded. In 1992, Ziv completed her MA in comparative literature at Brown University. When she returned to Israel in 1993, she established a gay-and-lesbian and queer theory study group at the Agudah (Israel's first LGBT center) in Tel Aviv. In 1996, together with Aeyal Gross and Miki Gluzman, she started the Queer Reading Group at Tel Aviv University. In 2001, while doing her PhD at Tel Aviv University, together with Gross and Daphna Hirsch, she founded the Sex Acher (\\"An Other Sex\\") LGBT Studies & Queer Theory annual conference, which held its 18th edition in 2018. In 2003, she edited the first book of queer essays in Hebrew, with Yair Kedar and Oren Kanar, Beyond Sexuality (Me'ever LeMiniyut ◊û◊¢◊ë◊® ◊ú◊û◊ô◊†◊ô◊ï◊™). In 2005, she completed her PhD. Her dissertation was titled \\"The Construction of the Female Subject in Pornographic Fiction\\". She then went on to do post-doctoral research at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, on queer activism in Israel. Included in this research was the topic of lesbian parenting. Ziv lectures in the department of literature at Tel Aviv University, and has been a faculty member of the Gender Studies Program at Ben Gurion University since 2008. As of 2016, she is the head of the program. In addition, Ziv is a member of the editorial committee and editorial board of the academic journal \\"Theory and Criticism\\" (◊™◊ô◊ê◊ï◊®◊ô◊î ◊ï◊ë◊ô◊ß◊ï◊®◊™), published by the Van Lir Institute. In 2015, on the 40th anniversary of the Agudah, Ziv was included on the list of the 40 most influential people in LGBT history in Israel. == Views == Ziv's positions regarding queer theory have generated opposition to her by supporters of the theory in academe. One such position is Ziv's distinction between queer theory and adoption of a queer (as opposed to gay) identity. She objects to the idea that \\"queer theory tells each of us personally is that everyone can be gender- and sexually fluid, and not only can be, but must be. Queer theory truly does not ask everyone to be queer, it just offers a way of looking at and subverting the entire field of sexuality and gender. But to point out the options does not mean that these options are readily available and obligatory.\\" Ziv's views on pornography are also divisive. Although she has made clear that she is stringently opposed to the exploitation of women in prostitution and pornography, she supports the existence of these occupations from a feminist perspective, in which she examines women's sexual subjectivity, right to choose, and other elements affecting them. == Personal life == Ziv resides in Tel Aviv with her life-partner, the poet Sharon Haas, and their son. == Publications == === Books === * Sexual Thoughts: Queer Theory, Pornography, and the Politics of Sexuality (Resling Press, 2013, in Hebrew) * Explicit Utopias: Rewriting the Sexual in Women‚Äôs Pornography (SUNY Press, 2015) * Beyond Sexuality: Selected Papers in Lesbian & Gay Studies and Queer Theory ‚Äì co-editor (Hakibbutz Hameuchad Press, 2003, in Hebrew). === Chapters in books === * ‚ÄúToward a History of Bars in Israel.‚Äù Sappho in the Holy Land: Lesbian Existence and Dilemmas in Contemporary Israel.

After a childhood marred by illness and long absences from school, Walne entered the Ipswich Art School on a ¬£1 a week scholarship in 1930. Originally assigned to the design school she soon joined the painting class where she met her future husband, Frank Ward. In 1933 Ward moved to London to study at the Royal College of Art. He also promoted Walne's works by taking examples to show West End galleries and dealers. After numerous refusals and rejections, Lucy Wertheim, the owner of the Wertheim Gallery, agreed to act on Walne's behalf. This was the start of a lifelong friendship between the two. Wertheim gave Walne a solo show in 1935 and for a time she worked at the gallery as a general help. Also in 1935, works by Walne were included in a show of contemporary watercolours at the Salford Art Gallery. The Salford Art Gallery went on to collect works by Walne throughout her career and gave her a retrospective exhibition in 1986. Walne and Ward married in 1938 and would have three children together. In 1939 Ward took a teaching post at Wilson's boys grammar school in Camberwell and, other than for his time in the army during the Second World War, would remain there until his retirement in 1974. After the war, the couple lived in Chelsea but in 1968 moved to Brighton to nurse Lucy Wertheim, who had been diagnosed with cancer. Walne and Ward had a joint exhibition at the Compendium 2 Gallery in 1972 and another together in Brighton in 1975. In 1991 the Salford Art Gallery mounted a tribute show to Wertheim, Adventure in Art, which featured works by Walne and other artists she had promoted. As well as Salford, the Towner Art Gallery in Eastbourne and the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki in New Zealand hold examples of her work. ==References== ==Further reading== * Mixed Palette, a monograph on Walne and Ward by David Buckman, published in 1997. ==External links== * Category:1915 births Category:2011 deaths Category:20th-century English painters Category:20th-century British women artists Category:Artists from Ipswich Category:English women painters ","title":"Kathleen Walne"},{"id":"60254656","text":"Bilathikuzhal is a 2018 Indian Malayalam-language film Directed by Vinu Kolichal.

Cali (May 9, 1928 ‚Äì January 15, 1992) was an American Democratic Party politician who served three terms in the New Jersey General Assembly, representing the 30th Legislative District from 1974 to 1980. ==Biography== Cali was born in Newark, New Jersey on May 9, 1928 and graduated from Kearny High School. He then attended the Casey Jones School of Aeronautics (now Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology) before joining the United States Army and fighting during the Korean War from 1950 to 1952. After returning to New Jersey, he worked as an administrative assistant at the Hudson County Jail and was the secretary to the warden at the time of his service in the Assembly. In 1973, he ran for the General Assembly from the new 30th district encompassing western Hudson County plus Belleville and the Ironbound and North Ward neighborhoods of Newark. He and running mate Michael F. Adubato received the most votes in the June primary narrowly defeating incumbent Assemblyman Frank Megaro and Fiorentino J. Alati by running larger margins in the Hudson portion of the district. The two Democratic primary winners were ultimately successful in the general election that year and were also reelected in 1975 and 1977. However, in 1979, Cali was defeated for a fourth term by Newark activist and former independent state legislator Anthony Imperiale running as a Republican; Adubato was reelected by coming in second place. Cali later became the warden at the Hudson County Jail in the 1980s. He died on January 15, 1992 at the age of 63. ==References== Category:1928 births Category:1992 deaths Category:American army personnel of the Korean War Category:Kearny High School (New Jersey) alumni Category:People from Kearny, New Jersey Category:Politicians from Newark, New Jersey Category:American prison wardens Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:New Jersey Democrats Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"John F.

For her play L'√âloignement (1987), she was awarded the Moli√®re prize. ==Early life and family== Born on 14 May 1925 in Bayonne, Marie Laure Viole Bellon was the daughter of Jacques Bellon, a magistrate, and Denise Simone Hulmann, a well-known photographer.

Following a divorce in 1960, she married the poet Claude Roy (1915‚Äì1997) in 1962. Loleh Bellon was the younger sister of the film director and screenwriter Yannick Bellon. ==Professional life== Bellon studied for the theatre under the Russian-born actress and drama teacher Tania Balachova, the actor and theatre manager Charles Dullin, and the actor Julien Bertheau. After making her stage d√©but in 1945 in J. B. Priestley's Dangerous Corner, in 1947, she played in L'An Mil by Jules Romains.

The 2019 General Practitioner contract gave the opportunity for GP practices to join networks, each with between 30,000 and 50,000 patients. The stated aim is to create fully integrated community-based health services. By June 2019 1,259 primary care networks had been established across England, with an average population covered of about 42,000 patients, and including all but about 55 practices. About 25 had decided not to participate. Networks will be required to deliver seven national service specifications. Structured medication reviews, enhanced health in care homes, anticipatory care (with community services), personalised care and supporting early cancer diagnosis are to start by April 2020. Cardiovascular disease case-finding and locally agreed action to tackle inequalities are to start in 2021. This model was pioneered by the vanguard projects established under the Five Year Forward View. The networks will hold local contracts for enhanced services. They will have 'expanded neighbourhood teams', which the plan envisages 'will comprise a range of staff such as GPs, pharmacists, district nurses, community geriatricians, dementia workers and allied health professionals such as physiotherapists and podiatrists/chiropodists, joined by social care and the voluntary sector'. Each network will get ¬£37,810 to fund a clinical pharmacist post for 2019/2020, which is to cover 70% of the costs, with the network expected to cover the rest. The intention is that each network will have five clinical pharmacists by 2024 ‚Äì about one per practice. Evidence of the effectiveness of this approach is rather limited. Modality Partnership and Our Health Partnership, two of the biggest GP super-partnerships, proposed in 2019 to lead networks across the country, which may include practices not in their organisations. ==Staffing== Funding will be provided for the employment of clinical pharmacists and social prescribing link workers in 2019/20, and subsequently for physiotherapists, physician associates and paramedics. It is expected that an additional 7,500 pharmacists will be required in the networks by 2024. In November 2019 NHS England announced a change in financial rules which will permit networks to meet management costs of the charities and other organisations which supply social prescriber link workers. ==References== Category:Health care reform Category:National Health Service (England) Category:Primary care ","title":"Primary care network"},{"id":"60255338","text":"Oussama Tebbi (; born September 23, 1991) is an Algerian footballer who plays for AS A√Øn M'lila in the Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1. == MC Alger == On July 2019, he signed a contract with ES Setif on a free transfer. == References == ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1991 births Category:Algerian footballers Category:RC Relizane players Category:MC Alger players Category:ES S√©tif players Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Oussama Tebbi"},{"id":"60255342","text":"Elie Naasan (2 June 1931 - 4 April 2015) was a Lebanese wrestler.

In 2017, restoration of the Baroque era frescoes in the apse and ceilings were completed. ==History== The site by the 13th century housed an oratory of the prominent Congregation of the Holy Spirit (Santo Spirito). That congregation and the oratory were patronized by the wealthy aristocratic Cancellieri Bianchi family, who owned the adjacent Palazzo, now serving as provincial office. However, during the early 16th century, this family had joined the anti-Medici party in Tuscany, and with the restoration of the latter family to the rule in the region, the Cancellieri palaces in town, as well as their fortunes, suffered extremely. The adjacent palace was burned down by forces led by the Panciatichi family. The oratory remained property of the Congregation. The oratory was refurbished in the 17th century, adding the portico and laminating the interior with marble and quadratura. During this time, the interiors were embellished with the altarpieces (1622) depicting: on the right the Resurrection by Giovanni Lanfranco for the Arfaruoli family and on left the Ascension of Christ by Stefano Marucelli for the Bronconi family. During 1753-1764, the apse and presbytery dome were decorated initially starting with Raffaello Ulivi, but mostly with the efforts of Vincenzo Meucci and Lorenzo del Moro with a large fresco depicting the Descent of the Holy Spirit. Moro contributed to the quadratura and lateral walls. In 1764, Mauro Tesi completed the nave ceiling frescoes. Between 1710 and 1773, the oratory was detached from the Congregation of Santo Spirito and granted to the bishop's seminary, who changed the dedication to San Leone.Pistoia e il suo territorio: Pescia e i suoi dintorni: guida del forestiero, by Giuseppe Tigri, Tipografia Cino, Pistoia (1853): page 185-186.Visit Tuscany, region of Tuscany tourism site.

Orlicz sequence spaces generalize the \\\\ell_p spaces, and as such play an important role in functional analysis. ==Definition== Fix \\\\mathbb{K}\\\\in\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbb{R},\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\\\\\} so that \\\\mathbb{K} denotes either the real or complex scalar field. We say that a function M:[0,\\\\infty)\\\\to[0,\\\\infty) is an Orlicz function if it is continuous, nondecreasing, and (perhaps nonstrictly) convex, with M(0)=0 and \\\\textstyle\\\\lim_{t\\\\to\\\\infty}M(t)=\\\\infty. In the special case where there exists b>0 with M(t)=0 for all t\\\\in[0,b] it is called degenerate. In what follows, unless otherwise stated we'll assume all Orlicz functions are nondegenerate. This implies M(t)>0 for all t>0. For each scalar sequence (a_n)_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\in\\\\mathbb{K}^\\\\mathbb{N} set :\\\\left\\\\(a_n)_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\right\\\\_M=\\\\inf\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\rho>0:\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty M(a_n/\\\\rho)\\\\leqslant 1\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. We then define the Orlicz sequence space with respect to M, denoted \\\\ell_M, as the linear space of all (a_n)_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\in\\\\mathbb{K}^\\\\mathbb{N} such that \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty M(a_n/\\\\rho)<\\\\infty for some \\\\rho>0, endowed with the norm \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\_M. Two other definitions will be important in the ensuing discussion. An Orlicz function M is said to satisfy the Œî2 condition at zero whenever :\\\\limsup_{t\\\\to 0}\\\\frac{M(2t)}{M(t)}<\\\\infty. We denote by h_M the subspace of scalar sequences (a_n)_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\in\\\\ell_M such that \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty M(a_n/\\\\rho)<\\\\infty for all \\\\rho>0. ==Properties== The space \\\\ell_M is a Banach space, and it generalizes the classical \\\\ell_p spaces in the following precise sense: when M(t)=t^p, 1\\\\leqslant p<\\\\infty, then \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\_M coincides with the \\\\ell_p-norm, and hence \\\\ell_M=\\\\ell_p; if M is the degenerate Orlicz function then \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\_M coincides with the \\\\ell_\\\\infty-norm, and hence \\\\ell_M=\\\\ell_\\\\infty in this special case, and h_M=c_0 when M is degenerate. In general, the unit vectors may not form a basis for \\\\ell_M, and hence the following result is of considerable importance. Theorem 1. If M is an Orlicz function then the following conditions are equivalent: :(i) M satisfies the Œî2 condition at zero, i.e. \\\\textstyle\\\\limsup_{t\\\\to 0}M(2t)/M(t)<\\\\infty. : (ii) For every \\\\lambda>0 there exists positive constants K=K(\\\\lambda) and b=b(\\\\lambda) so that M(\\\\lambda t)\\\\leqslant KM(t) for all t\\\\in[0,b]. : (iii) \\\\textstyle\\\\limsup_{t\\\\to 0}tM'(t)/M(t)<\\\\infty (where M' is a nondecreasing function defined everywhere except perhaps on a countable set, where instead we can take the right-hand derivative which is defined everywhere). : (iv) \\\\ell_M=h_M. : (v) The unit vectors form a boundedly complete symmetric basis for \\\\ell_M. : (vi) \\\\ell_M is separable. : (vii) \\\\ell_M fails to contain any subspace isomorphic to \\\\ell_\\\\infty. : (viii) (a_n)_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\in\\\\ell_M if and only if \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty M(a_n)<\\\\infty. Two Orlicz functions M and N satisfying the Œî2 condition at zero are called equivalent whenever there exist are positive constants A,B,b>0 such that AN(t)\\\\leqslant M(t)\\\\leqslant BN(t) for all t\\\\in[0,b]. This is the case if and only if the unit vector bases of \\\\ell_M and \\\\ell_N are equivalent. \\\\ell_M can be isomorphic to \\\\ell_N without their unit vector bases being equivalent. (See the example below of an Orlicz sequence space with two nonequivalent symmetric bases.) Theorem 2. Let M be an Orlicz function. Then \\\\ell_M is reflexive if and only if : \\\\liminf_{t\\\\to 0}\\\\frac{tM'(t)}{M(t)}>1\\\\;\\\\; and \\\\;\\\\;\\\\limsup_{t\\\\to 0}\\\\frac{tM'(t)}{M(t)}<\\\\infty. Theorem 3 (K. J. Lindberg). Let X be an infinite-dimensional closed subspace of a separable Orlicz sequence space \\\\ell_M. Then X has a subspace Y isomorphic to some Orlicz sequence space \\\\ell_N for some Orlicz function N satisfying the Œî2 condition at zero. If furthermore X has an unconditional basis then Y may be chosen to be complemented in X, and if X has a symmetric basis then X itself is isomorphic to \\\\ell_N. Theorem 4 (Lindenstrauss/Tzafriri). Every separable Orlicz sequence space \\\\ell_M contains a subspace isomorphic to \\\\ell_p for some 1\\\\leqslant p<\\\\infty. Corollary. Every infinite-dimensional closed subspace of a separable Orlicz sequence space contains a further subspace isomorphic to \\\\ell_p for some 1\\\\leqslant p<\\\\infty. Note that in the above Theorem 4, the copy of \\\\ell_p may not always be chosen to be complemented, as the following example shows. Example (Lindenstrauss/Tzafriri). There exists a separable and reflexive Orlicz sequence space \\\\ell_M which fails to contain a complemented copy of \\\\ell_p for any 1\\\\leqslant p\\\\leqslant\\\\infty. This same space \\\\ell_M contains at least two nonequivalent symmetric bases. Theorem 5 (K. J. Lindberg & Lindenstrauss/Tzafriri). If \\\\ell_M is an Orlicz sequence space satisfying \\\\textstyle\\\\liminf_{t\\\\to 0}tM'(t)/M(t)=\\\\limsup_{t\\\\to 0}tM'(t)/M(t) (i.e., the two-sided limit exists) then the following are all true. : (i) \\\\ell_M is separable. : (ii) \\\\ell_M contains a complemented copy of \\\\ell_p for some 1\\\\leqslant p<\\\\infty. : (iii) \\\\ell_M has a unique symmetric basis (up to equivalence). Example. For each 1\\\\leqslant p<\\\\infty, the Orlicz function M(t)=t^p/(1-\\\\log (t)) satisfies the conditions of Theorem 5 above, but is not equivalent to t^p. ==References== *Lindenstrauss, J., and L.

Born in Kukawa, Bornu Empire, Said fell victim to the Trans-Saharan slave trade. His father's fame as a general and his unusual aptitude for learning languages, however, led to the elevation of his social position.Paul E. Lovejoy. Mohammed Ali Nicholas Sa'id: From Enslavement to American Civil War Veteran Having learned Arabic in his youth in Central Africa, he quickly learned the Ottoman Turkish language of his enslavers. Demonstrating proficiency in Russian, he became the servant of Russian Prince Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov, who provided him with a French tutor after recognizing his exceptional linguistic abilities. By the time of his 1872 memoirs, he reported familiarity or fluency with the Kanuri, Mandara, Arabic, Turkish, Russian, German, Italian and French languages, as well as some experience with Armenian. Said traveled widely in Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the Russian Empire, later venturing to the Caribbean, South America, Canada, and the United States. In his account of his life and travels, Said decried the aggression of Usman dan Fodio against his homeland, described his pilgrimage to Mecca, reminisced about a chance encounter with the Czar, and reflected on his conversion from Islam to Christianity in Riga. From 1863‚Äì1865, Said served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Unlike most of the African Americans who served in the United States Army during the war, neither Said nor any of his ancestors had ever been enslaved in the United States. Rather, Said elected to immigrate to the United States and then volunteered to fight.Safet Dabovic. Out of Place: The Travels of Nicholas Said. Criticism, Vol. 54, No. 1., pp. 59-83 Near the end of the war, he requested attachment to the Hospital Department so that he could take up the study of medicine. An 1867 journalist's account suggests that, after the war, Said fell in love with an American woman and married her. They are reported to have settled in St. Stephens, Alabama, where Said wrote his memoirs. Said's later life is unclear, but one account has him dying in Brownsville, Tennessee.Allan D.

Said was raised primarily by his mother. According to Said, his father had four wives, and was \\"large, tall, and well proportioned; resembling more a giant than an ordinary man.\\" \\"My father greatly distinguished himself under our immortal King Mohammed El Amin Ben Mohammed El Kanemy, the Washington of Bornou... He was the terror of... the enemies of our Country, and wherever he appeared the enemy fled...\\" The military prowess of Said's father is described by an English traveler who had the opportunity to witness Barca Gana in combat. Dixon Denham accompanied a military expedition in which the forces of Bornu under Barca Gana were joined with those of an Arab slave-raiding army and those of the Sultan of Mandara. In combat against the forces of the Sokoto Caliphate, Denham reported that \\"A Fellatah chief with his own hand brought down four Bornu warriors, when Barca Gana, whose strength was gigantic, threw a spear from a distance of thirty- five yards and laid the pagan low...\\"Charles Henry Eden. \\"Africa, Seen Through Its Explorers\\" pp. 135-6, 2010, Denham's report added of Barca Gana's heroism, \\"The Bornu general had three horses killed under him by poisoned arrows.\\" While Denham attributes his survival to Barca Gana's prowess in combat, he also noted that Barca Gana had to be dissuaded from leaving the wounded white man behind, as the general did not want to divert military resources for the preservation of an adventurer who was not even a Muslim. Advised by one of his party that God seemed to want Denham preserved, Barca Gana delivered Denham to safety. Nicholas Said was not born until years after his father's wartime episode against the Sokoto Caliphate, recalled by Denham. (Jules Verne would later retell the story in his novel Five Weeks in a Balloon, but he cast Denham as the hero rather than Barca Gana, despite Denham's only surviving because Fulani warriors wanted to seize his exotic clothing without damaging it with their weapons.) Said did report his first encounter with a white man, whom he identified as the German researcher Heinrich Barth: \\"When I was about twelve years old, a large caravan arrived from Fezzan, and it was said a S√¢r√¢ (white man) was one of the party. This raised a great excitement, particularly among us children, for we had heard fabulous tales concerning them. For example, we were told that the whites were cannibals, and all the slaves that they bought were for no other but culinary purposes. Sure enough, there arrived a white man, and the King assigned him a dwelling situated in East Kouka... The first time I saw him was one day when he was in the market, outside of Kouka, and I ran from him.\\"Autobiography, pp. 25-6 ==References== Category:African Americans in the American Civil War Category:Union Army soldiers Category:1836 births Category:1882 deaths Category:Non-commissioned officers ","title":"Nicholas Said"},{"id":"60255860","text":"Anna Ascani (born 17 October 1987) is an Italian politician. == Biography == Ascani obtained a Bachelor in Philosophy in 2009 at the University of Perugia, and a master's degree at the University of Trento in 2012.

The current church building dates from 1959, built to accommodate Leicester's growing Catholic population, although the parish was first created in 1854. The current church building is in the Romanesque style with three distinctive domes in the nave of the church. A stained glass window depicting St Patrick, the parish patron, stands at the back of the church. The current parish priest is Father Raphael Imoni, who arrived at St Patrick's in September 2018. The church serves St Patrick's Catholic Voluntary Academy and English Martyrs Catholic School. == History of the Parish == The parish started life as a school chapel in Royal East Street, Leicester in 1854. The chapel was dedicated to St Patrick by Fr Nickolds OP, from Holy Cross Priory, Leicester. The mission of the chapel was handed over to the Diocese of Nottingham in 1894. Fr. Hawkins served as the first parish priest. The original chapel closed in 1940 due to a falling Catholic population in Leicester. In 1949, on the appointment of Fr. Hill as Parish Priest of Our Lady and St.Patrick's, a Mass Centre had been set up in the grandstand of the Leicester Stadium and land was acquired in Beaumont Leys Lane for a church, presbytery and parish hall. The new church was blessed and officially opened by Bishop Edward Ellis on St.Patrick's Day 1959. Fr. Sullivan was appointed Parish Priest in October 1961. Fr. Sullivan was responsible for the completion of the interior of the Church by the addition of the wooden Stations of the Cross, the statues of the Sacred Heart and St.Joseph the Worker, together with the Cross of Christ Triumphant and the two stained glass windows in the Sanctuary. These features are still present. After Fr Sullivan the Church was served by the Blessed Sacrament Fathers until Fr Neary was appointed Parish Priest. Fr Neary was succeeded by Fr Tutto who continued with the plans for further improvements. During 1982 and 1983, thanks to the generosity of benefactors, the St.Patrick's Chapel was completed by the addition of St.Patrick's statue of carved wood and parish banner. Fr Tutto was succeeded by Fr Stephen Lennon in 1986 and in 1996 Fr Michael Lynch was appointed Parish Priest. Under Fr Lynch, the parish hall was erected, which still serves as a venue for events today. Father Jimmy Browne served as Parish priest from 2000 until 2009 and during this time the church was redecorated and the sanctuary refurbished. He celebrated the golden anniversary of the parish in 2009 with a Mass celebrated with Bishop Malcolm McMahon, then Bishop of Nottingham. To celebrate the anniversary, a new stained glass window was commissioned in the Baptistry. The window depicts a course of faith through a river from natural beginnings to the depiction of the Eucharist. Father Martin Hardy arrived in the Parish in April 2009. He was a popular figure among parishioners and in the wider Leicester community, hosting Liz Kendall MP and other civic dignitaries at the annual St Patrick's celebrations. Father Raphael Imoni arrived in the parish as the parish priest as of September 2018. The mass attendance is above average for Leicester, with a weekly attendance of over 500. == Notable features == The church contains a number of notable features: * Carved Stations of the Cross * Wooden carving depicting St Patrick * Wooden carving depicting St Joseph * Prayer Room dedicated to St Brigid * Chapel dedicated to St Patrick * Stained glass window depicting St Patrick * Lady Altar with a mosaic icon of the Virgin Mary * 50th Anniversary Stained Glass Window * Original baptismal font * Carved triumphal cross depicting Christ the King * A depiction of the Holy Spirit above the tabernacle == References == == External links == * St Patrick's Catholic Church Website Category:Churches in Leicester Category:Roman Catholic churches in Leicestershire Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1959 ","title":"St Patrick's Catholic Church, Leicester"},{"id":"60255939","text":"Adrian Mo»õoc (born 11 July 1996 in Saumur) is a Romanian professional rugby union player.

Based on the Lamborghini Hurac√°n, the car is meant to be a modern reinterpretation of the De Tomaso Pantera. == Specifications == Initially called \\"Project Panther\\", the car was introduced in concept form in 2017. The name of the car was later revealed to be Project1 at its public debut in 2019. It is the first model in the company's \\"Legends Reborn\\" series. The car is based on the rolling chassis of the Lamborghini Hurac√°n and features a retro style carbon fibre body harking back to the De Tomaso Pantera. Although the resulting car is wider than the original Pantera, the wheelbase is only 12 centimetres longer, helping the car retain most proportions of the Pantera. A notable feature of the exterior of the car is the use of pop-up headlamps having LED projector lights, the first use of pop- up headlights in a new production car since the Chevrolet Corvette (C5) and Lotus Esprit were discontinued in 2004. The engine has been tuned by Ares Design and has a power output of and of torque by installing a new ECU and a new exhaust system. The car retains the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and the all-wheel-drive system from the donor car but the transmission has been reworked in order to allow for a more direct response. The exhaust system has been designed to deliver a more enhanced engine noise. The Project1 uses carbon ceramic brakes and callipers (four pistons at the front, six pistons at the rear) from Brembo with forged aluminium Vossen wheels measuring 20-inch at the front and 21-inch at the rear wrapped in Pirelli tyres measuring 255/30 R20 at the front and 325/25 R21 at the rear. The interior of the car has been completely redesigned and now features a retro design. It is upholstered in Nappa leather/Alcantara and has carbon fibre trim.

In addition to choreographing Jailhouse Rock, Romero worked with performers and choreographers who included Gene Kelly, Hermes Pan, Stanley Donen, Fred Astaire, and Michael Kidd in films that included On the Town and An American in Paris, in which he also performed during ballet sequences. He also staged dances as in the films Easter Parade, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Kiss Me Kate and television shows. Romero has been called \\"the last link to the Golden Age of movie musicals.\\" == Early life == Romero's parents were General don Miguel Quiroga Cantu and Soledad Chapa Quiroga, who had 22 sons and a daughter. His father, a general in the Mexican Army, was a confidante of Mexico's president Victoriano Huerta, and was a member of Mexico's political elite. Romero's mother fled across the border after her husband was killed in the Battle of Monterrey during the Mexican Revolution. Soledad Quiroga fled first to Laredo, Texas and then to San Antonio, where Alejandro was born on August 20, 1913. Six of Romero's siblings eventually joined the family in San Antonio. Alejandro was known as Alex from an early age.Knowles, pp. 7-11 == Career == === Early dance career === The family moved in 1921 to Los Angeles, where his older brother Carlos was working as a dancer in silent films. Carlos and his siblings began a Spanish dance act, \\"The Romeros\\", and Alex joined them in 1929.Knowles, pp. 12-22 Their dance act played on vaudeville circuits. The act went overseas in the 1930s and played at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. In one 1938 incident in Poland, Romero was almost shot by a German officer who believed him to be Jewish.Knowles, pp. 20-31 In 1941, after working in a print shop, Romero registered with Central Casting and was hired as a dancer by Warner Brothers' dance director LeRoy Prinz. He also appeared in the 1943 film The Heat's On, which starred Mae West, and Follow the Boys a 1944 film with George Raft and Vera Zorina.Knowles, pp. 32-37 In 1944, Romero was recruited by Jack Cole to join the dance department that he had just established at Columbia Pictures. He and the studio dance troupe performed in a number of Columbia films, including Eadie Was a Lady and The Thrill of Brazil, both with Ann Miller. In 1947, during a technicians' strike Cole and his dancers left Columbia to create a nightclub act.Knowles, pp. 38-49 === Film choreography === Romero left Cole's troupe in 1947 and shortly afterwards was hired by Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer dance director Robert Alton as an assistant choreographer. His first film assignment was with Gene Kelly, who was creating a dance routine to the music of Slaughter on Tenth Avenue that he would perform with Vera-Ellen for the film Words and Music. Romero also choreographed the \\"Thou Swell\\" dance performed by June Allyson and the Blackburn Twins in that film.Knowles, pp. 50-62 Romero also worked as assistant choreographer in Easter Parade and in On the Town, in which he appeared as one of the two sailors dancing with Kelly in the Day in New York ballet. He worked again with Kelly as assistant choreographer of An American in Paris, and appeared as a G.I. in the ballet sequence.Knowles, pp. 72-73 Romero's first assignment as a choreographer was in the 1950 film The Red Danube, directed by George Sidney, in which he worked with Janet Leigh, a non-dancer, in one of her earliest film roles. He then was an assistant to Alton in Annie Get Your Gun, and worked with Judy Garland on the \\"I'm An Indian Too\\" number, performing as well as choreographing. As choreographer of the 1953 film The Affairs of Dobie Gillis he choreographed dance numbers performed by Bob Fosse in his first film role.Knowles, pp. 63-68 Shoeshiner Leroy Daniels with Fred Astaire in The Band Wagon Romero assisted Hermes Pan in the film version of Kiss Me Kate, and went on to work with Michael Kidd in choreographing the 1953 film The Band Wagon, starring Fred Astaire. It was Romero's idea to hire for the film Leroy Daniels, a non-actor who was working as a shoeshiner in Los Angeles and noted for his rhythmic work. Daniels performed with Astaire in the \\"Shine on Your Shoes\\" number, set in a penny arcade, and subsequently went into show business full-time.Knowles, pp. 82-83 After working as assistant choreographer to Kidd on Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Romero was choreographer of his first big-budget film Love Me or Leave Me, starring Doris Day and James Cagney. He also was the choreographer for the 1955 film I'll Cry Tomorrow.Knowles, pp. 88-91 In 1956 he was choreographer of the Broadway musical Happy Hunting, which starred Ethel Merman. It was his only Broadway credit.Knowles, pp. 92-94 ====Jailhouse Rock==== alt= When Romero was assigned by MGM production executive Pandro S. Berman to work on a new Elvis Presley film in 1957, Presley, a non-dancer, was wary. He said that he \\"didn't want anyone making a Hollywood boy out of me.\\" Romero won over his confidence, and was helped by Russ Tamblyn, who worked with Presley on his leg movement.Knowles, pp. 97-103 The \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" number, which shows Presley dancing with other inmates, was Presley's first choreographed dance number. Rather than give him \\"slick dancing steps\\", Romero later said that he \\"chose steps that were foreign to him, but that were also like him, so he could pick them up.\\" Romero worked with Presley on the \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" number that was the climax of the film, but due to an oversight received no screen credit for his work. Berman sent Romero a letter of apology that was published in Variety. Romero's biographer Mark Knowles says that the \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" is \\"seen by many as a groundbreaking sequence in the history of film dancing, a transitional number propelling the film musical into the modern era.\\"Knowles, p. 107 He went on to choreograph three other Presley films: Clambake (1967), Double Trouble, (1967) and Speedway (1968). === Later career === After Jailhouse Rock, Romero was choreographer of Tom Thumb (1958) which starred Russ Tamblyn. As film musicals waned, Romero worked as choreographer on non-musical films with dance sequences such as The George Raft Story (1961), as well as television shows, including The Eddie Fisher Show. He choreographed burlesque numbers for Joanne Woodward in The Stripper (1963). He also staged nightclub acts for Howard Keel, Bobby Short and other performers.Knowles, pp. 108-123 In 1976 he returned to MGM to stage a dance number with Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire in That's Entertainment Part II. He danced with Kelly in a 1978 television special, \\"An American in Pasadena\\". He also performed in the 1981 film Pennies From Heaven, and worked on television shows and films throughout the 1980s. His last work was for Tracey Ullman's Show.Knowles, pp. 133-141 == Personal life == Romero married Frances Driscoll in 1936. She died in 1997.

He was a pioneer of Slavic Native Faith in Ukraine during the interwar period. == Biography == Shaian was educated at the University of Lviv. In 1934, he had a spiritual revelation at the top of Mount Grekhit in the Ukrainian Carpathian mountains. According to him, this inspired him to seek a pagan renewal. Shaian proposed a \\"pan-Aryan\\" approach to European paganism, developed in opposition to National Socialist Germany's focus on the Germanic world. Shaian presented his vision of a \\"pan-Aryan renaissance\\" in a paper at an Indologist seminar in Lviv in 1937.Ivakhiv 2005a p. 11 Shaian's theology was polytheistic and viewed God as a manifold essence that manifests itself through the various deities of Slavic mythology.Lesiv 2013 p. 41 In 1944 he had to flee from Lviv. He spent time in refugee camps and became involved in the Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences. Around the same time he founded the Order of the Knights of the Solar God, a religious-political organization active in the opposition to the Soviet invasion. Shaian worked to affiliate his group with the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. One of Shaian's initiates in this organization was Lev Sylenko, who eventually also became a major figure in Slavic Native Faith in Ukraine. Shaian spent the latter part of his life in exile in London.Ivakhiv 2005a p. 12 == Legacy == Like with other neopagan currents associated with the Eastern Bloc, the post-war Ukrainian diaspora in the West was important for the continuation of Shaian's teachings. Small communities of Shaian's followers were in particular active in Toronto and Hamilton in Canada.Lesiv 2013 p. 42 After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the first organization in Ukraine to adher to Shaian's polytheistic paganism was Pravoslavia, founded in Kiev in 1993. It was created by the philologist, folklorist and religious studies scholar Halyna Lozko, who was initiated by Myroslav Sytnyk in Hamilton. Lozko has also launched projects such as the Svitovyd Center for the Rebirth of Ukrainian Culture, the School of the Native Faith, the Museum of the Book of Veles (1996‚Äì1998) and the journal Svaroh.Ivakhiv 2005b pp. 228‚Äì229 To coordinate activities throughout Ukraine, Lozko co-founded the umbrella organization Native Faith Association of Ukraine (–û–±'—î–¥–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω—è –†—ñ–¥–Ω–æ–≤—ñ—Ä—ñ–≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω, ORU) in 1998. It was officially registered as a pagan religious organization in 2001. It includes a number of local congregations and has made an effort to establish regular calendar celebrations. It has also been active in the neopagan interfaith activities of the European Congress of Ethnic Religions.Ivakhiv 2005a p. 22 Shaian and Sylenko had parted ways by the 1970s, and came to represent two rivaling tendencies within the Slavic neopagan scene. Sylenko's theology sets itself apart from Shaian's by being more monotheistic. The rivalry has also led to conflicting accounts of Shaian's and Sylenko's involvement with each other, with Sylenko-derived RUNVira sources claiming that Sylenko never had been a disciple of Shaian. ==Sources== ===Citations=== ===References=== * * Ivakhiv, Adrian (2005b). \\"The Revival of Ukrainian Native Faith\\".

It opened at the Gallery van Diemen, 21 Unter den Linden, on Sunday 15 October 1922. The exhibition was hosted by the Soviet People's Commissariat for Education, and proved controversial in relationship to the current developments in avant-garde art in Russia, most notably Constructivism. ==Preparations== In 1918 the Fine Arts section (IZO) of Narkompros established an International Bureau which included Nikolay Punin, David Shterenberg, Vladimir Tatlin and Vassily Kandinsky. They worked with Ludwig Baehr, an artistically inclined ex-Officer in the German Imperial Army. Baehr had been on the German negotiating team for the Treaty of Brest Litovsk and was subsequently assigned to making links with the Russian intelligentsia. He established links with the Novembergruppe and the Arbeitsrat f√ºr Kunst (Workers' Council for Art). In particular he carried messages between Bruno Taut, Walter Gropius and Max Pechstein. However he was also importing books and printing presses into Russia against the policy laid down by the German Foreign Office, and after his arrest in late 1919, this channel of communication no longer worked. In 1921 they gave Kandinsky a mandate to organise an exhibition of contemporary Russian art in Berlin. However following political and aesthetic differences, the organisation of the exhibition was delayed as different personnel came to take on responsibility for the exhibition. In the end it was organised by Shterenberg, by then Director of IZO, Nathan Altman, and Naum Gabo. ==Catalogue== The Catalogue was published by Workers International Relief to raise money in response to a drought and famine in the Volga area, particularly those lands occupied by the Volga Germans. It featured a foreword with sections written by David Shterenberg, Edwin Redslob (in his capacity as Reichskunstwart) and Arthur Holitscher, who in 1921 had published an account of his visit to Soviet Russia. ===Foreword=== Shterenberg recounted how previous attempts by Russian artists to keep in touch with their western counterparts had been limited to the issuing of proclamations and manifestoes, but that with this exhibition a real step had been made to bring both groups together. The stated aim of the exhibition was to display the full story of the development of Russian art through both war and revolution. He referred to the transformative effect of the October Revolution in opening up art to mass of people, who had thus re- invigorated what had been the dead, official culture of \\"high art\\". This dynamic had also opened up new opportunities for Russia's creative forces, as their ideas could then be carried into the public spaces of towns and cities, which were being transformed by the revolution. There were new approaches being developed as regards urban decoration and architecture: the artist was no longer working in an isolated way, but rather in close contact with the people, who sometimes responded with enthusiasm and sometimes with scorn. Under these new testing circumstances some fell by the wayside, but others flourished. The limitation of the canvas, or the \\"stone coffins\\" which passed for housing were being swept away as the new society demanded a new environment. He continued that the immediately following the revolution the focus was on the decoration of public spaces, which however would be unsuitable for the exhibition. The exhibition thus focussed on the work of different movements active in Russia: the more traditional Union of Russian Artists, Mir Iskusstva, the Jack of Diamonds Group, the Impressionists and such leftist groups as the cubists, suprematists and the constructivists. Other exceptional work by artists who did not fit any of these groups was also included. Posters from the Russian Civil War had also been included, as had items from the State Porcelain factory. He also stated that the Soviet government sought German works of art to exhibit in Soviet Russia Redslob's contribution sought to balance the rooted-ness of artists in their own culture with a recognition of importance of contemporary issues in art. He described a shared responsibility for building Europe and said he was moved by the request for German art to be displayed in Russia. Holitscher provided s statement where he suggested that artists were more able to communicate what was happening in a period of dissolution of one epoch and the emergence of another. Mentioning the art movements of the previous fifty years, he said that these should not be dismissed as \\"studio revolutions\\". He described how the coming of a spiritual revolution was first sensed by groups of precocious artists who would then be picked up by connoisseurs, collectors, dealers and museum directors, and even some snobs. Thus it becomes drawn into bourgeois society and the world of commercial cunning and social ambition. Only rarely does it become a matter of the pleasure and satisfaction of inner understanding. Nevertheless, it is the masses, whether fully or semiconsciously, who spur on the artist to new achievement. Thus the revolution which emerges from the artist's studio may not have as much impact as those who guide the political and economic interests of society, nevertheless there are periods when the enslavement of the masses has a greater role in the creative works of their contemporaries, even if the circumstances in which Praxiteles, Michelangelo or D√ºrer worked are no longer understood. In such times the artist has the power to shape the political and economic aspirations of the people. He continued that prior to a revolutionary transformation of society it was thought that the artist would be the first to embrace the new. However this is only partially true. The revolutionary artists is as much shaken as the rest of the general population, and only a few, singled out as human beings and as artists, follow their inner conviction and serve the destiny of the people. They attempt to link up with the masses while the \\"studio revolutionaries\\" stand on the sidelines, pretending to join in but in fact sabotaging the movement. While the new vision is becoming manifest in the public spaces of the streets, squares, bridges and barricades, becoming integrated into the vigorous life of the people, the \\"studio revolutionaries\\" crawl back to the haze of oil paint in their studios. The forward development of art is no longer dependent on the vision of a single prophetic man, but rather the natural urge of the people which rises up as a triumphant choir. The art theory born of the old individualised world is swept away by the victorious revolution. The art that arises in this way cannot be criticised in terms of artistic activity, but rather in terms of the political and economic circumstances which give rise to it. Such art will within itself create new aesthetic laws, will in itself mean revolution rather than simply a segment of revolution. \\"It will mean the totality of the creative forces of an epoch‚Äìnot an isolated aspect of its many possible manifestations.\\" ==Reception== * German: Paul Westheim: ‚ÄúThe Exhibition of Russian Artists‚Äù (Originally published as ‚ÄúDie Ausstellung der Russen‚Äù), Das Kunstblatt (November 1922) * German: Adolf Behne ‚ÄúOn the Russian Exhibition‚Äù (Originally published as ‚ÄúDer Staatsanwalt sch√ºzt das Bild‚Äù), Die Weltb√ºhne No. 47 (23 November 1922) * Hungarian: Alfr√©d Kem√©ny: \\"Notes to the Russian Artists‚Äô Exhibition in Berlin\\", (Originally published as ‚ÄúJegyzetek az orosz m≈©v√©szek berlini ki√°llit√°shoz,‚Äù), Egys√©g (February, 1923) * Hungarian: Ern≈ë K√°llai: ‚ÄúThe Russian Exhibition in Berlin‚Äù (Originally published as ‚ÄúA berlini orosz ki√°llf√≠√°s‚Äù, Akasztott Ember vol. 2 (February 15, 1923)] * Serbo-Croat: Branko Ve Poljanski: ‚ÄúThrough the Russian Exhibition‚Äù (Originally published as ‚ÄúKroz rusku izlo≈æbu u berlinu‚Äù), Zenit vol. 3, no. 22 (March 1923) ==Artists exhibited== * Nathan Altmann: Russia, Petrokommuna, Painting * Yury Annenkov (1889-1974): Forest * Abram Arkhipov (1862-1930)): At the Market, Peasant Woman with Red Shawl, * Vladimir Baranov-Rossine (1888‚Äì1944): Pink Colour * David Burliuk (1882-1967): ==Gallery== Abram Arkhipov Peasant Woman with Red Shawl.pngPeasant Woman with Red Shawl by Abram Arkhipov –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ë–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–≤- –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–Ω—ç - –†–æ–∑–æ–≤–æ–µ.jpgPink Colour by Vladimir Baranov-Rossine Supremus 55 (Malevich, 1916).jpg Suprematism (1916) by Kazimir Malevich ==References== Category:1922 in Germany Category:Soviet art ","title":"First Russian Art Exhibition"},{"id":"60256598","text":"Li Qian (, born 13 February 1989) is a Chinese para table tennis player who has won four gold medals and one silver medal from three Paralympic Games (2008, 2012, and 2016).

The coup attempt consisted of a group of some 70 armed dissidents crossed into capital Lom√© from Ghana in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the government of President General Gnassingb√© Eyad√©ma. ==The coup attempt== According to radio reports, at about 20:00 UTC, the rebels entered Lom√© (located on the border with Ghana) in about 30‚Äì40 trucks. They headed straight for a military camp in where Eyad√©ma resided, and opened fire with automatic weapons and rocket launchers. The rebels also attacked the radio station and the governing RPT party headquarters. A radio report said the rebel attack was repulsed by a counterattack led by Eyadema himself. The crushing of the coup attempt involved Togolese Armed Forces troops and warplanes. At least 14 or 13 people were killed in an all-night street battle, and 19 of the rebels were captured. 6 civilians also were killed, state-run radio reported. The West German Foreign Ministry officials said in Bonn that their citizen, a businessman, was killed in the fighting. They described the battle as an apparent bid to topple the government. ==Aftermath== The Ghana‚ÄìTogo border was closed. People were ordered off the streets, and an indefinite curfew was imposed on Lom√©. Following the requested of Eyad√©ma for military help of France, the French Defence Ministry said on 26 September that it was sending warplanes and troops to Togo.

It is set in rural western Pennsylvania during the autumn of 1943 and describes how the protagonist, Annabelle \\"learned how to lie\\" and \\"that what I said and what I did mattered\\" in relation to two interlopers in her life: the bully Betty Glengarry, and the mysterious drifter Toby. It was named a Newbery Honor book in 2016. ==Plot summary== The novel is narrated by twelve-year-old Annabelle McBride, who lives on a farm with her family and walks with her two younger brothers, James and Henry to school in the town of Wolf Hollow. A new girl, Betty Glengarry, started attending the same school, in October 1943; she was sent to Wolf Hollow to live with her grandparents because, as rumor has it, she has been deemed 'incorrigible' by the city. One morning, Betty confronts Annabelle on their way to school, threatening to beat Annabelle or her younger brothers if Annabelle does not give her something nice; because Annabelle's house has a purple-colored glass window, Betty believes their family is extremely wealthy. Several years earlier, shortly after the start of the Great Depression, a reclusive drifter named Toby had arrived in town, staying in an abandoned smokehouse living on berries and game. Little is known about him, except that he was a veteran of World War I and that he had borrowed Annabelle's family's camera on a semi- permanent basis. He also carries three large guns with him wherever he goes, which causes suspicion within many people‚Äôs minds. Annabelle takes a penny from her piggy bank for Betty, but Betty refuses it and beats Annabelle with a stick. Later she kills a quail in front of Annabelle; the ensuing confrontation is witnessed by Toby, setting events into motion that result into Betty getting extremely angry at Toby and wants to get revenge eventually. Later that day, Annabelle is standing in the road with her friend Ruth, talking to Mr. Ansel, a friendly local man, who also happens to be German. A rock comes flying from the hillside above and hits Ruth in the eye, resulting in the loss of her eye. This nor the confrontation with Toby deterred Betty from her bullying of Annabelle, until Annabelle stands up to Betty. In reply, Betty and her friend (and possible love interest, street name crush) Andy, string a sharpened wire across the pathway through the hollow. This wire then cuts Annabelle's little brother James across the forehead. Although James is fine, this still leads to Annabelle sharing Betty's cruelty with her parents, who, concerned, go to have a talk with Betty and her grandparents (who she lives with). During this conversation, Betty claims that she saw Toby throw the rock that hit Ruth in the eye. She claims that she and Andy were up in the belfry and that's how she saw it. The Glengarrys are angry at the McBrides for suggesting that Betty would hurt Annabelle, and believe Betty that she saw Toby throw the rock. However, Annabelle's teacher, Mrs. Taylor later reveals that Betty and Andy couldn't have been in the belfry on the day Ruth got hurt, as she had kicked them out a few days previous to that and the door had remained locked ever since. This is to be investigated, when in a storm, Betty goes missing, and in the pictures Toby took, Annabelle's Aunt Lily, who has always distrusted Toby, finds a picture taken from the hillside the day Ruth was hurt. What they later learn is that Toby is also missing, and Lily suggests that Toby might've taken Betty. Refusing to believe that this is the case, Annabelle sneaks out in the night and finds Toby at the smokehouse. On her way she thinks she hears a porcupine. She convinces Toby to come with her, and hide in her barn until things get sorted out, and she provides him with food and drink and a book, Treasure Island. In a moment of weakness, Toby tells Annabelle about his experiences in the war, including how he scarred his hand, but Annabelle doesn't understand much of it. She also suggests that Toby cut his hair and beard, the result being that he is unrecognizable. This, combined with the porcupine she heard earlier gives Annabelle an idea, that Betty might've fallen down the well outside Toby's smokehouse, and that Toby, in his newly shorn disguise could be the one to save her, thus restoring his name. Toby, under the alias Jordan, goes down the well to rescue Betty, who has fallen in and become impaled on a pipe. He successfully gets her out and she is immediately rushed to the hospital, while Annabelle's father invites Toby/Jordan home for dinner, which he accepts to, but keeps his gloves on, so as to hide his scars. Lily is immediately smitten with Jordan, and has flirtatious conversation throughout dinner. Everyone excepting Annabelle and her parents go to bed. Eventually Annabelle's mother, Sarah, figures out that Jordan is Toby, and Annabelle explains what she did. They also receive a report from the hospital saying that Betty is blaming Toby incorrectly for pushing her down the well, but it makes no sense to the witnesses, as he was the first to spot her and save her life. Annabelle's parents agree to let Toby stay and help fix the barn, and they hide all of his things in the barn loft. Annabelle meanwhile makes plans for forcibly getting Andy to reveal that Betty is lying about everything she claims Toby did, but before she can put her plan in action, James and Henry find Toby's hat and camera in the loft and Lily calls the police. Toby leaves without saying goodbye. Annabelle goes back to the barn that night, and runs into Toby, who tells her he would have liked to have had a daughter like her before vanishing for good. Annabelle notices that he left one of his guns, the only one that worked. The next morning, the family receives word that Betty Glengarry has died from her infection. Over the phone, Annabelle gets Andy to confess that Betty threw the rock that hurt Ruth, and doubt arises about whether Toby pushed Betty down the well or not. Annabelle wakes up early the next morning and her mother informs her that Toby was found, shot, and killed. She says he pulled one of his guns off his back, suggesting that he wanted to die. The rest of the family discovers that Jordan was Toby when they see Annabelle wearing his gloves. They also discover that he left his Congressional Medal of Honor in one of the pockets. Annabelle goes to Toby's smokehouse one more time, and takes the pictures that are on the walls. She suggests to Henry and James that they take turns with the camera, and while James declines, Henry accepts, suggesting that Annabelle and Henry's relationship might flourish in the future. The book ends with Betty's and Toby's funerals, and gives us the final image of Annabelle sitting beside Toby's grave, telling him about her life. ==Development== Wolk's family farm inspired the setting for Wolf Hollow; her mother and two uncles lived on the farm and walked to school. In addition, Wolk stated she was inspired by contemporary events, as she \\"hoped to create through Betty a microcosm of what was happening in the war. A ferocious bully and his sidekicks were murdering and terrorizing the world. Bringing out the worst in people, and sometimes the best. And Betty was doing the same on a much smaller scale in Wolf Hollow.\\" ==Reception== In 2017, the American Library Association named Wolf Hollow to its list of Newbery Honor winners, alongside Ashley Bryan's Freedom Over Me and Adam Gidwitz's The Inquisitor's Tale. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Young adult novels Category:Newbery Honor-winning works Category:2016 American novels Category:2016 children's books Category:Novels set in Pennsylvania ","title":"Wolf Hollow (novel)"},{"id":"60256669","text":"Thomas Mewburn Crook (4 December 1869 ‚Äì 18 January 1949) was an English sculptor who primarily produced portraiture and ecclesiastical works, many of which were exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts. ==Biography== Crook was born at Tonge Moor, Bolton, Lancashire, son of cotton dealer James Crook and his wife Dinah (n√©e Hamilton). He was educated at the Xavierian Collegiate School in Chorlton-on-Medlock, Bolton Art School, and the Manchester School of Art (where he graduated with an Art Master's Certificate), before attending the Royal College of Art in London. After working as an assistant modelling master at the Royal College of Art from 1894 to 1895, he returned to Manchester, becoming modelling master and anatomy lecturer at the Manchester School of Art from 1896 to 1905, when he moved to Chiswick in West London with his widowed mother and sisters and set up a practice.Who's who in Art 1927, ed.

Secretary from 1913 to after World War II), and became a Fellow of the Royal Society of British Sculptors in 1923. With his wife, Winifred, a mosaicist (n√©e Saunders; she had been Crook's assistant), Crook had five children. He lived at Chiswick until his death in 1949.Westminster Record, March 2019, Fr Michael Dunne, Parish Priest of Our Lady of Grace, Chiswick, p. 15- 'Prayer: New home for sculpture in Chiswick' ==Works== Crook's early work included decorative reliefs for Manchester Council Chamber and a life size plaster figure of St Patrick for the Church of the Sacred Heart, Thornton-Cleveleys, Liverpool.

Collections of his works exist at St Mary's Church, Standishgate, Wigan; St Mark's Church, North Audley Street, London; St Catherine's Church, Rotherhithe; The National Memorial Arboretum; City Hall, Cardiff; New Malden Library. His work is also represented as war memorials in Streetly, Felixstowe, Caterham and Raynes Park. After a bomb struck the church of Our Lady of Grace, Chiswick, which Crook and his family attended, in 1944, he endeavoured to repair considerable damage done to the Stations of the Cross produced by nineteenth-century Belgian artist Charles Bayaert. Crook's declining health prevented him from completing the restoration, which his widow continued. In 2019, 'Prayer', the first of Crook's works to be exhibited at the Royal Academy, was given by the family to the parish of Our Lady of Grace, Chiswick, having previously been owned by Crook's daughter, Sister Bernadette Crook, herself an internationally renowned painter of icons, who died in 2018. ==References== ==External links== * https://tmewburncrook.com ‚Äì A website run by the family of T.

Cir. 2002), was a case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, on appeal from the United States Court of Federal Claims arising out of a 1998 lawsuit brought against the United States in an attempt to ensure that military benefits promised in exchange for military service would continue.Major Samuel W. Morris, \\"A Survey of Military Retirement Benefits\\", Military Law Review, Volume 177 (2003), p. 142. Ultimately, the Federal Circuit heard the case en banc and denied the benefits requested by the plaintiffs, leaving it to Congress to fashion a solution. It has been described as \\"[o]ne of the most important cases the court decided\\" in the area of military pay and benefits.Scott M. McCaleb, \\"Appeals From District Courts In Little Tucker Act cases\\", United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit: A History : 1990-2002, p. 379. ==Facts of the case== The Federal Circuit summarized the facts of the case as follows: ==Plaintiffs== The primary named plaintiff in the case was Lt. Col. William \\"Sam\\" O. Schism Jr., a decorated combat Veteran of the US Navy and US Air Force, who had served in WWII, the Korean War, and Vietnam. Schism served in the United States Air Special Operations Command, 4th Air Commando Squadron, 7th Special Operations Squadron, and for the OSI. His combat and special operation experiences, specifically during the Vietnam conflict, were highlighted in 'Call Sign: Spectre' by Jeff Noecker and 'Spectre Gunner' by David M. Burns. Schism also appeared in the documentary series DC Wings Over Vietnam. Schism was the aircraft commander (AC) of the Lockheed AC-130A gunship 'The First Lady' (also known as 'The Arbitrator'). Flying out of The Royal Thai Air Force base in Ubon Thailand whilst on a 'truck hunt mission' on March 25, 1971, the aircraft took a direct hit from enemy anti-aircraft attacks over the Ho Chi Minh Trail resulting in a crash landing with zero casualties and full aircraft recovery. Schism was awarded the United States Distinguished Flying Cross for this mission. The 'First Lady' is now on display at the US Air Force Armament Museum located in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. Schism and fellow plaintiff Robert Reinlie filed Schism v. United States, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida. Schism was represented by Brigadier General and Medal of Honor recipient George \\"Bud\\" Day. After the district court denied relief, the case was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and then went to the United States Supreme Court, which denied certiorari, thereby upholding the Federal Circuit ruling that any relief needed to come from Congress: The United States Department of Justice, arguing the case on behalf of the United States, wrote: \\"We understand and appreciate the dissatisfaction of the plaintiffs with the change in the retirement pay system, as they have rendered long and faithful service to our country in time of peace and war. However, if they are to get any relief, it must come from Congress, as this is not within [a court's] jurisdiction.\\" ==Panel decision== The case was initially heard by a judicial panel composed of Chief Judge Haldane Mayer, Judge Pauline Newman, and Judge S. Jay Plager. The panel unanimously found that the recruiters, in promising lifetime healthcare to recruits at the direction of the Department of Defense, were making a valid offer with appropriate consideration to create a binding contract. The government sought en banc review, which was granted. Following the en banc hearing, the court as a whole reversed the panel in a nine to four decision written by Judge Paul Redmond Michel, which held that the recruiters had no authority to bind the government to the promises that were made because Congress had not provided for such care. All of the original panel members, along with Judge Arthur Gajarsa, dissented from this ruling.W. Stanfield Johnson, \\"The Federal Circuit's Great Dissenter And Her 'National Policy of Fairness To Contractors',\\" Public Contract Law Journal, Vol. 40, No. 2 (Winter 2011), p. 310. ==References== Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit cases Category:Veterans' affairs in the United States Category:United States Court of Federal Claims Category:1988 in the United States ","title":"Schism v.

An anime television series adaptation by Lerche aired from January to March 2020. ==Plot== Kamome Academy is famous for its rumors regarding its Seven Mysteries and supernatural occurrences. Nene Yashiro, a first-year high-school student who loves the occult and wishes for a boyfriend, summons the Seventh and most famous Mystery, \\"Hanako-san of the Toilet\\", a girl who allegedly haunts the bathroom and can grant wishes for the right price. Upon summoning her, Yashiro discovers that \\"Hanako-san\\" is nothing like the rumors say; Hanako is a boy. With a turn of events, she is spiritually bound to Hanako and becomes his assistant, helping him destroy evil supernaturals and change rumors in order to maintain the balance between the spirit world and the human world. Along the way, Yashiro learns about her connection to the spirit world and the dark secrets regarding Hanako and his past. ==Characters== ===Protagonists=== ; : :Nene Yashiro is a first year high school student at Kamome Academy. She summons Hanako and wishes for her crush, Teru Minamoto, to return her feelings. A turn of events again, Hanako swallows a scale from the same mermaid to inflict himself with her curse and spread its effects, permitting Yashiro to remain human unless she is immersed in water. Having bound their souls together through the curse, he has Yashiro become his human assistant as payment. Yashiro works with Hanako to change and spread new rumors of supernaturals in the school to keep them under control. She is capable of destroying a School Mystery's yorishiro, their source of power; upon doing so, she falls asleep and views the memory associated with the yorishiro. :Yashiro's best friend is Aoi Akane, who loves to tell her new rumors. She wears two hair clips resembling magatama and a skull brooch on her school uniform. Yashiro is a very positive, sensitive, and caring girl. She is deeply insecure and genuinely fears that no one will ever love her back; after receiving the curse, she confesses to Hanako that she had realized what her true wish had been: she wanted someone, anyone, to return her feelings, not Teru specifically.Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, Chapter 1 Yashiro is insecure about her large ankles, often being compared to daikons as a running gag in the series. :Despite repeatedly claiming Hanako is not her type and Hanako's relentless teasing, she cares immensely for Hanako and after learning about his past, wants to be able to protect him.Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, Chapter 21 She is intuitive and sensitive to changes in his personality, and is deeply affected whenever she learns new information about his past life. ; : : The most famous rumor in the school, Hanako-kun is the Seventh Mystery of Kamome Academy. According to his rumor, Hanako can be summoned if one knocks on the third stall of the third floor of the girl's bathroom in the old school building; he is able to grant wishes to those who summon him in exchange for a suitable price. The strongest and the leader of the Seven Mysteries, Hanako fights with a kitchen knife and his two haku-joudai, spirit orbs that assist him in monitoring others and granting him immunity to exorcism lightning. His duty is to monitor all apparitions in the school and maintain the balance between humans and apparitions.Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, Chapter 2 :Though childish and mischievous, Hanako puts up a front to mask his true emotions and is rather serious beneath the surface. He takes his duties seriously, having been promised by God that he would be absolved of his past sins if he fulfilled his duties.Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, Chapter 3 He is secretive about his past life. Previously, his name was and he also attended Kamome Academy. A second-year middle school student in 1969, he often came to school with bruises and cuts, having been repeatedly abused by someone he refused to reveal the identity of. He harbored a deep passion for astronomy and had dreams of becoming an astronaut and going to the moon. According to Tsuchigomori, the Fifth Mystery and his homeroom teacher at the time, Hanako was destined to become a science teacher, until his fate changed for unknown reasons. He killed his younger twin brother, Tsukasa Yugi, and died young. Hanako is the only known person to ever have altered his fate.Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, Chapter 14 :By inflicting himself with the Mermaid's Curse, he bound his and Yashiro's souls together. Though he often teases her, Hanako comes to deeply cherish Yashiro and will go to extreme lengths to help her when she is in need. ; : :Kou is a third-year at Kamome Academy's middle school division and the second eldest son of the Minamoto Clan, a family of strong exorcists that believe all supernaturals are inherently evil. He uses a spear called the Raiteijou, a weapon passed down in the Minamoto family that transforms the yielder's spiritual power into lightning that exorcises supernaturals. Tasked by his older brother, Teru, to exorcise all Seven Mysteries, Kou attempts to exorcise Hanako but does not possess enough spiritual power to do so. Not giving up, he tags Hanako and Yashiro around the school for a while and comes to the realization that Hanako did not seem to be an 'evil' supernatural. As a result, Kou vows to learn more about him and other supernaturals (like Mitsuba) before blindly exorcising them, much to the dissatisfaction of his brother.Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, Chapter 10 :When Kou finds Mitsuba haunting the lockers, he offers to spend the day with him in attempt to fulfill his final regrets so he can pass on peacefully. The two were in the same homeroom class in first year and Kou feels guilty for not remembering. After Tsukasa turns Mitsuba into a violent supernatural against his will, Kou watches Hanako destroy Mistuba and is devastated by the loss of his friend. Enraged and upset, he vows to get stronger to destroy evil supernaturals like Tsukasa.Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, Chapter 20 :Kou is justice seeking and possesses a brave and kind personality, though he often finds himself in trouble due to his inexperience and low spiritual power. He is protective of Yashiro when he interprets Hanako as being mean or perverted. A running gag in the series is his earring on his right ear, an omamori that says '‰∫§ÈÄö' (traffic). ; : (Japanese); Kyle Igneczi (English) :Mitsuba was Kou's middle school classmate in their first year who was killed in a freak accident. He became a ghost and haunted the middle school lockers, calling out to students and hoping someone would remember him. Kou sees him after hearing about his rumor and though he doesn't remember him from school, decides to help him fulfill whatever regret was keeping him as at the school in order to help him pass on. :Mitsuba regrets having no friends while he was alive, and in his wish to Tsukasa, said he wanted everyone to remember him. Because Tsukasa believed his initial wish was too vague, he decides that Mitsuba's real wish was that he wanted to stay with his friends forever. He grants him this wish instead and changes Mitsuba's rumour, turning him into a violent supernatural against his will. Tsukasa forces Mitsuba to kill Kou and fulfill his wish of being with his friend forever (through death), but Hanako arrives and destroys Mitsuba before he can do so. Tsukasa saves a part of his soul and recreates a new Mitsuba by attaching it to a body formed of low level spirits he had killed. After killing No. 3, Tsukasa forces the new Mitsuba to eat No. 3's heart to become the new Third Mystery. Despite not being the original and having no memories, the new Mitsuba has the same personality and dreams of the old one, now wishing to become a real human. :Previously, Mitsuba didn't have friends because he was narcissistic and rude. Hoping to change in middle school, he repressed his personality, but then became bland and easily forgotten. He was a talented and awarded photographer in the school's photography club. Mitsuba makes up insulting nicknames for people; he calls Kou 'hella lame traffic safety earring', Yashiro 'daikon-senpai', and Hanako 'crazy knife'.Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, Chapter 35 Underneath his rudeness and narcissism, Mitsuba is desperate to be happy and becomes dejected when he thinks about his failures in his original life. ===The Seven Mysteries=== The Seven Mysteries of Kamome Academy are the seven most famous supernatural rumours in the school, and their corresponding supernaturals serve to maintain the students' safety from murderous supernaturals. Leading them is Hanako, who is the Seventh and most famous mystery. Each Mystery has their own Boundary, a divine yorishiro, and an aspect of the school that they control. Their Boundary is a section of the school where their power is the strongest. Boundaries are the 'sea' between the Near Shore, where the living reside, and the Far Shore, where other apparitions exist and thus contain a small amount of water on the ground. A divine yorishiro is an item they cherish that acts as the source of their power. When a yorishiro is destroyed (by removing its seal), the Mystery's designated seat as a School Mystery and their power is removed. Thus, they are usually kept in the deepest region of the Boundary or safeguarded by the mystery themselves. ; : ::Representatives: Kako, Akane Aoi, and Mirai  Aspect: Time : The Three Clock Keepers guard the clock tower of Kamome Academy and control time. Kako controls the past and can rewind time. One of Yashiro's classmates, , is a human who is secretly a Clock Keeper; he controls the present and can stop time for five minutes each day. Mirai controls the future and can fast-forward time. ; : ::Representative:  Aspect: Space : The Misaki Stairs is a staircase in front of the art room. Anyone who steps on the fourth step is rumoured to be transported to the spirit world, shredded to death by \\"Misaki\\", and have their blood splattered on the staircase the following day. Yako, the kitsune spirit of a school inari statue, is the current No. 2. She fell in love with Misaki, a Kamome Academy school teacher who could see her, taught her how to read and write, and included her in his class photo. She never saw him again after he was rumoured to have died in an accident on the school stairs. As her rumours changed, Yako was forced to shred those who entered her boundary and use their limbs to recreate Misaki. Her yorishiro is a pair of cutting shears, a gift from Misaki. ; ::Representative: Mitsuba („Éü„ÉÑ„Éê)  Aspect: Fear : The Hell of Mirrors is a boundary once controlled by a bird-like supernatural. The Mirrors reveal one's deepest fears and insecurities, gaining power based on how much fear the person has. Tsukasa killed the previous representative and his heart is ingested by Mitsuba, who became the new No. 3. ; ::Representative: Shijima Mei („Ç∑„Ç∏„Éû„É°„Ç§) : Shijima Mei was a third-year art student rumoured to have committed suicide because her parents didn't approve of her choice to pursue art professionally; in reality, Mei had been gravely ill and died before she could graduate. While working on an art assignment in the hospital, Mei imagined a fictional world where her alternate, healthy self could draw happily in a tower, wishing for her alternate to draw in her place after she dies. Unknowingly, Mei creates the supernatural Shijima, her alternate and ideal self, who watched over her for the remainder of her life and vowed to protect her. After the human Mei dies, her art is showcased in the art room and sparks the false rumours, which deeply angers Shijima because they tarnish Mei's reputation. Her Boundary is the tower within Mei's painting. She has the power to paint and create fictional worlds where people can live based on their deepest wishes. ; : ::Representative: : The 4 pm Bookstacks is a mysterious room filled with books about every student's past, present and future, whose door is only accessible at 4 pm. The books come in 3 colours; white books record the living, black books record the dead, and red books contain the future and are forbidden to read. The curator of the Bookstacks is Tsuchigomori, a spider-like supernatural who lives as a human teacher at Kamome Academy. He is currently Kou's homeroom teacher and was previously Hanako's homeroom teacher before he died. As his teacher, he cared for Hanako and was deeply affected when he died. Before his death, Hanako asked Tsuchigomori to keep his most cherished possession, a rock he believed to have fell from the moon. The rock becomes Tsuchigomori's yorishiro after Hanako dies. No. 6 ‚Äì The Reaper ::Representative: Shinigami-sama : On the night of tsukimi, the Reaper is rumoured to steal the lives of those who fall asleep while waiting to view the moon and can be heard playing a melody on the flute by individuals who will die soon. As a result, people weave baskets all night to stay awake and protect those who can hear the melody. The current No. 6 is Shinigami-sama, the God of Death. His Boundary lies below the school is the closest one to the Far Shore. His yorishiro is Sumire, a descendant of Aoi who he guarded until she was sacrificed. ; ::Representative: Hanako-Kun : The most famous School Mystery. Hanako's yorishiro is on his face, but his boundary is unknown. ===Kamome Academy Supernaturals=== Apart from the Seven Mysteries, there are other, less powerful supernaturals that roam the school. They rely on student rumors to gain power, unlike the Mysteries which already have theirs so popular and widespread among the student body. ; : :Known as \\"Yousei-San\\", the Mokke are in actual fact, sweets-loving rabbit-like supernaturals. They have a slight case of kleptomania, enjoy committing small, random acts of theft. Due to their timidness and weak appearance, the Mokke tend to merge together to create large, horrifying creatures to fight off enemies, which scares the student population. ;Kodama : :Known as \\"The Confession Tree\\". It was known to be planted by 'The God of Love'. Kodama is actually a spirit in the form of a tree determined to spread love among the students, but can be too meddlesome and forceful with its methods. After it is defeated by Hanako, it turns to the size of a broccoli, having been weakened greatly. ===Antagonists=== ; : :Hanako's younger identical twin brother. When they were still alive, the twins were supposedly very close until he was killed by Hanako. He is cheerful and overwhelmingly childish, but his personality switches quickly to show a disturbing and deranged side. He does not think about actions and acts on whims, deciding to kill things merely because he feels it is fun. The twins have opposing beliefs; while Hanako stresses the importance of maintaining a peaceful balance between humans and supernaturals, Tsukasa believes that the two should behave how they desire, even if it means wrecking tremendous havoc. While Hanako grants wishes to the living, Tsukasa grants wishes to the dead. He wears a black short-sleeved kimono with a grey hakama and a white button up underneath. Opposite to Hanako, he has a black seal on his right cheek and uses black koku-joudai willow wisps. Tsukasa works with his assistant, Sakura, to change the rumors of supernaturals in the school for his own purposes. ; : :A beautiful third- year high school student at Kamome Academy. Similarly to Yashiro, she became Tsukasa's assistant after he granted her a wish. She is the president of the Broadcasting Club and helps him broadcast altered rumors of supernaturals. Sakura is usually stoic and gets annoyed with both Natsuhiko and Tsukasa, resorting to imagining Tsukasa as a cat rather than a boy, making his actions more palatable. ; : :A second year student at Kamome Academy and a member of the Broadcasting Club. He is often seen trying to win Sakura's affection but to no avail. Though not bound to Tsukasa, Natsuhiko helps in Tsukasa's schemes. His flippant personality tends to lead him into trouble all on its own. ===Others=== ; : :A second year high school student, the student body president, and the most popular male student in the school. He is Kou's older brother and the eldest son of the Minamoto Clan. A prodigious exorcist, he was trained by his family elders since he was young to exorcise supernaturals and instilled with the family sentiment that all supernaturals are inherently evil. Despite his calm and gentle appearance, he is ruthless and frighteningly perceptive. He harbors a slightly sadistic streak, frequently terrorizing the Mokke to work as his servants. He dotes on his younger siblings and wants Kou to exorcise the Seven Mysteries so he can get stronger. Teru often spends his nights exorcising supernaturals, forcing him to only sleep after school. ; : :A first-year high school student and Yashiro's best friend. The school's prettiest and most popular girl, she enjoys rumors about the Seven Mysteries and recounting their stories to Yashiro. Yashiro notes that suspiciously, all the rumors Aoi tells her about come true. This is hinted to be related to her origins as someone who possesses the blood of Kannagi. Aoi and Yashiro are both in the Gardening Club. She is neighbours and childhood friends with Akane Aoi, who has a crush on her and confesses to her multiple times a day, though she merely awards him points for each effort. ; : :A first-year student at Kamome Academy and Akane's best friend. He is acts nonchalant and often seen on his phone. ; : :Two third-year middle school students at Kamome Academy and Kou's best friends. Yokoo enjoys sports is usually relaxed and cheerful. Satou enjoys baking and sweets, he usually has a stern and serious personality. : : ==Media== ===Manga=== Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun is written and illustrated by Iro Aida.

Esposito (January 22, 1913 ‚Äì July 12, 1988) was an American Democratic Party politician who served five terms in the New Jersey General Assembly from Jersey City. ==Biography== Esposito was born in Jersey City on January 22, 1913. He attended public schools there graduating from William L. Dickinson High School and later Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. He was the president of John Esposito & Sons, Inc., a hardware and contractor supply business in Jersey City. He also served on the Jersey City Board of Education and various other committees and societies. He married the former Theresa Orrico and had one daughter. In 1967, under a new district allotment for the General Assembly, Esposito was elected alongside fellow Democrat Christopher Jackman in Assembly District 12-C consisting of Ward E of Jersey City, Guttenberg, Hoboken, Weehawken, and West New York, New Jersey. In the next election held in 1969, District 12-C was again reconfigured to include Wards E and F in Jersey City, Hoboken, and Weehawken. In the Democratic primary, Esposito and school principal Frank R. Conwell defeated Hoboken attorney Andrew Batistich and incumbent Assemblyman Addison McLeon. For the 1971 election, Esposito's home was moved into District 12-B consisting of the central wards of Jersey City; he was elected alongside William G. Wilkerson. After the 1971 elections, Democrats picked up exactly half of the 80 Assembly seats up for election in the state after four years of Republican control (Republicans had 39 and one was an independent). The Democrats' choice for Assembly Speaker was S. Howard Woodson, a black minister and Assemblyman from Trenton. However, Democratic Hudson County Assemblyman David Friedland had also attempted to run for speaker as well despite allegations of corruption in the previous session. At the time of the speaker vote, Esposito along with Friedland, David Wallace, and Joseph J. Higgins broke from their Democratic caucus to elect Republican Thomas Kean speaker for the session; Esposito would receive a committee chairmanship during this term in exchange for the Kean vote. Woodson would eventually become speaker during the next Assembly term. In 1973, with the legislative districts changed again, Esposito ran in the new 32nd district consisting of parts of Jersey City and North Bergen. He won the 1973 election with Democrat Michael J. Marino and the 1975 election with Alina Miszkiewicz. However, in 1977 with the unpopularity of Governor Brendan Byrne's income tax proposal in large force, Esposito and Miszkiewicz (despite having the Hudson County Democratic Organization support) were defeated by Thomas F. Cowan and Robert C. Janiszewski. Esposito died on July 12, 1988 at the age of 75. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:New Jersey Democrats Category:Politicians from Jersey City, New Jersey Category:Bucknell University alumni Category:William L.

Jordan Pond House was established as a restaurant by Melvan Tibbetts in the early 1870s. In 1883, Bostonian Charles T. How, one of the first to develop real estate in Bar Harbor, bought the property.The Story of Jordan Pond House by T. A. McIntire In 1895, Mr and Mrs Thomas McIntyre took over the business, which would remain in their hands for the next half- century. Near the end of this reign, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. purchased the property and donated it to the National Park Service to ensure its continued existence. The Acadia Corporation, a small group of local preservationists, operated the business between 1946 and 2013, at which point they lost their bid to renew its contract.

Upon graduation from the Military Academy in Belgrade, he received the rank of second lieutenant in 1899. ==Chetnik action== He was among the first who joined the Serbian Chetnik Organization that went into action in Old Serbia and Macedonia. He went as an advisor in the autumn of 1904 together with Voivode Gligor Sokoloviƒá and his troop (ƒçeta).During the spring of 1905, Rudniƒçki was the first instructor who taught Jovan Babunski military skills.

Sreten Rajkoviƒá-Rudniƒçki solved the problem by creating a distraction -- getting local peasants to fire random gunshots a kilometer or two away, thus forcing the Turks to leave their guard post. The Chetniks then would safely cross the river from the Serbian to the Ottoman side.Because of his courage, skill and patience, he gained the utmost respect of his subordinates, peers, and superiors, the High Command. From 1905 until the end of the Chetnik action he held the position of Chief Secretary of the Central Chetnik Committee. He was the first commander of the Mountain Staff in the West Povardarje, in Poreƒç. ==The Balkan Wars, World War I and after== He was promoted to Major in the First Balkan War. During the Second Balkan War in 1913 he commanded a battalionand also during the Great War in 1914 he was in command of a battalion. In 1915 he was put in command of a regiment. Sreten Rudniƒçki was seriously wounded on 8 November 1915 during the withdrawal of the army from Serbia. After his recovery in 1919, Rudniƒçki took command of a border section for three years. He was promoted to the rank of Colonel and became commander of the Kosovo-Mitrovica military district.

It currently consists of thirteen lines, counting those of metro and tram as well as suburban rail; complemented by a wide-covering bus network, as well as other means of transportation including funiculars. The services are offered by different companies, whose activity is coordinated by the Consorcio de Transportes de Bizkaia (Transport Consortium of Bizkaia), which integrates their respective operators and facilitates and encourages their use. The three major operators of the rail transport network are Metro Bilbao (2 lines), Euskotren (5 lines of Euskotren Trena and 1 of Euskotren Tranbia) and Renfe (3 lines of Cercan√≠as Bilbao and 2 of Renfe Feve). The lines converge in the capital and reach six of the seven regions of the province: Arratia-Nervi√≥n, Busturialdea-Urdaibai, Duranguesado, Gran Bilbao, Las Encartaciones and Uribe. Thus, the only region without rail lines is Lea-Artibai. Areas that lack rail service are serve s by Bizkaibus.

August 18 is celebrated as the Day of the Border Troops, which is the professional holiday of the Border service. ==History== On August 18, 1992, in accordance with the Law ‚ÄúOn State Independence of the Republic of Kazakhstan‚Äù and in coordination with the newly formed Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), President Nursultan Nazarbayev ordered the establishment of the border troops from a compound of the Eastern Border District of the KGB of the USSR. In accordance with the intergovernmental treaties on collective security in May 1992, the Parliament of Kazakhstan adopted a Decree on consolidating a Kazakhstani battalion to strengthen the external borders of the CIS in December of that same year. The border troops developed a military council in April 1993 and had begun to incorporate maritime elements into the service a couple of days before the Victory Day holiday on May 9. The maritime units were located at the seaport of Aktau in the Mangystau region was determined to be the location of all sea units of the border guards. In 1994, combat activities of the Border troops were carried out for the first time against the background of positive development of interstate relations based on an agreement on the Kazakh-Chinese Border signed in May 1994. In order to improve the protection of the Kazakh border, President Nazarbayev in May 1995 converted the Border troops into an independent government agency called the State Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan, of which Major General Bolat Zakiev was appointed as chairman. By decree of the President dated November 17, 1997, the Border Troops were reformed into the Security Forces of the Ministry of Defense. In the early 2000s, regional commands were formed to ensure the protection of the border of Kazakhstan, irrespective of the region. In 2011, it was decided to reform the border department of Kazakhstan in order to maximize its adaptation to the modern era, transferring its mission of the administrative protection of the border to an operational component. In 2012, August 18 was officially declared as the Day of the Border Guard, replacing the Border Guards Day holiday on May 28. ==Timeline of border agreements== *July 17, 1997 - President Nazarbayev and Kyrgyz President Askar Akaev signed a memorandum on the delimitation of the State border between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in Cholpon-Ata. * July 1998 - The process of delimitation of the border between Kazakhstan and China was completed. *January 2000 - Nazarbayev and Chinese President Jiang Zemin signed a joint communiqu√© on the full settlement of border issues between the Kazakhstan and the China. * May 2002 - A protocol on the demarcation of the Kazakhstan-China border was signed between Kazakhstan and China. * January 18, 2005 - Nazarbayev and President Vladimir Putin of Russia signed a treaty on the Russo-Kazakh border, which defined the line of passage of the longest continuous land border in the world. * 2008 - The demarcation of the border with Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan was completed. ==State Symbols== The border guard service was awarded the honor of having official state symbols on November 20, 1996 by decree of President Nazarbayev. The entire service sports its own flag and seal, the latter of which consists of a blue star on a green circle with a yellow bird (similar to the one seen on the Kazakh flag) located at the under the circle. The naval components of the border service also maintain their own naval jacks and ensigns, which are flown on top of ships and vessels of the border guard. ==Structure== A Yakovlev Yak-40 of the Kazakh Border Guard. * Central Office of the Border Guard Service * Border units ** Border Commandants ** Border Posts ** Border Checkpoints * Air Police * Coast Guard * Support units * Specialized military schools ===Regional Directorates=== *Regional Directorate \\"West\\" *Regional Directorate \\"South\\" *Regional Directorate \\"Vostok\\" *Regional Directorate \\"North\\" *Regional Coast Guard Directorate ‚Äî Guards Kazakhstan's maritime border in the Caspian Sea. === Academy === The Academy of the Border Service of the National Security Committee ( / ) is the official military institution of the border service. It was founded by the Soviet Government on December 26, 1931 and was put under the control of the Joint State Political Directorate. In April 1957, the school was put under the authority and jurisdiction of the Committee for State Security (KGB) and was later transformed into a four-year school, which would be based in Alma-Ata (now Almaty). It was reformed in 1993, as the Military Institute of the NSC which it would hold until it was given its current name in 2012.https://books.google.com/books?id=9KgjQQgMC- cC&pg;=PA91&lpg;=PA91&dq;=Border+Troops+Academy&source;=bl&ots;=gVfFI- AzAO&sig;=ACfU3U35slUqFaOojMBtC5xqrzb0ZZmqTw&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiey82Pna_pAhVGHM0KHTNuAuoQ6AEwAnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q;=Border%20Troops%20Academy&f;=false ==Tasks== Primary tasks of the Border Service include: * Creating a border policy * Enhancing border security * Protecting the Kazakh border with Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, as well as a large portion of the Caspian Sea * Preventing and suppress encroachments on the territorial integrity of Kazakhstan * Fulfilling international obligations in relation to the international borders * Participating in the defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan from the national border * Assisting law enforcement and environmental authorities in the protection of citizens and natural resources on the border ==Directors== * Lieutenant General Evgeny Neverovsky (August 1992 - October 1992) * Lieutenant General Bolat Zakiev (October 1992 - June 1997) * Major General Toktasyn Buzubayev (June 1997 - July 1999) * Lieutenant General Bolat Zakiev (July 1999 - May 2008) * Major General Bolat Kirgizbaev (May 2008 - February 2011) * Major General Nurzhan Myrzaliev (February 2011 - June 2012) * Lieutenant General Nurlan Dzhulamanov (January 15, 2013 - October 27, 2014) * Major General Darkhan Dilmanov (Since October 27, 2014) ==Awards== In accordance with a decree of President Nazarbayev on September 30, 2011, the following state awards for the service were established: File:MedalSlujba1klass.jpgMedal \\"For Impeccable Service\\" 1st degree File:MedalSlujba2klass.jpgMedal \\"For Impeccable Service\\" 2nd degree File:For faultless service 3.jpgMedal \\"For Impeccable Service\\" 3rd degrees File:–ó–Ω–∞–∫ –ü–æ—á—ë—Ç–Ω—ã–π –ø–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∏–∫.JPGHonorary Border Guard Badge ==See also== * Armed Forces of Kazakhstan * Ministry of Defense (Kazakhstan) * National Security Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan * Visa policy of Kazakhstan ==References== Category:Border guards Category:Government of Kazakhstan Category:Government paramilitary forces Category:Military of Kazakhstan ","title":"Border Service of the National Security Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan"},{"id":"60257072","text":"Kartmazovo () is a rural locality (a (selo) in Moskovsky Settlement of Moscow, Russia.

It is the senior most of three bands in the regiment and is the only one that is part of the regular army. Uniquely, it employs bugles at its front, a tradition that goes back to the conflicts of the 18th century. Since 2016, Major Jason Griffiths has served as the director of the band and bugles. It is part of the Corps of Army Music. ==Origins of rifle bands== The Band and Bugles uphold traditions that date back to as far as 1665. In their early years, drums were abandoned by rifle regiments and were replaced with the silver bugle. The Rifles pioneered the use of the bugle as a way of communicating on the battlefields as well as giving orders. The use of bugles date back to the Napoleonic Wars as a result of the lessons learned during the American Revolutionary War. ==The Light Infantry== The Light Infantry maintained the other half of the lineage of the Band and Bugles. In April 1985, the band was reduced from six to four regular bands. The final two bands consisted of the Corunna Band and the Salamanca Band. ==RGJ Bands== ===Battalion Bands=== When cuts were made to regimental bands in 1984, the Royal Green Jackets decided to have two medium-sized bands rather than three small ones. ====1st Battalion==== The 1st Battalion band dates its lineage fron the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry Band and Bugles. The regiment is noted as having a \\"Band of Music\\" as early as 1768. An ensemble which was then part of the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot grew to 11 members by 1792. The Standing Orders of the 43rd Foot issued in 1795 make clear how the band was established. In 1958, the Regiment was redesignated the 1st Green Jackets, which was marked by a military parade in Cyprus with the band performing of the marches of all the constituent regiments. With its redesignation, it marked the first time that the Battalion and the band had been stationed at back home since it was sent to fight in the Second World War in 1939. The massed bands made their debut performance soon after at Wembley Stadium for an England-Italy football international, though unfortunately the wrong Italian national anthem was played, which must have caused some offence. Stationed in Berlin at the time of the regiment's amalgamation, the band continued its standard round of engagements such as the Queen's Birthday Parade in 1966 as well as foreign trips to locations throughout the world such as Hong Kong to Northern Ireland. ====2nd Battalion==== The King's Royal Rifle Corps Band dates back to 1783. It served in every war that has occurred since then including both World Wars. In 1958, the KRRC was officially redesignated the 2nd Green Jackets, though this had little immediate effect on the Band. Ted Jeanes continued as Bandmaster until 1961 when he was succeeded by Stewart Swanwick, formerly a musician in the 3rd King's African Rifles. In May 1969, was succeeded as Bandmaster by Jack Boden, who built on the legacy of his predecessors. In the 70s, the band served in Germany, all while alternating with the UK. Historical highlights include the Wembley Pageants of 1971 and 1973 and public duties at Buckingham Palace in 1972. In 1975, the Battalion was moved to Cyprus, where the Band played during Silver Jubilee Parade in 1977. ===1985-1994=== Between the disbandment of the battalion bands of the Royal Green Jackets in 1985 and the creation of the Band of the Light Division in 1994, the Royal Green Jackets had two regimental bands: the Normandy Band and the Peninsula Band. ====Normandy Band of the RGJ==== Bandmaster David Little, formerly a member of the 1st Green Jackets, was to remain for only just over a year before retiring, after which he was succeeded in December 1985 by trumpeter and percussionist Ian McElligott. Major events forte band took place in 1987 and 1988, during which the band took part in events, such as the Royal Bath and an inspection of Kneller Hall. 1989 saw the band being posted to Gibraltar, from which a tour was undertaken to Morocco to honour the 60th birthday of King Hassan II, performing a Sounding Retreat at Royal Palaces in Marrakesh and Fez. McElligott wa transferred to the Royal Military School of Music in 1992 and was replaced by Barry Wassell, who at the time of the formation of the Light Division, was moved to the newly formed Band of the Royal Lancers as Bandmaster as a training officer. ====Peninsula Band of the RGJ==== The Peninsula Band was first led by bandmaster Ian Harding on its formation, remaining on for 8 years. In 1988, it visited Canada as the official band for the exercise Medicine Man 3, as well as participate in the Calgary Stampede and conduct marching displays at the Olympic Plaza. After four years of being stationed in Germany as part of the British Army of the Rhine, which included tours of Sweden, Austria, Belgium, and France, the Band returned to its British barracks in 1989. They returned in 1989 for the 75th anniversary celebrations of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, an affiliated Canadian Army regiment. Harding retired in 1992 and was succeeded by Ian Macpherson. ==Hyde Park bombings== An oblong slate plaque with inscriptions in gold, set into a low wall. Seven band members were killed on 20 July 1982 alongside four soldiers of the Blues and Royals by an improvised bomb by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) at a public concert in Hyde Park and Regent's Park. The RGJ concert in the latter featured music from Oliver! to 120 people at the bandstand in Regents Park. The bomb had been hidden under the stand some time before and seemed to be designed to cause minimal harm to bystanders.Chalk, Peter. Encyclopedia of Terrorism. ABC-CLIO, 2012. pp.614‚Äì615. The seven fatalities from the RGJ Band included the following: *WO2 Graham Barker, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets *Bandsman John Heritage, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets *Corporal Robert Livingstone, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets *Corporal Robert McKnight, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets *Bandsman George Mesure, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets *Bandsman Keith Powell, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets *Bandsman Laurence Smith, 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets The band was regrouped five weeks later with just nine men under the direction of David Little. In 1983, a concert on a rebuilt bandstand was held by the band to commemorate the unveiling of a memorial plaque by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. ==Light Division== In August 1994, the Band and Bugles of the Light Division was formed from a merger of the four regimental bands of the Light Division. The Band and Bugles was one of the various artists featured on Over the Hills & Far Away: The Music of Sharpe, released in 1996 as a companion to the Sharpe television series. At the time of its existence, it was the only 49 piece Army band based outside London. It had recent overseas tours have included Jordan, Greece, Cyprus and much of continental Europe. ==Modern day== On 1 February 2007, the Light Division was reformed into The Rifles. The traditional names of the regiments that formed the regiment were not retained, which resulted in the band being renamed. The band performs in the musicians also perform in many varied combinations such as: *Marching Band *Concert Band *Woodwind Quintet *Brass Quintet *Fanfare Trumpet Teams *Barbershop Quartet *String Ensemble *Dixieland Jazz Band *Dance Band The band provides support for many famous military and civilian events including Garden Parties at Buckingham Palace and the former Royal Tournament as well as making regular television and radio appearances. The section of the band that performs with bugles are known collectively as the Bugle Platoon, which is composed of 20 soldiers from the five regular battalions. Many bugler's complete an 18-week course at the Army School of Ceremonial in Catterick. In June 2016, the Band and Bugles was prohibited from marching in a Sounding Retreat Ceremony at the fields of Bodmin Town F.C. in Cornwall, citing concerns over the conditions of the landscape that might be messed up due to the marching. Lance Kennedy, the Mayor of Bodmin, described it as an \\"unfortunate decision\\". In October 2017, the band performed for pupils at the Haberdashers' Adams. The Buglers' Association was initially created in 2013 by veteran buglers of The Light Infantry to give former buglers their own association. The Association buglers are now regularly engaged in performing at events across the country, the scale of which is growing as of the present. Today, these buglers perform in almost all occasions, including funerals, Remembrance Day ceremonies, parades and concerts with the Band of the Rifles and/or the reserve bands. ==Traditions== ===Marching pace=== The Buglers are selected from the regular battalions and are trained to play the bugle and a fast march of 140 paces per minute. In doing this, they march in a half-step. As a result of this fact, the band sounds a bugle call followed by a quick drum beat to signal a quick march, which breaks from other military bands that use a regular drum beat for this purpose. The band never performs slow marches except during occasions that require it (i.e. Trooping of the Colour, Presentation of Colours, Changing of the Queen's Guard). ===Sounding Retreat=== The Sounding Retreat is form of the Beating Retreat ceremony of the Household Division that is performed by the Band and Bugles as well as all other rifle bands. The National ceremony (which represents Retreat in the British Army) has been done on 31 May and 1 June on Horse Guards Parade, with the recent one being held in 2016. Besides the Bugle Band of the Rifles, the Band of the Brigade of Gurkhas also takes part in the ceremony, alongside other bugle bands and the Bugler's Association. In 2016, the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry Band from Canada took part in the ceremony. Prior to 2016, it had been conducted in London on very few occasions, with previous years including 1993, 1987 and 1979. ===Bugle Major=== The ceremonial leader of the band is known as the Bugle Major, who stands as a version of the Drum major. Unlike other military drum majors, the bugle major utilizes a shorter mace that is carried at the side of the torso. When preparing to march, the commander of the guard call out: \\"Bugle Major!\\", to which the actual Bugle Major responds with \\"Sir!\\" and begins conducting the bugle calls for a quick march. In the case of marching at the double, the guard commander which yell: \\"Sound the Double!\\" ===Colonel Commandant‚Äôs Annual Inspection=== The Colonel Commandant‚Äôs Annual Inspection is held annually at the Army Training Regiment Winchester. It features a marching display as well as a Bugle Competition. ==Commonly played and adapted music== Regimental marches: *Mechanised Infantry (official quick march) *Keel Row/Road to the Isles (Double Past) *Old Salamanca (Slow) *Regimental Call: 1st Bar of Light Division Assembly *Light Infantry (former) *Huntsman's Chorus/Italian Song (former) *March Off of the Rifles Historical marches: *Prince Albert *Palace Guard *One and All *The 46th *Trelawney *With Jockey to the Fair *The Minden March *On Ilkley Moor *The Yorkshire Girl *The Farmer's Boy *La Ligne *Land of My Fathers *The Lincolnshire Poacher *Le R√©giment de Sambre et Meuse *The Light Barque *The Old 68th *Garryowen *Silver Bugles *Old Towler *The Daughter of the Regiment *The 53rd *Raglan *I'm 95 *Light Division *Secunderabad *Blaydon Races Other Bugle Calls: *The 53rd Salute *KSLI Officers' Mess Calls *Cavalry Brigade Salute *Light Cavalry *The Lucknow Call ==Influence== *It's traditions and styles are mirrored in the reserve bands of the Rifles: Salamanca Band and the Waterloo Band. *The bands of the Royal Marines Band Service are the only military bands in the British Armed Forces where bugles are part of the unit's specific traditions. They are usually maintained in the front rank of corps of drums, where the drummers also double as buglers. *It has been the influence for several former drum and bugle corps as well as many rifle bands in service with the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). *Front rank bugle arrangements are also used in Sri Lankan military bands. *Most Indian military bands use the same marching pace as the Band and Bugles. Bugles are also used in many rifle bands, who often use similar uniforms as well. An example of this influence is the Band of the Assam Rifles. *The Neuss-based Quirinus Band and Bugle Corps, formed in 2011, is affiliated to the Band and Bugles and its marching pace mirrors that used by the band. Under its current Bandmaster, Peter Hosking, a veteran former musician of the bands of the Royal Green Jackets and affiliated as well to the Royal Green Jackets Association, it wears the uniforms used by the RGJ, which served in West Germany during the Cold War, and its predecessor units, with the red plume over the dark green shako. Being the first German military marching band of its kind, it also honors the German first generation riflemen of the final decades of the 18th and the first decades of the 19th century who served with their English, Scottish and Irish servicemen in the ranks of both the King's Royal Rifle Corps and the Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own). *The Silver Bugles Band of the Somerset Army Cadets of the Army Cadet Force is modeled after the Band and Bugles of The Rifles. ==See also== *Queen's Own Rifles of Canada Band & Bugles *Band of the Brigade of Gurkhas *La Musique des Voltigeurs de Qu√©bec *Indian military bands *Sri Lankan military bands ==External links== *Musical Heritage - Buglers Association *Royal Green Jackets *Meet a Bugler From 4 RIFLES Keeping a Tradition Alive  Forces TV ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 2007 Category:2007 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Organisations based in Hampshire Category:Military units and formations established in 2007 Category:Corps of Army Music ","title":"Band and Bugles of The Rifles"},{"id":"60257087","text":"Leo Piek (7 September 1927 - 1 June 2013) was a Dutch wrestler.

He was the minister of Skirling, a small parish in the western side of Peeblesshire, subsequent to the year 1649. Anderson relates that \\"of his history while in that charge, as well as during the earlier part of his life, nothing is now known.\\" Greig was ejected from Skirling by the Act of 1662. Ten years later we Ô¨Ånd him incumbent of Carstairs, as one of the indulged ministers, and tied down to preach nowhere but within the bounds of that parish. With this restriction, Greig could not agree. He went \\"aÔ¨Åeld\\" and held conventicles at Boghall, Leith, and other parts. In 1675 he was apprehended, at Leith, while conducting a meeting in the house of Thomas Stark, his brother-in-law, and committed to the Tolbooth of Edinburgh. Having been brought before the Privy Council on 9 March 1675, Greig was ordered to the Bass. Meanwhile, that sentence was not carried out, and he remained in the Tolbooth, preaching to his fellow-prisoners whenever an opportunity presented itself. Shortly after he was set at liberty on condition that he would, as an indulged minister, \\"live orderly,\\" and conÔ¨Åne his ministrations to the parish of Carstairs, under a penalty of two thousand merks, in the event of default. But, Greig again soon fell through his obligations and was present at conventicles, beyond the bounds of his parish. Summoned to compear before the Lords of Council, he failed to \\"show face,\\" and was, in consequence thereof, deprived of all his ecclesiastical rights. He was, however, shortly afterwards reinstated. For the next seven years Greig drops out of view. But, on 8 October, we Ô¨Ånd him again in \\"deep waters\\" owing to his refusal to commemorate the Anniversary of the Restoration of Charles II. and to join in a day of National Thanksgiving for the \\"deliverance of His Majesty‚Äôs sacred person\\" from the Rye-house Plot. Because of these and other acts of recalcitration, he was relegated to the Bass about the beginning of May, 1685. Here he remained for about 14 months. He petitioned for release, on the score of health. The Council, on 15 July, having heard and considered this petition, \\"grant warrant to the Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of the Bass to set the petitioner at liberty; he, Ô¨Årst Ô¨Ånding caution, under the penalty of Ô¨Åve thousand merks Scots money, to compear before the Council upon Tuesday next, the 20th instant, or that day to enter his person in prison within the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, or Canongate under the foresaid penalty in case of failure.\\" He was liberated along with William Spence. From this time until his death‚Äîthe date of which is uncertain‚ÄîGreig appears to have eaten \\"humble pie,\\" as he was constantly \\"appearing\\" before \\"My Lords\\" in order to ensure the continuance of his liberty. He was present at the first meeting of ministers in the bounds of Lothian and Tweeddale on 6 July 1687, after Toleration had been granted. He died on 17 May 1689, aged about 71. ==Family== He married a daughter of Alexander Livingston, minister of Biggar. His wife survived him, and requiring pecuniary aid, was recommended for charity by the Presbytery of Hamilton on 18 October 1692.

Larus is mentioned only by Silius in his poem, where he is noted as the only outstanding man in the battle in Celtiberia that pitted Punic generals Mago Barca and Hanno against their Roman homologue Marcus Junius Silanus. Some authors have doubted of the existence of Larus, noting in Silius the intention to embellish his chronicle of the war with epic heroes and duels in the style of ancient Greek literature. However, others have doubted this approach, pointing out that his role in the battle is too notable to be entirely fictitious. Assuming his historicity, Larus would have been active in 207 BC. After the Battle of the Metaurus, where Hasdrubal Barca and his newly hired Spanish mercenaries were defeated by Gaius Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius Salinator, Hanno and Mago would have started another recruitment campaign in Hispania in order to replace Hasdrubal's army. Among their mercenaries it was Larus, leading a contingent of the Cantabrian youth armed with battle axes and caetras as per their custom. Larus was described as a man of immense stature and martial skill, embodying the Celtic warrior ideal, who went to war wielding a double-headed axe (bipennis) with a single hand. He was also known as a fearsome unarmed fighter.Silius Italicus, Punica, 16, 46-65 Larus's first and only deployment started when the Roman forces attacked the Carthaginian positions. Believing themselves safe from attacks, Mago and Hanno had divided their camp and relaxed their defense, which encumbered their capacity of reaction. Their army was quickly routed except by Larus and his battalion, who mounted a fierce counterattack. Even when all his men were slain, Larus remained standing and doing battle, killing so many soldiers by himself alone that the Roman infantry began avoiding him in terror. Only Lucius Cornelius Scipio engaged him, fighting him in a singles duel and ultimately killing Larus after severing his arm. With the Cantabrian dead, the Punics were defeated and Hanno was captured. In his text, Silius speaks as well about another mercenary named Larus, who was compared to a gorgon for his frightening appearance. However, this was not the same as the Cantabrian Larus, but a Gaul soldier of the same name. ==See also== *Corocotta *Viriathus (Second Punic War) ==References== Category:207 BC Category:Ancient mercenaries Category:Carthaginian commanders of the Second Punic War Category:Celtic warriors Category:People whose existence is disputed Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Larus (Cantabrian)"},{"id":"60257323","text":"The Dixie Valley toad (Anaxyrus williamsi or Bufo williamsi) is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is endemic to Churchill County in the state of Nevada in the United States. It is the first new toad species to be described from the United States since the description of the now-extinct in the wild Wyoming toad (A. baxteri) about 49 years prior. It was formerly considered an isolated population of the common western toad (A. boreas) until physical and genetic analyses found it to be a separate species. It can be physically distinguished from the western toad by the scattered gold-colored flecks that cover its olive body, and is also the smallest member of the A. boreas species complex in the region. It is descended from an ancestor that inhabited the large lakes and wetlands that covered the Great Basin in the Pleistocene until the receding water isolated the different populations, leading to speciation. The Dixie Valley toad is only found in a small complex of vegetated spring-fed marshlands in Dixie Valley, one of the hottest and geothermally active systems in the region. The surrounding areas are largely arid land with little aquatic resources, isolating A. williamsi from the rest of the world. While it is considered locally abundant within its extremely small range, it is threatened by plans to build a geothermal power plant, which can degrade the marshland that it lives in. == References == Category:Anaxyrus Category:Endemic fauna of Nevada Category:Amphibians of the United States Category:Amphibians described in 2017 ","title":"Dixie Valley toad"},{"id":"60257328","text":"Thomas A.

The approach is based on asymmetric information, as the government is assumed to be unable to observe the number of hours people work or how productive they are, but can observe individuals' incomes. This imposes incentive compatibility constraints that limit the taxes which the government is able to levy, and prevents it from taxing high-productivity people at higher rates than low-productivity people. The government seeks to maximise a utilitarian social welfare function subject to these constraints. It faces a tradeoff between efficiency and equity: * Higher levels of taxation on the rich create revenue that can be used to redistribute to the poor, which raises social welfare because the marginal utility of income is (assumed to be) higher for the poor than the rich; * However, taxation reduces the incentive to work, and so leads to labour supply below the optimal level. == Mechanical, behavioral and welfare effects == Emmanuel Saez in his article titled \\"Using Elasticities to Derive Optimal Income Tax Rates\\" derives a formula for optimal level of income tax using the both compensated and uncompensated elasticities. Saez writes the tradeoff between equity and efficiency is a central consideration of optimal taxation, and implementing a progressive tax allows the government to reallocate their resources where they are needed most. However, this deters those of higher income levels to work at their optimal level. Saez decomposes the marginal effects of a tax change into mechanical, behavioural and welfare effects, as follows: * The mechanical effect is the effect that the tax change would have on government revenue, if no individuals changed their behaviour in response. For a tax increase, this is positive. * The behavioural effect is the effect that the behavioural change induced by the tax change would have on government revenue, at the initial tax rates. Raising taxes will discourage labour supply, and this will lead to lower tax revenue as a result; so for a tax increase, this is negative. * The welfare effect is the effect that the tax change has on the social welfare function by changing individual's utilities. For a tax increase, this is negative. The sum of these effects should be zero at the optimum. Stipulating this condition results in the following formula for the optimal top tax rate, if incomes are Pareto distributed: :\\\\tau = \\\\frac{1 - \\\\bar{g}}{1-\\\\bar{g}+\\\\bar{\\\\zeta}^u +\\\\bar{\\\\zeta}^c(\\\\alpha -1)} where: * \\\\tau is the tax rate * \\\\bar{g} is the ratio of social marginal utility for the top bracket taxpayers to the marginal value of public funds for the government, which depends on the social welfare function. The case \\\\bar{g}=0 corresponds to one where the government does not care about the welfare of top bracket taxpayers, and wants to raise as much revenue as possible from them, so setting \\\\bar{g}=0 gives a formula for the revenue-maximising top tax rate. * \\\\bar{\\\\zeta}^u and \\\\bar{\\\\zeta}^c are respectively the uncompensated and compensated elasticity of labour supply; higher elasticities imply that labour supply will fall more in response to an increase in taxes. * \\\\alpha is the shape parameter in the Pareto distribution of income. Empirical estimation of the parameters of this equation suggests that the revenue-maximising top tax rate is between approximately 50% and 80%, although this estimate neglects long-run behavioural responses, which would imply higher elasticities and a lower optimal tax rate. Saez's analysis can also be generalised to tax rates other than the top rate. == Arithmetic vs. economic effects == In the late 1970s, Arthur Laffer developed the Laffer curve, which demonstrates that there are two effects of changing tax rates: * An arithmetic effect ‚Äî if tax rates are lowered, revenue will be decrease by the same amount; * An economic effect ‚Äî which provides incentives for individuals to increase their work output through low tax rates. These correspond to the mechanical and behavioural effects discussed by Saez. The Laffer Curve illustrates that, for sufficiently high tax levels, the (negative) behavioural effect will outweigh the (positive) mechanical effect of a tax increase, and so increasing tax rates will reduce tax revenue. In fact, tax revenue with a tax rate of 100% is likely to be 0, since there is no remaining incentive to work at all. Therefore, the tax rate that maximises revenue collected will typically be below 100% - as estimated by Saez, the revenue-maximising top rate is between 50% and 80%. == Family and gender effects == Since only economic actors who engage in market activity of \\"entering the labor market\\" have an income tax liability on their wages, people who are able to consume leisure or engage in household production outside the market by say providing housewife services in lieu of hiring a maid are taxed more lightly. With the \\"married filing jointly\\" tax unit in U.S. income tax law, the second earner's income is added to the first wage earner's taxable income and thus gets the highest marginal rate. This type of tax creates a large distortion disfavoring women from the labor force during years when the couple have great child care needs. == Optimal linear income tax == Eytan Sheshinski has studied a simplified income-tax model, in which the tax is a linear function of the income: t(y) = -a + (1-b) y, where y is the income, t(y) is the tax paid by an individual with an income of y, 1-b is the tax rate, and a is a lump sum tax. The goal is to find the values of a and b such that the social welfare (the sum of individual utilities) is maximized. In his model, all agents have the same utility function, which depends on consumption and labor: u = u(c,l). The consumption c is determined by the after-income tax: c(y) = y-t(y) = a + b y. The before-tax income y is determined by the amount of labor l and an innate ability factor n, where the relation is assumed to be linear too: y = y(n,l) = n\\\\cdot l. Each individual decides on the amount of labor l which maximizes his utility: u(a+b n l , l). These decisions define the labor supply as a function of the tax parameters a and b. Under certain natural assumptions, it is proved that the optimal linear tax has a>0, i.e., it provides a positive lump-sum to individuals with zero income. This coincides with the idea of negative income tax. Additionally, the optimal tax rate is bounded above by a fraction that decreases with the minimum elasticity of the labor supply. == Developments == The theory of optimal labor income taxation started with a simple model of optimal linear taxation. It then developed to consider optimal nonlinear income taxation. Then, it considered various extensions of the standard model: tax avoidance, income shifting, international migration, rent-seeking, relative income concerns, couples and children, and non-cash transfers. == See also == * Negative income tax is considered by some economists as an optimal way to help the poor population, instead of the many different welfare programs. * Optimal capital income taxation is the theory of optimal tax on income from capital gains. == References == Category:Theory of taxation ","title":"Optimal labor income taxation"},{"id":"60257420","text":"Bomfim is a surname.

The fly is named after British entomologist Evelyn d‚ÄôAssis-Fonseca. It is classified as an endangered species by the IUCN Red List due to its small habitat range and constant threats to these limited environments. The fly is probably the rarest endemic insect species in the UK. The species was initially described in 1965 during a survey of Dornoch Firth, with the type specimen caught by d'Assis-Fonseca in 1971. However it was first described as a novel species in 1989 by Michael Ackland. The type specimen is housed at the Natural History Museum, London. This fly is endemic to the county of Sutherland in northeastern Scotland. Its range extends for a length of about along the coast of the Dornoch Firth, and it has a total area of occupancy of about at four known locations. Its habitat is the dune system where lyme grass (Leymus arenarius), cord grass (Spartina anglica) and marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), ragwort (Jacobaea vulgaris) and sow thistle (Sonchus spp) grow, along with limited amounts of cat's-ear (Hypochaeris radicata) and hawkweed (Hieracium spp). On the more consolidated back part of the dunes there is a richer flora which includes devil‚Äôs bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) as well as ragwort. A 2013 survey commissioned by Scottish Natural Heritage found some specimens of the fly, and a potential association of the larvae with ragwort or sow thistle. The survey suggested that populations have declined since similar surveys conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Threats to the fly include trampling of habitat from people on the dunes, as well as a potential golf course at Coul Links. ==References== Category:Anthomyiidae Category:Endemic fauna of Scotland Category:Muscomorph flies of Europe Category:Insects described in 1989 ","title":"Botanophila fonsecai"},{"id":"60257738","text":"Amphisbaena miringoera is a species of worm lizard found in Brazil. ==References== miringoera Category:Reptiles described in 1971 Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Reptiles of Brazil Category:Taxa named by Paulo Vanzolini ","title":"Amphisbaena miringoera"},{"id":"60257744","text":"The 1985 Rothmans Four-Nations Cup was held in Sharjah, UAE, between March 22‚Äì29, 1985.

He has served as Archbishop of Monreale since 8 February 2013. Following reorganisation of the Sicilian church in 2000, Archbishops of Monreale are no longer Metropolitans, but they retain the personal rank of Archbishop. ==Birth and education== Pennisi was born in the town of Licodia Eubea, Sicily, on 23 November 1946. From an early age he actively participated in the Communion and Liberation movement. He was ordained as a priest on 9 September 1972 by Bishop Carmelo Canzonieri, after studying at the prestigious Almo Collegio Capranica in Rome. ==Church career== After parish work, Pennisi became involved in theological education. From 1985 to 1992 he was rector of the episcopal seminary of Caltagirone in Sicily, and from 1997 to 2002 he was rector of the Almo Collegio Capranica in Rome, where he had himself been a student previously. Pope John Paul II appointed him Bishop of Piazza Armerina on 12 April 2002, and he was consecrated as bishop in Piazza Armerina Cathedral on 3 July 2002. On 8 February 2013 Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Archbishop of Monreale, and he was enthroned on 26 April 2013. On 21 September 2017 he was elected vice-president of the Sicilian Episcopal Conference. ==Opposition to the Sicilian Mafia== Pennisi has lived throughout his life on the island of Sicily, and in his working life has become an outspoken critic and opponent of the Sicilian Mafia. In the early part of 2008 he received a permanent police escort following death threats received from the mafia. He has worked for legal reforms allowing courts to strip convicted mafiosi of their property, and has banned churches from allowing religious rites for confraternities whose membership includes mafiosi. In 2007 he refused to allow a cathedral funeral service for convicted mafia chief Daniele Emmanuello, who had been killed during a shoot out with police. Ten years later in 2017, despite death threats over the Emmanuello refusal, he again refused to permit any type of public church funeral service for convicted Mafia chief Salvatore (Toto) Riina who had died in prison, describing the Mafia leader as \\"a public sinner\\" (\\"un pubblico peccatore\\"). On 17 March 2017 Pennisi again made news headlines for opposing the Sicilian Mafia, when he issued a blanket ban on known mafiosi becoming Godfathers to children within his diocese, stating that the application of the title to organised criminals could be an attempt to legitimise their crime through association with religion. He had expressed outrage the previous month when Mafia leader Giuseppe Salvatore Riina, the son of Toto Riina, had become a Godfather in a church in Corleone despite a legal injunction preventing his return to the region, after obtaining the necessary permits for exceptional travel from a judge, and of suitable character from a priest in Padua. ==Order of St Lazarus of Jerusalem== In March 2014 Don Carlos Gereda y de Borb√≥n, Marqu√™s of Almaz√°n and 49th Grand Master of the Military and Hospitaller Order of St Lazarus of Jerusalem, with the consent of Patriarch Gregory III Laham, the Patriarch of Antioch and Spiritual Protector of the Order of St Lazarus, appointed Pennisi as the international Ecclesiastical Grand Prior of the Order. ==References== Category:Archbishops of Monreale Category:Order of Saint Lazarus (statuted 1910) Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Bishops in Sicily ","title":"Michele Pennisi"},{"id":"60257848","text":"Robert Apisa (born June 4, 1945) is a former American football fullback.

She attended Edinburgh Ladies‚Äô College and Edinburgh Atelier, before moving to the Herkomer School of Painting in Bushey, Hertfordshire to study under Hubert von Herkomer, a well-known portrait painter. Gulland was a freelance artist whose primary work was as a genre painter and mezzotint engraver. She continued to live in Bushey and was an active artist from 1887 until her death at age 77 in 1934. == Art style == Gulland produced oil and water color paintings, book covers for American authors, sketches, and mostly mezzotint engravings. The subjects of her paintings included portraits, figures and flowers. Most of Gulland‚Äôs pieces were inspired, and even modeled, by 18th century Rococo portraits. A portrait that best illustrates her work is titled The Strawberry Girl after Joshua Reynolds. The piece was created in 1921 and was based on an oil painting by Joshua Reynolds. It is a mezzotint print, and thought to portray the struggles of the British working class after World War I, as young girls would often sell strawberries in order to support their family. == Significance of art == Gulland advocated many societal issues through her art, whether that was discreetly, with The Strawberry Girl, or explicitly stating her stance. Through different art techniques and styles, Gulland helped spread awareness. She was a very open feminist as she created a bookplate with a woman reading a novel with the words ‚ÄúVotes for Women‚Äù on the page. This was extremely political as she advocated for women‚Äôs suffrage. Gulland was also commissioned by David Douglas to design book covers for the American authors he published. One of the covers included women working with the title Women‚Äôs Industries. Gulland also created sketches about scientific discoveries on the Challenger. == Major accomplishments == Gulland received many recognitions for her work and was elected a member of the Society of Engravers. She had her work exhibited at many institutions including the Royal Academy, showing eleven pieces there between 1887 and 1910, the Royal Scottish Academy (1878‚Äì1885), and the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts (1888‚Äì1890). Gulland had also been commissioned by the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh, Scotland to design the 1886 Exhibition Catalogue for Queen Victoria‚Äôs visit. == References == Category:1857 births Category:1934 deaths Category:Artists from Edinburgh Category:19th-century Scottish painters Category:18th-century Scottish painters Category:Scottish women painters Category:Scottish engravers Category:18th-century British women artists Category:19th-century British women artists ","title":"Elizabeth Gulland"},{"id":"60257977","text":"Evelyn Andrus (1909-1972) was a Canadian photographer.

It is existed for more than 500 years. When the village was in its infancy, the villagers carved houses into the limestone, creating a protective barrier against storms and the winter cold. Presently, the village is a tiny community of 25 residents living on the edge of the Green Mountain. The villagers descend from the Al-Shariqi tribe, which originated in Jordan over 1,000 years ago. Al Sogara has remained virtually untouched for centuries; until 2005, foreigners were barred from visiting because Al Sogara was used as the center of a militarized zone. The village has since been modernized. Electricity has been installed to help provide power to cable cars aiding villagers with transportation and deliveries to and from the village. Due to the high altitude and rocky terrain, a helicopter regularly helps deliver supplies to Al Sogara. In addition to electricity, the village now has a man- made water canal that provides fresh water to villagers. In 2019, BBC Travel visited Al Sogara and described it as the most remote village in the region.http://www.bbc.com/travel/gallery/20190213-a-hidden-village-carved- into-a-cliff ==References== Category:Ad Dakhiliyah Governorate Category:Cliff dwellings Category:Populated places in Oman ","title":"Al Sogara"},{"id":"60258097","text":"This is a list of Christian schisms.

It is sympatric with the closely related European flounder (P. flesus), which it looks identical to and can only be distinguished from via genetic analysis. However, both have very different spawning behaviors and habitat requirements; the strongly migratory European flounder requires a minimum level of salinity and spawns in the pelagic zone where its eggs are carried by the waves, whereas the largely resident Baltic flounder is more tolerant of salinity decreases and spawns in shallow neritic areas where its eggs sink to the seabed. Due to these different spawning behaviors, both species display a major degree of reproductive isolation, preventing them from intermixing and establishing them as different species. Analyses indicate that the Baltic flounder and the Baltic population of the widespread European flounder both derive from the same ancestral population, but invaded the Baltic Sea at different times, with the ancestors of the Baltic flounder invading the area and diverging from the European flounder shortly after the Baltic Sea had formed from Ancylus Lake (circa 8,000 years ago), while the widespread European flounder invaded the area about 1,500 to 3,500 years later (or circa 5,000 - 6,500 years ago). The Baltic flounder has been steadily outcompeting the Baltic population of the European flounder over the past 5,000 years due to the declining level of salinity in the water; in areas such as the Gulf of Finland, the European flounder has almost completely disappeared due to climate change and eutrophication impacting its closest breeding grounds, leaving the Baltic flounder the predominant species in the area. == References == Category:Platichthys Category:Fish of the Baltic Sea Category:Fish described in 2018 ","title":"Baltic flounder"},{"id":"60258167","text":"Renata Hellmeister de Abreu (born 15 April 1982) is a Brazilian politician.

States can differ based on whether or not they guarantee equal treatment under law for followers of different religions, whether they establish a state religion (and the legal implications that this has for both practitioners and non-practitioners), the extent to which religious organizations operating within the country are policed, and the extent to which religious law is used as a basis for the country's legal code. There are further discrepancies between some countries' self-proclaimed stances of religious freedom in law and the actual practice of authority bodies within those countries: a country's establishment of religious equality in their constitution or laws does not necessarily translate into freedom of practice for residents of the country. Additionally, similar practices (such as having citizens identify their religious preference to the government or on identification cards) can have different consequences depending on other sociopolitical circumstances specific to the countries in question. Most countries in Africa legally establish that freedom of religion is a right conferred to all individuals. The extent to which this is enforced in practice varies greatly from country to country. Several countries have anti-discrimination laws which prohibit religious discrimination.

There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. Christianity is the religion of the vast majority of the population, with Catholicism as the largest single religious group. The Catholic Church estimates that 55 percent of the population is Catholic. There is also a small Muslim community, estimated at 80-90,000 adherents, composed largely of migrants from West Africa and families of Lebanese extraction. There are few declared atheists in the country. Traditional African religions are adhered to by a few peripheral rural societies only, but some traditional beliefs are held by many people. Members of the clergy regularly use their pulpits to criticize government policies, though church leaders report self-censorship regarding particularly sensitive issues. The Government banned 17 religious groups in Cabinda on charges of practicing harmful exorcism rituals on adults and children accused of \\"witchcraft,\\" illegally holding religious services in residences, and not being registered. Although the law does not recognize the existence of witchcraft, abusive actions committed while practicing a religion are illegal.

The government at all levels sought to protect this right in full and did not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors. There is no official state religion. Missionary groups are present and operate without impediment. The licensing requirements for foreign groups are the same as those for domestic religious denominations. The practice of witchcraft is a criminal offense under the national penal code, punishable by a 2 to 10-year prison term. People generally are prosecuted for this offense only in conjunction with some other offense such as murder; however, there were no reports of convictions of witchcraft under this law. The government distinguishes between witchcraft and traditional indigenous religious practices; witchcraft is defined by the law as attempts to do harm by spiritual means and is a common explanation for diseases. Several religious denominations operate primary and secondary schools. Although post-secondary education continues to be dominated by state institutions, private schools affiliated with religious denominations, including Catholic, Protestant, and Qur'anic schools, have been among the best schools at the primary and secondary levels for many years. == Cape Verde == The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. There is no state religion. However, the Catholic Church maintains a privileged position in national life. For example, the government provides the Catholic Church with free television broadcast time for religious purposes (an estimated 85% of the population of Cape Verde is Catholic).United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Cape Verde: International Religious Freedom Report 2007. == Central African Republic == The Constitution of the Central African Republic provides for the freedom of religion, and the government generally permitted adherents of all religious groups to worship without interference. The constitution prohibits what the government considers to be religious fundamentalism or intolerance, a provision that is widely perceived as targeting Muslims in the country. There is no state religion.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Central African Republic: International Religious Freedom Report 2007. Religious organizations and missionary groups are free to proselytize and worship throughout the country. Students are not compelled to participate in religious education, and they are free to attend any religious program of their choosing. Although the government does not explicitly prohibit religious instruction in public schools, such instruction is not part of the overall public school curriculum, nor is it common. Religious instruction is permitted without government interference in private schools. Private Catholic schools generally include 1 hour of religious education per week. Although witchcraft is a criminal offense punishable by execution under the penal code, most sentences are from 1 to 5 years in prison or a fine of up to $1,500 (817,836 CFA francs). Individuals arrested for witchcraft are generally arrested in conjunction with some other offense, such as murder. Religious groups that the Government considered \\"subversive\\", a term not specifically defined by the government, are subject to sanctions by the Ministry of Interior. When imposing sanctions, the Ministry of Interior may decline to register, suspend the operations of, or ban any organization that it deems offensive to public morals or likely to disturb the peace. The Ministry of Interior may also intervene in religious organizations to resolve internal conflicts about property, finances, or leadership within religious groups. == Chad == Article 1 of the Constitution of Chad declares that the country is a secular state and \\"affirm[s] the separation of the religions and of the State\\". However, some policies favor Islam in practice. For example, a committee composed of members of the High Council for Islamic Affairs and the Directorate of Religious Affairs in the Ministry of the Interior organizes the Hajj and the Umra. In the past the Association of Evangelical Churches criticized government- sponsored Hajj trips as eroding the traditionally secular stance of the country. The government indirectly monitors Muslim activities through the pro- government High Islamic Council. The High Council, in coordination with the president, also has the responsibility of appointing the grand imam‚Äîa spiritual leader for all Muslims in the country who oversees each region's high imam and serves as head of the council. In principle, the grand imam has the authority to restrict proselytizing by other Islamic groups throughout the country, regulate the content of sermons in mosques, and exert control over activities of Muslim charities operating in the country. The Al Mountada al Islami and the World Association for Muslim Youth organizations were banned by the government for portraying violence as a legitimate precept of Islam. The government has also banned the Sufi religious group Al Faid al-Djaria for engaging in various practices deemed un-Islamic to religious authorities, such as the incorporation of singing and dancing into religious services. Religious leaders are also involved in managing the country's wealth. A representative of the religious community sits on the Revenue Management College, the body that oversees the allocation of oil revenues. The seat rotates between Muslim and Christian leaders every 4 years. Public schools conduct instruction in French, and public bilingual schools conduct classes in French and Arabic. The government prohibits religious instruction in public schools but permits all religious groups to operate private schools without restriction. The poor quality of Chad's educational system has prompted many Muslim families to look to Islamic schools as an opportunity for educating children who would otherwise have little or no access to formal schooling. Most large towns have at least one or two private religious schools. Although the government does not publish official records on school funding, many Islamic schools were commonly understood to be financed by Arab donors (governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and individuals), particularly from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Libya. == Comoros == The Constitution of the Comoros provides for freedom of religion, but the government limits this right in practice. In 2009, an amendment to the constitution established Islam as the state religion. Foreigners caught proselytizing for religions other than Islam are subject to deportation. While the law allows non-Muslims to practice their religion, it prohibits citizens from converting away from Islam. Although enforceable, this law is rarely applied. The Grand Mufti of Comoros is part of the government and manages a department that handles issues concerning religion and religious administration. The Grand Mufti's position is attached to the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, and he advises the Government on matters of Islamic faith and ensures that Islamic laws are respected. He is nominated by the president of Comoros. The Grand Mufti periodically consults with a group of elders to assess whether the principles of Islam are respected, and he regularly addresses the nation on the radio regarding social and religious issues such as marriage, divorce, and education. While the study of Islam is not compulsory in public schools, the tenets of Islam are sometimes taught in conjunction with the Arabic language in public schools at the middle school level. There is societal discrimination against non-Muslims, particularly Christians, in some sectors of society. All citizens face societal pressure to practice elements of Islam, particularly during the month of Ramadan. Most societal pressure and discrimination occurs behind closed doors at the village level. The extent of de facto discrimination typically depends on the level of involvement of local Islamic teachers. Most non-Muslim citizens did not openly practice their faith for fear of societal rejection. Persons who raise their children with non-Muslim religious teachings face societal discrimination. Societal pressure and intimidation continued to restrict the use of the country's three churches to non-citizens. == Democratic Republic of the Congo == The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice, although it often lacks the institutional infrastructure to enforce anti-discrimination laws.Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Democratic Republic of the Congo. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. However, violence between Muslims and other religious groups in the Congo, especially Congolese Christians, has been attested in North Kivu since 2014 in connection with the Allied Democratic Forces insurgency begun in neighboring Uganda. The Allied Democratic Forces, whose political ideology is based on Islamism, is widely suspected of having perpetrated the Beni massacre in August 2016. The law provides for the establishment and operation of religious institutions and requires practicing religious groups to register with the government; registration requirements were simple and implemented in a nondiscriminatory manner. In practice unregistered religious groups operated unhindered. == Djibouti == Article 1 of the Constitution of Djibouti names Islam as the sole state religion, and Article 11 provides for the equality of citizens of all faiths and freedom of religious practice. The equality of citizens regardless of religion is also stressed repeatedly in other articles as well. The constitution also forbids religiously-based political parties in Article 6. According to the International Religious Freedom Report 2014, while Muslim Djiboutians have the legal right to convert to or marry someone from another faith, converts may encounter negative reactions from their family and clan or from society at large, and they often face pressure to revert to Islam. In 2012, a law was passed that grants the Ministry of Religious Affairs increased oversight of Djibouti's mosques, including of messages disseminated during Friday prayers. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs reportedly used the new law that regulated mosques to replace imams and temporarily close some mosques. Some imams reported being questioned by security services following sermons with strong political and social justice themes. There were also reports of plainclothes officers monitoring the content of Friday sermons and the activities of people attending mosque services. In 2014, the government issued a decree executing a law on state control of mosques which converted the status of imams into civil service employees under the Ministry of Islamic Affairs and transferred ownership of mosque properties and other assets to the government. The Secretary General of the Ministry of Religious Affairs stated the decree aims to eliminate political activity from mosques and provide greater government oversight of mosque assets and activities. Government officials also indicated the law was designed to counter perceived foreign influence in mosques.\\"DJIBOUTI 2015 INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT\\". U.S. Department of State. Retrieved October 15, 2016. According to article 23 of the Family Code, a non-Muslim man may marry a Muslim woman only after converting to Islam. Non-Islamic marriages are not legally recognized by the government, which only recognizes marriages performed in accordance with the Ministry of Islamic Affairs or the Ministry of the Interior. There are approximately 40 private Islamic schools nationwide, which are managed by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs and the Ministry of Education. The public schools remain secular, although the Ministry of Islamic Affairs instituted a program in which religious leaders visit the secular schools for an hour to answer religious questions in non-mandatory events. == Egypt == Constitutionally, freedom of belief is \\"absolute\\" and the practice of religious rites is provided in Egypt, but the government has historically persecuted its Coptic minority and unrecognized religions.article 64 of the 2014 Constitution Islam is the official state religion, and Shari'a is the primary source of all new legislation.article 2 of the Egyptian constitution (starting from Constitution of 1971, and all following ones (2007, 2012 and 2014)) Egypt's population is majority Sunni Muslims. Shi'a Muslims constitute less than 1 percent of the population. Estimates of the percentage of Christians range from 10 to 20 percent. === Treatment of Coptic Christians === Coptic Christians, an ethnoreligious group indigenous to Egypt, face discrimination at multiple levels of the government, ranging from a disproportional representation in government ministries to laws that limit their ability to build or repair churches. Coptic Christians are minimally represented in law enforcement, state security, and public office, and are discriminated against in the workforce on the basis of their religion. In 2009, The Pew Forum ranked Egypt among the 12 worst countries in the world in terms of religious violence against religious minorities and in terms of social hostilities against Christians. === Treatment of Ahmadiyya Muslims === The Ahmadiyya movement in Egypt, which numbers up to 50,000 adherents in the country, was established in 1922Yohanan Friedmann. Prophecy Continuous: Aspects of Ahmadi Religious Thought and its Medieval Background Oxford University Press, 2003 p.24 but has seen an increase in hostility and government repression as of the 21st century. The Al-Azhar University has denounced the Ahmadis and Ahmadis have been hounded by police along with other Muslim groups deemed to be deviant under Egypt's defamation laws.Lawrence, Bruce B. (2013; p.302), 'Citizen Ahmad among the Believers: Salvation Contextualized in Indonesia and Egypt' in Khalil, M. H. (ed.) Between Heaven and Hell: Islam, Salvation, and the Fate of Others, pp.288-312. New York: Oxford University Press === Treatment of Bah√° º√≠ === Egypt's government-issued ID cards have historically declared the holder's religion, but only the religions of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism were considered valid options by the government. As an unrecognized religious group that faced explicit government persecution for much of the 20th century, members of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Egypt (est. pop 2,000) historically would rely on sympathetic government clerks to get their ID cards marked with either a dash, \\"other\\", or Bah√° º√≠. As Egypt adopted an electronic ID system in the 1990s, Electronic processing locked out the possibility of an unlisted religion, or any religious affiliation other than Muslim, Christian, or Jewish. Consequently, adherents of any other faith (or no faith) became unable to obtain any government identification documents (such as national identification cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion.Bah√° º√≠s became virtual non-citizens, without access to employment, education, and all government services, including hospital care. In a series of court cases from 2006 to 2008, judges ruled that the government should issue ID cards with a dash instead of religious affiliation for Bah√° º√≠ citizens. The issue is presumed to have been resolved as of 2009. === Treatment of atheists === There are Egyptians who identify themselves as atheist and agnostic. It is however difficult to quantify their number as the stigma attached to being one makes it hard for irreligious Egyptians to publicly profess their views. Furthermore, public statements that can be deemed critical of Islam or Christianity can be tried under the country's notorious blasphemy law. Outspoken atheists, like Alber Saber, have been convicted under this law. The number of atheists is reportedly on the rise among the country's youth, many of whom organize and communicate with each other on the internet. In 2013 an Egyptian newspaper reported that 3 million out of 84 million Egyptians are atheists. While the government has acknowledged this trend, it has dealt with it as a problem that needs to be confronted, comparing it to religious extremism. Despite hostile sentiments towards them atheists in Egypt have become increasingly vocal on internet platforms like YouTube and Facebook since the Egyptian revolution of 2011, with some videos discussing atheist ideas receiving millions of views. In a 2011 Pew Research poll of 1,798 Muslims in Egypt, 63% of those surveyed supported \\"the death penalty for people who leave the Muslim religion.\\" However, no such punishment actually exists in the country.Egypt 2015 International Religious Freedom Report In January 2018 the head of the parliament's religious committee, Amr Hamroush, suggested a bill to make atheism illegal, stating that \\"it [atheism] must be criminalised and categorised as contempt of religion because atheists have no doctrine and try to insult the Abrahamic religions\\". Atheists or irreligious people cannot change their official religious status, thus statistically they are counted as followers of the religion they were born with. == Equatorial Guinea == The Constitution of Equatorial Guinea provides for the freedom of religion, and prohibits the establishment of political parties on the basis of religion. The law establishes no state religion, but the government gives preference to the Roman Catholic Church and the Reformed Church of Equatorial Guinea, which are the only religious groups not required to register their organization or activities with the Ministry of Justice, Religious Affairs, and Penitentiary Institutions (MJRAPI) The government provides funds to the Catholic Church and its schools for educational programming. Catholic masses are also a normal part of official government ceremonial functions. Permits are required for door-to-door proselytism. While some time limits are officially imposed on public religious activities, Evangelical Christian groups often hold activities outside the prescribed period without government intervention. == Eritrea == Eritrea officially recognizes only the Orthodox, Catholic, and Lutheran Christian churches and Sunni Islam. Those practicing religions that are not recognized face imprisonment. Human rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented serious violations of the right to freedom of religion. They report disruption of private worship, mass arrests of participants at religious weddings, prayer meetings, and other gatherings.SHADOW REPORT TO THE AFRICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN AND PEOPLES' RIGHTS, Amnesty International. 2018 == Eswatini == The constitution and laws protect religious freedom in Eswatini, but \\"minority religious groups enjoy fewer protections under traditional laws and customs, which include traditional courts and the authority of approximately 360 chiefs\\", according to a U.S. State Department report on religious freedom. \\"When a religious group's practices conflict with tradition and culture as defined by chiefs, they may direct community pressure against the group.\\" Religious groups must obtain the approval of chiefs before constructing houses of worship. New congregations must submit applications to the authorities through one of three umbrella bodies: the League of Churches, Swaziland Conference of Churches, or Council of Swaziland Churches. Believers practice openly and without interference, with Muslim clergy being permitted access to prisoners and Bah√° º√≠ schools allowed to close on that religion's holy days. Despite a general respect for religious freedom, however, there is still a degree of societal discrimination, especially toward non-Christian faiths. == Ethiopia == The constitution of Ethiopia codifies the separation of religion and the state, establishes freedom of religious choice, prohibits religious discrimination, and stipulates that the government will not interfere in the practice of any religion. The federal government generally follows these principles, although there have been abuses at the level of local government. Protestant and Muslim groups have alleged that the government discriminates against them. Religious groups must register with the government to obtain legal status, which grants them the right to congregate in public and to request land from the government for the construction of religious buildings. Religious instruction is not allowed in public or private schools. However, a separate category of religious schools are allowed to provide religious instruction. There have been isolated incidents of violence between religious groups. Political parties based on religious denominations are not allowed. == Gabon == The constitution of Gabon prohibits religious discrimination and provides for the freedom of religion and equality for all, irrespective of religious belief. It grants religious groups autonomy and the right to provide religious instruction. The state provides for public education based on ‚Äúreligious neutrality.‚Äù Public schools are secular and do not provide religious instruction. Muslim, Catholic, and Protestant groups operate primary and secondary schools, in which representatives of religious groups give religious instruction. These schools must register with the Ministry of Education (Gabon), which ensures they meet the same standards as public schools. Catholic, Muslim, and Protestant leaders meet regularly and work together to promote religious tolerance. == The Gambia == The constitution of the Gambia guarantees and protects the freedom of religion in Articles 17, 25, 32, 33, and 212. Article 60 of the constitution prohibits forming political parties that are formed on a religious basis. The Supreme Islamic Council is an independent body that advises the government on religious issues. Although not represented on the council, the government provides the council with substantial funding. The country's president serves as the minister of religious affairs and maintains a formal relationship with the council.International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Gambia. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (September 14, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The constitution establishes Qadi courts, with Muslim judges trained in the Islamic legal tradition for matters pertaining to marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance for Muslims. The Qadi courts are located in each of the country's seven regions. Muslim law also applies to interfaith couples where there is one Muslim spouse. Non-Qadi district tribunals, which deal with issues under the customary and traditional law, apply sharia, if relevant when presiding over cases involving Muslims. A five-member Qadi panel has purview over appeals regarding decisions of the Qadi courts and non-Qadi district tribunals relating to sharia. Foreign missionary groups operate in the country. The government does not require religious groups to register. Faith- based nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) must meet the same registration and licensing requirements as other NGOs. == Ghana == The constitution of Ghana prohibits religious discrimination and stipulates individuals are free to profess and practice their religion.United States International Religious Freedom Report for 2017, US State Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Registration is required for religious groups to have legal status. Ghanaian society is very tolerant of differences in religion.Owusu-Ansah (1994), \\"Religion and Society\\". However, religious dress codes, particularly those pertaining to the wearing of hijabs by women, have been enforced in publicly funded Christian and Muslim schools, despite a directive from the Ministry of Education that would prohibit such dress codes. == Guinea == The constitution of Guinea establishes that Guinea is a secular state where all enjoy equality before the law, regardless of religion. The constitution provides for the right of individuals to choose, change, and practice the religion of their choice. The imams and administrative staff of the principal mosque in the capital city of Conakry, and the principal mosques in the main cities of the four regions, are government employees. These mosques are directly under the administration of the government. The Guinean government's Secretariat of Religious Affairs aims to promote better relations among religious denominations and ameliorate interethnic tensions. The secretary general of religious affairs appoints six national directors to lead the offices of Christian affairs, Islamic affairs, pilgrimages, places of worship, economic affairs and the endowment, and general inspector. Private Muslim and Christian schools are prevalent, and some Muslim schools receive funding from the local government.International Religious Freedom Report for 2017 Guinea, US Department of State Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Religious groups may not own radio or television stations, but the government provides broadcast time for religious groups on state-owned television channels, and privately owned radio stations are allowed to air religious programming. === Societal attitudes === In some parts of Guinea, strong familial, communal, cultural, social, or economic pressure discourage conversion from Islam. It has been reported that in the town of Dinguiraye, a holy city for African Muslims, public celebration of non-Muslim religious holidays or festivals are not permitted. Dinguiraye town authorities have also refused permission to build a church within its boundaries. Members of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith have reported that they are discriminated against and shunned by their families because of their religious beliefs. There were 3 days of ethno-religious fighting in the city of Nzerekore in July 2013.\\"Guinea's Conde appeals for calm after 11 killed in ethnic clashes\\", Reuters, July 16, 2013.\\"Guinean troops deployed after deadly ethnic clashes\\", BBC Africa, 17 July 2013. Fighting between ethnic Kpelle, who are Christian or animist, and ethnic Konianke, who are Muslims and close to the larger Malinke ethnic group, left at least 54 dead. The violence ended after the military of Guinea imposed a curfew, and President Cond√© made a televised appeal for calm. == Guinea-Bissau == The constitution of Guinea-Bissau establishes the separation of religion and state and the responsibility of the state to respect and protect legally recognized religious groups.International Religious Freedom Report for 2017 Guinea-Bissau US Department of State Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. In accordance with the constitution, there is no religious instruction in public schools. There are some private schools operated by religious groups. == Ivory Coast == The constitution of Ivory Coast calls for a secular state, although this is not interpreted as strict separation of church and state. Officials often attend religious ceremonies as representatives of the state, and some mission schools receive government aid. Missionaries are generally welcomed throughout the nation. The constitution also prohibits religious discrimination in employment, and emphasizes religious tolerance as central to the Ivory Coast's national unity. The government supervises and funds pilgrimages for Muslims (to go to Mecca for Hajj) and for Christians (to go to France, Israel, and local religious sites for African Christian churches). These pilgrims number a few thousand per year. == Kenya == === Legal framework === The constitution of Kenya and other laws and policies prohibit religious discrimination and protect religious freedom, including the freedom to practice any religion or belief. For certain civil cases, such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance, where all parties involved are Muslim, the constitution provides for special qadi courts to adjudicate based on Islamic law. The country's secular High Court has jurisdiction over civil or criminal proceedings, including those in the qadi courts, and accepts appeals of any qadi court decision. All public schools have religious education classes taught by government-funded teachers. The national curriculum mandates religious classes, and students may not opt out. Some public schools offer different options for religious education, usually Christian or Islamic studies, but they are not required to offer both. === Treatment of Muslims === Human rights and Muslim religious organizations stated that certain Muslim communities, especially ethnic Somalis, have been the target of government- directed extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest, and detention. A December 2016 report by a Mombasa-based human rights organization documented 81 extrajudicial killings and disappearances of Muslims from the coastal region over a five-year period. The government denied directing such actions. Ethnic Somali and other Muslim communities reported difficulties in obtaining government-mandated identification documents, citing heightened requirements for Muslim communities. === Societal attitudes === Atheism is greatly stigmatized in Kenya. Muslim minority groups, particularly those of Somali descent, reportedly continued to be harassed by non-Muslims. There were reports of religiously motivated threats of societal violence and intolerance, such as Muslim communities threatening individuals who converted from Islam to Christianity. According to religious leaders, some Muslim youths responded to alleged abuses by non-Muslim members of the police who came from other regions by vandalizing properties of local Christians. === Incidents === On October 17, 2017, authorities in the coastal city of Malindi in Kilifi County charged Christian televangelist Paul Makenzi and his wife with radicalizing children. In 2017, the Somalia-based terrorist group Al-Shabaab carried out attacks in Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, and Lamu Counties and said it had targeted non-Muslims because of their faith. == Lesotho == The constitution of Lesotho prohibits religious discrimination and provides for freedom of conscience, thought, and religion, including the freedom to change religion or belief and to manifest and propagate one's religion.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Lesotho US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The government provides extensive support for schools operated by religious groups, including paying and certifying all teachers. == Liberia == The constitution of Liberia provides for the separation of religion and state and stipulates all persons are entitled to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, except as required by law to protect public safety, order, health, or morals, or the rights of others. It also provides for equal protection under the law.International Religious Freedom Report for 2017 Liberia US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Starting in 2015, there has been a political campaign to pass a constitutional amendment that would name Liberia a \\"Christian nation\\". This campaign has been supported by the United People's Party, which is currently an opposition party in the Liberian government. Businesses are legally required to close on Sunday for municipal street cleaning, which Muslim citizens view as a pretext to force them to observe the Christian sabbath. Requests to make Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha national holidays have been made since 1995, and have not been implemented. Muslims account for roughly 12% of the population of Liberia. Muslim women have faced obstacles to voter registration, as poll workers have refused to take ID photographs for people wearing a hijab. The Liberia Muslim Women Network reported that this practice persisted despite other types of head coverings (including traditional garments and habits worn by Catholic nuns) being allowed. == Libya == thumb Military situation in Libya on 7 November 2018 (For a more detailed map, see military situation in the Libyan Civil War) The Libyan interim Constitutional Declaration states that Islam is the state religion and that Sharia is the principal source of legislation. It accords non-Muslims the freedom to practice their religion and bans discrimination based on religion.2017 International Religious Freedom Report Libya United States Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor The internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) does not control several regions of the country, and does not have the ability to enforce its laws there. Libya has a restrictive social environment, including efforts designed to prevent women from traveling alone outside the country. The RADA Special Deterrence Forces (RADA-SDF), a religious police force aligned with the GNA, was involved in the arrests of several individuals whom it accused of violating Islamic law. In Tripoli some militias reportedly imposed restrictions on women's dress and movement, and punished men for behavior they deemed to be ‚Äúun-Islamic.‚Äù The RADA-SDF has also been accused of deliberately destroying Sufi shrines during military clashses, although it denies these claims. === Tobruk Government === There have been reports the military governor aligned with the Tobruk government and the Libyan National Army increased restrictions on the movement of women without male guardians. === Extremist militias === Since May 2016, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has lost all significant territory that it held in Libya. Mass graves of executed Coptic Christians have been found in areas previously held by the Islamic State. Sporadic violence by extremist militias against Christians and Sufis have occurred since then, although the culprits have sometimes gone unidentified. == Madagascar == The constitution of Madagascar provides for the freedoms of religious thought and expression and prohibits religious discrimination in the workplace. Other laws protect individual religious freedom against abuses by government or private actors.2017 International Religious Freedom Report Madagascar US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Members of the Muslim community and adherents of some evangelical Protestant churches have reported that they have been denied admission into private schools and sometimes had limited access to employment due to their religious affiliation. Muslim community leaders have also criticized Madagascar's naturalization process as disproportionately barring Muslims from citizenship. The government's inconsistent enforcement of labor laws, particularly the provision that workers are entitled to at least one 24-hour break from work per week, has led to workers sometimes being forced to miss religious services. In April the minister of education threatened to close 16 Islamic schools he classified as ‚ÄúQuranic,‚Äù stating the schools were among 190 private schools identified as not complying with various administrative requirements. Representatives of the Muslim community criticized this declaration as Islamophobic. == Malawi == The constitution of Malawi prohibits discrimination based on religion and provides for freedom of conscience, religion, belief, and thought. It also specifies that eliminating religious intolerance is a goal of education in Malawi. Religious instruction is mandatory in public primary schools, with no opt-out provision, and is available as an elective in public secondary schools. In some schools, the religious curriculum is a Christian-oriented ‚ÄúBible knowledge‚Äù course, while in others it is an interfaith ‚Äúmoral and religious education‚Äù course drawing from the Christian, Islamic, Hindu, and Bah√° º√≠ faiths. According to the law, local school management committees, elected at parent-teacher association meetings, decide on which religious curriculum to use. Private Christian and Islamic schools offer religious instruction in their respective faiths. Hybrid ‚Äúgrant-aided‚Äù schools are managed by private, usually religious, institutions, but their teaching staffs are paid by the government. In exchange for this financial support, the government chooses a significant portion of the students who attend. At grant-aided schools, a board appointed by the school's operators decides whether the ‚ÄúBible knowledge‚Äù or the ‚Äúmoral and religious education‚Äù curriculum will be used. Rastafarian children face obstacles to obtaining education, as school children in Malawi are generally required to shave their heads, and Rastafarian religious practice requires them to wear dreadlocks. This has resulted in several Rastafarian children being denied access to public schools, although the majority concede to shaving their heads and complying with the school's rules. Religious pluralism is enshrined by Malawi society, and members of Christian, Muslim, and Hindu faiths regularly engage in business and civil society together. == Mauritania == Freedom of religion in Mauritania is limited by the government. The constitution establishes the country as an Islamic republic and decrees that Islam is the religion of its citizens and the State. In April 2018, the National Assembly passed a law making the death penalty mandatory for \\"blasphemy\\". Non-Muslim resident expatriates and a few non-Muslim citizens practice their religion openly with certain limitations against proselytizing to Muslims and transmitting religious materials. Almost all of the population are practicing Sunni Muslims, although there are a few non-Muslims. Roman Catholic and non- denominational Christian churches have been established in Nouakchott, Atar, Zouerate, Nouadhibou, and Rosso. A number of expatriates practice Judaism but there are no synagogues. Relations between the Muslim community and the small non-Muslim community are generally amicable. There are several foreign faith- based nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) active in humanitarian and developmental work in the country. The government does not register religious groups; however, secular NGOs, inclusive of humanitarian and development NGO's affiliated with religious groups, must register with the Ministry of the Interior.International Religious Freedom Report 2006. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on- international-religious-freedom/mauritania == Mauritius == The constitution of Mauritius prohibits discrimination on religious grounds and provides for freedom to practice or change one's religion. The government provides money to the Roman Catholic Church, Church of England, Presbyterian Church of Mauritius, Seventh-day Adventists, Hindus, and Muslims according to their numbers in the census in addition to tax-exempt status. Other religious groups can register and be tax-exempt but receive no subsidy. Religious education is allowed in public and private schools, at both the primary and high school levels. Students are permitted to opt out, and civic education classes are provided for non-Catholic students attending Catholic schools.2017 International Religious Freedom Report Mauritius US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Non-Hindus have often stated they were underrepresented in government. There are no reliable statistics available on the numbers of members of different religious groups represented in the civil service; however, the Truth and Justice Commission had stated in its latest report in 2011 that employment in the civil service did not represent national ethnoreligious diversity. There is tension between Hindus and Muslims in Mauritius. Police investigations revealed, however, that some alleged cases of interreligious violence were in fact cases of retaliation stemming from domestic or personal issues. == Morocco == == Namibia == The constitution of Namibia prohibits religious discrimination and provides for freedom of belief and the right to practice, profess, and promote any religion. Some religious groups have commented on the difficulty of obtaining work visas for foreign religious workers; however, they also noted that all organizations were subject to strict visa enforcement and this policy was not targeted at religious groups in particular.2017 International Religious Freedom Report Namibia US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. In 2017, there were no reports of significant societal actions affecting religious freedom in Namibia. In previous years, the Namibian Islamic Judicial Council reported that Muslims were targeted for deportation for working without valid visas. Religious groups are allowed to establish private schools provided that no student is denied admission based on creed. The government school curriculum contains a nonsectarian ‚Äúreligious and moral education‚Äù component that includes education on moral principles and human rights and introduces students to a variety of African traditions and religions, as well as world religions such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and Rastafarianism. == Niger == Freedom of religion for individuals is generally respected in Niger, with the government providing some oversight for the Muslim community. The constitution of Niger prohibits religious discrimination and provides for freedom of religion and worship consistent with public order, social peace, and national unity. It provides for the separation of state and religion and prohibits religiously affiliated political parties. The government prohibits full-face veils in Diffa Region under state of emergency provisions to prevent concealment of bombs and weapons. The government also prohibits open-air, public proselytization events due to stated safety concerns. The government created an Islamic Forum with the goal of standardizing the practice of Islam in Niger and preventing the use of Islamic institutions to spread Islamic extremism. The establishment of any private school by a religious association must be approved by various government bodies. Private madrasas, established uniquely to teach the Quran without providing other education, are unregulated. Mainstream public schools do not include religious education. The government funds a small number of special primary schools (called ‚ÄúFrench and Arabic Schools‚Äù) that include Muslim religious study as part of the curriculum. The Muslim and Christian communities in Niger generally have good relations, including ongoing interactions through a Muslim-Christian forum. == Nigeria == Nigeria is nearly equally divided between Christianity and Islam, though the exact ratio is uncertain. There is also a growing population of non-religious Nigerians who accounted for the remaining 5 percent. The majority of Nigerian Muslims are Sunni and are concentrated in the northern region of the country, while Christians dominate in the south. Nigeria allows freedom of religion. (Article 38) Islam and Christianity are the two major religions. 12 states in Nigeria use a sharia-based penal code, which can include penalties for apostasy. Religious persecution is largely carried out by groups not affiliated with the Nigerian government, such as Boko Haram.Nigeria: Recent reports regarding the treatment of persons who convert from Islam to Christianity. Recent reports on Sharia law in relation to religious conversion, Ireland: Refugee Documentation Centre, 26 June 2012, Q15539; available at: http://www.refworld.org/docid/50068bbf2.html [accessed 18 July 2014]. There is a great stigma attached to being an atheist. == Republic of the Congo == The constitution of the Republic of the Congo states that the Republic of the Congo is secular, prohibits religious discrimination, provides for freedom of religion, bans the use of religion for political ends, and stipulates impositions on freedom of conscience stemming from ‚Äúreligious fanaticism‚Äù shall be punishable by law.I nternational Religious Freedom Report for 2017 Congo, Republic of the US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. A government decree bans individuals from wearing full-face Islamic veils in public. This decree, which was established in 2015, received broad support from religious leaders and the general population, including Muslims. The law prohibits religious instruction in public schools. Private schools may provide religious instruction. The law requires that all public and private schools respect all philosophical and religious doctrines. The constitution protects the right to establish private schools. == Rwanda == The constitution of Rwanda and other laws prohibit religious discrimination and provide for freedom of religion and worship, and bars religious political parties as well as the participation of religious organizations in politics in Rwanda.International Religious Freedom Report for 2017 Rwanda, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor New public servants are required by law to take an oath of loyalty ‚Äúin the name of God almighty‚Äù and touch the flag while reciting the oath. Those who do not fulfill the requirement forfeit their position. The law does not make accommodations for religious minorities whose faith does not permit them to comply with this requirement. Jehovah's Witnesses have been forced to participate in compulsory night patrols and to recite a pledge of allegiance while holding the flag of Rwanda despite their religious objections. The government subsidizes some schools affiliated with different religious groups. A presidential order guarantees students attending any government-subsidized school the right to worship according to their beliefs during the school day, as long as their religious groups are registered in the country and the students‚Äô worship practices do not interfere with learning and teaching activities. The order does not stipulate any procedure for arranging special accommodations, and there have been reports of Catholic and Islamic schools that have not accommodated the religious observance of students of other religions. In 2017, two attacks on members of a Pentecostal church in the Huye District of Southern Province were reported. One day after six church members were attacked and severely beaten (leaving one in a coma as a result), an armed mob attacked the church at night, injuring 25 church members. In 2016 there were reports of Muslims and Muslim community leaders being targeted for arrest or attacked. == S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe == The constitution of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe provides for freedom of religion and worship and equality for all, irrespective of religious belief. It grants religious groups autonomy in and the right to teach their religion.International Religious Freedom Report for 2017 Sao Tome and Principe US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Religious groups in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe must register with the government. The United States Department of State reported no significant actions or complaints regarding religious freedom in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe in 2017. == Senegal == The constitution of Senegal provides for the free practice of religious beliefs and self-governance by religious groups in Senegal without government interference. By law all faith-based organizations must register with the government to acquire legal status as an association, and the government monitors groups to ensure that they operate within the terms of their registration. The government maintains programs to assist religious groups to maintain places of worship, to fund and facilitate participation in the Hajj, and to fund schools operated by religious groups. Muslims may choose either the civil family code or Sharia to adjudicate family conflicts, such as marriage and inheritance disputes. Civil court judges preside over civil and customary law cases, but religious leaders informally settle many disputes among Muslims, particularly in rural areas. By law religious education may be proposed in public and private schools, and parents have the option to enroll their children in the program. == Seychelles == The constitution of Seychelles prohibits all forms of discrimination and provides for the freedom of religion. Religious groups are barred from owning radio or television stations, but larger religious groups are given programming time on state radio.International Religious Freedom Report for 2017 Seychelles, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Compulsory religious education in schools is against the law. Nevertheless, non-Catholic students at Catholic schools were not provided with alternative activities during religious lessons. The government offers financial assistance to religious organizations for the purpose of repairing religious buildings. == Sierra Leone == The constitution of Sierra Leone provides for the freedom of conscience and thus for freedom of religion. Laws in Sierra Leone prohibit discrimination on religious grounds, and safeguard the right of citizens to change religions.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Sierra Leone, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor The Rastafari community in Sierra Leone has faced harassment and obstructions from the police and government of Sierra Leone, as cannabis, which plays an important role in Rastafari religious practice, is illegal in Sierra Leone. === Societal attitudes === Intermarriage between religious groups is common in Sierra Leone, and many families have members of more than one religion. Despite this, in the past few years, religious leaders have raised concerns about polemical and aggressive proselytization by Christian and Muslim fundamentalist groups, which have been further characterized as a foreign influence. == Somalia == Map of the Somali Civil War, up to date as of 2016Due to the Somali Civil War, the enforcement of laws pertaining to religion by the various autonomous governments in the region is inconsistent. Sunni Islam is the state religion in Somalia. Generally, the judiciary in most areas relies on xeer (traditional and customary law), sharia, and the penal code. In many regions, activity by Salafi groups further restricts religious freedom, as individuals are afraid of reprisal. Islam has been a core part of Somali national identity for the entirety of its modern history. A 1961 constitution established Islam as the state religion, and later governments have maintained this policy. The Somali Democratic Republic, which existed from 1969 to 1991, propagated an ideology merging elements of Islam and Marxism.de la Fosse Wiles, Peter John (1982) The New Communist Third World: an essay in political economy, Taylor & Francis, p. 279 . Following the collapse of this government, Somalia has experienced a prolonged civil war which has continued on and off since the 1990s. The official transitional national government has continued to uphold Islam as the state religion, and further established that the Somali legal code is based on principles of Islamic law. The region of Somaliland, which seceded at the outset of the civil war and remains nominally independent but internationally unrecognized, has established its own constitution founded on similar religious precepts. Activity by various Islamist insurgent groups further limits religious freedom, as individuals who do not comply with these groups' interpretations of Islamic law are targeted for reprisals. === Al- Shabaab === Al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda-affiliated militant group in Somalia, killed, maimed, or harassed persons suspected of converting from Islam or those who failed to adhere to the group's religious edicts. Fear of reprisals from al-Shabaab often prevented religious groups from operating freely. Al- Shabaab reportedly threatened to close mosques in areas it controlled if the mosques‚Äô teachings did not conform to the group's interpretation of Islam. === Societal attitudes === There is a strong societal pressure to adhere to Sunni traditions. Conversion from Islam to another religion has been socially unacceptable in all areas of Somalia. Those suspected of conversion face harassment by members of their community. According to the federal Ministry of Religious Affairs, more than 99 percent of the population is Sunni Muslim. Members of other religious groups combined constitute less than 1 percent of the population and include a small Christian community, a small Sufi Muslim community, and an unknown number of Shia Muslims. Immigrants and foreign workers, who are mainly from East African countries, belong mainly to other religious groups. == South Africa == South Africa is a secular democracy with freedom of religion guaranteed by its constitution. Pursuant to Section 9 of the Constitution, the Equality Act of 2000 prohibits unfair discrimination on various grounds including religion. The Equality Act does not apply to unfair discrimination in the workplace, which is covered by the Employment Equity Act. The Witchcraft Suppression Act of 1957 based on colonial witchcraft legislation criminalises claiming a knowledge of witchcraft, conducting specified practices associated with witchcraft including the use of charms and divination, and accusing others of practising witchcraft.Witchcraft Suppression Act 3 of 1957 In 2007 the South African Law Reform Commission received submissions from the South African Pagan Rights Alliance and the Traditional Healers Organisation requesting the investigation of the constitutionality of the act and on 23 March 2010 the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development approved a South African Law Reform Commission project to review witchcraft legislation. == South Sudan == The constitution of South Sudan provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies of the Government of South Sudan contribute to the generally free practice of religion. The Pew Research Center on Religion and Public Life report from December 2012 estimated that in 2010, there were 6.010 million Christians (60.46%), 3.270 million followers of African Traditional Religion (32.9%), 610,000 Muslims (6.2%) and 50,000 unaffiliated (no known religion) of a total 9,940,000 people in South Sudan.Pew Forum on Religion == Sudan == The 2019 transitional constitution of Sudan guarantees freedom of religion and omits reference to sharia as a source of law, unlike the 2005 constitution of Sudan's deposed president Omar al-Bashir whose government had outlawed apostasy and blasphemy against Islam. Bashir's government had also targeted Shia Muslims and those engaging in proselytization to faiths other than Islam. Christians had also faced restrictions in matter of religious freedom. Apostasy from Islam was decriminalized in July 2020, whereas previously those found guilty of apostasy could face the death penalty. In September 2020, the interim government established the separation of religion and state. == Tanzania == == Togo == The constitution of Togo specifies the state is secular and protects the rights of all citizens of Togo to exercise their religious beliefs, consistent with the nation's laws. Religious groups other than Roman Catholics, Protestants, and Muslims must register with the government. In 2016 and 2017, the government did not approve any pending registration applications from religious groups, nor did it accept new applications because additional legislation pertaining to religious freedom is being drafted. Approximately 900 applications remained pending at the end of 2017. The constitution prohibits the establishment of political parties based on religion. The law forbids private religious radio stations from broadcasting political material. The public school curriculum does not include religion classes. There are many Catholic, Protestant, and Islamic schools, to which the government assigns its own paid employees as additional teachers and staff. Other registered religious groups have the right to establish schools as long as they meet accreditation standards. === Societal attitudes === There is a high degree of religious tolerance in Togolese society. Members of different religious groups regularly to invite one another to their respective ceremonies. Marriage between persons of different religious groups remained common. According to the Directorate of Religious Affairs in the Ministry of Territorial Affairs, disputes continued to occur when new churches established themselves in neighborhoods, particularly those led by religious leaders from Nigeria. Local residents continued to state some of these congregations worshiped too loudly and often late at night, using drums. The MTA received 40 complaints during the year, nearly all regarding noise, and the ministry stated it sought to resolve them. These complaints reportedly often focused on evangelical Protestant congregations whose services often employ musical instruments and loud praying. == Tunisia == The constitution of Tunisia establishes that Islam is the state religion of Tunisia and requires the president to be Muslim, but also provides for the freedoms of belief, conscience, and religious practice. The constitution further designates that the government is the \\"guardian of religion\\" and that its duties include the promotion of the values of \\"moderation and tolerance\\", as well as prohibiting the use of mosques and other houses of worship to promote political agendas. Laws prohibit the promotion of discrimination, hatred, or violence along religious lines. The government subsidizes mosques and synagogues, appoints imams, and pays their salaries, and also pays the salary of the grand rabbi. The Grand Mufti is selected by the president. The Ministry of Religious Affairs suggests themes for Friday prayers, but does not regulate their content. The government may initiate administrative and legal procedures to remove imams whom authorities determine to be preaching ‚Äúdivisive‚Äù theology. It is mandatory for students in public schools to attend courses on Islam approximately one hour per week. The curriculum for secondary school students also includes references to the history of Judaism and Christianity. Religious groups may operate private schools. Provisions of law addressing marriage, divorce, and other personal status issues are largely based on principles of civil law, combined with elements of sharia. Laws of inheritance are principally based on requirements in sharia, but there are some provisions that allow for exceptions as outlined in the Code of Personal Status. The police in Tunisia have targeted Salafists and others profiled as terrorists with arrests, house searches, and other restrictions. The political party Hizb ut-Tahrir was suspended for one month by a court in Tunis for violating laws against the incitement of religious hatred and for advocating the establishment of a Caliphate. Women who wear a niqƒÅb are also sometimes harassed by police. Members of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith have also faced harassment by government officials, and the faith is not recognized by the government, although they are allowed to practice their religion in private. Jews and Christians are allowed to practice their religion in authorized houses of worship. In September 2017, the government abolished a law prohibiting Muslim women from marrying non-Muslim men. === Societal attitudes === Christian converts from Islam and atheists reported threats of violence and societal pressure to conceal their faith. === Incidents === In June 2017, during Ramadan, police arrested five individuals in Bizerte, who were subsequently sentenced to one month in prison for public indecency for eating or smoking in public during the daytime. The arrests were followed by protests calling for the individuals' release. The governor and Tunis and the minister of the interior also condemned the arrests In October 2017, the government approved the establishment of the openly atheist organization, the Tunisian Council of Secularism. == Uganda == The constitution of Uganda prohibits religious discrimination, establishes the freedom of conscience, and establishes that Uganda does not have a state religion.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Uganda, United States Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The constitution also bans the creation of political parties based on religion. The government restricts the activities of religious groups that it has defined as \\"cults\\", and also has arrested some individuals who refused to participate in vaccination initiatives for religious reasons. According to the Uganda Muslim Supreme Council, the government discriminates against Muslims when hiring government officials. In accordance with the constitution, religious instruction in public schools is optional. The state has developed separate curricula for a number of world religions, including Christianity and Islam. Public primary and secondary schools may choose which, if any, religious studies to incorporate into their curriculum; however, they must adhere to the state- approved curriculum for each religion they choose to teach. === Incidents === In December 2016, the Uganda Police Force raided two Salafi mosques in Kampala and arrested fourteen individuals for suspected involvement in the November 2016 killing of Sheikh Mohammed Kigundu, a Muslim cleric. The suspects were released in January 2017, and the police force apologized to the Muslim community, saying that it had acted on false intelligence. == Zambia == The constitution of Zambia establishes Zambia as a Christian country while prohibiting religious discrimination and guaranteeing the freedoms of conscience, belief and religion.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Zambia, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Some religious groups within Zambia have criticized actions President Edgar Lungu's government for \\"blurring the line between church and state\\" and showing religious favoritism to Christians. As of 2017, new registration requirements for religious groups have been criticized as excessively bureaucratic, and have resulted in difficulties for smaller religious groups, and resulted in at least one denial of entry and one deportation. Religious groups are allowed to establish private schools and provide religious instruction to members of their religious communities. The government requires religious instruction in all schools from grades one through nine. Students may request education in their religion and may opt out of religious instruction only if the school is not able to accommodate their request. Religious education after grade nine is optional and is not offered at all schools. The religious curriculum focuses on Christian teachings but also incorporates comparative studies of Islam, Hinduism, and traditional beliefs. === Societal attitudes === Several mob attacks against those suspected of witchcraft occurred in 2017. Victims were usually elderly, and incidents often resulted in the violent death of the accused. Some religious leaders from non- Christian communities, such as the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and Messianic Jewish communities, have expressed concerns that Christian church leaders have repeatedly singled out their religious practice and accused them of being \\"Satanic\\". == Zimbabwe == The constitution of Zimbabwe prohibits religious discrimination and guarantees the freedom of religion and practice in Zimbabwe. The government does not require religious groups to register; however, religious groups operating schools or medical facilities must register those institutions with the appropriate ministry. Religious groups as well as schools and medical facilities run by religious groups may receive tax-exempt status. The government of Zimbabwe has on several occasions in 2017 arrested religious leaders and disrupted or prohibited religious gatherings which were perceived to be critical of the government. The Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education (MPSE) sets curricula for public primary and secondary schools. Many public primary schools require a religious education course focusing on Christianity but covering other religious groups, emphasizing religious tolerance. There is no provision for opting out of religious instruction courses at the primary level. Students are able to opt out at the secondary level beginning at age 14, when they begin to choose their courses. The government does not regulate religious education in private schools but must approve employment of headmasters and teachers at those schools. ==References== Africa Category:Religion in Africa ","title":"Freedom of religion in Africa by country"},{"id":"60258222","text":"Habit Boronia hapalophylla is a plant in the citrus family Rutaceae and is endemic to New South Wales. It is an erect or straggling shrub with simple leaves, hairy branches and relatively large pink, four-petalled flowers. ==Description== Boronia hapalophylla is an erect or straggling shrub that grows to about high and has branches with minute, star-like hairs. The leaves are simple, narrow elliptic to lance-shaped, mostly long, wide with a hairy, paler underside and the edges rolled down. The leaves are sessile or sometimes have a petiole up to long. The flowers are pink, sometimes white and are arranged singly or in groups of up to seven in leaf axils, the groups on a peduncle up to long (if present), the individual flowers on a pedicel long. The four sepals are broadly egg-shaped to triangular, mostly long, wide and hairy on the back. The four petals are long and densely hairy on the back. Flowering occurs mainly in August and September. ==Taxonomy and naming== Boronia hapalophylla was first formally described in 2004 by Marco Duretto, John Edwards and Patricia Edwards who published the description in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (hapalophylla) is said to be derived from the Ancient Greek word hapalo meaning \\"soft to touch\\" and phyllus meaning \\"leaf\\", referring to the soft, hairy surface of the leaves. In Ancient Greek \\"soft to touch\\" and \\"leaf\\" are however hapalos (·ºÅœÄŒ±ŒªœåœÇ) and phyllon (œÜœçŒªŒªŒøŒΩ).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon.

The great diversity is related to the many ridges and valleys which form isolated communities in which species evolve separately from one another. The region lies south of the glaciers that covered North America 11,000 years go. To escape the glaciers, northern species retreated south to find refuge in the southern Appalachians. When the glaciers retreated, many of these species remained along with the southern species that were native to the area. The diversity includes trees, mosses, millipedes and salamanders. small whorled pogonia Biodiversity in the southern Appalachians is being threatened by the cutting down of forests, damming off rivers and the paving of land for farms and towns, leading to the loss of species by fragmentation of the ecological landscape. Many species, once common and abundant, are now confined to islands of refuge. The national forests provide enclaves for the survival of many threatened species. Rare species found in the area of the Craig Creek Cluster include a variety of flora and fauna--mussels, the Atlantic Pigtoe and James Spineymussel; a fish, the Orange Madtom; mammals, the northern long-eared Myotis and the Indiana Bat;, and a vascular plant, the small whorled pogonia. ==Geologic history== The cluster contains North Mountain, Patterson Mountain and Price Mountain; long, linear ridges, typical of the Ridge and Valley Province. Craig Creek and Catawba Creek, the two principal creeks in the area, are tributaries of the James River. ==New Castle Ranger District== The cluster is in the former New Castle Ranger District, which has now been absorbed into the Eastern Divide Ranger District. The New Castle Ranger District included Craig County and parts of Botetourt and Monroe County in West Virginia. The ridges of the New Castle District were once covered with a forest composed of about 50% chestnut trees, often growing as high as 120 feet with a 10-foot diameter. The wood was lightweight, straight-grained and split easily. Mast from the trees supplied nourishment to both people and wildlife. In 1906 a fungus from China was introduced that killed 3.5 billion trees with a devastating effect on those who had come to depend on it. In 1938, The New Castle district had an estimated 15,000 ‚Äì 20,000 cords of dead chestnut. Between the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, industrial woodcutting supplied charcoal firing for iron making. Consuming an acre of forest per day, the cutting lay bare bottomland forest and mountainside woods. Following the Civil War, annual plowing and grazing created soil erosion impacting wildlife. Game populations were reduced by unregulated hunting as well as the practice of field burning that left hillsides bare. Then construction of railroads in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries supported the intensive cutting of trees on an industrial level leading to degradation of much of the forests in southwest Virginia. The eastern national forests were created to restore the integrity of the forest lands. ==Other clusters== Other clusters of the Wilderness Society's \\"Mountain Treasures\\" in the Jefferson National Forest (north to south): *Glenwood Cluster *Barbours Creek-Shawvers Run Cluster *Sinking Creek Valley Cluster *Mountain Lake Wilderness Cluster *Angels Rest Cluster *Walker Mountain Cluster *Kimberling Creek Cluster *Garden Mountain Cluster *Mount Rogers Cluster *Clinch Ranger District Cluster ==References== ==Further reading== * Stephenson, Steven L., A Natural History of the Central Appalachians, 2013, West Virginia University Press, West Virginia, . * Davis, Donald Edward, Where There Are Mountains, An Environmental History of the Southern Appalachians, 2000, University of Georgia Press, Athens, Georgia. . ==External links== * George Washington and Jefferson National Forests * Wilderness Society * Geology of Virginia * Vegetation of the Craig Creek Watershed Category:Protected areas of Virginia ","title":"Craig Creek Cluster"},{"id":"60258235","text":"Lithops meyeri is a species of living stone (Lithops), under the family Aizoaceae.

States can differ based on whether or not they guarantee equal treatment under law for followers of different religions, whether they establish a state religion (and the legal implications that this has for both practitioners and non- practitioners), the extent to which religious organizations operating within the country are policed, and the extent to which religious law is used as a basis for the country's legal code. There are further discrepancies between some countries' self-proclaimed stances of religious freedom in law and the actual practice of authority bodies within those countries: a country's establishment of religious equality in their constitution or laws does not necessarily translate into freedom of practice for residents of the country. Additionally, similar practices (such as having citizens identify their religious preference to the government or on identification cards) can have different consequences depending on other sociopolitical circumstances specific to the countries in question. Most countries in Asia officially establish the freedom of religion by law, but the extent to which this is enforced varies.

Roughly 90% of the Afghans follow Sunni Islam, with the rest practicing Shia Islam. Apart from Muslims, there are also small minorities of Sikhs and Hindus. The Constitution of Afghanistan established on January 23, 2004 mandates that: # Afghanistan shall be an Islamic Republic, independent, unitary, and an indivisible state. # The sacred religion of Islam shall be the religion of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Followers of other faiths shall be free within the bounds of law in the exercise and performance of their religious rights. # No law shall contravene the tenets and provisions of the holy religion of Islam in Afghanistan. In practice, the constitution limits the political rights of Afghanistan's non-Muslims, and only Muslims are allowed to become the President. In March 2015, a 27-year-old Afghan woman was murdered by a mob in Kabul over false allegations of burning a copy of the Koran. After beating and kicking Farkhunda, the mob threw her over a bridge, set her body on fire and threw it in the river. === Taliban controlled regions === Map showing insurgent and government-controlled areas of Afghanistan, as of February 19, 2017Historically, the Taliban, which controlled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, prohibited free speech about religious issues or discussions that challenge orthodox Sunni Muslim views. Repression by the Taliban of the Hazara ethnic group, which is predominantly Shia Muslim, was particularly severe. Although the conflict between the Hazaras and the Taliban was political and military as well as religious, and it is not possible to state with certainty that the Taliban engaged in its campaign against the Shi'a solely because of their religious beliefs, the religious affiliation of the Hazaras apparently was a significant factor leading to their repression. After the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the Taliban was forced out of power and began an insurgency against the new government and allied US forces. The Taliban continues to prohibit music, movies, and television on religious grounds in areas that it still holds. According to the U.S. Military, the Taliban controls 10% of Afghanistan as of December 2017. There are also pockets of territory controlled by Islamic State affiliates. On October 14, 2017, The Guardian reported that there were then between 600 and 800 ISIL-KP militants left in Afghanistan, who are mostly concentrated in Nangarhar Province. ==Armenia== As of 2011, most Armenians are Christians (94.8%) and members of Armenia's own church, the Armenian Apostolic Church. The Constitution of Armenia as amended in December 2005 provides for freedom of religion; however, the law places some restrictions on the religious freedom of adherents of minority religious groups, and there were some restrictions in practice. The Armenian Apostolic Church which has formal legal status as the national church, enjoys some privileges not available to other religious groups. Some denominations reported occasional discrimination by mid- or low-level government officials but found high-level officials to be tolerant. Societal attitudes toward some minority religious groups were ambivalent, and there were reports of societal discrimination directed against members of these groups. The law does not mandate registration of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including religious groups; however, only registered organizations have legal status. Only registered groups may publish newspapers or magazines, rent meeting places, broadcast programs on television or radio, or officially sponsor the visas of visitors, although there is no prohibition on individual members doing so. There were no reports of the Government refusing registration to religious groups that qualified for registration under the law. To qualify for registration, religious organizations must \\"be free from materialism and of a purely spiritual nature,\\" and must subscribe to a doctrine based on \\"historically recognized holy scriptures.\\" The Office of the State Registrar registers religious entities. The Department of Religious Affairs and National Minorities oversees religious affairs and performs a consultative role in the registration process. A religious organization must have at least 200 adult members to register. The Law on Freedom of Conscience prohibits \\"proselytizing\\" but does not define it. The prohibition applies to all groups, including the Armenian Church. Most registered religious groups reported no serious legal impediments to their activities. ==Azerbaijan== The Constitution of Azerbaijan provides that persons of all faiths may choose and practice their religion without restriction, although, some sources state that there have been some abuses and restrictions. Azerbaijan is a majority Muslim country. Various estimates calculate that upwards of 95% of the population identify as Muslim.Administrative Department of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan - Presidential Library - Religion Most are adherents of Shia branch with a minority (15%) being Sunni Muslim, although differences traditionally have not been defined sharply. For many Azerbaijanis, Islam tends toward a more ethnic/nationalistic identity than a purely religious one. Religious groups are required by law to register with the State Committee on Religious Associations of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Organizations which fail to register may be considered illegal and may be forbidden to operate within Azerbaijan. Some religious groups reported delays in and denials of their registration attempts. There are limitations upon the ability of groups to import religious literature. Most religious groups met without government interference; however, local authorities monitored religious services, and officials at times harassed and detained members of \\"nontraditional\\" religious groups. There were some reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. The US. State Department reported prejudice against Muslims who convert to other faiths and hostility toward groups that proselytize, particularly evangelical Christian and other missionary groups, as well as Iranian groups and Salafists, who are seen as a threat to security. == Bahrain == The constitution of Bahrain states that Islam is the official religion and that Shari'a (Islamic law) is a principal source for legislation. Article 22 of the Constitution provides for freedom of conscience, the inviolability of worship, and the freedom to perform religious rites and hold religious parades and meetings, in accordance with the customs observed in the country; however, the government placed some limitations on the exercise of this right. Shi'a Muslims are discriminated against by the government socially and economically, although the government still supports Shi'a religious institutions financially.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Bahrain, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The government of Bahrain allows religion-based, political nongovernmental organizations to register as political \\"societies\\", which operate somewhat like parties with the legal authority to conduct political activities. The law prohibits the publication of anti-Islamic publications; other religious groups have reported that they have faced no obstacles buying or selling their own religious texts. Holding a religious meeting without a permit is illegal; however, there have been no reports of religious groups being denied a permit to gather. The High Council for Islamic Affairs is charged with the review and approval of all clerical appointments within both the Sunni and Shi'a communities and maintains program oversight for all citizens studying religion abroad. Historically there is evidence of discrimination against Shi'a Muslims in recruitment for the country's military and domestic security services. The government funds all official religious institutions, including Shi'a and Sunni mosques, Shi'a ma\`tams (religious community centers), Shi'a and Sunni waqfs (religious endowments), and the religious courts, which represent both the Ja'afari (Shi'a) and Maliki (Sunni) schools of Islamic jurisprudence. The Government permits public religious events, most notably the large annual commemorative marches by Shi'a Muslims during the Islamic months of Ramadan and Muharram. Islamic studies are a part of the curriculum in government schools and mandatory for all public school students. The decades-old curriculum is based on the Maliki school of Sunni theology. Proposals to include the Ja'afari traditions of Shi'a Islam in the curriculum have been rejected. The civil and criminal legal systems consist of a complex mix of courts based on diverse legal sources, including Sunni and Shi'a Shari'a, tribal law, and other civil codes and regulations. === Interventions against the Shi'a community === During the 2011‚Äì2012 Arab Spring uprising and crackdown against Shia protest in Bahrain, \\"dozens\\" of Shia mosques [were] leveled by the government according to a report in McClatchy newspapers. According to Shiite leaders interviewed by the reporter, work crews have often arrived \\"in the dead of night, accompanied by police and military escorts\\", to demolish the mosques, and in many cases, have hauled away the buildings' rubble before townspeople awake so as to leave no trace. Sheikh Khalid bin Ali bin Abdulla al Khalifa, the minister of justice and Islamic affairs for Bahrain, defended the demolitions stating: \\"These are not mosques. These are illegal buildings.\\" However the McClatchy reporter found that photos taken of several mosques before their destruction by the government \\"showed they were well maintained, decades-old structures.\\"Bahrain's Sunni rulers target Shiite mosques, By Roy Gutman, McClatchy Newspapers, May 11, 2011 Since 2016, Sheikh Isa Qassim, a leading Shi'a figure, has been under house arrest. Protests around his home in June 2016 resulted in 5 deaths, 286 arrests, and 31 injured police officers In 2017, militant groups attacked police forces with improvised explosive devices, killing four. The militant groups justified their attacks with Shi'a rhetoric, and in response the government prosecuted members of the Shi'a community, as well as blaming Iran for providing material aid to the militant groups. === Status of Jewish community === Jewish people in Bahrain regularly practice their faith privately without interference from the government or fear of harassment. While some anti-Zionist political commentary and editorial cartoons appeared, usually linked to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, outside of a political context the Jewish minority is fully respected and allowed to operate freely. In 2008 Bahrain named Houda Ezra Ebrahim Nonoo, a Jewish female lawmaker, ambassador to the United States. == Bangladesh == Bangladesh was founded as a secular state, but Islam was made the state religion in the 1980s. However, in 2010, the High Court held up the secular principles of the 1972 constitution.Verdict paves way for secular democracy. The Daily Star. 30 July 2010. Retrieved on 22 August 2010. The Constitution of Bangladesh establishes Islam as the state religion but also allows other religions to be practiced in harmony. Constitution of Bangladesh While the government of Bangladesh does not interfere in the free practice of religion by people within its borders, incidences of individual violence against minority groups are common. In particular, Chakma Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, and Ahmadiyya Muslims are subject to persecution.Bangladesh: Bomber Attacks a Mosque, New York Times, 26 December 2015 Additionally, atheists face persecution, with prominent bloggers having been assassinated by radical groups, such as the Ansarullah Bangla Team. Family law concerning marriage, divorce, and adoption has separate provisions for Muslims, Hindus, and Christians. These laws are enforced in the same secular courts. A separate civil family law applies to mixed faith families or those of other faiths or no faith. The government operates training academies for imams, and monitors the content of religious education in Islamic religious schools, or madrassahs, and announced its intention to make changes to the curriculum, including modernising and mainstreaming the content of religious education. In 2013, Supreme Court deregistered the Jamaat-e-Islami, the largest Islamist political party, for violating the constitution, thereby banning it from participating in elections. However, the ban was not enforced in practice. Religious studies are compulsory and part of the curriculum in all government schools. Students attend classes in which their own religious beliefs are taught. Schools with few students from minority religious groups are generally allowed to make arrangements with local churches or temples to hold religious studies classes outside of school hours. === Persecution of religious minorities === ==== Hindus ==== Hindus in Bangladesh have faced violence throughout the country's history, having been subjected to what most academics consider to be a genocide during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. There have been more recent instances of violence in the 2010s. In 2016 violence over blasphemy accusations lead to the destruction of 15 Hindu temples and 100 homes, although authorities suggest only 8 temples and 22 houses were damaged. According to a report by the Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mohajote, in 2017 alone, at least 107 people of the Hindu community were killed and 31 fell victims to enforced disappearances, while 782 Hindus were either forced to leave the country or faced threats demanding that they leave. A further 23 were forced to convert. At least 25 Hindu women and children were raped, while 235 temples and statues vandalized during the year. According to the BJHM, the total number of distinct \\"atrocities\\" that affected the Hindu community in 2017 is 6474. During the 2019 Bangladesh elections, eight houses belonging to Hindu families on fire in Thakurgaon District alone. ==== Chakma people ==== In June 2017, hundreds of Bengali Muslim villagers in the southeastern part of the country set fire to 300 houses belonging to members of the Chakma people, a mostly Buddhist minority. A 70-year-old woman died during the attacks. The arson followed the killing of a local Muslim resident. ==== Christians ==== In 2018, Bangladesh was number 41 on the World Watch List for religious persecution of Christians, between the United Arab Emirates and Algeria. In 2016, four people were murdered for their Christian faith. The growing Christian population is met by growing persecution. ==== Ahmadiyya ==== Ahmadis have been targeted by various protests and acts of violence, and fundamentalist Islamic groups have demanded that Ahmadis be officially declared kafirs (infidels).Rahman, Waliur. \\"Violent Dhaka rally against sect\\". BBC News. 23 December 2005.\\"Bangladesh: The Ahmadiyya Community ‚Äì their rights must be protected\\". Amnesty International. 22 April 2004. ==== Atheists ==== Several Bangladeshi atheists have been assassinated, and a \\"hit list\\" exists issued by the Bangladeshi Islamic organisation, the Ansarullah Bangla Team. Activist atheist bloggers have left Bangladesh under threat of assassination. == Bhutan == The Bhutanese Constitution of 2008 and previous law provide for freedom of religion in Bhutan; however, the government has limited non-Buddhist missionary activity, barring non-Buddhist missionaries from entering the country, limiting construction of non-Buddhist religious buildings, and restricting the celebration of some non-Buddhist religious festivals. Drukpa Kagyu (Mahayana) Buddhism is the state religion, although in the southern areas many citizens openly practice Hinduism, and there is an increasing acceptance of Hinduism as a religion in Bhutan, including support from the royal family of Bhutan. There are reports of discrimination against Christians in the country, who are forced to practice their religion in private (or to cross the border into India to hold public services). According to a Christian religious leader, Christian children are sometimes denied access to schools. Religious political parties are forbidden by the constitution of Bhutan. == Brunei == The constitution of Brunei states, \\"The religion of Brunei Darussalam shall be the Muslim religion according to the Shafi'i sect of that religion: Provided that all other religions may be practiced in peace and harmony by the person professing them in any part of Brunei Darussalam.\\" However, the government imposes many restrictions on non-Shafi'i and non-Islamic religious practice. Since the early 1990s, the government has reinforced the legitimacy of the hereditary monarchy and the observance of traditional and Muslim values by asserting a national ideology known as the Melayu Islam Beraja (MIB), or Malay Islamic Monarchy, the genesis of which reportedly dates from the 15th century. MIB principles have been adopted as the basis for government, and all meetings and ceremonies commence with a Muslim prayer. At citizenship ceremonies non- Muslims must wear national dress, which includes Muslim head coverings for men and women. There is no legal requirement for women to wear head coverings in public, and government officials are portrayed regularly, if infrequently, in the media without head coverings. There is social pressure for women to wear head coverings in public.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Brunei: International Religious Freedom Report 2007. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. === Law enforcement === The government routinely censors magazine articles on other faiths, blacking out or removing photographs of crucifixes and other Christian religious symbols. Government officials also guard against the distribution and sale of items that feature photographs of undesirable or religious symbols. There have been reports that agents of the Internal Security Department monitored religious services at Christian churches and that senior church members believed that they were under intermittent surveillance. Religious authorities regularly participated in raids to confiscate alcoholic beverages and non-halal meats. They also monitored restaurants and supermarkets to ensure conformity with halal practice. Restaurants and service employees that served a Muslim in daylight hours during the fasting month were subjected to fines. Non-halal restaurants and non-halal sections in supermarkets were allowed to operate without interference from religious authorities. === Education === The Ministry of Education requires courses on Islam and the MIB in all public schools. Private schools are not required to teach Islam, but many make voluntary Ugama instruction available on an extracurricular, after-hours basis. Ugama is a six-year education system that teaches Islam under the Sunni Shafi'i school of thought. Most school textbooks were illustrated to depict Islam as the norm, and often all women and girls were shown wearing the Muslim head covering. There were no depictions of practices of other religions in textbooks. The Ministry prohibits the teaching of other religions and comparative religious studies. At one private school that offers Islam instruction during regular school hours, Christian students have been allowed to attend church during those periods when Muslim students receive instruction about Islam. === Marriage and conversions === Marriage between Muslims and those of other faiths is not permitted, and non-Muslims must convert to Islam if they wish to marry a Muslim. Muslims who wish to convert to another religion face such official and societal pressure not to leave Islam that conversion is extremely difficult if not impossible in practice. Permission from the Ministry of Religious Affairs must be obtained to convert from Islam. ==Cambodia== Article 43 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia reads: \\"Khmer citizens of either sex shall have the right to freedom of belief. Freedom of religious belief and worship shall be guaranteed by the State on the condition that such freedom does not affect other religious beliefs or violate public order and security. Buddhism shall be the State religion.\\"The Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia (archived from the original on 2011-07-22) ==China== The Constitution of the People's Republic of China provides for freedom of religious belief; however, the government restricts religious practice to government-sanctioned organizations and registered places of worship and controls the growth and scope of the activity of religious groups. The government of China currently recognizes five religious groups: the Buddhist Association of China, the Chinese Taoist Association, the Islamic Association of China, the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (a Protestant group), and the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. Members of the governing Communist Party are strongly discouraged from holding religious faith.Xinhua News Agency, 'CPC members shall not believe in religion: senior official', 19 Dec 2011. A significant number of non- sanctioned churches and temples exist, attended by locals and foreigners alike. Unregistered or underground churches are not officially banned, but are not permitted to openly conduct religious services. These bodies may face varying degrees of interference, harassment, and persecution by state and party organs. In some instances, unregistered religious believers and leaders have been charged with \\"illegal religious activities\\" or \\"disrupting social stability.\\" Religious believers have also been charged under article 300 of the criminal code, which forbids using heretical organizations to \\"undermine the implementation of the law.\\" === Falun Gong === Following a period of meteoric growth of Falun Gong in the 1990s, the Communist Party launched a campaign to \\"eradicate\\" Falun Gong on 20 July 1999. The suppression is characterised by multifaceted propaganda campaign, a program of enforced ideological conversion and re-education, and a variety of extralegal coercive measures such as arbitrary arrests, forced labor, and physical torture, sometimes resulting in death. An extra-constitutional body called the 6-10 Office was created to lead the suppression of Falun Gong.Congressional- Executive Commission on China (31 October 2008) ‚ÄòAnnual Report 2008‚Äô Retrieved 24 December 2013. The authorities mobilized the state media apparatus, judiciary, police, army, the education system, families and workplaces against the group. The campaign is driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspaper, radio and internet.Leung, Beatrice (2002) 'China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era', Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 761 ‚Äì 784 There are reports of systematic torture,(23 March 2000) The crackdown on Falun Gong and other so-called heretical organizations, Amnesty International illegal imprisonment, forced labor, organ harvestingDavid Kilgour, David Matas (6 July 2006, revised 31 January 2007) An Independent Investigation into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China (free in 22 languages) organharvestinvestigation.net and abusive psychiatric measures, with the apparent aim of forcing practitioners to recant their belief in Falun Gong.Mickey Spiegel (2002) \\"Dangerous Meditation: China's Campaign Against Falungong\\" Human Rights Watch === Tibetan Buddhism === Prior to Tibet's incorporation into China, Tibet was a theocracy with the Dalai Lama functioning as the head of government.Shakya, Tsering W. (1999), The Dragon in the Land of Snows: A History of Modern Tibet Since 1947, London: Pimlico Since incorporation into China, Dalai Lama have at times sanctioned Chinese control of the territory,https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA- RDP82-00457R009600210006-1.pdf while at other times they have been a focal point of political and spiritual opposition to the Chinese government.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA- RDP82R00025R000100060024-3.pdf As various high-ranking Lamas in the country have died, the Chinese government has proposed their own candidates for these positions, which has led at times to rival claimants to the same position. In an effort to further control Tibetan Buddhism and thus Tibet, the Chinese government passed a law in 2007 requiring a Reincarnation Application be completed and approved for all lamas wishing to reincarnate. === Treatment of Muslims === Ethnicity plays a large role in the Chinese government's attitude toward Muslim worship. Authorities in Xinjiang impose strict restrictions on Uyghur Muslims: mosques are monitored by the government, Ramadan observance is restricted, and the government has run campaigns to discourage men from growing beards which are associated with fundamentalist Islam.Congressional- Executive Commission on China, Annual Report 2011, Oct 2011. Individual Uyghur Muslims have been detained for practicing their religion. However, this persecution is largely due to the association of Islam with Uyghur separatism. Hui Muslims living in China do not face the same degree of persecution, and the government has at times been particularly lenient toward Hui practitioners. Although religious education for children is officially forbidden by law in China, the Communist party allows Hui Muslims to violate this law and have their children educated in religion and attend Mosques while the law is enforced on Uyghurs. After secondary education is completed, China then allows Hui students who are willing to embark on religious studies under an Imam.ALL√àS & CH√âRIF-CHEBBI & HALFON 2003, p. 14. China does not enforce the law against children attending Mosques on non-Uyghurs in areas outside of Xinjiang. === Support for traditional religions === Toward the end of the 20th century, China's government began to more openly encourage the practice of various traditional cults, particularly the state cults devoted to the Yellow Emperor and the Red Emperor. In the early 2000s, the Chinese government became open especially to traditional religions such as Mahayana Buddhism, Taoism and folk religion, emphasising the role of religion in building a \\"Harmonious Society\\" (hexie shehui), p. 239. a Confucian idea. p. 56. p. 14. Aligning with Chinese anthropologists' emphasis on \\"religious culture\\", the government considers these religions as integral expressions of national \\"Chinese culture\\" and part of China's intangible cultural heritage. p. 8. ==Cyprus== The Republic of Cyprus largely upholds and respects religious freedom within its territory. However, individual cases of religious discrimination against Muslims have occurred.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Cyprus: International Religious Freedom Report 2007. In 2016, a 19th- century mosque was attacked by arsonists, an action condemned by the government. In 2018, the Cyprus Humanist Association accused the Ministry of Education of promoting anti-atheist educational content on its government website. === Northern Cyprus === While freedom of religion is constitutionally protected in Turkish occupied Northern Cyprus, the government has at times restricted the practice of Greek Orthodox Churches. A controversial 2016 decision restricts most Orthodox churches to celebrate a single religious service per year. == East Timor == The constitution of East Timor establishes the freedom of religion, and specifies that there is no state religion and that religious entities are separate from the state. Nevertheless, the constitution commends the Catholic Church for its role in securing the country's independence, and a concordat with the Holy See grants the Catholic Church certain privileges. The government routinely provides funding to the Catholic Church, and other religious organizations may apply for funding.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Timor-Leste, US Department of State: Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Religious organizations are not required to register with the government, and can apply for tax-exemption status from the Ministry of Finance. Should an organization wish to run private schools or provide other community services, registration with the Ministry of Justice is required. Religious leaders have reported incidents where individual public servants have denied service to members of religious minorities, but do not consider this to be a systematic problem. The government has, however, routinely rejected birth and marriage certificates from religious organizations other than the Catholic Church. Civil certificates are the only option that religious minorities have for government recognition of marriages and births. Representatives of the Catholic, Protestant, and Muslim communities in East Timor maintain good relations with each other. ==India== The Indian constitution's preamble states that India is a secular state. Freedom of religion is a fundamental right guaranteed by the constitution. According to Article 25 of the Indian Constitution, every citizen of India has the right to \\"profess, practice and propagate religion\\", \\"subject to public order, morality and health\\" and also subject to other provisions under that article.The Constitution of India, With Short Notes, As Amended upto Constitution (52nd Amendment) Act, 1985; Central Law Agency, Allahabad 1986 Article 25 (2b) uses the term \\"Hindus\\" for all classes and sections of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs. Sikhs and Buddhists objected to this wording that makes many Hindu personal laws applicable to them. However, the same article also guarantees the right of members of the Sikh faith to bear a Kirpan.The Constitution of India, Right to Freedom of religion, Article 25  Religions require no registration. The government can ban a religious organisation if it disrupts communal harmony, has been involved in terrorism or sedition, or has violated the Foreign Contributions Act. The government limits the entry of any foreign religious institution or missionary and since the 1960s, no new foreign missionaries have been accepted though long term established ones may renew their visas. Many sections of the law prohibit hate speech and provide penalties for writings, illustrations, or speech that insult a particular community or religion. Some major religious holidays like Diwali (Hindu), Christmas (Christian), Eid (Muslim) and Guru Nanak's birth anniversary (Sikh) are considered national holidays. Private schools offering religious instruction are permitted while government schools are non-religious. The government has set up the Ministry of Minority Affairs, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) to investigate religious discrimination and to make recommendations for redressal to the local authorities. Though they do not have any power, local and central authorities generally follow them. These organisations have investigated numerous instances of religious tension including the implementation of \\"anti-conversion\\" bills in numerous states, the 2002 Gujarat violence against Muslims, The Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from the state (now a union territory since August 5, 2019) of Jammu and Kashmir in the 1990s and the 2008 attacks against Christians in Orissa. === Jammu and Kashmir === The Grand Ashura Procession In Kashmir where Shia Muslims mourn the death of Husayn ibn Ali has been banned by the Government of Jammu and Kashmir since the 1990s. People taking part in it are detained, and injured by Jammu and Kashmir Police every year. According to the government, this restriction was placed due to security reasons. Local religious authorities and separatist groups condemned this action and said it is a violation of their fundamental religious rights. ==Indonesia== The Indonesian Constitution states \\"every person shall be free to choose and to practice the religion of his/her choice\\" and \\"guarantees all persons the freedom of worship, each according to his/her own religion or belief\\". It also states that \\"the nation is based upon belief in one supreme God.\\" The first tenet of the country's national ideology, Pancasila, similarly declares belief in one God. Government employees are required to swear allegiance to the nation and to the Pancasila ideology. While there are no official laws against atheism, a lack of religious belief is contrary to the first tenet of Pancasila, and atheists have been charged and prosecuted for blasphemy. Other laws and policies at the national and regional levels restrict certain types of religious activity, particularly among unrecognized religious groups and \\"deviant\\" sects of recognized religious groups. The government officially only recognises six religions, namely Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism. ==Iran== The Iranian constitution was drafted during the Iranian Constitutional Revolution in 1906; While the constitution was modelled on Belgium's 1831 constitution, the provisions guaranteeing freedom of worship were omitted. Subsequent legislation provided some recognition to the religious minorities of Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians, in addition to majority Muslim population, as equal citizens under state law, but it did not guarantee freedom of religion and \\"gave unprecedented institutional powers to the clerical establishment.\\" The Islamic Republic of Iran, that was established after the Iranian revolution, recognizes four religions, whose status is formally protected: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Members of the first three groups receive special treatment under law, and five of the 270 seats in parliament are reserved for members of these religious groups. However, senior government posts including the presidency are reserved exclusively for followers of Shia Islam.Wright, Robin. The Last Great Revolution, (2000), p.210 Additionally, adherents of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, Iran's largest religious minority, are not recognized and are targeted for persecution. Bah√° º√≠s have been subjected to unwarranted arrests, false imprisonment, executions, confiscation and destruction of property owned by individuals and the Bah√° º√≠ community, denial of civil rights and liberties, and denial of access to higher education. Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, Iranian Bah√° º√≠s have regularly had their homes ransacked or been banned from attending university or holding government jobs, and several hundred have received prison sentences for their religious beliefs. Bah√° º√≠ cemeteries have been desecrated and property seized and occasionally demolished, including the House of M√≠rz√° Buzurg, Bah√°'u'll√°h's father. The House of the B√°b in Shiraz has been destroyed twice, and is one of three sites to which Bah√° º√≠s perform pilgrimage. ==Iraq== The government of Iraq is a constitutional democracy with a republican, federal, pluralistic governmental system consisting of 18 provinces or \\"governorates.\\". Although the Constitution recognizes Islam as the official religion and states that no law may be enacted that contradicts the established provisions of Islam, it also guarantees freedom of thought, conscience, and religious belief and practice. While the Government generally endorses these rights, political instability during the Iraq War and the 2014 --2017 Iraqi Civil War and the prevented effective governance in parts of the country not controlled by the Government, and the Government's ability to protect religious freedoms has been handicapped by insurgency, terrorism, and sectarian violence. Since 2003, when the government of Saddam Hussein fell, the Iraqi government has generally not engaged in state-sponsored persecution of any religious group, calling instead for tolerance and acceptance of all religious minorities. However, some government institutions have continued their long-standing discriminatory practices against the Bah√° º√≠ and Sunni Muslims. Beginning in 2017, an Iraqi insurgency by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (IS, formerly ISIL or ISIS) led to violations of religious freedom in certain parts of Iraq. IS is a Sunni jihadist group that claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring most of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control beginning with Iraq. The IS follows an extreme anti-Western interpretation of Islam, promotes religious violence and regards those who do not agree with its interpretations as infidels or apostates. Concurrently, IS aims to establish a Salafist-orientated Islamist state in Iraq, Syria and other parts of the Levant. ==Israel== Israel's Basic Law of Human Dignity and Liberty promises freedom and full social and political equality, regardless of political affiliation, while also describing the country as a \\"Jewish and democratic state\\". However, the Pew Research Center has identified Israel as one of the countries that places high restrictions on religion, and the U.S. State Department notes that while the government generally respects religious freedom in practice, governmental and legal discrimination against non-Jews non-Orthodox Jews exist, including arrests, detentions, and the preferential funding of Jewish schools and religious organizations over similar organizations serving other religious groups. On July 18, 2018, Israel adopted a law defining itself as \\"the homeland of the Jewish people in which the Jewish people fulfill their self-determination according to their cultural and historical legacy.\\" Various observers have objected that archaeological and construction practices funded by the Israeli government are used to bolster Jewish claims to the land while ignoring other sites of archaeological importance,\\"U.S. Department of State: 2012 Report on International Religious Freedom: Israel and The Occupied Territories (May 20, 2013)\\"United States Department of State some going as far as to claim that Israel systematically disrespected sites of Christian and Muslim cultural and historical importance. Several influential political parties within Israel's Knesset have explicitly religious character and politics (Shas, The Jewish Home, United Torah Judaism). Shas and United Torah Judaism represent different ethnic subgroups of the Haredi Jewish community in Israel. These parties seek to strengthen Jewish religious laws in the country and enforce more ultra-orthodox customs on the rest of the population, among other political platforms specific to their voterbase. Historically the state's treatment of Haredi Jewish communities has been an issue of political contention, and different Haredi communities are divided on their attitude toward the Israeli state itself. The Jewish Home represents the religious right-wing Israeli settler communities in the West Bank. While Israel's legal tradition is based on English Common Law, not Jewish Halakha, Halakha is applied in many civil matters, such as laws relating to marriage and divorce, and legal rulings concerning the Temple Mount. Israeli authorities have codified a number of religious laws in the country's political laws, including an official ban on commerce on Shabbat and a 1998 ban on the importation of nonkosher meat. === Law of Return === The Israeli Law of Return provides that any Jew, or the child or grandchild of a Jew, may immigrate to Israel with their spouse and children. Israel's process for determining the validity of a prospective immigrant's claim to Judaism has changed over time, and has been subject to various controversies. === Management of holy sites === Israel's 1967 Protection of Holy Sites Law protects the holy sites of all religious groups in the country. The government also provides for the maintenance and upkeep of holy sites, although The U.S. State Department has noted that Jewish sites receive considerably more funding than Muslim sites, and that the government additionally provides for the construction of new Jewish synagogues and cemeteries. ==== Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif and Al-Aqsa Mosque ==== The government of Israel has repeatedly upheld a policy of not allowing non-Muslims to pray at the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif since their annexation of East Jerusalem and the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif site in 1967. The government has ruled to allow access to the compound for individuals regardless of faith, but removes non-Muslims if they appear to be praying and sometimes restricts access for non-Muslims and young Muslim men, citing security concerns. Since 2000, the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf that manages the site and the Al-Aqsa Mosque has restricted non-Muslims from entering the Dome of the Rock shrine and Al-Aqsa, and prohibits wearing or displaying non-Muslim religious symbols. ==== Western Wall ==== The religious practices allowed at the Western Wall are established by the Rabbi of the Western Wall, appointed jointly by the Prime Minister of Israel and chief rabbis. Mixed-gender prayer is forbidden at the Western Wall, in deference to Orthodox Jewish practice. Women are not allowed to wear certain prayer shawls, and are not allowed to read aloud from the Torah at the Wall. ==Japan== Historically, Japan had a long tradition of mixed religious practice between Shinto and Buddhism since the introduction of Buddhism in the 7th century. Though the Emperor of Japan is supposed to be the direct descendant of Amaterasu ≈åmikami, the Shinto sun goddess, all Imperial family members, as well as almost all Japanese, were Buddhists who also practiced Shinto religious rites as well. Christianity flourished when it was first introduced by Francis Xavier, but was soon violently suppressed. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan tried to reform its state to resemble a European constitutional monarchy. The Emperor, Buddhism, and Shintoism were officially separated and Shintoism was set as the state religion. The Constitution specifically stated that Emperor is \\"holy and inviolable\\" (). During the period of Hirohito, the status of emperor was further elevated to be a living god (). This ceased at the end of World War II, when the current constitution was drafted. (See Ningen-sengen.) In 1946, during the Occupation of Japan, the United States drafted Article 20 of the constitution of Japan (still in use), which mandates a separation of religious organizations from the state, as well as ensuring religious freedom: \\"No religious organization shall receive any privileges from the State, nor exercise any political authority. No person shall be compelled to take part in any religious act, celebration, rite or practice. The State and its organs shall refrain from religious education or any other religious activity.\\" The New Komeito Party is a political party associated with the religion S≈çka Gakkai, a minor religion in Japan. ==Jordan== The Constitution of Jordan provides for the freedom to practice the rights of one's religion and faith in accordance with the customs that are observed in the kingdom, unless they violate public order or morality. The state religion is Islam. The Government prohibits conversion from Islam and proselytizing to Muslims. Members of unrecognized religious groups and converts from Islam face legal discrimination and bureaucratic difficulties in personal status cases. Converts from Islam additionally risk the loss of civil rights. Shari'a courts have the authority to prosecute proselytizers. Relations between Muslims and Christians generally are good; however, adherents of unrecognized religions and Muslims who convert to other faiths face societal discrimination. Prominent societal leaders have taken steps to promote religious freedom. ==Kazakhstan== Kazakhstan has a long tradition of secularism and tolerance. In particular, Muslim, Russian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Jewish leaders all reported high levels of acceptance in society. The Constitution of Kazakhstan provides for freedom of religion, and the various religious communities worship largely without government interference. However, local officials attempt on occasion to limit the practice of religion by some nontraditional groups, and higher-level officials or courts occasionally intervene to correct such attempts. , the law on religion continues to impose mandatory registration requirements on missionaries and religious organizations. Most religious groups, including those of minority and nontraditional denominations, reported that the religion laws did not materially affect religious activities. In 2007, the Hare Krishna movement, a registered group, suffered the demolition of 25 homes as part of the Karasai local government's campaign to seize title to its land based on alleged violations of property laws. ==North Korea== The North Korean constitution guarantees freedom of belief; however, the US Department of State International Religious Freedom Report for 2011 claims that \\"Genuine religious freedom does not exist.\\" While many Christians in North Korea fled to the South during the Korean War, and former North Korean president Kim Il-sung criticized religion in his writings, it is unclear the extent to which religious persecution was enacted, as narratives about persecution faced by Christians are complicated by evidence of pro-Communist Christian communities that may have existed since at least the 1960s, and that many Christian defectors from North Korea were also of a high socioeconomic class and thus would have had other reasons to oppose and face persecution from the government.. The Federation of Korean Christians and Korea Buddhist Federation are the official representatives of those faith groups in government, but it is unclear to what extent they are actually representative of religious practitioners in the country. ==South Korea== According to the US Department of State, , the constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respected this right in practice. In the Pew Research Center's Government Restrictions Index 2015 index the country was categorized as having moderate levels of government restrictions on the freedom of religion, up from previous categorizations of low levels of government restrictions. Since the 1980s and the 1990s there have been acts of hostility committed by Protestants against Buddhists and followers of traditional religions in South Korea. This include the arson of temples, the beheading of statues of Buddha and bodhisattvas, and red Christian crosses painted on either statues or other Buddhist and other religions' properties.Robert E. Buswell, Timothy S. Lee. Christianity in Korea. University of Hawaii Press, 2007. p. 375 Some of these acts have even been promoted by churches' pastors. In 2018, a mass protest broke out in support of freedom of religion and against the government's inaction on widespread programs of violent forced conversion carried out by Christian churches under the guide of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK), just after a woman named Ji-In Gu, one among approximately a thousand victims of the churches, was kidnapped and killed while being forced to convert. Before being killed, Ji-In Gu dedicated herself in exposing the conversion treatments, and for such reason she had become a target of the Christian churches. Ji was a member of the controversial Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, which is considered by most South Koreans to be a deceptive cult. == Kuwait == The constitution of Kuwait provides for religious freedom, although it also establishes Islam as the state religion. While there is generally societal tolerance for Abrahamic religions, the laws of Kuwait consistently favor Islam. Shia Muslims face some discrimination as a consequence of government policies.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Kuwait, US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. === Restrictions and safeguards === The law requires jail terms for journalists convicted of defaming any religion and prohibits denigration of Islam, Jewish, and Christian religious figures, including Muhammad and Jesus. The law prohibits publications that the government deems could create hatred, spread dissension among the public, or incite persons to commit crimes. The law prohibits non- Muslims from proselytizing. In accordance with the religious laws of Islam, it is illegal to import pork or alcohol, and public consumption of food is forbidden during Ramadan. The government exercised direct control of Sunni religious institutions. The government appointed Sunni imams, monitored their Friday sermons, and financed construction of Sunni mosques. In some instances, Sunni imams were suspended for delivering sermons whose content the government deemed inflammatory. The government did not exert this control over Shia mosques, which the Shia community, not the government, funded. === Education === The government has Islamic religion studies in public schools for all students. Non-Muslim students are not required to attend these classes. High school Islamic education textbooks are based largely on the Sunni interpretation of Islam. === Marriage and family law === Religious courts administer personal status law. Shia Muslims follow their own jurisprudence in matters of personal status and family law at the first instance and appellate levels. In 2003 the government approved a Shia request to establish a court of cassation to oversee Shia personal status issues, but as of 2017 the court has not yet been established due to the lack of Shia clergy in the country properly trained to officiate it. The law states that Muslim apostates lose certain legal rights, including the right to inherit property from Muslim relatives or spouses, but it does not specify any criminal penalty. The marriage of a Muslim man is annulled if he converts from Islam. A Muslim woman may have her marriage annulled if her Muslim husband converts to another religion. The law prohibits the naturalization of non-Muslims but allows male citizens of any religion to transmit citizenship to their descendants. The law forbids marriage between Muslim women and non-Muslim men, but Muslim men may marry women of other Abrahamic faiths. The law requires that children of such marriages be raised in their father's faith, and the father's religion governs the settlement of marital disputes. he government does not designate religion on passports or national identity documents, with the exception of birth certificates. On birth certificates issued to Muslims, the government does not differentiate between Sunnis and Shia. === Treatment of Shia Muslims === Shia worshipers gathered peacefully in public spaces to attend sermons and eulogies during Ashura and the government provided security to Shia neighborhoods. However, the government did not permit self-flagellation (public reenactments) of the martyrdom of Hussein. Even though the Shia make up an estimated 30 percent of the population, they remained underrepresented in all segments of government: six of 50 members in parliament, one of 16 cabinet members, one of six Amiri Diwan advisors, and disproportionately lower numbers of senior officers in the military and police force. Shia community leaders repeatedly complained about a glass ceiling in promotions and difficulties in getting jobs, as well as the lack of new places to worship, which they said created an oppressive environment for their community. === Treatment of followers non- Abrahamic religions === Members of non-Abrahamic faiths stated that they remained free to practice their religion in private, but faced harassment and potential prosecution if they practiced their faith in public. Expatriates of non-Abrahamic religions could not have public places of worship nor marry in Kuwait, and they remained subject to sharia if family matters were taken to court. Most members of these communities indicated they were able to practice their faith within their communities, but practiced a discreet form of self- censorship that allowed them to avoid conflict with authorities. ==Kyrgyzstan== The Constitution of Kyrgyzstan provides for the freedom of religion in Kyrgyzstan, and the government generally respects this right in practice. However, the Government restricts the activities of radical Islamic groups that it considered threats to stability and security and hampered or refused the registration of some Christian churches. The Constitution provides for the separation of religion and state, and it prohibits discrimination based on religion or religious beliefs. The Government does not officially support any religion; however, a May 6, 2006 decree recognized Islam (practiced by 88% of the population) and Russian Orthodoxy (practiced by 9.4% of the population) as traditional religious groups. The State Agency for Religious Affairs (SARA), formerly called the State Commission on Religious Affairs (SCRA), is responsible for promoting religious tolerance, protecting freedom of conscience, and overseeing laws on religion. All religious organizations, including schools, must apply for approval of registration from SARA. The Muftiate (or Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Kyrgyzstan-SAMK) is the highest Islamic managing body in the country. The Muftiate oversees all Islamic entities, including institutes and madrassahs, mosques, and Islamic organizations. Although most religious groups and sects operated with little interference from the Government or each other, there have been several cases of societal abuse based on religious beliefs and practices. Muslims who attempt to convert to other religions face heavy censure and persecution. In one case, a mob upset at a Baptist pastor's conversions of Muslims to Christianity publicly beat the pastor and burned his Bibles and religious literature. ==Laos== The Constitution of Laos provides for freedom of religion, some incidents of the persecution of Protestants have been reported. The Lao Front for National Construction (LFNC), a popular front organization for the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP), is responsible for the oversight of religious practice. The Prime Minister's Decree on Religious Practice (Decree 92) was the principal legal document defining rules for religious practice.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Laos: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 Local officialshave pressured minority Protestants to renounce their faith on threat of arrest or forceful eviction from their villages. Such cases occurred in Bolikhamsai, Houaphanh Province, and Luang Namtha provinces. Arrests and detentions of Protestants occurred in Luang Namtha, Oudomxay, Salavan, Savannakhet, and Vientiane provinces. Two Buddhist monks were arrested in Bolikhamsai Province for having been ordained without government authorization. In some areas, minority Protestants were forbidden from gathering to worship. In areas where Protestants were actively proselytizing, local officials sometimes subjected them to \\"reeducation.\\" Conflicts between ethnic groups and movement among villages sometimes exacerbated religious tensions. The efforts of some Protestant congregations to establish churches independent of the Lao Evangelical Church (LEC) continued to cause strains within the Protestant community. ==Lebanon== The Constitution of Lebanon provides for freedom of religion and the freedom to practice all religious rites provided that the public order is not disturbed. The Constitution declares equality of rights and duties for all citizens without discrimination or preference but establishes a balance of power among the major religious groups through a confessionalist system, largely codified by the National Pact. Family matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith. Calls for civil marriage are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities but civil marriages conducted in another country are recognized by Lebanese civil authorities. === National Pact === The National Pact is an agreement that specifies that specific government positions must go to members of specific religious groups, splitting power between the Maronite Christians, Greek Orthodox Christians, Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, and Druze, as well as stipulating some positions for the country's foreign policy. The first version of the pact, established in 1943, gave Christians a guaranteed majority in Parliament,Binder, Leonard. \\"Politics in Lebanon\\". New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc, 1966. reflecting the population of the country at the time, and specified that the highest office, the President of Lebanon, must be held by a Maronite Christian. Over the following decades, sectarian unrest would increase due to dissatisfaction with the greater power given to the Christian population and the refusal of the government to take another census that would provide the basis for a renegotiation of the National Pact eventually led to the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. The National Pact was renegotiated as part of the Taif Agreement to end the civil war, with the new conditions guaranteeing parliamentary parity between Muslim and Christian populations and reducing the power of the position of the Maronite President of Lebanon relative to the Sunni Prime Minister of Lebanon.Somasundram, Premarani (2 August 2006). \\"Lebanon: Return to the dark ages\\" (PDF). IDSS Commentaries. Archived from the original (PDF) on 21 February 2007. Retrieved 2 July 2012. ==Malaysia== The status of religious freedom in Malaysia is a controversial issue. Islam is the official state religion and the Constitution of Malaysia provides for limited freedom of religion, notably placing control upon proselytization of religions other than Islam to Muslims. Non-Muslims who wish to marry Muslims and have their marriage recognized by the government must convert to Islam.Marriage Procedures Between Muslim and Non-muslim , Malaysia Government Official Portal. Accessed 23 September 2007. However, questions including whether Malays can convert from Islam and whether Malaysia is an Islamic state or secular state remains unresolved. For the most part the multiple religions within Malaysia interact peacefully and exhibit mutual respect. This is evident by the continued peaceful co-existence of cultures and ethnic groups, although sporadic incidences of violence against Hindu temples, Muslim prayer halls, and Christian churches have occurred as recently as 2010. Restrictions on religious freedom are also in place for Muslims who belong to denominations of Islam other than Sunni Islam, such as Shia Muslims and Ahmaddiya Muslims. === Illegal words in Penang state === In 2010, a mufti in Penang decreed a fatwa that would forbid non-Muslims to use of 40 words related to Muslim religious practice. Under the Penang Islamic Religious Administration Enactment of 2004, a mufti in Penang state could propose fatwa that would be enforceable by law. The list included words such as \\"Allah\\", \\"Imam\\", \\"Sheikh\\", and \\"Fatwa\\", and purported to also make illegal the use of translations of these words into other languages. This decree caused uproar, particularly in the Sikh community, as Sikh religious texts use the term \\"Allah\\", with members of the community calling the law unconstitutional. The ban was overturned in 2014, as Penang lawmakers decreed that the Penang Islamic Religious Administration Enactment law only gave the Mufti permission to pass fatwas for the Muslim community, and that these bans were not enforceable on non-Muslim individuals. == Maldives == The constitution of Maldives designates Islam as the state religion, requires citizens of Maldives to be Muslim, and requires public office holders, including the president, to be followers of Sunni Islam. The constitution provides for limitations on rights and freedoms ‚Äúto protect and maintain the tenets of Islam.‚Äù Propagation of any religion other than Islam is a criminal offense. The law criminalizes speech breaking Islamic tenets, breaching social norms, or threatening national security. Antiterror legislation bans the promotion of ‚Äúunlawful‚Äù religious ideologies. The penal code permits the administration of certain Sharia punishments, such as stoning and amputation of hands, although such punishments are rarely used in sentencing.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Maldives, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs (MIA) maintains control over all matters pertaining to religion, and oversees the content of sermons given by imams at Friday services, as well as enforcing strict rules on who is allowed to legally preach within the country. The law prohibits importation of any items deemed contrary to Islam by the MIA, including religious literature, religious statues, alcohol, pork products, and pornographic materials. Foreigners visiting the country are not allowed to publicly display religious symbols for religions other than Islam. The constitution states education shall strive to ‚Äúinculcate obedience to Islam‚Äù and ‚Äúinstill love for Islam.‚Äù In accordance with the law, the MIA regulates Islamic instruction in schools, while the Ministry of Education funds salaries of religious instructors in schools. === Societal attitudes === Religiously motivated violent extremists target individuals whom they label as \\"secularists\\" for harassment and violence, up to and including murder. Non-governmental organizations have reported that the government encourages this activity, and that the extremists have targeted employees of human rights organizations. === Incidents === Following the killing of secular blogger Yameen Rasheed in 2017, the president Abdulla Yameen issued a statement that criticized \\"anti-Islamic\\" bloggers and condoned the killing, saying that \\"hate speech\\" could cause \\"certain elements\\" within society to \\"do anything to these people\\". The government of Maldives has issued court summons to expatriates for posting \\"anti-Islamic\\" content online. ==Mongolia== The Constitution of Mongolia provides for freedom of religion, and the Mongolian Government generally respects this right in practice; however, the law somewhat limits proselytism, and some religious groups have faced bureaucratic harassment or been denied registration. There have been few reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Mongolia: International Religious Freedom Report 2007. ==Myanmar (Burma)== Every year since 1999 the U.S. State Department has designated Myanmar as a country of particular concern with regard to religious freedom. Muslims, and particularly Muslims of the Rohingya ethnic group, face discrimination at the hands of the Buddhist majority, often with governmental indifference or even active encouragement. === Genocide of Rohingya Muslims === The Rohingya people have been denied Burmese citizenship since the Burmese nationality law (1982 Citizenship Act) was enacted. The Government of Myanmar claims that the Rohingya are illegal immigrants who arrived during the British colonial era, and were originally Bengalis., Human Rights Watch Report on Malaysia (2000). The Rohingya that are allowed to stay in Myanmar are considered 'resident foreigners' and not citizens. They are not allowed to travel without official permission and were previously required to sign a commitment not to have more than two children, though the law was not strictly enforced. Many Rohingya children cannot have their birth registered, thus rendering them stateless from the moment they are born. In 1995, the Government of Myanmar responded to UNHCR's pressure by issuing basic identification cards, which does not mention the bearer's place of birth, to the Rohingya. , Chris Lewa North Arakan: An Open Prison for the Rohingya in Burma FMR 32 at [11]. Without proper identification and documents, the Rohingya people are officially stateless with no state protection and their movements are severely restricted. As a result, they are forced to live in squatter camps and slums. Starting in late 2016, the Myanmar military forces and extremist Buddhists began a major crackdown on the Rohingya Muslims in the country's western region of Rakhine State. The crackdown was in response to attacks on border police camps by unidentified insurgents, and has resulted in wide-scale human rights violations at the hands of security forces, including extrajudicial killings, gang rapes, arsons, and other brutalities. Since 2016, the military and the local Buddhists have killed at least 10,000 Rohingya people, burned down and destroyed 354 Rohingya villages in Rakhine state, and looted many Rohingya houses. The United Nations has described the persecution as \\"a textbook example of ethnic cleansing\\". In late September 2017, a seven-member panel of the Permanent Peoples' Tribunal found the Myanmar military and the Myanmar authority guilty of the crime of genocide against the Rohingya and the Kachin minority groups. The Myanmar leader and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi was criticized for her silence over the issue and for supporting the military actions.Ramzy, Austin, \\"270,000 Rohingya Have Fled Myanmar, U.N. Says\\", September 8, 2017, New York Times retrieved September 9, 2017 Subsequently, in November 2017, the governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar signed a deal to facilitate the return of Rohingya refugees to their native Rakhine state within two months, drawing a mixed response from international onlookers. According to the United Nations reports, as of January 2018, nearly 690,000 Rohingya people had fled or had been driven out of Rakhine state who then took shelter in the neighboring Bangladesh as refugees. ==Nepal== Nepal has been a secular state since the end of the Nepalese Civil War in 2006, and the Constitution of Nepal adopted in 2015 guarantees religious freedom to all people in Nepal.Constitution of Nepal Article 3 Section 26 The Constitution also defines Nepal as a secular state that is neutral toward the religions present in the country.Constitution of Nepal, Article 4 Section 1 The Constitution also bans actions taken to convert people from one religion to another, as well as acts that disturb the religion of other people. There have been sporadic incidents of violence against the country's Christian minority. In 2009 and 2015, Christian churches were bombed by anti-government Hindu nationalist groups such as the Nepal Defence Army.U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom 2017, p.2. == Oman == The Basic Law of Oman declares that Islam is the state religion, that Shari'a is the source of legislation, and that the Sultan of Oman must be a Muslim. It also prohibits discrimination based on religion and provides for the freedom to practice religious rites as long as doing so does not disrupt public order. The government generally respects this right, but within defined parameters that placed limitations on the right in practice.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Oman, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. === Government practices === Religious gatherings in locations other than government-approved houses of worship are forbidden, although this is not enforced in practice. Religious organizations seeking to import religious texts must request approval from the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs (MERA). Omani law prohibits the defamation of any religion. Public proselytization is also forbidden. The MERA monitors sermons to ensure that their content is politically acceptable to the government. Civil courts adjudicate cases according to the nonsectarian civil code. The law states Shia Muslims may resolve family and personal status cases according to Shia jurisprudence outside the courts, and retain the right to transfer their cases to civil courts if they cannot find a resolution within the Shia religious tradition. The law allows non-Muslims to seek adjudication of matters pertaining to family or personal status under the religious laws of their faith or under civil law. Citizens may sue the government for violations of their right to practice religious rites that do not disrupt public order; there are no known cases of anyone pursuing this course in court. === Education === Islamic studies are mandatory for Muslim students in public schools from kindergarten through 12th grade. Non-Muslim students are exempt from this requirement if they notify school administrators they do not wish to attend such instruction. The classes take a historical perspective in comparing the evolution of Islamic religious thinking, and teachers are prohibited from proselytizing or favoring one Islamic group over another. Many private schools provide alternative religious studies courses. === Societal attitudes === Conversion from Islam was reportedly viewed extremely negatively within the Muslim community. In 2017, the Anti-Defamation League and Simon Wiesenthal Center reported separate occasions of an antisemitic cartoon and article published in the Alwatan newspaper. ==Pakistan== Pakistan's penal code includes provisions that forbid blasphemy against any religion recognized by the government of Pakistan.Pakistan Penal Code, Chapter XV Punishments are more severe for blasphemy against Islam: while acts insulting others' religion can carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a fine, desecration of the Quran can carry a life sentence and insulting or otherwise defiling the name of Muhammad can carry a death sentence.Pakistan Penal Code, Section 295B-295C The death sentence for blasphemy has never been implemented, however, 51 people charged under the blasphemy laws have been murdered by vigilantes before their trials could be completed. The Pakistan government does not formally ban the public practice of the Ahmadi Muslim sect, but its practice is restricted severely by law. A 1974 constitutional amendment declared Ahmadis to be a non-Muslim minority because, according to the Government, they do not accept Muhammad as the last prophet of Islam. However, Ahmadis consider themselves to be Muslims and observe Islamic practices. In 1984, under Ordinance XX the government added Section 298(c) into the Penal Code, prohibiting Ahmadis from calling themselves Muslim or posing as Muslims; from referring to their faith as Islam; from preaching or propagating their faith; from inviting others to accept the Ahmadi faith; and from insulting the religious feelings of Muslims.Trespasses of the State, Ministering to Theological Dilemmas through the Copyright/Trademark, Naveeda Khan, Sarai Reader, 2005; Bare Acts. Page 178 == Palestinian territories == === The West Bank === In the West Bank, Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PA) enforce varying aspects of religious freedom. The laws of both Israel and the Palestinian National Authority protect religious freedom, and generally enforce these protections in practice. The PA enforces the Palestinian Basic Law, which provides for the freedom of religion, belief, and practice within the territories it administers. It also holds that Islam is the official religion of the Palestinian Territories, and that legislation should be based on interpretations of Islamic Law. Six seats in the 132-member Palestinian Legislative Council are reserved for Christians, while no other religious guarantees or restrictions are enforced. The PA recognizes a Friday-Saturday weekend, but allows Christians to work on Saturday in exchange for a day off on Sunday. Heightened tensions exist between Jewish and non-Jewish residents of this territory, although relations between other religious groups are relatively cordial. Map showing Palestinian territories and part of Israel. The Palestinian Authority provides funding for Muslim and Christian holy sites in the West Bank and has been noted to give preferential treatment to Muslim sites, while the Israeli Government funds Jewish sites. Matters of inheritance, marriage, and dowry are handled by religious courts of the appropriate religion for the people in question, with members of faiths unrecognized by the PA are often advised to go abroad to resolve their affairs. Religious education is mandatory for grades 1 through 6 in schools funded by the PA, with separate courses available for Muslims and Christians. While it is not strictly a religious ban, Israeli policies restricting the freedom of movement of Palestinians throughout the West Bank and between the West Bank and Israel restrict the ability for Palestinians to visit certain religious sites, such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Nativity. These restrictions are sometimes relaxed for portions of the population on specific holidays. Christian groups have complained that an extended visa application process for the West Bank has impeded their ability to operate there. Jews are routinely provided access to specific holy sites in territories under the control of the PA, and holy sites that are significant to both Jews and Muslims, such as the Cave of the Patriarchs, enforce restricted access to either group on different days, with Jews often facing less restricted access and lighter security screening. ==== Gaza Strip ==== Despite nominally being a part of the territory administered by the Palestinian National Authority, the Gaza Strip has been de facto controlled by Hamas since the 2006 Palestinian civil skirmishes. Religious freedom in Gaza is curtailed by Hamas, which imposes a stricter interpretation of Islamic law and at times has broadcast explicitly anti-Jewish propaganda. Due to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, Muslim residents of Gaza are not allowed by the Israeli government to visit holy sites in Israel or the West Bank, and Christian clergy from outside Gaza are not allowed access to the region. However, some Christian residents of Gaza have been issued permits by Israel to enter Israel and the West Bank during Christmas to visit family and holy sites. Hamas largely tolerates the Christian population of the Gaza Strip and does not force Christians to follow Islamic law. However, Christians at times face harassment, and there are concerns that Hamas does not sufficiently protect them from religiously motivated violence perpetrated by other groups in the Gaza Strip. ==Philippines== The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines mandates a separation of church and state,Constitution of the Philippines, Article II Section 6 significantly limiting the Catholic Church's influence in the country's politics. The Moro people are a Muslim ethnoreligious minority in the Philippines that have historically fought insurgencies against the government of the Philippines (as well as against previous occupying powers, such as Spain, the United States, and Japan).http://www.opendemocracy.net/madrid11/philippines_130707 They have faced discrimination from the country's Christian majority in the 21st century. == Qatar == In Qatar, the constitution, as well as certain laws, provide for freedom of association, public assembly, and worship in accordance with the requirements of public order and morality. Notwithstanding this, the law prohibits proselytizing by non-Muslims and places some restrictions on public worship. Islam is the state religion.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Qatar: International Religious Freedom Report 2007. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. === Legal system and restrictions === Both Muslims and non-Muslims are tried under the unified court system, incorporating both secular law and Shari'a (Islamic law). Convicted Muslims may earn a sentence reduction of a few months by memorizing the Qur'an. Litigants in civil cases may request the Shari'a courts to assume jurisdiction. The law provides for a prison sentence of up to seven years for defaming, desecrating, or committing blasphemy against Islam, Christianity, or Judaism.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Qatar, US Department of State, Bureau of Human Rights, Democracy, and Labor. Religious groups are required to register with the government. Unregistered religious groups that engage in worship activities are illegal, and members of those groups are subject to deportation. However, this is rarely enforced, and non-registered religious groups have been able to worship in private without disruption. Converting to another religion from Islam is considered apostasy and is technically a capital offense; however, since the country gained independence in 1971, there has been no recorded execution or other punishment for such an act. The government regulates the publication, importation, and distribution of all religious books and materials. However, in practice, individuals and religious institutions are not prevented from importing holy books and other religious items for personal or congregational use. Non-Muslim religious symbols are not allowed to be displayed in public, but representatives of minority religious communities in Qatar reported that they were allowed to wear traditional religious garments. The government discouraged Qatari citizens and residents from taking part in the Umra or annual Hajj due to the severing of relations between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. === Education === Islamic instruction is compulsory for all students in state- sponsored schools. While there were no restrictions on non-Muslims providing private religious instruction for children, most foreign children attended secular private schools. Muslim children were allowed to go to secular and coeducational private schools. === Societal attitudes === Media based in the country periodically published antisemitic material, usually in the form of cartoons. ==Saudi Arabia== The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an Islamic theocratic absolute monarchy in which Islam is the official religion. Religious status (defined as \\"Muslim\\" or \\"Non-Muslim\\") is identified on government-issued identity cards, and non-Muslims face many restrictions, including bans on non-Muslim religious texts and the dismissal of their testimony in court. Officially, the government supports the rights of non- Muslims to practice their faith in private, but non-Muslim organizations claim that there is no clear definition of what constitutes public or private, and that this leaves them at risk for punishment, which can include lashes and deportation. The government of Saudi Arabia does not allow non-Muslim clergy to enter the country for the purpose of conducting services, which further restricts practice. Members of the Shi‚Äôa minority are the subjects of officially sanctioned political and economic discrimination, although the faith is not entirely banned. Shi'a Muslims are barred from employment in the government, military, and oil industries. Ahmadiyya Muslims are officially barred from the country, although many Saudi residents and citizens practice the religion privately. It is illegal for Muslims to convert or renounce their religion, which is nominally punishable by death. Death sentences have been mandated as recently as 2015, although the most recent execution performed in Saudi Arabia solely for apostasy charges was conducted in 1994. In 2014, the government of Saudi Arabia passed new regulations against terrorism that defined \\"calling for atheist thought in any form, or calling into question the fundamentals of the Islamic religion on which [Saudi Arabia] is based\\" as a form of terrorism. The Saudi Mutaween (Arabic: ŸÖÿ∑ŸàÿπŸäŸÜ), or Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (i.e., the religious police) enforces an interpretation of Muslim religious law in public, employing both armed and unarmed officers. Islamic religious education is mandatory in public schools at all levels. All public school children receive religious instruction that conforms with the official version of Islam. Non-Muslim students in private schools are not required to study Islam. Private religious schools are permitted for non-Muslims or for Muslims adhering to unofficial interpretations of Islam. ==Singapore== The constitution provides for freedom of religion; however, other laws and policies restricted this right in some circumstances.\\"2010 International Religious Freedom Report 2010: Singapore\\", U. S. State Department, 17 November 2010, As Retrieved 15 January 2011 In 1972 the Singapore government de-registered and banned the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses in Singapore on the grounds that its members refuse to perform military service (which is obligatory for all male citizens), salute the flag, or swear oaths of allegiance to the state.\\"Singapore\\", International Religious Freedom Report 2004, U. S. Department of State, As Retrieved 11 March 2010 Singapore has banned all written materials published by the International Bible Students Association and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, both publishing arms of the Jehovah's Witnesses. A person who possesses a prohibited publication can be fined up to $1500 (Singapore Dollars $2,000) and jailed up to 12 months for a first conviction. ==Sri Lanka== The Constitution of Sri Lanka provides for the freedom of practice of all religions, while reserving a higher status for Buddhism. At times, local police and government officials appeared to be acting in concert with Buddhist nationalist organizations. In addition, in NGOs have alleged that government officials provided assistance, or at least tacitly supported the actions of societal groups targeting religious minorities. Matters related to family law, e.g., divorce, child custody and inheritance are adjudicated under customary law of the applicable ethnic or religious group. For example, the minimum age of marriage for women is 18 years, except in the case of Muslims, who continued to follow their customary religious practices of girls attaining marrying age with the onset of puberty and men when they are financially capable of supporting a family. During the Sri Lankan Civil War, conflict between Tamil separatists and the government of Sri Lanka at times resulted in violence against temples and other religious targets. However, the primary causes of the conflict were not religious. ==Syria== The constitution of the Syrian Arab Republic guarantees freedom of religion. Syria has had two constitutions: one passed in 1973, and one in 2012 through a referendum. Opposition groups rejected the referendum; claiming that the vote was rigged. Political instability caused by the Syrian Civil War has deepened religious sectarianism within the country, as well as creating regions in the country where the official government does not have the ability to enforce its laws. Syria has come under international condemnation over their alleged \\"anti-Semitic\\" state media, and for alleged \\"sectarianism towards Sunni Muslims\\". This is a claim that Damascus denies. While secular, Syria does mandate that all students go through religious education of the religion that their parents are/were. The government enforces several measures against what it considers to be Islamic fundamentalism. The Muslim Brotherhood, a political Sunni Muslim organization, is banned in Syria, alongside other Muslim sects that the government considers to be Salafi or Islamist. Those accused of membership in any such organization can be sentenced to long prison terms. In 2016, the Syrian government banned the use of the niqab in universities. Jehovah's Witnesses in Syria face persecution, as the government banned their religion in 1964 for being a \\"Zionist organization\\". Military situation as of August 2018. Territory in red is controlled by the Syrian Arab Republic, territory in green is controlled by the Syrian opposition (including the Free Syrian Army), territory in yellow is controlled by the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, territory in gray is controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and territory in white is controlled by Tahrir al-Sham. For a more detailed, up-to-date, and interactive map, see Template:Syrian Civil War detailed map === Democratic Federation of Northern Syria === The charter of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria (also known as Rojava) guarantees the freedom of religion to people living within its territory. The government of this region employs various measures to ensure the representation of various ethnic and religious groups in the government, using a system that has been compared to Lebanon's confessionalist system.Andrea Glioti, Rojava: A libertarian myth under scrutiny, Al-Jazeera (6 August 2016). However, there have been numerous claims made by refugees that YPG units affiliated with the Democratic Federation have forcibly displaced Sunni Arabs from their homes, in addition to destroying businesses and crops. These claims have been denied by Syrian Kurdish authorities. === Free Syrian Army === Battalions affiliated with the Free Syrian Army have been accused of taking hostages and murdering members of religious minorities in territory held by their soldiers. === Jihadist groups === Jihadist groups, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and Jabhat Al-Nusra have enforced very strict interpretations of Sunni religious law in their territory, executing civilians for blasphemy, adultery, and other charges. Watchdog organizations have documented extensive persecution of Yazidi people, particularly women, who have been routinely forced into sexual slavery by the Islamic State in what Human Rights Watch described as an \\"organized system of rape and sexual assault\\". ==Taiwan (Republic of China)== Article 13 of the Constitution of the Republic of China provides that the people shall have freedom of religious belief.Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan), Chapter II - Rights and Duties of the People ==Tajikistan== Freedom of religion in Tajikistan is provided for in Tajikistan's constitution. The Tajikistan government, enforces a policy of active secularism. Tajikistan is unique for barring minors from attending public religious ceremonies, with the exception of funerals (where they must be accompanied by an adult guardian). Minors are allowed to practice religion in private. Hanafi mosques bar women from attending services, a policy decreed by a religious council with support from the government. Tajikistan's policies reflect a concern about Islamic extremism, a concern shared by much of the general population. The government actively monitors the activities of religious institutions to keep them from becoming overtly political. A Tajikistan Ministry of Education policy prohibited girls from wearing the hijab at public schools. == Thailand == The constitution of Thailand prohibits discrimination based on religious belief and protects religious liberty, but also stipulates that the government should promote Theravada Buddhism and that the King of Thailand is required to be Buddhist. There is an ongoing insurgency in the southern part of the country, which is motivated by ethnic and religious separatism by Malay Muslims.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Thailand, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. === Legal framework === The law officially recognizes five religious groups: Buddhism, Islam, Brahman Hinduism, Sikhism, and Christianity, and does not confer recognition to any new groups outside of these umbrella categories. Unregistered groups are allowed to practice their religion without disruption, but are not eligible for tax-exemption status and other benefits of registration. Laws prohibit the defamation of Buddhism or Buddhist clergy, punishable by fines. The Central Islamic Council of Thailand, whose members are Muslims appointed by royal proclamation, advises the Ministries of Education and Interior on Islamic issues. The government provides funding for Islamic educational institutions, the construction of mosques, and participation in the Hajj. The chularatchamontri (grand mufti) is appointed by the king. The Ministry of Justice allows the practice of sharia as a special legal process, outside of the national civil code, for Muslim residents of the South for family law, including inheritance. Provincial courts apply this law and a sharia expert advises the judge. The constitution prohibits Buddhist clergy from voting in elections or running for seats in the House of Representatives or Senate. Christian clergy are prohibited from voting in elections if they are in formal religious dress. Except for the chularatchamontri himself, imams are not regarded as priests or clergy and are thus allowed to vote in elections and assume political positions. Female Buddhist monks are not recognized by the government, and thus do not receive any of the privileges associated with monk status in the country. === Education === Religious education is required for all students at both the primary and secondary levels; students may not opt out. The curriculum must contain information about all of the five recognized umbrella religious groups in the country. Students who wish to pursue in-depth studies of a particular religion may study at private religious schools and can transfer credits to public schools. Individual schools, working in conjunction with their local administrative boards, are authorized to arrange additional religious studies courses. === Insurgency === Because of the close ties between ethnicity and religion in Thailand, violence that is part of the ongoing insurgency in South Thailand is difficult to classify as being purely motivated by religious identity. In 2017, there were at least 263 deaths reported connected to insurgent violence, and no reports of anyone being specifically targeted due to their religion. Some Buddhist monks regarded as part of the Buddhist ‚Äúnationalist‚Äù movement used social media to call for violence against Muslims. In 2017, Apichat Punnajanatho, a Buddhist monk, was arrested by the government for making anti-Islamic that encouraged violence, and was expelled from the monkhood. There were no reports of Muslims calling for violence against Buddhists in Thailand in 2017. In prior years, insurgents would target some school teachers and Buddhist monks, whom they viewed as agents of the Thai government. As of 2017, this practice appears to have been discontinued. The primary rhetoric of the insurgency portrays the insurgency as opposition to \\"Siamese colonizers\\". === Other incidents === According to human rights groups, a majority of the country's relatively small urban refugee and asylum seeker population are fleeing religious persecution elsewhere. Many of them, both those registered by the United Nations and others who were not, face prolonged detention in crowded immigration detention centers, some for years. Authorities reportedly arrest and detain some UN-designated refugees, some of whom claimed they faced religious persecution in their home countries. Those without asylum-seeking status face eventual deportation. In October 2017, The Sangha Supreme Council issued an order prohibiting monks from using social media to criticize the kingdom, Buddhism, or the monarchy, or otherwise behaving in a manner inappropriate to their religious status. ==Turkey== The Constitution of Turkey establishes the country as a secular state and provides for freedom of belief and worship and the private dissemination of religious ideas. However, other constitutional provisions for the integrity of the secular state restrict these rights. The constitution prohibits discrimination on religious grounds.Turkey: International Religious Freedom Report 2009, United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, released on 26 October 2009, accessed on 10 November 2009 Article 219 of the penal code prohibits imams, priests, rabbis and other religious leaders from \\"reproaching or vilifying\\" the government or the laws of the state while performing their duties, punishable by several months in prison. Religious affiliation is listed on national identity cards, despite Article 24 of the 1982 constitution which forbids the compulsory disclosure of religious affiliation. Members of some religious groups, such as the Bah√° º√≠, are unable to state their religious affiliation on their cards because it is not included among the option, and thus must report their religion as \\"unknown\\" or \\"other\\". === Treatment of Muslims === The Turkish government oversees Muslim religious facilities and education through its Directorate of Religious Affairs, under the authority of the Prime Minister. The directorate regulates the operation of the country's 77,777 registered mosques and employs local and provincial imams (who are civil servants). Sunni imams are appointed and paid by the state. Historically, Turkey's Alevi Muslim minority has been discriminated against within the country. However, since the 2000s, various measures granting Alevis more equal recognition as a religious group have been passed at the local and national levels of government.Turkey 2009 Progress Report by the European Commission for Enlargement, dated 14 October; accessed on 10 November 2009 Other Muslim minorities, such as Shia Muslims, largely do not face government interference in their religious practice, but also receive no support from the state. Since the 2000s Turkish Armed Forces have dismissed several members for alleged Islamic fundamentalism.Turkey: International Religious Freedom Report 2007. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. === Treatment of other religious groups === In the 1970s, the Turkish High Court of Appeals issued a ruling allowing for the expropriation of properties acquired after 1936 from religious minorities. Later rulings in the 2000s have restored some of this property, and generally allow minorities to acquire new properties. However, the government has continued to apply an article allowing it to expropriate properties in areas where the local non-Muslim population drops significantly or where the foundation is deemed to no longer perform the function for which it was created. There is no specific minimum threshold for such a population drop, which is left to the discretion of the GDF. This is problematic for small populations (such as the Greek Orthodox community), since they maintain more properties than the local community needs; many are historic or significant to the Orthodox world. Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox and Jewish religious groups may operate schools under the supervision of the Education Ministry. The curricula of the schools include information unique to the cultures of the groups. The Ministry reportedly verifies if the child's father or mother is from that minority community before the child may enroll. Other non-Muslim minorities do not have schools of their own. Churches operating in Turkey generally face administrative challenges to employ foreign church personnel, apart from the Catholic Church and congregations linked to the diplomatic community. These administrative challenges, restrictions on training religious leaders and difficulty obtaining visas have led to a decrease in the Christian communities. Jehovah's Witnesses have faced imprisonment and harassment, largely connected to their religiously grounded conscientious objection to obligatory military service. ==Turkmenistan== The Constitution of Turkmenistan provides for freedom of religion and does not establish a state religion. However, the Government imposes legal restrictions on all forms of religious expression. All religious groups must register in order to gain legal status; unregistered religious activity is illegal and may be punished by administrative fines. While the 2003 law on religion and subsequent 2004 amendments had effectively restricted registration to only the two largest groups, Sunni Muslim and Russian Orthodox, and criminalized unregistered religious activity, presidential decrees issued in 2004 dramatically reduced the numerical thresholds for registration and abolished criminal penalties for unregistered religious activity; civil penalties remain. As a result, nine minority religious groups were able to register, and the Turkmenistan government has permitted some other groups to meet quietly with reduced scrutiny. Ethnic Turkmen identity is linked to Islam. Ethnic Turkmen who choose to convert to other religious groups, especially the lesser-known Protestant groups, are viewed with suspicion and sometimes ostracized, but Turkmenistan society historically has been tolerant and inclusive of different religious beliefs. == United Arab Emirates == The constitution of the United Arab Emirates establishes Islam as the state religion. While it establishes the freedom of worship (so long as it does not interfere with public policy or morals), there are laws against blasphemy, and against proselytizing by non-Muslims. === Legal framework === According to the constitution, sharia is the principal source of legislation, although the judicial system applies two types of law, depending on the case. Sharia forms the basis for judicial decisions in most family law matters for Muslims, such as marriage and divorce, and inheritance for both Muslims and non-Muslims; however, in the case of noncitizens, the parties may petition the court to have the laws of their home country apply, rather than sharia. Sharia also applies in some criminal matters. Civil law provides the basis for decisions on all other matters. Shia Muslims in Dubai may pursue Shia family law cases through a special Shia council rather than through the regular judicial system. When sharia courts try non-Muslims for criminal offenses, judges have the discretion to impose civil or sharia penalties. Higher courts may overturn or modify sharia penalties. Authorities conduct arrests under blasphemy and antidiscrimination laws that criminalize insulting religions. The Awqaf provides weekly guidance for the content of sermons in Sunni mosques, and the government regulates and actively monitors the issuance of all fatwas at both the national and emirate levels. Shia mosques continued to receive guidance from the Awqaf but were considered private and managed primarily by the Jaafari Affairs Council, located in Dubai. The government continued to allow private worship of other religious groups and granted permission to build houses of worship on a case-by-case basis. ==== General restrictions ==== The law prohibits blasphemy, defined as any act insulting God, religions, prophets, messengers, holy books, or houses of worship. Offenders are subject to imprisonment for five or more years and fines from 250,000 AED ($68,000) to two million AED ($545,000); noncitizens may be deported. The law prohibits black magic, sorcery, and incantations, which are punishable by a prison term ranging from six months to three years, and deportation for noncitizens. The law does not directly prohibit Muslims from converting to other religions; however, the penal code defers to sharia on matters defined as crimes in Islamic doctrine, which in many interpretations prohibits apostasy. The law requires Muslims and non-Muslims to refrain from eating, drinking, and smoking in public during fasting hours during the month of Ramadan. The law prohibits the distribution of religious literature the government determines is contradictory to Islam, as well as literature it deems blasphemous or offensive towards religions. ==== Restrictions on minority religions ==== The law prohibits churches from erecting bell towers or displaying crosses or other religious symbols on the outside of their premises, although they may place signs on their properties indicating they are churches. The law also restricts land ownership to citizens, or companies majority-owned by citizens. This effectively prevents most minority religious communities (which consist of noncitizens) from purchasing property to build houses of worship. Under the law, Muslim men may marry non-Muslim women who are ‚Äúpeople of the book‚Äù (Christian or Jewish). Muslim women may not marry non-Muslim men. Non-Muslim men and Muslim women who marry are subject to arrest, trial, and imprisonment on grounds of engaging in extramarital sex, which carries a minimum sentence of one year in jail, as the marriage is considered invalid. In the event of a divorce between a Muslim father and non-Muslim mother, the law grants child custody to the Muslim father. Non-Muslim wives of citizens are also ineligible for naturalization. === Education === Islamic studies are mandatory for all students in public schools and for Muslim students in private schools. The government does not provide instruction in any religion other than Islam in public schools. In private schools, non-Muslim students are not required to attend Islamic study classes. All students, however, are required to take national social studies classes, which include some teaching on Islam. A small number of Christian-affiliated schools are authorized to provide instruction tailored to the religious background of the student. === Societal attitudes === According to non-Muslim religious groups, there was a high degree of tolerance within society for minority religious beliefs and traditions, although societal attitudes and behavior discouraged conversion from Islam. Conversion to Islam was encouraged, however. Anti-Semitic materials are frequently available for purchase at book fairs. There were continued instances of anti-Semitic remarks on social media sites. ==Uzbekistan== The Constitution of Uzbekistan provides for freedom of religion and for the principle of separation of church and state. However, the government restricts these rights in practice. The government permits the operation of what it considers mainstream religious groups, including approved Muslim groups, Jewish groups, the Russian Orthodox Church, and various other Christian denominations, such as Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Baptists. Uzbek society generally tolerates Christian churches as long as they do not attempt to win converts among ethnic Uzbeks. The law prohibits or severely restricts activities such as proselytizing, importing and disseminating religious literature, and offering private religious instruction.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Uzbekistan: International Religious Freedom Report 2007. A number of minority religious groups, including congregations of some Christian denominations, operate without registration because they have not satisfied the strict requirements set by the law. As in previous periods, Protestant groups with ethnic Uzbek members reported operating in a climate of harassment and fear. The government has been known to arrest and sentence Protestant pastors, and to otherwise raid and harass some unregistered groups, detaining and fining their leaders and members. The government works against unauthorized Islamic groups suspected of extremist sentiments or activities, arresting numerous alleged members of these groups and sentencing them to lengthy jail terms. Many of these were suspected members of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a banned extremist Islamic political movement, the banned Islamic group Akromiya (Akromiylar), or unspecified Wahhabi groups. The government generally does not interfere with worshippers attending sanctioned mosques and granted approvals for new Islamic print, audio, and video materials. A small number of \\"underground\\" mosques operated under the close scrutiny of religious authorities and the security service. Religious groups enjoyed generally tolerant relations; however, neighbors, family, and employers often continued to pressure ethnic Uzbek Christians, especially recent converts and residents of smaller communities. There were several reports of sermons against missionaries and persons who converted from Islam. ==Vietnam== The constitution formally allows religious freedom. (See Article 70) Every citizen is declared to be allowed to freely follow no, one, or more religions, practice his or her religion without violating the law, be treated equally regardless of his or her religion, be protected from being violated his or her religious freedom, but is prohibited to use religion to violate the law. All religious groups and most clergy must join a party controlled supervisory body, religions must obtain permission to build or repair houses of worship, run schools, engage in charity or ordain or transfer clergy, and some clergy remain in prison or under serious state repression. == Yemen == here.) The constitution declares Islam the state religion and sharia the source of all legislation in Yemen. It provides for freedom of thought and expression ‚Äúwithin the limits of the law,‚Äù but does not mention freedom of religion. The law prohibits denunciation of Islam, conversion from Islam to another religion, and proselytizing directed at Muslims. As a consequence of the ongoing Yemeni Civil War, the Cabinet of Yemen affiliated with former president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi only controls a portion of the country and is unable to enforce its laws elsewhere, with the Supreme Political Council, the Southern Transitional Council, and various Islamic fundamentalist groups controlling significant portions of the country. Violence from the conflict has resulted in the bombing destruction of many religious buildings by several different factions in the conflict.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Yemen, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. === Legal framework === The constitution states the president must be Muslim (‚Äúpractices his Islamic duties‚Äù); however, it allows non-Muslims to run for parliament, as long as they ‚Äúfulfill their religious duties.‚Äù The law does not prohibit political parties based on religion, but it states parties may not claim to be the sole representative of any religion, oppose Islam, or restrict membership to a particular religious group. The criminal code states ‚Äúdeliberate‚Äù and ‚Äúinsistent‚Äù denunciation of Islam or conversion from Islam to another religion is apostasy, a capital offense. The law allows those charged with apostasy three opportunities to repent; upon repentance, they are absolved from the death penalty. It is illegal to proselytize to Muslims. Family law prohibits marriage between a Muslim and an individual whom the law defines as an apostate. Muslim women may not marry non-Muslims, and Muslim men may not marry women who do not practice one of the Abrahamic religions. By law, a woman seeking custody of a child ‚Äúought not‚Äù to be an apostate; a man ‚Äúought‚Äù to be of the same faith as the child. === Supreme Political Council territories === According to the UN, Bah√° º√≠ community members in Sana‚Äôa faced a ‚Äúpersistent pattern of persecution,‚Äù including arrest orders and pressure to recant their faith. Prior to the outbreak of the military conflict, Christian community representatives reported increased scrutiny by Houthi rebels, leading them to be more discreet, although they continued to wear religious attire that identified them as members of the community. In northern areas traditionally under Zaydi control, there were reports of continued Houthi efforts to impose their religious customs on non-Zaydi residents, including by banning music and requiring women to wear full veils. Abdul-Malik al-Houthi has stated there is Israeli involvement in the Saudi-led coalition campaign against Houthi rebels in speeches featuring anti-Semitic slogans, in addition to other religiously sectarian rhetoric. == References == Asia Category:Religion in Asia Category:Human rights in Asia ","title":"Freedom of religion in Asia by country"},{"id":"60258281","text":"Megan Gustafson (born December 13, 1996) is an American basketball player for the Dallas Wings of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).

A small, gabled front portico with barrel vault supported by fluted Doric columns and pilasters decorates the main entry on Hays Street. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. With ==History== The Dunbar House was constructed for William and Henrietta Dunbar at the corner of 15th and Hays Streets in 1923. A year after the house was completed, Etta Dunbar took second place for her front yard in a Better Gardens contest sponsored by Boise's Columbian Club in 1924. In 1934 the attic was finished and dormers were installed. In 1940 new exterior siding was installed, the heating system was upgraded, and a basement was excavated. The roof was repaired in 1949. ==William Dunbar== William C. Dunbar (June 25, 1874 --February 23, 1951) was an attorney and a municipal judge specializing in probate law. A few years after graduating with a law degree from Columbia University, he arrived in Boise in 1901 and taught political science at the original Boise High School (demolished) for two years. Then he became principal at the school, a post he held for one year before beginning his law practice. Dunbar was one of the early tenants of the Idaho Building, occupying office 321 until his retirement in 1950, two months before his death at the Dunbar House. Etta Dunbar continued to live at the house at least until 1965, the year the roof was replaced. By 1982 Mrs. Dunbar still owned the house but no longer lived there. Another William C.

States can differ based on whether or not they guarantee equal treatment under law for followers of different religions, whether they establish a state religion (and the legal implications that this has for both practitioners and non-practitioners), the extent to which religious organizations operating within the country are policed, and the extent to which religious law is used as a basis for the country's legal code. There are further discrepancies between some countries' self-proclaimed stances of religious freedom in law and the actual practice of authority bodies within those countries: a country's establishment of religious equality in their constitution or laws does not necessarily translate into freedom of practice for residents of the country. Additionally, similar practices (such as having religious organizations register with the government) can have different consequences depending on other sociopolitical circumstances specific to the countries in question. Every country in North America includes provisions for the freedom of religion or freedom of conscience in its constitution. Several countries also have formally outlawed discrimination on religious grounds,International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Jamaica US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Nicaragua, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Bahamas, The, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. and according to US State Department reports many countries in the region have no outstanding issues regarding breaches of religious freedom due to government intervention or societal pressure.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Antigua and Barbuda, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Dominica, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Seven countries have blasphemy laws which have been part of their legal codes since the British colonial era, but which are not currently enforced. Rastafarians face discrimination and obstacles to religious practice in many countries in the region, often due in part to countries outlawing cannabis, which is used in Rastafarian religious rituals.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Barbados, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Roman Catholicism is the state religion of a few countries in North America,International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Costa Rica, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Dominican Republic, US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. and a couple more provide preferential treatment to the Catholic Church despite not officially establishing it as a state religion.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Guatemala, US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Haiti, US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. == Antigua and Barbuda == The constitution of Antigua and Barbuda establishes the freedom of religious belief in the country. Members of clergy are not allowed to run for political office. Representatives of the Rastafari community have complained that legal restrictions such as the criminalization of cannabis and mandatory vaccination policies are contrary to their religious beliefs, although the government is also reportedly working with the community to reach a compromise on these issues. As of 2017, there have been no reports of significant societal breaches or abuses of the freedom of religion in Antigua and Barbuda according to the United States Department of State. == The Bahamas == The constitution of the Bahamas provides for the freedom of religion and prohibits discrimination based on belief. The country has no state religion, although the preamble to its constitution mentions \\"Christian values\\". Obeah is illegal in the Bahamas, punishable by a jail sentence. This law, however, is traditionally unenforced. Similarly, laws prohibiting the publication of blasphemy (with exceptions for opinions \\"expressed in good faith and in decent language\\") are also unenforced. As of 2017, there have been no reports of significant societal breaches or abuses of the freedom of religion in the Bahamas according to the United States Department of State. == Barbados == The constitution of Barbados provides for the freedom of religion and prohibits discrimination based on creed. There is a law against \\"blasphemous libel\\" but it is unenforced. Religious groups are allowed to establish private schools and provide religious instruction, with some support from the government. Religious groups are not required to register with the government, but may do so for tax purposes. Rastafarians are unable to perform some religious rituals due to the illegality of cannabis. Representatives of the community have also objected to mandatory vaccinations for schoolchildren, and reported that Rastafarians face disproportionate scrutiny at security checkpoints, as well as facing some social discrimination. Muslims in Barbados have objected to being forced to pose without head coverings for identification and passport photographs. According to the government, these measures are purely for security reasons. == Belize == The Constitution of Belize establishes the freedom of religion. Discrimination on religious grounds is illegal. A law against blasphemy is unenforced. The Belize Council of Churches, a body which includes representatives from several Christian denominations, appoints one senator to the senate of Belize with the approval of the Governor-General. The law also establishes that prisoners in jails must have their religious beliefs respected and accommodated.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Belize, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Religious groups are required to register with the government in order to operate in the country. Religious groups are exempt from certain taxes. Missionaries are required to register with the government and purchase a religious worker's permit. The public school curriculum for primary schools includes nondenominational \\"spirituality\\" classes that introduce world religions, as well as ethics and morals associated with religion. Most public schools are managed by Christian churches. A few schools are run by non-Christian religious groups. ==Canada== Religious freedom in Canada is a constitutionally protected right as part of Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. There is no established church, however religious groups can qualify for tax-exemption. The amount of funding religious schools receive varies from province to province. In many provinces religious schools are government funded in the same way other independent schools are. In most parts of Canada there is a Catholic education system alongside the secular \\"public\\" education system. They all run on Catholic principles and include religious activities and instruction as a matter of course. They are not exclusively attended by practicing Catholics. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is entrenched in the Constitution, states in the preamble that Canada \\"is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law.\\" Freedom of religion as also guaranteed.

Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] (1 S.C.R. 295) ruled that a 1906 statute that required most places to be closed on Sunday did not have a legitimate purpose in a \\"free and democratic society,\\" and was an unconstitutional attempt to establish a religious-based closing law (see Blue law.) == Costa Rica == The constitution of Costa Rica establishes Roman Catholicism as the state religion and provides it with special privileges and funding. The constitution also prohibits the government from interfering with the free practice of religion, a provision that is respected in practice. Religious groups with at least ten members may register with the government in order to be able to raise funds and own property. There is no penalty for not being registered, other than a lack of access to these privileges. Religious marriage ceremonies other than those conducted by the Catholic Church are not recognized by the government. Couples married through such ceremonies must also obtain a civil union from a public notary in order to have their marriage legally recognized. The government provides funding to private religious schools regardless of religion. == Cuba == The constitution of Cuba establishes the freedom of religion and prohibits religious discrimination.Oliva, Enrique Lopez. \\"Religious reawakening: stirrings in Cuba.\\" \\"> Following the Cuban Revolution, in the 1960s Cuba's government polemicized against the Catholic Church, which was accused of being Francoist and anti-communist, and priests were imprisoned and harassed by the government. Additionally, the Communist Party of Cuba did not allow non-atheists to become party members. Since the 1980s, the government of Cuba has taken an increasingly permissive stance towards religious practice, first thawing relations with Protestant groups which were encouraged to practice their religion, and then later inviting the Pope John Paul II in the 90s to visit the country (all subsequent popes have made official visits to Cuba since then).Jim Yardley, \\"Praising Pope, Cuban President says he might return to Church.\\" New York Times May 11, 2015 A4. The government, however, continues to restrict the Catholic Church's communications and only allows it to receive funding from sources that it approves. == Dominica == The constitution of Dominica provides for the freedom of religion and thought. This is enforced by the government, although the Rastafarian community objects to the illegal status of cannabis in Dominica, as cannabis plays an important role in their religious practice. The government subsidizes the salaries of teachers at private religious schools. Public schools typically include optional non-denominational prayers in morning assemblies. Religious groups may register with the government in order to receive non-profit status. According to the US Department of State, there have been no significant societal breaches of religious freedom in Dominica. == Dominican Republic == The constitution of the Dominican Republic provides for the freedom of religion. Catholicism is the state religion and the Catholic Church receives special privileges, such as subsidies for clergy salaries and the transfer of property to the Church. Non-Catholic religious groups can register with the government in order to receive tax exemptions and to be allowed to officiate marriages. Public schools include religious studies classes with curricula that are overseen by the Catholic Church. Parents can choose to have their children skip such classes, and private schools are not required to provide them. Private religious schools may offer their own religious curricula. == El Salvador == The constitution of El Salvador provides for the freedom of religion and prohibits religious discrimination. Publicly offending others' religious beliefs or damaging religious objects is punishable by imprisonment. Members of the clergy may not hold senior government positions, and are forbidden from joining political parties.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 El Salvador, US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Religious groups may register with the government for the purposes of tax-exemption and acquiring building permits. Special visas are required for individuals who wish to travel to El Salvador to engage in proselytizing. Public school education is secular. Private schools may include religious content in their curricula, but do not receive government support. Since 2016, clergy have limited access to prisons, due to concerns that some members of the clergy were using prison visits to smuggle items into prisons. == Grenada == The constitution of Grenada establishes the freedom of religion. The country's legal code bans the publication of blasphemy, but this is not enforced in practice.International Religious Freedom Report 2017, US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Religious groups may register in order to receive tax exemption and to sponsor missionaries from outside the country. The government subsidizes religiously affiliated private schools. As of 2017, members of minority religious groups reported being able to practice their religions openly without interference. == Guatemala == The constitution of Guatemala establishes the freedom of religion. While it is not a state religion, the Catholic Church is recognized as \\"a distinct legal personality\\" that receives certain privileges. According to the constitution, no member of the clergy of any religion may serve as president, vice president, government minister, or as a judge. Registration for religious groups is not required, but provides access to property purchase and tax exemptions. The constitution includes a commitment to protect the rights of indigenous Maya groups to practice their religion. Mayan religious groups are allowed to use historical sites on government-owned property for ceremonies. However, representatives of Mayan groups have complained that their access is limited and subject to other obstacles, such as being required to pay fees. Public schools may choose to offer religious instruction, but there is no national framework for such classes. Private religious schools are allowed to operate as well. == Haiti == The constitution of Haiti establishes the freedom of religion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs oversees and monitors religious groups and laws affecting them. While Catholicism has not been the state religion since 1987, a 19th century concordat with the Holy See continues to confer preferential treatment to the Catholic Church, in the form of stipends for clergy and financial support to churches and religious schools. The Catholic Church also retains the right to appoint certain amounts of clergy in Haiti without the government's consent. Religious groups are not required to register with the government, but may do so in order to receive special standing in legal proceedings, tax exemptions, and civil recognition for marriage and baptismal certificates. The government has continually failed to recognize marriages performed by Haitian Vodou practitioners, despite it being a registered religion. Government officials claim that they are working with the Vodou community to establish a certification process for their clergy in order to resolve this issue. Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has continually not approved a request from the Muslim community to register as a religious group, which has been outstanding since the 1980s. According to the government, this was due to not having received necessary financial documentation as part of the registration process. According to the government, Muslims in jail do not reliably have access to halal food and Muslim clergy due to a lack of resources. Protestant and Catholic clergy have reported good relations with the government. Representatives of the Vodou and Muslim communities have reported social stigma against their communities, and discrimination in employment. == Honduras == The constitution of Honduras establishes the freedom of religion. The National Congress of Honduras has the power to legally recognize religious groups, which confers to them tax-exempt status and other privileges. The Catholic Church is the only organization legally recognized as a religious group, although other religious groups can register with the government as NGOs. Some religious groups have criticized this as constituting preferential treatment for the Catholic Church at the expense of other groups.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Honduras, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The constitution prohibits religious leaders from holding elected office or publicly making political statements. Despite this, some Protestant pastors have been elected to government positions and serve on government advisory bodies. The government also frequently includes Catholic or Protestant prayers as part of official events and ceremonies, which has been criticized by representatives of other religious groups. Clergy are provided exemptions from being required to testify in court about information acquired from religious confessions. Vicars, bishops, and archbishops of the Catholic Church, as well as similarly high ranking members of other religions, are not required to appear in court if subpoenaed. Public schools are required to teach secular curricula. Private religious schools also operate in Honduras. Foreign missionaries must register with the government. Some religious groups have reached agreements with the government to expedite this process. Conscientious objection to military service is protected by law, including objection on religious grounds. Some politicians, generally from opposition parties, have regularly used antisemitism rhetoric in their political statements. == Jamaica == The constitution of Jamaica establishes the freedom of religion and outlaws religious discrimination. A colonial-era law criminalizing Obeah and Myal continues to exist, but has rarely been enforced since Jamaica's independence from the United Kingdom in 1962. Registration with the government is not mandatory for religious groups, but provides groups with some privileges, such as being able to own land and enter legal disputes as an organization. Groups seeking tax-exempt status must register separately as charities. The public school curriculum includes nondenominational religious education. Some public schools are run by religious institutions, but are required to hold to the same standard as other public schools. Religious private schools also operate in Jamaica. While Rastafarians were once persecuted by the government of Jamaica and routinely harassed by police looking for then-illegal cannabis, the government has since taken steps to accommodate Rastafarians, including the decriminalization of the possession of small amounts of cannabis for religious purposes in 2015, and formal apologies coupled with financial reparations for past actions against the Rastafarian community, such as the Coral Gardens incident. Rastafarians still face some societal discrimination, particularly when seeking employment, but community representatives have stated that incidences of discrimination have sharply decreased since 2015. Representatives of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities in Jamaica have described Jamaican society as being tolerant of religious diversity, and identified the high level of interfaith dialogue as evidence to support this claim. ==Mexico== The Constitution of Mexico and other laws establish and protect the freedom of religion in Mexico. A precedent of limiting the rights of the church ‚Äì especially the Roman Catholic Church‚Äì was set by President Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as in 1833. Later, President Benito Ju√°rez enacted a set of laws that came to be known as the Leyes de Reforma (or Reform laws) between 1859 and 1863 in the backdrop of the Reform War. These laws mandated, among other things, the separation of church and state, allowed for civil marriages and a civil registry, and confiscated the church's property. Tensions also existed between the Roman Catholic Church and the post-Revolution Mexican government. Severe restrictions on the rights of the Church and members of the clergy were written into the country's 1917 constitution that led to the eruption of the Cristero War in 1926. In 1992 the government reestablished diplomatic relations with the Holy See and lifted almost all restrictions on the Catholic Church. This later action included granting all religious groups legal status, conceding them limited property rights, and lifting restrictions on the number of priests in the country. However, the law continues to mandate a strict separation of church and state. The constitution still bars members of the clergy from holding public office, advocating partisan political views, supporting political candidates, or opposing the laws or institutions of the state. The constitution provides that education should avoid privileges of religion, and that one religion or its members may not be given preference in education over another. Religious instruction is prohibited in public schools; however, religious associations are free to maintain private schools, which receive no public funds. Religious groups may not own or administer broadcast radio or television stations. Government permission is required for commercial broadcast radio or television to transmit religious programming. == Nicaragua == The constitution of Nicaragua prohibits religious discrimination and establishes the freedom of religion. It declares that Nicaragua has no state religion, but it also empowers government controlled, community-level organizations called Family Committees to promote \\"Christian values\\" at a community level. Religious groups may register with the government through a process similar to that which is used by NGOs. Registration allows organizations to enter legal contracts and provides some tax exemptions. According to the United States International Religious Freedom Report, Nicaragua's government gives preferential treatment to religious organizations with pro-government political stances, and uses bureaucratic measures to impede the activities of religious groups that have been critical of the government. Some representatives of Christian groups have also made statements that are critical of the government's usage of Catholic rhetoric and its incorporation of Catholic traditions as government-backed celebrations. Religious education is included as part of a civics curriculum in schools. ==Panama== The Constitution of Panama provides for freedom of religion, with some qualifications, and other laws and policies contribute to the generally free practice of religion. The law at all levels protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private actors. The Government generally respects religious freedom in practice. In 2007, the US government received no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice. The Constitution dictates that Catholicism be taught in public schools; however, parents have the right to exempt their children from religious instruction. The numerical predominance of Catholicism and the consideration given to it in the Constitution generally have not prejudiced other religious groups.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Panama: International Religious Freedom Report 2008. == Saint Kitts and Nevis == The constitution of Saint Kitts and Nevis establishes the freedom of religion and prohibits discrimination.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Saint Kitts and Nevis, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Religious organizations are not required to register with the government, but doing so adds them to a database through which the government sends up to date information about policies regarding religion, and allows them to operate as charities. Public schools include Christian religious instruction and daily prayers, which are optional for students who do not wish to attend them. Religious groups are allowed to establish their own private schools. According to the Organization for Rastafarians in Unity, Rastafarians in Saint Kitts and Nevis face discrimination. Cannabis, a Rastafarian religious sacrament, is illegal in Saint Kitts and Nevis. While dreadlocks are not illegal, many private businesses do not allow their employees to wear them, and prisoners in jail are forced to have their dreadlocks shaved off. The ORU has also reported police harassment of Rastafarians and limited access to public spaces for religious purposes, as well as stating that Rastafarians face employment discrimination in the private sector. == Saint Lucia == The constitution of Saint Lucia establishes the freedom of religion, and prohibits religious instruction without consent in schools, prisons, and the military. An anti- blasphemy law remains part of the legal code of Saint Lucia but is not enforced.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Saint Lucia, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The government requires religious organizations with more than 250 members to register with the government. Upon registering, the groups can further apply for concessions such as tax breaks. Public schools include optional nondenominational religious education courses for students. Religious groups can run private schools where they are allowed to teach their religion; the government provides about 50% of the funding for these schools. There are no restrictions on foreign missionaries, although they are required to register with the government to receive a labor permit before entering the country. Rastafarians in Saint Lucia have criticized the government's prohibition of cannabis, as this discourages them from engaging in certain religious rituals. Rastafarians are also subject to police harassment in connection with cannabis. The government only began recognizing Rastafarian marriages (and thus their children's inheritance rights) in 2017. Muslims in Saint Lucia have been subjected to harassment, especially when wearing religious attire. == Saint Vincent and the Grenadines == The constitution of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines states that the country \\"is founded on the belief in the supremacy of God\\". It further establishes the freedom of conscience and the right to free religious practice in public or private. An anti-blasphemy law is part of the legal code but is not enforced.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Public schools include nondenominational religious curriculums based on Christianity, as well as optional Christian prayer in assemblies. Religious groups are allowed to set up their own schools. Cannabis is illegal, including for religious use. Rastafarians have criticized this law, as it impedes their ability to practice their religion. == Trinidad and Tobago == The constitution of Trinidad and Tobago establishes the freedom of religion and prohibits religious discrimination. An anti-blasphemy law is part of the legal code but is not enforced.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Trinidad and Tobago, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Religious groups may register with the government in order to be able to perform marriages, sponsor missionaries, or accept tax-exempt donations. Voluntary religious instruction is available as part of the public school curriculum. The government subsidizes religious private schools affiliated with Christian, Muslim, and Hindu groups. In 2017, Trinidad and Tobago set a uniform minimum marriage age of 18 years. Previously, different age limits were enforced for different religious groups. While many organizations (and particularly religiously affiliated women's organizations) welcomed this change, some religious organizations such as the orthodox Hindu organization Sanatan Dharma Maha Saba stated that they would oppose the law on the grounds that it infringes on religious freedom. The government of Trinidad and Tobago hosts the Inter-Religious Organization, an interfaith coordinating committee with representatives from 25 religious groups, including Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Orisha and Bah√°'i groups. Chaplains from the various religious denominations present in Trinidad Tobago are able to provide religious services to inmates in prisons. ==United States== The principle of freedom of religion is officially protected by the US constitution. US Supreme Court rulings have re-stated and expanded upon the legal individual right of freedom of religion within the United States of America. In the 17th and 18th centuries, many Europeans emigrated to what would later become the United States. For some this was driven at least partly by the desire to worship freely in their own fashion. These included a large number of nonconformists such as the Puritans and the Pilgrims as well as English Catholics. However, with some exceptions, such as William Penn of Pennsylvania or the Roman Catholic Lord Baltimore in Maryland, most of these groups did not believe in religious toleration and in some cases came to America with the explicit aim of setting up an established religion. === Treatment of Native American religions === Despite the historical protection of the freedom of religion in the US body of law, these rights were not extended to Native Americans for much of US history. With the practice of the Americanization of Native Americans, Native American children were sent to Christian boarding schools where they were forced to worship as Christians and traditional customs were banned.Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools -Andrea Smith writing for Amnesty International Magazine on the historic government policy of forcing over 100,000 Native American children to attend Christian boarding schools, and the subsequent social reverberations of \\"widespread sexual and physical abuse\\" suffered at the hands of school administrators. Until the Freedom of Religion Act 1978, \\"spiritual leaders [of Native Americans] ran the risk of jail sentences of up to 30 years for simply practicing their rituals.\\"http://www.religioustolerance.org ‚Äì Native American Spirituality The traditional indigenous Sun Dance was illegal from 1904 to the 1980s. Peyote, a hallucinogenic plant used in some Native American religious ceremonies, is illegal in the US,Kahn, Paul W. \\"Putting Liberalism In Its Place.\\" Princeton University Press, 2005. P. 76 and access to other items used for ceremonies, such as eagle feathers, is restricted.Stokes, DaShanne. 2007. \\"Time for New Eagle Feather Law.\\" Indian Country Today, February 21, pp. A2.Stokes, DaShanne. 2008. \\"Eagle Feathers and the Imperialist Conquest of State Recognized Tribes.\\" Indian Country Today, August 13, pp. 5. Ancestral remains and lands also have a significant role in Native American religions, and access to both the land and physical remains (many of which are being held in museums) is limited.Carrillo, Jo (1998). Readings in American Indian Law: Recalling the Rhythm of Survival Temple University Press, Philadelphia. === Treatment of Jews === In 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that 54.2% of hate crimes motivated by religious bias targeted Jews.2016 Hate Crime Statistics, Federal Bureau of Investigation Cultural changes from the 1960s onward into the 21st century have caused a large shift in general attitudes such that, in recent years, most Americans surveyed express positive viewpoints regarding Jews, whereas previously antisemitism was more common in American society. An ABC News report in 2007 recounted that about 6% of Americans reported some feelings of prejudice against Jews. According to surveys by the Anti-Defamation League in 2011, antisemitism is rejected by clear majorities of Americans, with 64% of them lauding Jews' cultural contributions to the nation in 2011, but still a minority holding hateful views of Jews remain, with 19% of Americans supporting the antisemitic canard that Jews co-control Wall Street. Holocaust denial has also only been a fringe phenomenon in recent years; 96% of Americans believe the Holocaust occurred. === Treatment of Muslims === While discrimination along religious lines is officially illegal, discrimination and prejudice against Muslims is common in American society. Muslims face discrimination in the workplace, discrimination at airport security checkpoints, immigration hearings.Figueroa, Tiffani B. \\"All Muslims are Like That: How Islamophobia is Diminishing Americans' Right to Receive Information.\\" Hofstra L. Rev. 41 (2012): 467. Additionally, Muslims are subjected to harassment, and there have been incidents of deadly violence perpetrated against Muslims due to their religion. As a consequence of the Patriot Act, various bodies of the American government have explicitly engaged in the targeted surveillance and infiltration of Muslim communities.Pitt, Cassady . \\"U.S. Patriot Act and Racial Profiling: Are There Consequences of Discrimination?\\" Michigan Sociological Review 25:53-69. Accessed September 26, 2017. JSTOR. Keyword: Patriot Act. Studies have noted that Muslims are disproportionately negatively portrayed as violent in American media.Media Tenor International. 2011. A New Era for Arab-Western Relations ‚Äì Media analysis. New York: Media Tenor. === Treatment of atheists === In the United States, seven state constitutions include religious tests that would effectively prevent atheists from holding public office, and in some cases being a juror/witness, though these have not generally been enforced since the early twentieth century. As of 2013 there were no publicly atheist legislators in the federal government, although Pete Stark had previously held office in Congress as a public atheist, and it is alleged that several other legislators are atheists but keep their religious beliefs private. Few politicians have been willing to acknowledge their lack of belief in supreme beings, since such revelations have been considered \\"political suicide\\". A 2015 Gallup survey found that 40% of Americans would not vote an atheist for president, and in polls prior to 2015, that number had reached about 50%. ==References== Category:Religion in North America Category:Religion and politics Category:Irreligion North America Category:Human rights in North America ","title":"Freedom of religion in North America by country"},{"id":"60258398","text":"Alan Patrick Hamlin (born 25 March 1951) is a British economist and political theorist.

States can differ based on whether or not they guarantee equal treatment under law for followers of different religions, whether they establish a state religion (and the legal implications that this has for both practitioners and non-practitioners), the extent to which religious organizations operating within the country are policed, and the extent to which religious law is used as a basis for the country's legal code. There are further discrepancies between some countries' self-proclaimed stances of religious freedom in law and the actual practice of authority bodies within those countries: a country's establishment of religious equality in their constitution or laws does not necessarily translate into freedom of practice for residents of the country. Additionally, similar practices (such as having religious organizations register with the government) can have different consequences depending on other sociopolitical circumstances specific to the countries in question. Every country in South America includes a provision for the freedom of religion in its constitution. A few countries have explicitly outlawed discrimination along religious lines.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 ¬ß Suriname, US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. International Religious Freedom Report 2016 ¬ß Uruguay, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. While no country in South America has an official state religion, some confer preferential treatment to the Catholic Church.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 ¬ß Bolivia, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.\\"Paraguay\\". International Religious Freedom Report 2008. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (September 19, 2008). Antisemitic vandalism has been reported in three countries in South America.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 ¬ß Chile US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. ==Argentina== Article 14 of the Constitution of Argentina guarantees all the inhabitants of the Nation the right \\"to profess freely their religion.\\" The Constitution further requires the government to support Roman Catholicism economically, and the government pays salaries for Roman Catholic bishops.(English translation) See Article I, Chapter I, sections 2 and 14. As of 2010 the state pays bishops salaries calculated as 80% of a judge's salary. Despite this, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Roman Catholic Church was not granted the status of official religion by the constitution or any federal legislation.Villacampa, Ignacio c/ Almos de Villacampa, Mar√≠a Ang√©lica (fallos 312:122) A 2011 poll conducted by the Gino Germani Research Institute of the University of Buenos Aires on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and Delegaci√≥n de Asociaciones Israelitas Argentinas showed that a majority of Argentines held antisemitic sentiments or prejudices. There have been a number of antisemitic incidents recorded in Argentina since 2010, largely in the form of verbal abuse and vandalism. ==Bolivia== The constitution of Bolivia establishes the freedom of religion and a separation between church and state. The constitution further prohibits discrimination along religious lines. Religious organizations are required to register with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with the exception of the Catholic Church, whose registration is waived due to an agreement between the Bolivian government and the Holy See. A separate class of groups called \\"spiritual organizations\\", and which roughly corresponds to indigenous religious groups in Bolivia, is also required to register with the government and does so through a process that is similar to that used by religious organizations, although the registration fees for spiritual organizations are lower. Both private and public schools have the option to include religious studies in their curricula. All schools are required to teach ethics courses which emphasize religious tolerance. Some smaller churches in the evangelical Christian community have refused to register with the government, citing concerns for their privacy. While these groups have been unable to open bank accounts or hold property, the state has not otherwise interfered with their religious practice. Christian groups have alleged that the government shows a preference toward indigenous religious groups and practices. In rural areas of the country, hostility by indigenous communities against Christian missionaries has been reported; in some cases, these incidents have included cases of \\"indigenous leaders hitting pastors\\". ==Brazil== Religious freedom has been part of Brazil as law since January 7, 1890, codified by a decree signed by President Deodoro da Fonseca in the then-newly established Republic. It has been a Constitutional right since the 1946 Constitution was enacted, up to and including the current 1988 Constitution of Brazil. The Federal Constitution of Brazil establishes as a fundamental right the freedom of religion, prescribing that Brazil is a secular country, that is, the state cannot adopt, encourage or promote any god or religion. In its article 19, the Federal Constitution of Brazil also prohibits to all Brazilian federative entities the establishment of religious cults. In practice, all religions in Brazil are respected, but none promoted. However, personal beliefs, which includes religious creed, often influence the democratic political decisions. Some notable public and political spaces such as the Chamber of Deputies contain crucifixes, which has been criticized as being against the secular law. January 7 is the National Day of Religious Freedom in Brazil. == Chile == The constitution Chile provides for the freedom of religion, although it stipulates that this freedom must be not be ‚Äúopposed to morals, to good customs or to the public order\\". It further establishes a separation between church and state, and other laws prohibit religious discrimination. Religious organizations are not required to register with the government, but may do so to receive tax breaks. Religious groups may appoint chaplains to provide services in hospitals and prisons. Officially registered groups may appoint chaplains for the military. All schools are required to provide two hours of religious per week, tailored to the religious affiliations of the students. The majority of such courses focus on a Catholic perspective, but the government has approved curricula for 14 different religious groups. Parents may also choose to excuse their children from such classes. According to Christian Solidarity Worldwide, arsonists attacked Baptist and Catholic churches in the primarily indigenous Mapuche communities in the rural Araucania Region in 2017. According to other sources, the church attacks fit into a pattern of sabotage directed at a wide range of institutions, business interests, and infrastructure in Araucania, and thus may not necessarily have been intended as a religiously-motivated attack. As of the end of 2017, a trial was still pending for the arson suspects, and the regional government verbally committed itself to helping rebuild the churches. Leaders of the Jewish community have expressed concerns about incidences of antisemitic vandalism and graffiti targeting Jews. The National Office of Religious Affairs facilitates inter-religious dialogue and promotes tolerance of religious diversity. ==Colombia== The Colombian Constitution of 1991 guarantees freedom of religion and maintains that all religious faiths are equally free before the law.Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title II ‚Äì Concerning rights, guarantees, and duties ‚Äì Chapter I ‚Äì Concerning fundamental rights ‚Äì Article 19) The government of Colombia does not collect religious statistics in its censuses. Based on a 2010 survey in \\"major cities throughout the country, many mid-size cities, and the rural region of Uraba\\". ==Ecuador== Freedom of religion in Ecuador is guaranteed by the country's constitution, and the government generally respects this right in practice.International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Ecuador. U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (2007). Religious groups are allowed to engage in missionary activities, and private schools are allowed to provide religious instruction, although the government generally does not allow religious instruction in public schools. ==Paraguay== Freedom of religion in Paraguay is provided in the Constitution of Paraguay. The law at all levels protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private actors, and the constitution provides for conscientious objection to military service.The constitution recognizes the historical role of the Catholic Church (the dominant religion). Although the government is secular in name and practice, most government officials are Catholic, and Catholic clergy occasionally speak during official government events.. The government permits, but does not require religious instruction in public schools. Parents are permitted to homeschool or send their children to the school of their choice without sanction or restriction. Anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi messages and symbols, including graffiti, appear sporadically. The government investigated but did not identify suspects. In July 2007 the newspaper ABC Color published an anti- Semitic article. ==Peru== The constitution of Peru, along with numerous laws and policies, protect the freedom of religion. However, non-Catholic groups have continuously struggled to obtain the same freedoms given to those who are Catholic. Non-Catholic religious groups were unable to receive certain benefits provided to those in the Catholic Church, and frequently experience societal abuses as a result of their religious affiliation and beliefs. In Article 50 of the Constitution, it states that the state \\"extends its contribution\\" to the Catholic Church and \\"may\\" to other religions. About 81% of the Peruvian population is Roman Catholic, 13% Protestant, and 3% other religions. The minority religious groups have criticized religious freedom laws, claiming they do not address the problem of inequality, and can be discriminatory and unconstitutional. Many Peruvians continue to have problems with Christian religious groups who impose their culture on those populations who have different beliefs and ways of life. However, Peru has taken many steps toward establishing more legal rights for numerous religious groups. Through the development of the Office of Interfaith Affairs, Peru has worked to address problems with religious tolerance. Many minority groups have said that they were pleased with adjustments made by the government in 2011 and 2016 to reduce favoritism toward the Catholic Church and relax organization registration requirements.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 ¬ß Peru, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Even though there are still inequalities to be addressed when it comes to religious freedom, the Peruvian government has worked to combat problems surrounding non-Catholic religious groups, and continues to push for institutional equality. ==Suriname== The constitution of Suriname establishes the freedom of religion and outlaws discrimination along religious lines. \\"Instigating religious hatred\\" is punishable by fines, and in some cases prison. Religious groups may register with the government in order to receive financial support. Most groups are registered. Religious instruction is not allowed in public schools. Private religious schools are allowed, and comprise roughly half of the primary and secondary schools in Suriname. These private schools are partially subsidized by the government. Parents are not allowed to homeschool children for religious reasons The government engages in vocal support of religious diversity and tolerance, and recognizes the holidays of various religious traditions present in the country as national holidays. The armed forces have chaplains for the Hindu, Muslim, Catholic, and Protestant faiths. == Uruguay == The constitution of Uruguay provides for the freedom of religion and states that \\"the State supports no religion\\". Discrimination on religious grounds is illegal. The National Institute of Human Rights, part of the parliament, hears complaints of religious discrimination and conducts investigations, ultimately deciding whether the case should receive a judicial or administrative hearing. The Institute also provides free legal resources to complainants. Religious groups may register with the government as nonprofit organizations in order to receive tax breaks. Local government regulates the use of public land for burials. Many departments allow for all religious groups to use public cemeteries. Religious instruction is prohibited in public schools. Although public schools close for certain Christian holidays, the government does not refer to these holidays by their Christian names. Students belonging to other religions may miss classes to observe their religious traditions without penalty. Private schools may decide which holidays to observe. Minority non-Abrahamic religious groups reported no cases of discrimination against them by the government in 2017. They also claimed, however, that the government demonstrated more interest in engaging with Christian and Jewish groups, and that they had few opportunities for direct dialogue with the government. Such groups also complained that a lack of knowledge of their beliefs in general society sometimes led to discrimination, and that they were at times verbally harassed in public due to their beliefs. The Jewish community has been targeted by antisemitic graffiti, and antisemitic rhetoric is present on Uruguayan websites and social media. In 2017 there were tensions between the Catholic Church and the government of Montevideo due to the government's refusal to install a statue of the Virgin Mary on a major public road. Church representatives alleged that this was particularly controversial because the government had previously approved statues of Confucius and Yem·ªçja along the road. Supporters of the Virgin Mary statue used its rejection as a justification for opposing requests from the Muslim community of Montevideo to use land in the public ceremony for Muslim burial rites. As of the end of 2017, the Muslim community's request was pending. ==Venezuela== The constitution of Venezuela provides for the freedom of religion insofar as it does not violate \\"public morality or decency\\". A 2017 constitutional law criminalizes \\"incitement to hatred\\" or violence, including provisions specifically concerning the incitement of hatred against religious groups.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 ¬ß Venezuela, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Religious organizations must register with the government in order to obtain legal status. The Directorate of Justice and Religion, part of the Ministry of Interior, Justice and Peace, manages registrations, disburses funds to registered organizations, and promotes religious tolerance. Chaplain services in the military are available only for Catholics. Religious education is allowed in public schools, although it is not part of any official curriculum proposed by the government. Representatives of the Catholic Church-affiliated National Laity Council have claimed that the government has at times pressured school administrators to not teach religious courses, but that in other cases teachers had autonomy to include religious education as long as their curricula were otherwise compliant with the Ministry of Education's standards. Leaders of religious organizations who are vocal critics of the government faced harassment by pro-government groups who accused them of improperly politicizing their religious services. In some cases this harassment has escalated to violence. Jewish community leaders have accused state-funded media and some government officials of engaging in antisemitic rhetoric. ==References== South America Category:Religion in South America Category:Human rights in South America ","title":"Freedom of religion in South America by country"},{"id":"60258412","text":"Sir Richard Lane (c.1667‚Äì1756), of Worcester was a British merchant, sugar- baker and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1721 and 1734. He became a prominent figure in the salt trade ==Biography== Lane was the eldest son of Richard Lane of St. Augustine's, Bristol, sugar-baker, merchant and mayor of Bristol and his wife Susanna. He married by licence dated 3 January 1692, Sarah Davie of Salford, Lancashire. He moved to Worcester, where he was established as a merchant and sugar-baker by 1699. In 1705 he succeeded his father. He was Mayor of Worcester for the year 1709 to 1710. In July 1710, while mayor, he put a stop to the ‚Äòinsolent progress of Dr. Sacheverel and his deluded followers‚Äô. He was High Sheriff of Worcestershire for the year 1714 to 1715, the first year of King George the First, and raised 'the posse comitatus and (thro‚Äô God‚Äôs blessing) defeated great numbers of' Jacobites 'who came in tumults there with arms'. He was knighted on 21 October 1714. Lane was returned as Member of Parliament for Minehead, at a by-election on 18 December 1721. However he had taken the writ from messenger who was supposed to take it to the returning officer, and kept it in his pocket until the election.day. The messenger was taken into custody of the serjeant-at-arms but Lane escaped punishment. He was later unseated on petition on 9 January 1722. In 1725, some people involved in the Cheshire salt works discovered that the strongest brine lay below the depth of the pits in Droitwich. Lane gave the order to sink through the talc at the bottom of the pits, and the strong brine burst out with such violent abundance, that two men who working in the pit were thrown to the surface and killed. Soon after everyone sunk his pit through the talc and obtained so much strong brine that much of it was wasted, From then on the old pits, which had been worth near ¬£5,000 a year, became valueless. Lane was returned for Worcester after a contest at the 1727 British general election. He supported the Administration consistently and was rewarded with the appointment of his eldest son as receiver general of the land tax for Worcestershire, while his second son was appointed a commissioner for licensing hawkers and pedlars. In March 1732 Lane spoke in favour of the free export of wool and yarn from Ireland. He was a salt exporter and at this time he was involved in a protracted lawsuit with the salt commissioners on a claim for nearly ¬£23,000 for allowances on shipments of salt to Ireland over a period of six months. He protested against the export of rock salt to Ireland because, as there was no restriction on refining it there, it would undercut his own salt. He did not stand in 1734. Lane died, aged 89, on 29 March 1756 and was buried in the North ambulatory of Westminster Abbey.Westminster Abbey ‚Äì Sir Richard Lane He left four sons and five daughters of whom three were Ann, Sarah and Mary. ==References== Category:1660s births Category:1756 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1715‚Äì1722 Category:British MPs 1727‚Äì1734 Category:Mayors of places in Worcestershire Category:High Sheriffs of Worcestershire ","title":"Richard Lane (politician)"},{"id":"60258416","text":"Marek Grzegorz Magierowski (born 12 February 1971, in Bystrzyca K≈Çodzka) is a Polish journalist and columnist.

States can differ based on whether or not they guarantee equal treatment under law for followers of different religions, whether they establish a state religion (and the legal implications that this has for both practitioners and non-practitioners), the extent to which religious organizations operating within the country are policed, and the extent to which religious law is used as a basis for the country's legal code. There are further discrepancies between some countries' self-proclaimed stances of religious freedom in law and the actual practice of authority bodies within those countries: a country's establishment of religious equality in their constitution or laws does not necessarily translate into freedom of practice for residents of the country. Additionally, similar practices (such as having religious organizations register with the government) can have different consequences depending on other sociopolitical circumstances specific to the countries in question. All of the countries in Oceania officially guarantee the right to freedom of religion in a constitution or bill of rights, although over half qualify this freedom as being subordinate to other concerns such as public safety or \\"morality\\". Additionally, a few countries have communal local leadership structures which are sometimes hostile to foreign religions, despite official legal requirements for tolerance.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 ¬ß Papua New GuineaUS Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.Saada Angelica, Samoa: A Truly Religious Place? Views Towards Religion in Samoa, S.I.T.

Anti- semitic material has been found distributed on Australian college campuses.https://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/antisemitic- material-found-on-university-campuses/news- story/c0ee900d4a6f83597629bb6809db2413 According to some scholars, a particular trend of anti-Muslim prejudice has developed in Australia since the late 1980s. Various far-right groups have held anti-Muslim rallies and have otherwise espoused anti-Muslim political campaigns. A 2014 report from the Islamic Sciences and Research Academy, University of Western Sydney, on mosques in New South Wales found that 44 percent of mosques in the state had \\"experienced resistance from the local community when the mosque was initially proposed\\". In around 20 percent of these cases opposition was from a small number of people. == Federated States of Micronesia == The constitution of Micronesia states that laws establishing a state religion or impeding the freedom of religion may not be passed.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 ¬ß Micronesia, Federated States of US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. There are no registration requirements for religious groups. There is no religious education in public schools, but private religious schools are allowed so long as they also teach the curriculum established by the Department of Education. A small community of Ahmadiyya Muslims (~20 people as of 2017) have reported discrimination, including both the denial of government services and vandalism against their property. == Fiji == The constitution of Fiji establishes the freedom of religion and defines the country as a secular state, but also provides that the government may override these laws for reasons of public safety, order, morality, health, or nuisance, as well as to protect the freedom of others. Discrimination on religious grounds is outlawed, and incitement of hatred against religious groups is a criminal offense. The constitution further states that religious belief may not be used as an excuse for disobeying the law, and formally limits proselytization on government property and at official events. Religious organizations must register with the government through a trustee in order to be able to hold property and to be granted tax- exempt status. Religious groups may run schools, but all religious courses or prayer sessions must be optional for students and teachers. Schools may profess a religious or ethnic character, but must remain open to all students. Religion, ethnicity, and politics are closely linked in Fiji; government officials have criticized religious groups for their support of opposition parties. In 2017, the Republic of Fiji Military Forces issued a press release stating that Methodist leaders were advocating for the country to become \\"a Christian nation\\" and that this could cause societal unrest. Following the press release, Methodist leaders distanced themselves from their previous statements, and other religious leaders also affirmed the nonpolitical nature of their religious movements. Many Hindus of Fiji emigrated to other countries.Sussana Trnka (2002), Foreigners at Home: Discourses of Difference, Fiji Indians and the Looting of May 19, Pacific Studies, Vol. 25, No. 4, pp. 69-90 Several Hindu temples were burned, believed to be arson attacks, for example, the Kendrit Shiri Sanatan Dharam Shiv Temple.\\"Another Arson attack on Fiji's Hindu Temples\\", ABC Radio Australia, 17 October 2008\\"Time to speak up\\" , Fiji Times, 17 October 2008 While Hindus face less persecution than before, a Hindu temple was vandalized in 2017. Later that year, following an online post by an Indian Muslim cleric visiting the country, a significant amount of anti-Muslim discourse was recorded on Fijian Facebook pages, causing controversy. ==Kiribati== The constitution of Kiribati provides for the freedom of religion, although it also states that this freedom may be overruled in the interests of public defense, safety, order, morality, or health, or to protect the rights of others. Most government ceremonies open and close with Christian prayer. The government also provides small development grants to religious organizations among other NGOs.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 ¬ß Kiribati US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Any religious group representing more than 2 percent of the population (about 2160 people as of the 2015 census) must register with the government, although there are no penalties for failure to register. There is no standardized religious education program in public schools, but schools generally allow representatives of various faiths to provide religious education courses. Two islands in Kiribati, Arorae and Tamana, maintain a \\"one-church-only\\" tradition, refusing to build any religious structures other than a single church. According to officials, this custom is in deference to the Protestant missionaries that arrived on those islands in the 19th century. Residents of other religions on those islands are able to worship freely in their homes, and the government has received no reports of complaints about this policy. == Marshall Islands == The constitution of the Marshall Islands establishes the freedom of religion, although it provides that this freedom may be limited by \\"reasonable restrictions\\". The constitution further states that no law may discriminate against any person on the basis of religion.https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious- freedom/marshall-islands International Religious Freedom Report 2017 ¬ß Marshall Islands] US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. There are no requirements for religious groups to register with the government, but they may receive tax benefits if they register as non-profits. There is no religious education in public schools, but school events and government functions typically begin and end with a Christian prayer. According to the government, this is a longstanding practice that is widely accepted in the country. The government provides funding to private religious schools. The Ahmadiyya Muslim community in the Marshall Islands has reported that it faces difficulties interacting with the government, as well as harassment in general society. Representatives attributed these attitudes to prejudice against Muslims due to perceptions that Islam is linked to terrorism. == Nauru == The constitution of Nauru establishes the freedom of conscience and expression, although it provides that these rights may be limited by any law which is \\"reasonably required\\". Religious groups are required to register with the government in order to proselytize, build houses of worship, hold religious services, or officiate marriages. As of 2014, religious groups are required to have 750 members to register. According to local religious leaders, in practice the only activity which is restricted for unregistered groups is marriage officiation. Religious groups are allowed to operate private schools. In public schools, religious groups are allowed to provide religious studies courses once a week during school hours. Students are expected to attend courses pertaining to their chosen religious denomination; other students are expected to use the time as an independent study period. According to a 2017 US government report, there are no significant societal limits on religious freedom in Nauru. == New Zealand == There has never been a state church in New Zealand, although prayers are said in Parliament.http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/about-parliament/how-parliament- works/speaker/press-releases/48Speakpress150620071/mps-vote-to-retain-prayer The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 codified freedom of religion and belief in Section 15. Blasphemous libel is a crime in New Zealand, but cases can only be prosecuted with the approval of the Attorney-General and the defence of opinion is allowed: \\"It is not an offence against this section to express in good faith and in decent language, or to attempt to establish by arguments used in good faith and conveyed in decent language, any opinion whatever on any religious subject.\\" The only prosecution, in 1922, was unsuccessful.The King v. Glover (1922) GLR 185 In March 2019, two mosques were attacked by a white supremacist, killing 49 and injuring an additional 51. The attacks were condemned by general society and the government, which announced that it would be undertaking a royal commission of inquiry into the attacks. == Palau == The constitution of Palau establishes the freedom of religion and prohibits the government from taking any action to infringe upon it. It also states that the country has no state religion. Religious groups are required to register with the government as nonprofit organizations. Foreign missionaries are also required to apply for missionary permits from the Bureau of Immigration and Labor. Religious instruction is prohibited in public schools, but religious groups are allowed to request government funds to run private schools. According to US State Department reports, there have been no significant societal breaches of religious freedom in Palau. == Papua New Guinea == The constitution of Papua New Guinea establishes the freedom of religion and religious practice, provided that it does not infringe on the rights of others or public interest. There is no state religion, although the preamble to the constitution mentions \\"the Christian principles\\" the country is founded upon. Parliament sessions and most official government functions open and close with Christian prayer. Since 2016, the government has pursued programs to increase partnership between churches and the state, including subsidies to churches and the establishment of church councils to assist in local governance. Religious groups are required to register the government in order to hold property and obtain tax-exempt status. Foreign missionaries are allowed into the country on special work visas with lower fees than other visa categories. Churches operate roughly half of the educational and medical institutions in the country, and receive government subsidies to provide these services. Public schools provide one hour of non-compulsory religious education per week; in practice, few students opt out of these lessons. Government officials have discussed plans to make religious education compulsory, but as of the end of 2017 these were not implemented. Religious leaders have stated that religious groups are generally able to practice their religion without interference. However, there have been multiple incidences of Muslim refugees and asylum seekers being the targets of stabbings. Other Muslim residents of Papua New Guinea have not faced such attacks. ==Samoa== The constitution of Samoa guarantees the protection of freedom of religion. However, these laws are generally not enforced at the local level,Rev. Fepa'i Fiu Kolia, Secretary, National Council of Churches Samoa: The church and development, Samoan National Human Development Report, 2006 as many villages have an official religion and do not allow residents to practice other religions.International Religious Freedom Report for 2013, United States Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor While the courts generally rule in favour of those alleging that their religious freedom has been violated, few cases make it to court. In June 2017, a clause was added to the constitution making Christianity the state religion. Religious groups are not required to register with the government, but may do so in order to receive tax exemptions. Christian religious instruction is compulsory in schools. == Solomon Islands == The constitution of the Solomon Islands establishes the freedom of religion, although it also allows for this freedom to be curtailed when \\"reasonably required\\" by other laws.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 ¬ß Solomon Islands, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. All religious organizations are required to register with the government. The public school curriculum includes an hour of optional weekly religious education, with the content determined by the Solomon Islands Christian Association. Non-christian religious instruction is available by request. The government subsidizes schools and health centers operated by religious organizations, in addition to providing small grants to religious organizations. Leaders of minority groups in the Solomon Islands have reported no incidents of religious discrimination as of 2017. == Tonga == The constitution of Tonga establishes the freedom of religion, with the qualification that this freedom is not used to \\"commit evil\\" or to otherwise violate the law. The constitution forbids commercial transactions on Sundays in accordance with the Christian Sabbath, although the tourism industry is granted some exceptions from this rule.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 ¬ß Tonga, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Religious organizations are not required to register with the government, but may do so in order to receive tax exemptions, the right to issue legally recognized marriage certificates, and other privileges. Foreign missionaries may operate in the country without special restrictions. Public schools may choose to include up to an hour of religious education per week; students are required to attend religious education courses pertaining to the religion that they profess. Many religious organizations operate private schools. The government allows religious organizations to broadcast programming on TV Tonga and Radio Tonga, officially with the restriction that they must limit their messaging to be \\"within the limits of the mainstream Christian tradition\\". Despite this restriction, in the past the Bah√°'√≠ Faith community has televised programming, although the community has since discontinued this program. As of 2017, there have been no reports of the government denying requests for air time from any religious organization. == Tuvalu == The constitution of Tuvalu establishes the freedom of religion, although it allows this freedom to be limited by other laws. It establishes Tuvalu as an \\"independent state based on Christian principles, the Rule of Law, and Tuvaluan custom and tradition\\". The Ekalesia A Kelisiano Tuvalu, a congregational church, is officially the state church of Tuvalu, although in practice this just accords the church and its followers \\"the privilege of performing special services on major national events. Religious organizations whose adult membership comprises at least 2% of the population of Tuvalu are required to register with the government or face prosecution. Additionally, all religious groups, regardless of size, must register with and gain approval from the traditional elder councils (falekaupule) of any island on which they wish to publicly practice their religion. Groups not approved by the councils may face fines if they contain to host meetings. On some islands, the elder councils have issued proselytization bans. Representatives of religious minorities on the main island of Funafuti report that they are able to practice their faiths freely. On other islands they face greater obstacles, although most are still able to practice privately without disruption. The government has engaged in programs to foster tolerance of religious diversity, but minority groups assert that these programs have been insufficient in attaining their goals on the country's outer islands. == Vanuatu == The constitution of Vanuatu establishes the freedom of religion, and also states that the state is founded on a commitment to \\"traditional Melanesian values, faith in God, and Christian principles.\\" Religious groups are required to register with the government or face fines, but this law is not enforced in practice. Religious groups are allowed to establish private schools, and both private and public schools include optional religious education courses. Since 2016, high ranking members of the government have expressed the intent to define Vanuatu as a Christian country and to prohibit other religions from entering the country. As of the end of 2017, no actual legislation has been passed to this effect. ==References== Category:Religion in Oceania Oceania Category:Human rights in Oceania ","title":"Freedom of religion in Oceania by country"},{"id":"60258459","text":"The Sheriff of Medicine Bow is a 1948 American Western film directed by Lambert Hillyer and written by J.

Chow studies the structural and functional roles of modified nucleosides in RNA. So far, several hundred modifications have been found in RNA and Transfer RNA, but their contributions to structure and function have yet to be fully established. Chow develops the methodologies to incorporate modified nucleosides at specific points in RNA; in particular helix 69 of 23S ribosomal RNA. The pseudouridine modification helps to maintain fidelity during protein synthesis, but its exact role in regulating the function of a ribosome is unknown. They use inorganic complexes (such as platinum(II)) to examine the structure of nucleic acid. Chow has used fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to study drug-RNA interactions in an effort to inform the design of new antibiotics. Improved RNA binding ligands indicate that drugs have potential, and should be developed further. She developed assays to investigate aminoglycoside analogues. She is working on new anti-infectives that combat antimicrobial resistance. === Academic service and advocacy === Chow is an advocate for undergraduate research opportunities and diversity in the scientific community.

Gomes voted in favor of the 2017 Brazilian labor reform, and would vote against a corruption investigation into Rousseff's successor Michel Temer. ==References== Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian educators Category:Liberal Party (Brazil, 1985) politicians Category:Republicans (Brazil) politicians Category:Brazilian Pentecostals Category:Members of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil) from Rio de Janeiro (state) Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro Category:People from Nova Igua√ßu Category:Brazilian politicians of African descent Category:Brazilian women in politics ","title":"Ros√¢ngela Gomes"},{"id":"60258553","text":"The Egyptian Lever was an aspect of colonial Anglo-German relations in the late 19th century in which Germany would receive consent for their African colonial ventures from the United Kingdom in exchange for German support of the British occupation of Egypt. ==Background== Anti-European riots in Alexandria, as depicted by the Canadian Illustrated News After the French withdrawal from Egypt during the Napoleonic Wars an Ottoman-Albanian officer, Muhammad Ali seized control of Egypt through a three-way civil war, establishing himself as WƒÅli between 1805 and 1848. During his reign he let European contractors and managers enter the country, establishing a cordial relationship with the French. However, under his grandson, Abbas I (1848-1854) foreign policy was turned on its head, as Abbas turned to the French's British rivals in order to fight the Ottomans. By the 1870s and the rule of Isma'il Pasha, Egypt had fallen under corruption, mismanagement, increased European influence, and debt. Measures taken to postpone bankruptcy by the Khedive had failed, and the Commission of the Public Debt was established in 1876 to help take care of the nation's debt. Its members were nominated by France, Britain, Austria, and Italy. The same year, Egyptian revenue and expenditure was put under the surveillance of a French and British controller, establishing a period of Dual Control in Egypt. By the turn of the 1880s, important government or military posts were either controlled by Western Europeans, Turks, Circassians or Albanians. Along with the growing fiscal crisis, there was a rise in literacy, furthering public consciousness until it reached its boiling point when Colonel Ahmad Urabi launched a protest against European control. He was briefly imprisoned before being promoted as Minister of War in a newly-formed rebel government. This aggravated the British and French governments to the extent of threatening war. In June 1882, riots broke out in Alexandria against foreign nationals. With this, the British and French intervened with the British launching an invasion in July of that year. Urabi and his forces were defeated that September at the Battle of Tell El Kebir. ==The Egyptian Question== William Gladstone in 1879 ===Continued occupation=== With the immediate threat of revolt now taken care of, the debate over occupation started. As early as two days after the victory at Tell El Kebir Prime Minister Gladstone called for evacuation from Egypt. Gladstone and the radical wing of the Liberals supported evacuation and ending Dual Control through the elimination of French influence in Egypt, in order to prevent any further need to intervene. However, on the other side of the aisle officials such as the Earl of Northbrook deemed it necessary to occupy Egypt to secure passage to the Indian colonies. Things remained stagnant until a revolt flared up in the Sudan, (which had been previously ignored by London) in which the Khedivate's main forces were massacred in November 1883. In turn, London sent General Charles Gordon on a relief expedition in 1884, but it soon became clear that the British weren't going to withdraw from Sudan or Egypt any time soon.Lowe, pp. 54-56 ===June conference=== The French and British governments organized a conference to discuss the Egyptian Question, which was to be held on June 28, 1884. But throughout the springtime of that year, Foreign Secretary Granville tried negotiating with French Prime Minister Jules Ferry to reach an agreement before the conference date. While Ferry and Granville managed to come on agreement on a British evacuation timetable, the issue of finances and control over the Public Debt Commission let negotiations fall through. At the same time, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was introducing the idea of Franco-German collaboration, which Ferry used to go on the offensive on the opening day of the conference, blocking any British proposals. With this, Granville adjourned the conference on its first day, ending hopes of resolving the Question in the meantime.Lowe, pp. 58-59 ==Bismarck's offensive== Otto von Bismarck in 1884 ===Angra Pequena Dispute=== In 1883, the Bremen-born tobacco merchant Adolf L√ºderitz bought the anchorage at Angra Pequena in South West Africa and all land within an eight kilometer radius from Chief Josef Frederiks II for ¬£100 in gold coin and 200 rifles through his agent, Heinrich Vogelsang. Vogelsang continued to purchase land from Frederiks, buying the coast from Angra Pequena to the Orange River with a width of 20 \\"geographical miles\\" (Frederiks had thought that the German mile was the same as the English mile, but in fact was five times as long). L√ºderitz later bought the northern coast all the way up to the Kunene River. The venture had been officially protected by the German government on 24 April 1884, but on 29 May, the British Cape government announced the annexation of the Walvis Bay Enclave, incensing the Germans.Lowe, pp. 60-61 With this, the German ambassador in London, M√ºnster, threatened to cut German support in Egypt unless demands were met, with the same threats repeated by Herbert von Bismarck to Granville. Gladstone's cabinet decided in favor to give into German demands, but Bismarck rejected this. With Reichstag elections approaching, Bismarck purposely dug up a dispute in New Guinea to leverage support among the electorate, worsening Anglo-German relations. ===The Congo Question=== The conference of Berlin, as illustrated in \\"Illustrierte Zeitung\\" Since the invasion of Egypt in 1882 it was regarded among some British officials that the French had had the upper-hand in negotiations,Lowe, p. 58 this was furthered by the signing of the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of February 26, 1884. In it, the British recognized the dubious Portuguese claims of ownership of the area between 50¬∞ 12' and 8¬∞ south latitude in the area of the Congo River, which the British previously denied. The treaty was unpopular among the Parliament and British press, but more importantly France declared that it wouldn't be bound by the treaty (March 13) along with Germany (April 18), uniting the two nations against the United Kingdom. France instead proposed an international commission around the river. However, the new Franco-German alliance didn't get off without a hitch. The French were cold to Bismarck's idea of \\"reciprocal free trade in the territories which either power occupied on the West Coast of Africa,\\" and would only go forth with the plan if they were paid handsomely, mainly in Egypt, which the Germans weren't planning on doing. Even in August 1884 with the planned Berlin Conference on the Congo Question coming up in November, Ferry didn't want it to be used as \\"war machine against England\\" while the French minister in Berlin, the Baron of Courcel, had serious doubts of where the alliance was going.Lowe, p.64 The Conference opened on November 15, 1884 and largely got off without any interruptions, with most questions being answered seemingly before the actual opening. By then, the German government had promised to Courcel and the French to end occupation of any African territories disputed between Germany and France, freeing up tensions.De Leon, p. 126 The Conference (after squabbling over boundary lines) ended on February 26, 1885. The British had their demands mostly satisfied; gaining recognition of their control over Egypt along with the internationalization of the Congo, and placing them ahead of the French. The Germans meanwhile earned a direct stake in African affairs, while also gaining prestige as peacemakers. ===Wilhelm II's offensive=== However, the British would end up floating towards the French, now with their demands satisfied. Bismarck tried to keep conflicts minor with the British, but after Bismarck's dismissal at the behest of Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1890, the careful balance of power in Europe collapsed. The ambitious young Kaiser increased tensions with the British through the Anglo-German naval arms race and the First Moroccan Crisis; in which the Germans almost went to war with the French and British between 1905-06 over the Kaiser's recognition of Sultan Abdelaziz of Morocco, challenging French rule there. This demonstrated that the newly- formed Entente Cordiale was strong, and that an Anglo-French alliance wouldn't budge, effectively ending all chances of an Anglo-German alliance resurrecting and destroying the lever. == Post mortem == The Franco-German entente was never supposed to last. Bismarck leveraged France's anger at British policy \\"to squash Gladstone against the wall, so that he can yap no more.\\" Lowe, p. 62 The reasons for pushing London against the wall were numerous. If the Germans and French were successful in discrediting Gladstone and his liberal moral diplomacy, the threat of liberalism and social democracy in Germany would be eliminated. Gladstone as well was sympathetic to the Russians, which got in the way of Anglo-German overtures. By discrediting Gladstone, the Conservative Lord Salisbury could be brought back in office and Anglo-German cooperation restored. The policy of pressure was to \\"...gain England's goodwill - albeit a goodwill accompanied by gnashing of the teeth - by way of an alliance with France,\\" at which point the British would succumb to pressure, Germany would leave the French out in the sun, and relations restored between the two Germanic powers.Lowe pp. 62-64 In establishing this goodwill would also come greater opportunity to produce and export manufactured goods into the African interior that the British had been monopolizing. Daniel De Leon theorized that while Germany had a strong population and one of the highest birth rates in Western Europe, (in 1900 there was 4.93 children per German woman, compared to the United Kingdom's 3.53, and France's 2.8) this competitive edge was watered down due to mass emigration from rural areas. In De Leon's eyes Bismarck didn't want colonies for colonization's sake, but instead to foster economic growth; creating an industrial-capitalist class who could then create economic prosperity domestically, and keep would-be immigrants at home with a higher standard of living.De Leon, pp. 122-123 This was demonstrated through the creation of the Deutsche Ost-Afrika Linie in 1890, but also some years earlier by Bismarck's demands for credit from the Reichstag to establish steamship lines headed towards Asia, Africa, and Australia,De Leon, p. 121 directly conjoining the German and foreign markets. While only the Australian Line passed through the Reichstag, Bismarck was vehement about bringing German unity at home through this colonial process.De Leon, p.123 ==References== ==Further reading== * Craven, Matthew. \\"Between law and history: the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 and the logic of free trade\\".

In 1905, she relocated to Austria and, five years later, began to study anthropology at the University of Vienna. There, she studied under Michael Haberlandt, at the time a leading figure in the study and collection of folk art. Haberlandt and his son, Arthur Haberlandt, would go on to become supporters of the Third Reich and sever their ties with Jewish colleagues. Goldstern's research interests centered on the culture of the Western Alps. Focusing on the commune of Bessans, Goldstern created one of the first-ever ethnographic monographs about a community, writing about life and economy in a European mountain village. Her research began in 1912, and she spent the winter of 1913-1914 living in the community. While in Switzerland, she was supported by the ethnographer Arnold van Gennep. Her investigations markedly departed from typical scholarly opinion at the time, the latter portraying the culture of the Alps as idealized and unchanging. Of particular focus in her studies were small, handmade toy objects. Her first and last articles published in the Viennese journal of ethnography Wiener Zeitschrift f√ºr Volkskunde focused on toys. She donated many items she collected in the course of her work to the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna. The outbreak of World War I disrupted Goldstern's research. After continuing her studies at the University of Neuchatel, she completed her PhD at the University of Fribourg in 1920, under the direction of professor Paul Girardin. As a woman in a male-dominated field and in the increasingly antisemitic climate of Austria, Goldstern struggled to find a permanent position in her field. By the end of the 1920s, Goldstern stopped publishing and withdrew from her field research. In 1937, Goldstern's work, along with that of von Gennep, was featured in a display about Savoie at the Exposition Internationale in Paris. However, with the takeover of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, Jewish people were officially excluded from public life and subjected to antisemitic racial laws. Many of her family members fled Vienna, but Goldstern remained in the city. On June 14, 1942, Goldstern was deported to the Sobib√≥r extermination camp in Poland, where she was killed. == Posthumous exhibitions == In 2004-2005, the Vienna Museum of Ethnology displayed Goldstern's collection of Swiss folk art objects in an exhibition titled \\"Ur-Ethnographie.\\" The Mus√©e dauphinois and the Mus√©e savoisien held an exhibition about her and her work in 2007. == Publications == *Alpine Spielzeugtiere.

Alexander earned her master's degree and a doctorate before joining the faculty of the University of Florida where she earned the title of Distinguished Professor in the Department of Exercise and Sport Sciences. From there, she spearheaded a campaign to allow equal opportunities for female athletes to compete at the University of Florida in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. President Richard Nixon appointed her to sit on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition and she founded the Florida Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. She was inducted into the National Association of Sport and Physical Education's Hall of Fame in 1987 and the Milligan College Athletics Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2012, Alexander was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame. ==Personal life== Alexander was born in Madison County, Kentucky with an older sister Jacqueline and two older brothers, Larry and Denny. They were all raised as Methodists. Although her mother died when she was young, Alexander says both of her parents inspired her to become involved in sports. Alexander and her former husband Kern Alexander had four children together. Her son, F. King Alexander, is the president of Louisiana State University. ==Career== After graduating from Milligan College in 1960 with a degree in religious education and physical education, Alexander earned a master's degree at the University of Kentucky. She married in 1961 and moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky where she worked at the State Street Methodist Church. After her first son was born, the family moved to Louisville, Kentucky where she worked at Valley High School and earned her doctorate. She then taught at Indiana University, the University of Kentucky, and the University of Maryland before joining the University of Florida faculty. Alexander stated that she earned her job as an assistant professor at the University of Maryland because of her degree in educational psychology. As an assistant professor, she also taught nursing courses at the Walter Reed Hospital School of Nursing. Alexander eventually left the University of Maryland because her husband wanted to move and gained employment at the University of Florida. She eventually earned the title of Distinguished Professor in the Department of Exercise and Sport Sciences at the University of Florida and was named Chairman of the Department of Physical Education for Women. After receiving encouragement from several female teachers, Alexander and other female coaches approached Florida University athletic director Ray Graves with a request to fund women's sports. They then brought their proposal to the Faculty Committee on Intercollegiate Athletics who approved their budgeting plan. This marked the first time a Southeastern Conference school would fund women's sports. Starting in 1972, the women's intercollegiate athletic programs at the University of Florida (dubbed the ‚ÄúLady Gator Athletic‚Äù program) received a budget of $16,000 to start golf, tennis, swimming, track and gymnastics teams. After they proved to be successful, the following year they received $36,000. During the 1973‚Äì1974 season, every female team finished within the top of their respective sport in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The University of Florida female golf team finished fifth, the swimming team was eighth, and the tennis team ranked 10th. After that season, the budget was raised to $65,000. Alexander stated that while there was backlash from some male coaches who did not like sharing their budget and facilities with women teams, others were supportive and offered to coach. Alexander was not only active in female participation and equality in athletics at the University of Florida. She was also recruited to testify in front of the United States Congress about the importance of funding for female sports to help push Title IX. Title IX was a proposed federal civil rights law that stated no person should be excluded on the basis of sex. Even before the implementation of Title IX, Alexander served as the coordinator of the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women until 1981. Although she continued her job as a professor, she eventually decided to concentrate on fitness. President Richard Nixon took notice of her work and appointed Alexander to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, making her the first woman ever to be appointed to the council; she was subsequently reappointed by the three following presidents.

It registered her on 17 May 1806 as HMS Ranger but renamed her HMS Pigmy on 29 May 1806. Pigmy underwent fitting-out at Portsmouth between 12 June and 26 September 1806, apparently including conversion of her to a brig-rig. Lieutenant George Higginson commissioned Pigmy in 1807. He sailed her to the Pertuis d'Antioche on the Atlantic coast of France under orders to observe the movements of a French Navy squadron there. When he arrived on the evening of 4 March 1807 he discovered that the fifth-rate frigate was already on station. Pigmy was short-handed, her master was in bed, ill, and Higginson was exhausted from having been on deck for several days. He requested that he be permitted to anchor, but was ordered to lay-to off the √éle d'Ol√©ron. At 3:30 a.m. on 5 March 1807 Pigmy grounded. Higginson came on deck and directed the attempts to get her off, but she rolled on her side and bilged. At daybreak a nearby French fort observed her and began to fire on her. Pigmy‚Ä≤s crew were unable to escape and took to their boats, landing on shore where they were made prisoners of war. When Higginson was freed in 1814 he underwent a court martial for the loss of Pigmy. He was admonished to be more careful in the future. He had relied too much on the pilot, and had not come on deck after the watch had warned that shore lights suggested that Pigmy might be in danger. ==Citations and references== Citations References * * Category:1806 ships Category:Cutters of the Royal Navy Category:Brigs of the Royal Navy Category:Maritime incidents in 1807 Category:Shipwrecks of the Biscay coast ","title":"HMS Ranger (1806)"},{"id":"60259448","text":"Zoe Freney is a South Australian artist, arts writer and arts educator.

He is known for his research specifically on input devices and interaction methods, swipe-gesture-based touchscreen keyboards, eye-tracking interfaces, and models of human performance in human-computer interaction. His studies have contributed to both foundational models and understandings of HCI and practical user interface designs and flagship products. He previously worked at IBM where he invented the ShapeWriter text entry method for smartphones, which is a predecessor to the modern Swype keyboard. Dr. Zhai's publications have won the ACM UIST Lasting Impact Award and the IEEE Computer Society Best Paper Award, among others, and he is most known for his research specifically on input devices and interaction methods, swipe-gesture-based touchscreen keyboards, eye-tracking interfaces, and models of human performance in human- computer interaction. Dr. Zhai is currently a Principal Scientist at Google where he leads and directs research, design, and development of human-device input methods and haptics systems. == Education == Born in Harbin, China in 1961, Dr. Zhai received his bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in 1982, and his master's degree in Computer Science in 1984 from Xidian University. After that, he served on the faculty of the Northwest Institute of Telecommunication Engineering (now Xidian University) in Xi'an, China where he taught and conducted research in computer control systems until 1989. In 1995, received his PhD degree in Human Factors Engineering at the University of Toronto. == Career == From 2001 to 2007, Dr. Zhai was a visiting adjunct professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science (IDA) at Link√∂ping University, where he also supervised graduate research. He was a consultant at Autodesk in 1995 before joining IBM Almaden Research Center in 1996. From 1996 to 2011, he worked at the IBM Almaden Research Center. In January 2007, he originated and led the SHARK/ShapeWriter project at IBM Research and a start-up company that pioneered the touchscreen word-gesture keyboard paradigm, filing the first patents of this paradigm, publishing the first generation of scientific papers. In 2010, ShapeWriter was acquired by Nuance Communications, and taken off the market. During his tenure at IBM, Dr. Zhai also worked with a team of engineers from IBM and IBM vendors to bring the ScrollPoint mouse from research to market, and received a CES award and millions of users. From 2009 to 2015, Dr. Zhai was also the Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction. At the time he had been deeply involved in both the conference side and the journal side of publishing HCI research as an author, reviewer, editor, committee member, and papers chair. From 2011 till present, Dr. Zhai has been working at Google as a Principal Scientist, where he leads and directs research, design, and development of human-device input methods and haptics systems. Specifically, he has led research and design of Google's keyboard products, Pixel phone haptics, and novel Google Assistant invocation methods. Notably, Dr. Zhai led the design of Active Edge, a headline feature of Google Pixel 2, which enables the user to reach Google Assistant faster and more intuitively using a gentle device squeeze rather than the touch screen. == Work == Dr. Zhai researches primarily in human-computer interaction, and is currently working on the research, design and development of manual and text input methods and haptics systems. Besides text input and haptics, his other research interests include system user interface design, human-performance modeling, multi-modal interaction, computer input devices and methods, and theories of human- computer interaction. He has published over 200 research papers and received 30 patents. === Word-gesture keyboard === In 2003, Dr. Zhai and Per Ola Kristensson proposed a method of speed-writing for pen-based computing, SHARK (shorthand aided rapid keyboarding), which augments stylus keyboarding with shorthand gesturing. SHARK defines a shorthand symbol for each word according to its movement pattern on an optimized stylus keyboard. In 2004, they presented SHARK2 that increased recognition accuracy and relaxed precision requirements by using the shape and location of gestures in addition to context based language models. In doing so, Dr. Zhai and Kristensson delivered a paradigm of touch screen gesture typing as an efficient method for text entry that has continued to drive the development of mobile text entry across the industry. One of the most important rationales of gesture keyboards is facilitating transition from primarily visual-guidance drive letter-to-letter tracing to memory-recall driven gesturing. By releasing the first word-gesture keyboard in 2004 through IBM AlphaWorks and a top ranked iPhone app called ShapeWriter WritingPad in 2008, Dr. Zhai and his colleagues were able to facilitate this transition and brought the invention from the laboratory to real world users. === Laws and models of action === One of Dr. Zhai's main HCI research threads is Fitts‚Äô law type of human performance models. From 1996, Dr. Zhai, alongside his colleagues, has pursued research on ‚ÄúLaws of Action‚Äù that attempted to carry the spirit of Fitts' law forward. In the HCI context, Fitts' law can be considered the ‚ÄúLaw of Pointing‚Äù, while they believe there are other robust human performance regularities in action. The two new classes of action relevant to user interface design and evaluation that they have explored are crossing and steering. * ‚ÄúLaw of Pointing‚Äù: Refining Fitts‚Äô law models for bivariate pointing, 2003 * ‚ÄúLaw of Steering‚Äù: Human Action Laws in Electronic Virtual Worlds - an empirical study of path steering performance in VR, 2004 * ‚ÄúLaw of Crossing‚Äù: Foundations for designing and evaluating user interfaces based on the crossing paradigm, 2010 * Modeling human performance of pen stroke gestures, 2007 * FFitts' law: modeling finger touch with Fitts' law, 2013 * Modeling Gesture-Typing Movements, 2018 === Manipulation and navigation in 3D interfaces === Dr. Zhai started working on multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) input during his graduate years at the University of Toronto. In his Ph.D. thesis, he systematically examined human performance as a function of design variations of a 6 DOF control device, such as control resistance (isometric, elastic, and isotonic), transfer function (position vs. rate control), muscle groups used, and display format. He investigated people's ability to coordinate multiple degrees of freedom, based on three ways of quantification: simultaneous time-on-target, error correlation, and efficiency. === Eye-tracking augmented user interfaces === Dr. Zhai has been involved in two applications about eye-tracking augmented user interfaces, MAGIC pointing and RealTourist. In 1999, he worked together with his colleagues (Carlos Morimoto and Steven Ihde) at IBM Almaden Research Center and published a paper Manual and gaze input cascaded (MAGIC) pointing. This work explored a new direction in utilizing eye gaze for computer input, showing that the MAGIC pointing techniques might offer many advantages, including less physical effort and fatigue than traditional manual pointing, greater accuracy and naturalness than traditional gaze pointing, and possibly faster speed than manual pointing. In 2005, he developed and studied an experimental system, RealTourist, with Pernilla Qvarfordt and David Beymer. RealTourist lets a user to plan a conference trip with the help of a remote tourist consultant who could view the tourist's eye-gaze superimposed onto a shared map. Data collected from the experiment were analyzed in conjunction with literature review on speech and eye-gaze patterns. This inspective, exploratory research identified various functions of gaze-overlay on shared spatial material including: accurate and direct display of partner's eye-gaze, implicit deictic referencing, interest detection, common focus and topic switching, increased redundancy and ambiguity reduction, and an increase of assurance, confidence, and understanding. This study identified patterns that can serve as a basis for designing multimodal human-computer dialogue systems with eye-gaze locus as a contributing channel, and investigated how computer- mediated communication can be supported by the display of the partner's eye- gaze. === FonePal === FonePal is a system developed to improve the experience of accessing call centers or help desks. Known as \\"touchtone hell\\", voice menu navigation has long been recognized as a frustrating user experience due to the nature of voice presentation. In contrast, FonePal allows a user to scan and select from a visual menu at the user's own pace, typically much faster than waiting for the voice menus to be spoken. FonePal uses the Internet infrastructure, specifically Instant Messaging, to deliver a visual menu on a nearby computer screen simultaneously with the voice menu over the phone. In 2005 and 2006, Dr. Zhai and his colleague Min Yin at IBM Almaden Research Center published two papers about this project.

It is composed of 20 Sc atoms and 60 C atoms. Volleyballene term refers to a chemical compound that is a new type of 3D hollow molecule composed of carbon and transition metals, the name is a reference to fullerenes. It is the first buckyball compound to be spiked with scandium atoms. The main feature of these substances is that metal atoms are part of the framework and they are not deposited on the surface of the molecule. The incorporation of the metal atoms avoids their clustering and confers to volleyballene with sites to attach hydrogen mainly. The history of volleyballenes dates from its first prediction in 2016 by Jing Wang et al. A further study based on Density functional Theory (DFT) carried out by Tlahuice-Flores in the same year supports the prediction and provides with Infrared, Raman and UV spectra of the structure for its experimental detection. The structure is described as one Sc8 cluster holding 12 scandium atoms linked to six C10 units on each face. The chemical formula C60Sc20 is close related to C80 fullerene and it has a large HOMO-LUMO gap of 1.47 eV. Further hydrogenation of volleyballene reported a 70-H structure with an adsorption energy of circa -0.11 eV/H2. Moreover, it is expected that the adsorption-desorption reaction can be reached at ambient temperature.

Nayar is a recipient of the Lightborne Fellowship, Aaron Siskind Fellowship and an Art Matters Foundation grant. ==Works== Nayor creates large-scale photographs from sculptures constructed from found materials. After the construction is documented with a large-format camera, they are destroyed leaving only the photographic evidence. Her works intersect photography, sculpture and architecture, with projects exploring postcolonial narratives, memory, migration, informal architecture and dwellings, modernist architecture, and alternate and imagined modernities. She has been likened to a \\"tripped-out version of Samuel van Hoogstraten\\" and also compared to German artist Thomas Demand. Nayar's work has been reviewed in the New York Times, the New Yorker, the Hindu, and Artforum. Her work has been described both as exhibiting \\"a painstaking attention to detail\\" in certain pieces, and in others portraying a \\"sense of chaos.\\" Nayar's photographs are as much about the psychological as physical space. Her work explores the \\"relationship between memory and architecture while establishing a tension between the remembered and the real.\\" Her photographs have been described as providing \\"a topography of the mind itself.\\" Nayar‚Äôs more recent work blends multiple exposures from various stages of construction of a single model.

The former alerts the visually impaired of danger while the bars provide directional cues. However, \\"the paths have been constructed inconsistently,\\" in different times and places.Lupton, Ellen and Lipps, Andrea (2018). The Senses: Design Beyond Vision, p.136. Chronicle Books. .Pissaloux, Edwige and Velazquez, Ramiro (2017). Mobility of Visually Impaired People: Fundamentals and ICT Assistive Technologies, p.364. Springer. . Two years later, on 18 March 1967, Okayama City (western Japan) was the first place to install this invention for visually impaired people. The bricks' bright color is visible to people with low vision and cognitive impairments. Ten years later, thanks to its safety and navigation benefits, the use of tactile bricks became mandatory in the Japan National Railway. By 1985, it was mandated for broader use in Japan. ==Honours== In 2010, the Okayama Prefectural Association for the Visually Impaired registered March 18 as the Day of the Tenji Block with the Japan Anniversary Association. A monument for the Tenji Block birthplace was unveiled at the Harojima intersection in Naka Ward with a theme song, \\"Shiawase no kiiroi michi\\" (Yellow road of happiness). On 18 March 2019, Google Doodle honoured him by creating a short animation of a person with a probing cane being moved over tactile bricks. ==See also== *Universal design *Braille *Japanese Inventions ==References== ==External links== * Traffic Safety Research Center, Inc history (Japanese) * Biography \\"Happy yellow road\\" on YouTube (Japanese) Category:1926 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Date of death missing Category:Japanese inventors Category:People from Okayama Prefecture ","title":"Seiichi Miyake"},{"id":"60259739","text":"Runaway Romany is a 1917 American silent drama film directed by George W.

It was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on March 15, 1784 and is a member of the Virgo Cluster. NGC 4299 forms an interacting pair with NGC 4294. ==Physical characteristics== NGC 4299 has a fairly featureless disk with a very small, weak bulge and weak, asymmetric spiral arms plus numerous bright HII regions. At the center of NGC 4299 lies a nuclear star cluster with a diameter of ~. ===Truncated HŒ± disk=== NGC 4299 has a truncated HŒ± disk with the outer extent of the HŒ± having an irregular distribution except in the southwest where it forms a well-defined ridge. This appears to be the result of ram-pressure. ==Interaction with NGC 4294== As a result of a tidal interaction with NGC 4294, NGC 4299 has a disturbed optical and HI morphology, with asymmetric spiral arms, a small, weak bar and a high global star formation rate that appears to have been enhanced by ram-pressure. ==HI tail== Chung et al. identified that NGC 4299 has a one sided tail of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI). The tail points to the southwest and appears to be a result of ram-pressure or by a tidal interaction with NGC 4294. The tail has no optical counterpart and is oriented parallel to the HI tail found in NGC 4294. NGC 4299 appears to have a second tail pointing to the southeast that is much broader and lower in HI surface density than the main tail. ==Black Hole== NGC 4299 may harbor an intermediate-mass black hole with an estimated mass ranging from 7,000 (7*10^3) to 200,000 (2*10^5) solar masses. ==See also== * List of NGC objects (4001‚Äì5000) ==References== ==External links== 4299 7414 39968 Category:Virgo (constellation) Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 1784 Category:Spiral galaxies Category:Virgo Cluster Category:Interacting galaxies Category:Discoveries by William Herschel ","title":"NGC 4299"},{"id":"60259857","text":"Sheryl van Nunen, FRACP, is an Australian allergy researcher and Senior Staff Specialist in the Department of Clinical Immunology and Allergy at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, Australia, and Clinical Associate Professor at the Sydney Medical School - Northern, University of Sydney. Van Nunen is widely recognized for her work in 2007 identifying tick-induced mammalian meat allergy, which has increased in prevalence worldwide since then. In 2007 she was the first immunologist in the world to describe in a published paper the link between ticks and meat allergy. In 2018, after four years in development, van Nunen, in collaboration with a pharmaceuticals company and northern Sydney hospital Emergency Department, released a world-first freeze spray designed to be topically applied to ticks that have attached to humans. The spray kills ticks by freezing, rather than by the traditional method of removal using tweezers. Removing ticks by tweezers was found to have a significantly detrimental effect because tweezers squeeze toxins from the tick into the host and thereby significantly increase the allergen injected. A study released last year by van Nunen supports the growing consensus in Australia to kill the tick in situ rather than pull the tick out. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Australian immunologists ","title":"Sheryl van Nunen"},{"id":"60259871","text":"Gloria Osuna Perez (November 21, 1947 - June 25, 1999) was a Chicana artist.

The film depicts an astronaut infected by an alien crab-like creature, transforming him into a decapod crustacean/human hybrid and whose family has disappeared, both the result of a sinister conspiracy, for which he seeks vengeance. As of 2019, Chillon's second film has been selected for more than 300 international film festivals, and received over thirty awards and honours within the first two years of its release, including a M√©li√®s d'Argent. ==Synopsis== An astronaut explores the red dirt surface of an alien planet, where a crab-like creature reaches out of the soil and snips through his space suit. The infection that results transforms him into a cosmic decapod crustacean/human hybrid, with the head and claws of a crayfish or lobster. When he returns to Earth and tries to reconnect with his family, he discovers that he's been the victim of a sinister conspiracy, and takes revenge on those responsible for his family's disappearance. ==Cast== ;Actors *Federico Mart√≠n ‚Ä¢ Hombre-Cangrejo Man (\\"Crab Man\\" or \\"Crayfish Man\\") * ‚Ä¢ Astronaut *Jos√© Antonio Fuentes ‚Ä¢ Eric Gibraltar *Alexei Chillon ‚Ä¢ Son *Pilar Garc√≠a ‚Ä¢ Mother ;Voice * ‚Ä¢ Astronaut Voice ==Themes== Decapoda Shock shares a number of themes with Javier Chillon's first film, Die Schneider Krankheit: monstrous creatures resulting from \\"spatial\\" mutations or genetic manipulation, primarily derived from the science fiction B movies of the 1950s, the \\"atomic age\\". ==Production== ===Background and financing=== Less than a year after the release of Javier Chillon's very successful first short film, Die Schneider Krankheit (2008), a film that includes the \\"Hollywood look of the 50s\\" among its influences, Chillon was in Paris pitching a project called Outfinite, which would \\"pay tribute to sci-fi B movies and blaxploitation pics.\\" The film that became Decapoda Shock was ultimately self- produced by Chillon and his friend Luis Fuentes, who was also the cinematographer on Die Schneider Krankheit; as before, they relied on themselves and on their \\"very talented friends\\" for support: \\"we didn't have much money to spend (the final budget was around 1500‚Ç¨) so we made everything ourselves or called our friends for help.\\" The film was made for far less money than Die Schneider Krankheit, and was also less time-consuming; the director's love of the American B movie genre he imitates in these films happens also to be a way to get a film made on a limited budget. ===Development and writing=== Chillon wanted to \\"make something very different\\" from his previous film: \\"There were very different things that I wanted to try and, in a way, I wrote the script to accommodate all of them in a wacky story. I spent two years in the making of the film.\\" The director allowed himself more spontaneity and improvisation this time around, shooting without a fleshed out script: there was a \\"concise idea\\" but the story elements were added gradually over time, \\"on the fly\\". ===Filming=== Decapoda Shock was filmed between July 2009 and March 2011 in Guadalajara, Spain and Madrid, using an HDV camera, the Canon XL-H1, \\"because a friend owned it and we could borrow it any time we needed it during these two years.\\" Unlike the previous film, it was shot in colour, with orange the \\"main dominant\\" and also the main colour \\"for clothes, props, and so on\\", with a view to achieving \\"a kind of a comic book feeling.\\" The reason the film took so long to shoot was the range of \\"locations and different actors and the tight budget\\"; as an example, the first scene with the astronaut was shot in the course of one year using three different locations and three different actors (two of them for the hands). ==Release== Decapoda Shock had its premiere at in Paris on 9 September 2011. Its Spanish premiere was at the Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival in October. In October 2013, it was selected by Peter Kuplowsky at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival as a standout for the internet premiere of Fangoria Magazine's Screamers short film series. As of 2019, the film had been selected for more than 330 international film festivals. ===Home media=== Decapoda Shock and the director's first film, Die Schneider Krankheit, appear as bonus material on a Spanish-subtitled DVD of Daniel Cockburn's 2010 feature film, You Are Here. ===Online platform=== The film is available in its entirety on Vimeo. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== Robert Barry reviewed Decapoda Shock after seeing it at its premiere, saying it \\"mixed an inventive and articulate use of 'real' cinematography with the freedom of expression afforded by occasional intrusions of animation\\"; he voted for it in the audience prize in the festival's short film competition. A statement by the Fanonmenon jury awarding the Silver M√©li√®s to the film at the Leeds International Film Festival, gives the reasons why it was chosen: \\"Decapoda Shock was very creative and achieved a lot in a short space of time ‚Äì hilarious storytelling, strong pastiche techniques, multi-media visualisation and displayed a passion for the genre.\\" Adrienne Fox remarks that Chill√≥n taps into revenge films, spaghetti westerns, and exploitation films \\"with some screaming guitar to make a very memorable short.\\" Describing the film as coming \\"from way the heck out in left field\\", Paul Bowers suggests despite the plot making \\"only halfway\\" sense, it's \\"fine\\", and: \\"You'll be too enraptured by the horror-schlocky camera cuts, animated depictions of evil government cabals, and close-up shots of gored anonymous henchmen to put all the pieces together anyway.\\" Kate Williamson and Gem Carmella say the film does what it deliberately sets out to do: \\"confuse, shock, surprise, and most importantly, to make fun of itself\\"; initially, it passes itself off as \\"a badly made but serious film\\", but \\"its cheap feel is actually the result of a precise and perfectly executed set of technical considerations. Quite simply, you‚Äôve got to be pretty good at what you do to make something look this bad\\"; the film is a \\"master class in parody\\". Similarly, Samantha Hautea calls the film \\"a celebration of the absurd\\", \\"tying in various film clich√©s\\". Andrew Robertson said \\"once you have seen it you cannot help but measure every film you have ever seen against it ... The colour-palette is washed and perfect, and the high-drama and STAGGERING ACTION are such that one cannot help but reach for the hyphen and CAPS LOCK keys.\\" ===Accolades=== Decapoda Shock received over thirty awards and honours within the first two years of its release. ;2011 ;Awards *M√©li√®s d'Argent (Short Film), Fanomenon (EFFFF, presented at Leeds) *Fantastic Fest ‚Ä¢ Best Fantastic Short Film *Knoxville Horror (Knoxville) ‚Ä¢ Palm D'Gore (Jury award) *Cinefantasy (S√£o Paulo) ‚Ä¢ Best Science-Fiction Short Film * (Tapiales) ‚Ä¢ Best International Short Film *HorrorVision Spanish Horror-Trash Festival (Barcelona) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film ;Special mention *Festival de Cortos del Barb√∫ (Madrid) ;2012 ;Awards *Muestra de Cine de Terror, Fant√°stico y Gore (Alcantarilla) ‚Ä¢ Jury Prize ‚Ä¢ 2nd Audience Award *Mostra de Cinema Jove d'Elx (Elche) ‚Ä¢ Best Original Screenplay *Festerror (Cine de Terror y Fant√°stico Lloret de Mar) ‚Ä¢ 3rd Prize (Audience Award) *Caostica (Bilbao) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film (Bizarro section) *Festival de Cine Propio (Madrid) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film ‚Ä¢ Best Director ‚Ä¢ Best Screenplay *Festival of Nations (Lenzing) ‚Ä¢ Diploma *Open Cinema International Short and Animation (Saint Petersburg) ‚Ä¢ SKIF Special Award *Picknic Festival (Santander, Spain) ‚Ä¢ Best Digital Short Film *Offanengo (Offanengo) ‚Ä¢ Best International Short Film *Cortonogara (Nogara) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film *Abycine Cortos (Albacete) ‚Ä¢ Second Best Short Film *Post Mortem (Aguascalientes) ‚Ä¢ Best International Short Film *Buried Alive (Atlanta) ‚Ä¢ Mind Fuck Award ;Special mentions *Villanova in Corto, (Bagnacavallo) ‚Ä¢ Best Editing *Strawberry Shorts (Cambridge) *Riviera Maya Underground (Playa del Carmen) *Acocollona't (Girona) ;2013 ;Awards *Winter Shorts (Somerset, Kentucky) Foreign Special merit awards ‚Ä¢ Editing ‚Ä¢ Special Effects *U.S. Super 8 Film and Digital Video (Rutgers University) ‚Ä¢ Best Experimental Short Film *Peculiar (Peculiar, Missouri) ‚Ä¢ Most Peculiar Film Award *RATMA (River Aire Ten Minute Amateur) (Keighley) Sci-Fi Short Film Runner Up *Vagrant (Belarus) ‚Ä¢ Audience Award *British Horror (London) ‚Ä¢ Best Music *Suspiria (Alicante) ‚Ä¢ Best Fantastic Short Film *Certamen de Documental e V√≠deo Secuencia Cero (Vigo) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film ;Special mention *Fanterror (Asturias) ==References== ==External links== *Official online release on Vimeo *Official trailer on YouTube * Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish short films Category:Spanish science fiction drama films Category:Spanish science fiction horror films ","title":"Decapoda Shock"},{"id":"60260129","text":"Guy M. \\"Chalky\\" Williamson (July 14, 1890 ‚Äì December 8, 1930) was an American football player and coach.

Allen, living and working in Oakland, California, is a well-known California street and vert skater who had parts in H-Street videos, Shackle Me Not and Hokus Pokus. ==Skateboarding career== Allen is one of the nation‚Äôs first black professional skateboarders and one of the first to obtain a major corporate sponsorship. The first company to sponsor Allen was Gullwing Trucks. After placing third in an amateur contest in Santa Barbara, Vision Street Wear started to sponsor Allen. In 1989, Allen left Vision for the newly founded H-Street, alongside John Schultes, Colby Carter, Art Godoy, Tony Magnusson, Danny Way, Chris Livingston, Aaron Vincent, John Sonner, David Nelsen, Matt Hensley, Sal Barbier, and others. After H-Street, Allen started his own company with Mike Ternasky called Life, a name based on the De La Soul song called Living In a Fulltime Era. Soon after starting Life, Sean Sheffey joined the team. Two years later, Ternasky left Life for Plan B Skateboards. Life ended because Allen and the other members of the company weren‚Äôt happy being associated with H-Street, so they moved to Deluxe & called it Fun Skateboards. The team consisted of Jesse Niehaus, John Reeves, Keith Hufnagel and others. After Fun, Allen founded American Dream Inc with the artist Alyasha Moore, who Allen met in 1996. Moore designed a deck for Allen with Dexter Woods of the San Francisco chapter of the Black Panthers on it. In 1999, Allen founded and released a bamboo board on his new company Energy, standing for: Enough Nonsense Every Rider Get Yours. In 2007, H-Street reissued Allen's Ben Outlook board with art by Jeff Klindt. In 2008, Allen joined Creation skateboards at the age of 44. Additionally, Allen work as team manager at High Grade Distribution, the company that distributes Creation; however, as a stint as team manager, Allen went back to being strictly a Pro. Allen had a part in the 2016 documentary ‚ÄúThe Blackboard‚Äù. The film by Marquis Bradshaw, a Minot, North Dakota attorney and filmmaker, explored the issue of racial identity among African Americans through the lens of skateboarding. Allen is recognized for his unique variation on the Ollie North.

The Daredevils, the first women's football team of the era, featured one of the top players, Marcella Sanborn. The All Stars, the second women's team to be established, were later renamed the Hurricanes and then the Powderkegs. Two of the best players played for the Powderkegs, Carole Duffy and Linda Rae Hodge. By 1971, the WPFL had more teams and was divided into an East Division and a West Division. Buffalo, New York, Cleveland, Toronto and Pittsburgh were in the Eastern Division. The Western Division included Vancouver, British Columbia, Seattle, Washington, Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles and San Francisco. At some point during its existence, the WPFL also included teams from Bowling Green, Kentucky, Cincinnati, Ohio, Dayton, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan (the Detroit Cowgirls) The New York team was originally the New York Fillies but then became the NY Herricanes. The WPFL primarily played exhibition and charity games. However they also played during some halftime shows for NFL and CFL teams. There were actual games with these generally numbering four or five games a year. By 1973, all WPFL teams had disbanded except for the Toledo Troopers of Toledo, Ohio.

It involved the Mountain pine beetle, which has since spread across millions of acres of dense forest land. In addition, Spruce beetle populations have also been growing in the area in recent years and are further contributing to the existing outbreak. One of the main factors limiting bark beetle population growth is the temperature they can survive at and climate change has raised the average temperature in the region resulting in warmer winters and hotter, drier summers. This not only sped up the bark beetle reproduction process by providing more time per year for them to complete their developmental stages (at lower elevations they now often complete generations in one year instead of two), moisture stressing due to hotter temperatures also weakens the trees‚Äô defense against attacks by reducing resin production. Furthermore, forest management has also played a significant role as many forests in the region have very dense tree populations which facilitates faster spreading from tree to tree, as well as weakening tree defenses further by stressing them through excessive competition. While the culling of the region's trees brings significant economic ramifications, ecosystems are also being profoundly impacted: affected watersheds are experiencing changes to storage and flow, and such high rates of tree mortality alters the exchange of gases between the biosphere and atmosphere. Forest disturbances such as fires usually have nebulous and far-ranging ecological impacts, and bark beetle infestations are no exception. Though many species are benefiting from the infestation and are showing higher rates of occurrence in affected forests, many show the opposite effect. Most notably, elk are avoiding beetle-killed forests even though they traditionally adapt well to many disturbances and capitalize on them, representing significant decrease in elk habitat. The loss of transpiration from beetle-killed trees has also increase groundwater contributions to affected watersheds, which may affect riverine ecosystems, as well as human water usage, by altering factors like water supply and quality. Finally, though forests act as carbon sinks that absorb atmospheric carbon, the high rate of tree mortality not only reduces forests‚Äô capacity to absorb carbon, the large amounts of carbon already stored in beetle-killed trees is being released back into the atmosphere as they decompose. == Bark beetles == The bark beetle is an insect of the subfamily Scolytinae, containing around 6000 species, which live and reproduce in the inner bark of trees. Upon successfully entering a tree, they mate and the female starts to burrow a labyrinth of tunnels running along the inner bark called egg galleries where she then lays her eggs. The larvae themselves continue feeding and excavate further across the inner bark until they reach adulthood and leave to find a new host to start the process anew. While most species of bark beetles prefer dead or dying hosts, some attack live trees with the preference of mature and over-mature ones, as well as trees weakened by external factors. Due to the bark beetle's tendency to target trees that are weak, late in life, or dead, they play an important role in the forest's nutrient cycle by hastening the decomposition of old trees to make way for the new. However, more aggressive species can become pests as they amass large populations, attack healthier trees, and turn into an infestation. The only direct defense trees have against bark beetles is the resin released when sapwood is breached, which can fill in the tunnels they dig and encase the insects entirely. However, many species of bark beetle carry symbiotic fungal spores on their bodies which they use to inoculate the sapwood. This prevents resin from flowing into the tunnels and provides food for the larvae but also hampers the flow of water and nutrients through the tree and accelerates its death. == Management approaches == In response to the unprecedented spread of bark beetles in the Rocky Mountains and other parts of the western United States, the U.S. Forest Service formed the Western Bark Beetle Research Group (WBBRG) in 2007‚Äîa collaboration between scientists from three research stations that pools knowledge and resources to better understand the threat and eventually develop a strategy to combat it. In 2011, the WBBRG published the Western Bark Beetle Strategy. Self-described as ‚Äúa modest strategy that reflects current budget realities‚Äù, it concedes that not all affected and at-risk forest lands can be covered with the resources at the project's disposal. Instead, it mainly focuses its efforts on important areas and the general mitigation of any immediate effects on the populace. The order of priorities for the strategy are (1) human safety, (2) recovery, and (3) resilience. With up to 100,000 beetle-killed trees falling in the United States per day, a significant threat is being posed to road safety, power transmission, and water lines so the removal of dead trees near these essential amenities is of paramount importance to the project and will be completed before the other two priorities which are deemed less time-sensitive. Once public safety is ensured, recovery efforts will consist of the removal of dead trees which would fuel potential fires, cone collection for specific species, replanting trees to accelerate habitat restoration, and the treatment and prevention of noxious weeds with native species. Simultaneously, resilience will be achieved by thinning at-risk forests to reduce stress from competition and replanting forests in appropriate densities. The strategy prioritizes the restoration of affected forests over preventing the spread of bark beetles as current direct prevention techniques like pheromone baiting and pesticides are meant for small-scale scenarios and are not even close to being cost-effective at combating the extreme scale of the infestation. Though the strategy does implement some direct prevention techniques, they are rarely used and are primarily for protecting high value trees and maintaining the aesthetic appeal of important tourism sites. Despite the U.S. government's implementation of this strategy, it remains a stop-gap measure as no solution yet exists. However, scientists have been making strides towards better understanding the problem. Professor Diana Six at the University of Montana, whose work on forest entomology and pathology has received national attention, has been studying tree species that survive bark beetle outbreaks and her recent findings suggest that survivorship is genetically based and can be inherited. In an interview, she claims that past management strategies focus on resilience against bark beetles rather than adaptation. Instead, she proposes that the long-term sustainability of our forests relies on their adaptation to threats like bark beetles and drought, and that identifying the genetic markings that allow certain tree species to survive the current infestation may yield crucial information that can inform the development of future management approaches that support forest adaptation. ==See also== *Beetle kill in Colorado == References == Category:Environmental disasters in the United States Category:Effects of climate change ","title":"Rocky Mountain bark beetle infestation"},{"id":"60260348","text":"Karl Nissen (February 27, 1879 ‚Äì May 14, 1920) was a Norwegian pianist, teacher, music journalist, and conductor.

He also painted oils in a variety of genres. ==Biography== ===Early life=== He was born to a family of German descent. After attending the public schools, he went to work as a decorative painter in mansions and on ships. In 1874, he was able to begin formal art studies with De Scott Evans, who specialized in still-lifes.Biography by Thomas B. Parker @ the RoGallery. Shortly after, he became one of the first members of the \\"Art Club\\", founded by Archibald Willard.Encyclopedia of Cleveland History He also spent a brief period at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Portrait of his wife, Mary Upon returning he met a painter newly arrived in Ohio from Massachusetts, Willis Seaver Adams, and they became associates. When Adams helped create the Cleveland Academy of Fine Arts, he had Bacher appointed to the governing board. About this time, he also began to study etching with Sion Wenban (1848-1897), an artist from Cincinnati. ===Years abroad (much of 1878-88)=== In 1878, he accompanied Adams to Europe for studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich and, later, with an introduction from Wenban, he studied with Cincinnati-born artist Frank Duveneck, whom he would accompany to Florence and Venice, where they established a studio. Once they were settled, he brought his etching equipment there and became Duveneck's teacher. They produced some of the earliest examples of modern monotypes. While there, he became friends with James McNeill Whistler and they shared etching techniques. They would continue to visit each other until Whistler's death. In 1908 he published the memoir, Whistler in Venice, originally a serial in The Century Magazine. Bacher was most highly regarded for his etchings, many of them depicting scenes from his early years in Cleveland. He exhibited throughout Western Europe and, in 1881, he was elected a member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers.Whistler: The Etchings @ the University of Glasgow He returned home in 1883 and opened a studio. Shortly after, he joined with Joseph DeCamp to operate a summer sketching class in Richfield, Ohio. He also began to paint more oils, but was unsuccessful in selling them or other items from his earlier period. As a result, he once again left for Europe; this time, Paris, where he took some classes at the Acad√©mie Julian. He was there for only a short time before continuing on to Venice, where he shared an apartment and studio with Robert Frederick Blum and Charles Ulrich. ===Back in the USA (1888-1909)=== By 1888, Bacher was back in the United States and had settled in New York City after marrying a former art student from Cleveland, Mary Holland. They had four sons. He was a much sought-after illustrator, both for books and magazines, such as Scribner's and McClure's. In 1901, he became one of the founding members of the Society of Illustrators. He won a silver medal for his etchings at the St. Louis Exposition of 1904 and was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1906. He spent the last years of his life in Bronxville and died there in 1909, from an undisclosed illness. ==Selected works== File:Jacob Riis - At the Cradle of the Tenement.jpgIllustration for How the Other Half Lives by Jacob Riis File:Arachne MET DP872951.jpgArachne File:Ponte del Pistor, Venice by Otto Henry Bacher, etching.jpgPonte del Pistor, Venice File:Bacher- Restaurant.jpgWomen in a Restaurant ==References== ==External links== * More etchings by Bacher @ the Harvard Art Museums * The Otto Bacher Papers @ the Smithsonian Archive of American Art Category:1856 births Category:1909 deaths Category:American etchers Category:American illustrators Category:Artists from Ohio ","title":"Otto Henry Bacher"},{"id":"60260617","text":"Juiceboxxx is an American rapper, producer, and label-owner based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ==Music== Juiceboxxx released his first album in 2005: R U There God??

He came to particular attention for giving evidence against the leader of Lincolnshire Council, who was subsequently jailed.

He graduated with a science degree. He has worked in the public sector since the 1980s. ==Lincolnshire Councils== Bowles was Chief Executive of Lincolnshire County Council from 1998. He subsequently revealed that the Conservative council leader, Jim Speechley, had been using his position to manipulate the route of a new by-pass to increase the value of his land. His evidence led to Speechley being jailed for 18 months. Bowles then had a \\"strained\\" relationship with the new Conservative leader, Ian Croft. On 3 September 2004 Bowles was heckled at a council meeting, as he defended his actions and described the past period as \\"characterised by smear innuendo and lies\\" with \\"bullying and a climate of fear\\". With his tenure at the county council due to come to an end shortly, Bowles then accepted a position as chief executive of West Lindsey District Council, in north Lincolnshire, to start in September 2004. In March 2006 councillor Croft (who had resigned as leader of Lincolnshire County Council) was banned from being a county councillor for 15 months for \\"breaching the code of conduct for people in public office\\" during his revenge campaign to get rid of Bowles. ==United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust== After three years as chair of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Bowles resigned in July 2009 after being threatened with suspension for refusing to commit the Trust to meeting national waiting targets. Bowles described the situation as \\"a substitution of bullying for performance management and an obsession with targets rather than safety\\". ==Anglesey County Council== In September 2009 Bowles became a 'troubleshooter' to sort out the in-fighting on Isle of Anglesey County Council. Bowles was imposed on the council, as an interim managing director, by the Welsh Government and paid via a recruitment company. At ¬£1,160 a day, he became Wales' most expensive public sector worker at the time. Bowles sacked two members of the ruling council group, and the head of education and leisure was forced to resign. ==Other roles== In 2012 Bowles stood as a Campaign to Stop Politicians Running Policing candidate for the position of Lincolnshire Police and Crime Commissioner. He was narrowly defeated by another Independent candidate, Alan Hardwick. Bowles is a member of the Audit Committee of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.

The Rockwall Trail is a scenic 55 kilometre (34 mile) traverse of alpine passes, subalpine meadows, hanging glaciers, and limestone cliffs, in some places in excess of above the trail. ==Geology== Mount Gray is composed of Ottertail limestone, a sedimentary rock laid down during the Cambrian period and pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==History== \\"Mount Cambria\\" or \\"Cambria Peak\\" were names originally proposed in 1918 for the mountain by Charles Doolittle Walcott because it was formed entirely of Cambrian rocks. However, the mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada to honor William J.

Her work has been showcased in various exhibitions in India, France and the UK. She lives and works in the Adivasi Lok Kala Academy, Bhopal. == Early life and career == Lado Bai was born in the Badi Bawadi village of Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh in the Bhil tribal community. At a very early age, she moved to Bhopal with her family to be engaged as manual labourers in the building of the iconic Bharat Bhavan. She got married and continued to work in the building complex and also painted to de-stress after a day's work. Lado Bai started her work alongside Bhuri Bai. Her art reflects the spirituality and animism of her community. For years, she could not pursue her art because of financial constraints. Her luck turned when she was discovered by the famous Indian artist Jagdish Swaminathan. Swaminathan encouraged her to work for the Adivasi Lok Kala Academy where she had the opportunity to transfer images of festivals, rituals and animals from wall to paper. == Bhil art == The Bhil Tribe are indigenous, being the Second largest Tribal Community in India. Art is Integral to the Bhil Community. The rich texture of their paintings generally depict nature and Adivasi Style that is their legacy. Bhil artists are just starting to be internationally recognized. They paint the simple human joys of birth and other ceremonial occasions like harvests that are often forgotten in our modern society. The art of the Bhils along with that of other tribal groups reminds us what the simple pleasures in life are. == Inspiration and style == Lado Bai's works are characteristic for their formal simplicity, heightened by her use of dots. Nature, spirituality and animism find dominance in her canvases. She is inspired by the stories told by elders in her community, myths and rituals of the tribe and the flora and fauna she encounters in her everyday life. Bai creates art reflects the flora and fauna of her environment along with the customs and festivals of her tribe. Her work is informed by the timeless tradition of Bhil painting, portraying ritualized depictions of Pithora, the Bhil folklore god. Lado Bai's inspirations came from the stories told her elders, and her personal faith that the gods will be pleased by her Art. She belongs to a community famous for their ritualistic murals of god Pithora, a centuries old tradition that was primarily a man's domain. Lado Bai carries forward this timeless tradition while at the same time, developing in a strong individual visual language. Lado Bai is among such tribal artists who are keeping their traditional identity alive in their works and lives. Her paintings reflect all the aspects of a Bhil life. She seems completely at ease while working with fine quality brush and canvas in place of a piece of jute which she would use before. Today she is working at Adivasi Lok Kala Academy in Bhopal and is contented with her job as an artist. In Lado Bai's work, nature, spirituality and animism of her community are dominant themes. With the encouragement and support of late Indian artist Jagdish Swaminathan, she has developed a contemporary language of traditional artforms. The main motifs in her works are the animal kingdom and Bhil rituals and festivals. Her works demonstrate an episode of a larger story from the folklore. \\"We prepare for a whole night before starting to paint. There are a lot of rituals that I have shown in my work, and this is exactly how the Bhil culture is,\\" says Bai. == Awards and ceremonies == Lado Bai is the Master Ojas Art Awardee. The Ojas Art Award 2017, instituted by Ojas Art Gallery, was awarded this year to a couple of Bhil artists from Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh at the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF) 2017. Lado Bai was awarded under the Master Artist category, winning a sum of Rs 51,000. She belongs to the early group of artists of this genre and was among the first bheel artists, besides bhuri bai, to have worked directly with J Swaminathan. == Family == For Lado Bai, whose family joined her in painting the canvas, the elements of the picture are drawn from the deep collective memory of her ancestors, which she has evoked in the Pithora tradition. She points to the peasants gathering harvested maize and millet, the tents and marquees of the marketplace, and the bullock carts laden with produce making their way to the bazaars. Her Daughter Anita assisted her in painting murals. == Select exhibition == Satrang, Ojas Art Gallery, New Delhi, 2017 == Select collections == *The Indira Gandhi National Center for the Arts, New Delhi *Saffronart, Mumbai *National Handicrafts and Handlooms Museum, New Delhi *Sutra Gallery, Wisconsin, United States ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Bhil Category:Women artists from Madhya Pradesh Category:ArtAndFeminism 2019 Category:Religious artists ","title":"Lado Bai"},{"id":"60261323","text":"Temiang is a state constituency in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, that has been represented in the Negeri Sembilan State Legislative Assembly. ==References== * Category:Negeri Sembilan state constituencies ","title":"Temiang (state constituency)"},{"id":"60261327","text":"Mambau is a state constituency in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, that has been represented in the Negeri Sembilan State Legislative Assembly. ==References== * Category:Negeri Sembilan state constituencies ","title":"Mambau (state constituency)"},{"id":"60261347","text":"Kota is a state constituency in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, that has been represented in the Negeri Sembilan State Legislative Assembly. ==References== * Category:Negeri Sembilan state constituencies ","title":"Kota (state constituency)"},{"id":"60261352","text":"Jan Peters is an engineer, consultant and campaigner for diversity in STEM.

She is the third of four children in her family, which is of Yemeni extraction. Her mother Ziona, is a special education teacher, and her father, Benny, is a printer. Her mother's family came to Israel in the 1950s from Yemen. Her father's family arrived from Sana'a in 1882. From a young age, Keissar experienced bullying and discrimination because of her dark skin color, and according to her, she came to understand that she is belongs to a low social status group. During her compulsory army service, she worked as an infantry instructor, and began to develop her Mizrahi identity. After an extended trip to South America and some time in New York, Keissar returned to Israel, and began working as a cultural reporter for a local Jerusalem newspaper. In 2009, she moved to Tel Aviv, and began writing for Ha'ir. In 2017, Keissar gave birth to a daughter. == Education == Keissar completed her bachelor's degree in the Humanities at the Open University in 2008. In 2010, she completed an MFA in screenwriting at Tel Aviv University. == Career == Keissar started writing poetry at the age of 32, after years of reporting and screenwriting. She viewed poetry as white, elitist and unrelated to her. But after finding some poems on newspaper clippings, she became inspired. She began reading such poets as Sami Shalom Chetrit, Yona Wallach, Yehuda Amichai, Dahlia Ravikovich, Vicki Shiran, Erez Biton, and Miri Ben Simchon - and started writing her own works. Keissar is especially concerned with changing the perception that poetry is something generally out of reach, and believes it belongs to us all. According to Keissar, poetry belongs in our homes and in the streets, not on high shelves in libraries. She says poetry that is not accessible is futile and serves no purpose. In 2017, Israel's ministry of education began including Keissar's poems in the literature curriculum, and her work is also studied in Arab- Jewish culture studies at Ben-Gurion University and Tel Aviv University. === Ars Poetica === Keissar found the typical Israeli poetry readings and spaces to be condescending and alien. In January 2013, she established poetry nights called Ars Poetica - which in Hebrew is a play on the latin phrase meaning \\"the art of poetry\\", whereas the word \\"Ars\\" also a commonly used racist epithet used towards Mizrahim. Keissar wanted to reclaim the word, and make it into a source of pride. Her original intention was to hold a single event, but it was so successful, that it became a monthly popular event. Keissar claims that the Israeli literature canon is Ashkenazi-Western-masculine, and that feminine and Mizrahi art is marginalized and excluded from the consensus. Ars Poetica, therefore, creates a space for the marginalized to express themselves and their art publicly. Ars Poetica, according to Keissar, is a platform for social and political discourse on gender, social identity, and Israel's ethnic rift, which are generally absent from poetry meets, and from Israeli culture as a whole. The evenings are intentionally Mizrahi - including Mizrahi music, belly dancing, spoken word, and a newly formed sub-culture of Mizrahi poets, some of whom have become well-known and won national awards, such as Roy Hasan, Tehila Hakimi, Mati Shemoelof, and others. According to some culture critics, Ars Poetica has given rise to a new art stream that has shaken the world of poetry, literature and culture in Israel. Ha'aretz culture section has called Keissar the most influential poet working in Israel today. === Publication and appearances === Keissar's poems have appeared in a wide variety of newspapers, magazines and journals in Israel and around the world, as well as in several anthologies and multiple websites. Her work has been translated into at least eight languages. Keissar also appears and lectures in festivals and educational institutions. Her most noted poem, \\"I Am the Mizrahi\\", which has been integrated into the national curriculum, expresses the core of her artistic thesis: Don‚Äôt tell me how to be Mizrahi/Even if you‚Äôve read Edward Said/Because I‚Äôm the Mizrahi/Who‚Äôs not afraid of you/Not in admissions committees/ Not in job interviews/And not in airports/ Even though you ask me/Quite a few questions/With accusing eyes/ Searching me for Arab traces/How long did you come here for/And how much cash have you got/You didn‚Äôt come here to work, right?/You didn‚Äôt come here to work, right? == Books == Keissar has published three collections of her poetry: * \\"Black on Black\\" ◊©◊ó◊ï◊® ◊¢◊ú ◊í◊ë◊ô ◊©◊ó◊ï◊® (Guerrilla Tarbut, September 2014) * \\"Loud Music\\" ◊û◊ï◊ñ◊ô◊ß◊î ◊í◊ë◊ï◊î◊î (Ars Poetica, June 2016) * \\"Chronicles\\" ◊ì◊ë◊®◊ô ◊î◊ô◊û◊ô◊ù (Ars Poetica, 2018) Editor: * Ars Poetica, First Anthology - ◊¢◊®◊° ◊§◊ï◊ê◊ò◊ô◊ß◊î, ◊í◊®◊ô◊ú◊î ◊™◊®◊ë◊ï◊™, May 2013 * Ars Poetica, Second Anthology - ◊¢◊®◊° ◊§◊ï◊ê◊ò◊ô◊ß◊î, ◊ê◊°◊ï◊§◊î ◊©◊†◊ô◊ô◊î December 2013 == Awards == * 2013 - Pessach Millin Award, from the Israeli Writers Association * 2015 - Ministry of Culture Award for emerging poets * 2015 - Bernstein Literature Award, for Black on Black * 2015 - \\"Women at the Front\\" award, from Saloona magazine.

The process of government formation can sometimes be lengthy. For example, following the 2013 German federal election, Germany engaged in 85 days of government formation negotiations, the longest in the nation's post- war history.

This occurred most notably in 2010‚Äì11, when Belgium operated without a government for 541 days.
