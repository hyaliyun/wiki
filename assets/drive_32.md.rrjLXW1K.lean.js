Interviews for various positions within the mine are set to take place in the early months of 2012. The silica quartz and other minerals came from the erosion of the Scottish landmass. They were deposited on the shore of a tropical sea on Jurassic shales and limestones in the middle of the Cretaceous period, 93 million years ago, at the same time the chalk cliffs of Dover were forming. The sandy sediment was reworked by frequent changes to sea level. Natural winnowing processes sorted the quartz from other minerals, separating grains of similar size. For 60 million years this was protected from erosion by a basalt covering from the Mull volcano. Near the loch shoreline today are fossil oysters, or Gryphaea, that lived on the shoreline of a tropical sea here 200 million years ago.The Evolution of Gryphaea, Stephen Jay Gould, 1980.

Carillo had been married at the age of 13 and widowed by 21. She founded Mexico's first feminist leagues in 1912, including the League of Rita Cetina Gutierrez () in 1919. In 1923, Carillo became Mexico's first woman state deputy, and elected to the Chamber of Deputies Due to Carillo's contributions to Mexican government and history, she was officially decorated as a \\"Veteran of the Revolution.\\" Carillo's tireless dedication to the revolution and women's movement earned her the nickname \\"The Red Nun\\" (). ==Feminist leagues== ===1912-1922=== Elvia Carrillo Puerto is credited with starting numerous feminist leagues in Mexico, the most prominent being the Rita Cetina Gutiérrez League, named after one of Yucatán's most prominent educators. The feminist leagues focused on many tasks to promote women's rights, beginning in Mérida, where the first were founded in 1912, and eventually spreading through Southeastern Mexico, into Central Mexico in later years. The organization led a campaign against prostitution, the use of drugs, alcoholism, superstition and fanaticism. In attempts to uplift women, the Liga Rita Cetina Gutierrez, founded in 1919, often gave talks on child care, economics and on hygiene for poor women. The league inspected schools and hospitals, and helped to establish a state orphanage. Through the feminist leagues which Carillo founded, family planning programs were instituted with legalized birth control, the first in the Western Hemisphere. Elvia believed large families were a barrier to a better life for the poor and distributed literature by Margaret Sanger, who would later go on to found the American Birth Control League, later known as Planned Parenthood, material Sanger could not distribute in the United States for legal reasons. The leagues also set up prenatal and postnatal care for women. ===1923-1925=== Carillo is noted as having devoted herself full-time to touring Southeastern Mexico with the goal of organizing Mayan women into leagues and preparing them for civic responsibility. The leagues would identify women of special aptitude and train them to fill elective posts in the city and state government. Carillo, after her brother and governor Felipe permitted women the right to vote and hold office, was elected in 1923 to the Yucatán legislature, Mexico's first female member of state legislature. Carillo won the election by an overwhelming 5,115 votes. While a member of government, Carillo promoted the issue of land reform, proposing plans that would provide campesinos with farms capable of sustaining their families. In doing so Carillo organized local chapters of women into Gualbertista Central Agrarian Communities for Females, named after her brother Gualberto, a senator and land reform activist. In 1924 as women's rights were advancing, Felipe was assassinated. Felipe's death signaled a change in the local government, as well as in women's rights. While permitting women's rights in Yucatán, he had not been able to have those rights reflected in the constitution of Mexico; after his death those rights were revoked by the incoming leadership of Juan Ricardez Broca. With a new government in power, women were removed from positions in municipal and state government offices, women's suffrage was revoked, and social programs through women's leagues were no longer supported. Carillo moved to San Luis Potosí, the new center of the women's rights movement, following Felipe's death. In 1925, Carillo was elected to the national Chamber of Deputies as a representative of San Luis Potosí; she was however denied the seat due to suffrage and office-holding being restricted to males. While local governments had permitted such roles, they were still not recognized nationally. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Birth control activists Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) Category:Mexican feminists Category:Mexican feminist writers Category:Mexican people of Maya descent Category:Mexican socialists Category:People of the Mexican Revolution Category:Politicians from Yucatán (state) Category:Mexican women's rights activists Category:Women members of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) ","title":"Elvia Carrillo Puerto"},{"id":"17291212","text":"The Beretta 682 (also known as the S682, 682 Gold and currently 682 Gold E) is a competition grade over-under shotgun. It is manufactured, marketed, and distributed by Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro Beretta, in Gardone Val Trompia, Italy. The 682 comes in various grades for sporting clays, trap and skeet shooting. It is distributed in the UK by GMK Ltd, and in the United States by Beretta USA. ==Versions== There are two primary versions of the action of the Beretta 682 shotgun. The first version of the action is the original version, designated by a model number such as S682305T, and made at least through 1994. These earlier models are known as \\"wide\\" or \\"large\\" frame 682s. At some point, Beretta dropped the \\"S\\" from the front of the 682 model number, narrowed the receiver, introduced a new choke system, and reduced the barrel weight as well. This new model is consistent in width (or \\"narrow\\") with the 686 and 687 lines. The wood components from a current narrow 682/686/687 [1.525 inches, 38.7 mm] will not fit on an older S682 wide receiver [1.585 inches, 40.3 mm] shotgun; replacement stocks for wide 682 shotguns need to be custom made at this point. Other than serial number lookup for production year, measurement of the frame size is the width measured in front of the breech across the recoil shoulders. The older and newer models share many of the same parts, and barrel sets from narrow 682 shotguns can be used without issue in the wide S682 shotgun. However, there is only a small chance that a new model 682 barrel with drop in place and work properly on an older wide frame S682. Obviously, there will be a very small lip present where the narrow barrel doesn't exactly match the wide receiver. One of the most common issues with simply dropping an unfitted barrel into a S682 is that the ejectors may not work / be times properly. The primary reason given for the receiver design changes are generally thought to be related to weight savings for Olympic competition shotguns, such as the S682 and subsequent 682/686/687 models. ==References== ==External links== *Beretta USA Product Catalog *Beretta Over and Unders / Side by Sides Instruction Manual *Beretta 682 Gold E - ratings and reviews 682 Category:Double-barreled shotguns of Italy ","title":"Beretta 682"},{"id":"17291216","text":"Ram Kinkar Upadhyay is a noted scholar on Indian scriptures and a recipient of Padma Bhushan in 1999.

Photographic interpretation is “the act of examining photographic images for the purpose of identifying objects and judging their significance” (Colwell, 1997). This mainly refers to its usage in military aerial reconnaissance using photographs taken from reconnaissance aircraft and satellites. The principles of image interpretation have been developed empirically for more than 150 years. The most basic are the elements of image interpretation: location, size, shape, shadow, tone/color, texture, pattern, height/depth and site/situation/association. They are routinely used when interpreting aerial photos and analyzing photo-like images. An experienced image interpreter uses many of these elements intuitively. However, a beginner may not only have to consciously evaluate an unknown object according to these elements, but also analyze each element's significance in relation to the image's other objects and phenomena. == Elements of interpretation == === Location === : There are two primary methods to obtain a precise location in the form of coordinates. 1) survey in the field by using traditional surveying techniques or global positioning system instruments, or 2) collect remotely sensed data of the object, rectify the image and then extract the desired coordinate information. Most scientists who choose option 1 now use relatively inexpensive GPS instruments in the field to obtain the desired location of an object. If option 2 is chosen, most aircraft used to collect the remotely sensed data have a GPS receiver. === Size === : The size of an object is one of the most distinguishing characteristics and one of the more important elements of interpretation. Most commonly, length, width and perimeter are measured. To be able to do this successfully, it is necessary to know the scale of the photo. Measuring the size of an unknown object allows the interpreter to rule out possible alternatives. It has proved to be helpful to measure the size of a few well-known objects to give a comparison to the unknown-object. For example, field dimensions of major sports like soccer, football, and baseball are standard throughout the world. If objects like this are visible in the image, it is possible to determine the size of the unknown object by simply comparing the two. === Shape === : There is an infinite number of uniquely shaped natural and man-made objects in the world. A few examples of shape are the triangular shape of modern jet aircraft and the shape of a common single-family dwelling. Humans have modified the landscape in very interesting ways that has given shape to many objects, but nature also shapes the landscape in its own ways. In general, straight, recti-linear features in the environment are of human origin. Nature produces more subtle shapes. === Shadow === : Virtually all remotely sensed data are collected within 2 hours of solar noon to avoid extended shadows in the image or photo. This is because shadows can obscure other objects that could otherwise be identified. On the other hand, the shadow cast by an object act as a key for the identification of the object as the length of the shadow will be used to estimate the height of the object which is vital for the recognition of the object. Take for example, the Washington Monument in Washington D.C. While viewing this from above, it can be difficult to discern the shape of the monument, but with a shadow cast, this process becomes much easier. It is a good practice to orient the photos so that the shadows are falling towards the interpreter. A pseudoscopic illusion can be produced if the shadow is oriented away from the observer. This happens when low points appear high and high points appear low. === Tone and color === : Real-world materials like vegetation, water and bare soil reflect different proportions of energy in the blue, green, red, and infrared portions of the electro-magnetic spectrum. An interpreter can document the amount of energy reflected from each at specific wavelengths to create a spectral signature. These signatures can help to understand why certain objects appear as they do on black and white or color imagery. These shades of gray are referred to as tone. The darker an object appears, the less light it reflects. Color imagery is often preferred because, as opposed to shades of gray, humans can detect thousands of different colors. Color aids in the process of photo interpretation. === Texture === : This is defined as the “characteristic placement and arrangement of repetitions of tone or color in an image.” Adjectives often used to describe texture are smooth (uniform, homogeneous), intermediate, and rough (coarse, heterogeneous). It is important to remember that texture is a product of scale. On a large scale depiction, objects could appear to have an intermediate texture. But, as the scale becomes smaller, the texture could appear to be more uniform, or smooth. A few examples of texture could be the “smoothness” of a paved road, or the “coarseness” a pine forest. === Pattern === : Pattern is the spatial arrangement of objects in the landscape. The objects may be arranged randomly or systematically. They can be natural, as with a drainage pattern of a river, or man-made, as with the squares formed from the United States Public Land Survey System. Typical adjectives used in describing pattern are: random, systematic, circular, oval, linear, rectangular, and curvilinear to name a few. === Height and depth === : Height and depth, also known as “elevation” and “bathymetry”, is one of the most diagnostic elements of image interpretation. This is because any object, such as a building or an electric pole that rises above the local landscape will exhibit some sort of radial relief. Also, objects that exhibit this relief will cast a shadow that can also provide information as to its height or elevation. A good example of this would be buildings of any major city. === Site/situation/association === : Site has unique physical characteristics which might include elevation, slope, and type of surface cover (e.g., grass, forest, water, bare soil). Site can also have socioeconomic characteristics such as the value of land or the closeness to water. Situation refers to how the objects in the photo or image are organized and “situated” in respect to each other. Most power plants have materials and building associated in a fairly predictable manner. Association refers to the fact that when you find a certain activity within a photo or image, you usually encounter related or “associated” features or activities. Site, situation, and association are rarely used independent of each other when analyzing an image. An example of this would be a large shopping mall. Usually there are multiple large buildings, massive parking lots, and it is usually located near a major road or intersection. == See also == *Aerial photography *Orthophoto *Photogrammetry *Photomapping *Remote sensing *United States Geological Survey == References == * * * Category:Aerial photography Category:Aerial reconnaissance Category:Remote sensing Category:Satellite imagery ","title":"Aerial photographic and satellite image interpretation"},{"id":"17291227","text":"Jack Whitham is an English former professional footballer who played for Sheffield Wednesday, Liverpool, Cardiff City and Reading. He was a centre forward who only started 111 league games in a nine-year career between 1967 and 1976, scoring 40 goals. He made one appearance for the England under 23 team against Wales in 1968. Whitham was born in Burnley on 8 December 1946; his grandfather Thomas Whitham of the Coldstream Guards had won the Victoria Cross in 1917 for attacking single-handed an enemy machine gun post. He played amateur football for Holy Trinity F.C. before signing for Sheffield Wednesday in October 1964. ==Playing career== ===Sheffield Wednesday=== Whitham made his debut for Wednesday on 6 May 1967 as a substitute against his home town club Burnley and scored twice in a 7–0 victory. Whitham's time as a Wednesday player was marred by injury problems; his brave style of play meant that he spent long periods on the treatment table and he never played 20 league games in any season. He scored 10 goals in 10 games at the start of the 1968–69 season but never scored again that season as injury took its toll. He still ended up as top scorer that season; his tally included a hat-trick against Manchester United in a memorable 5–4 win on 31 August 1968 which was the highlight of his time at Hillsborough. In the following 1969–70 season he was top scorer again with 11 goals in all competitions as Wednesday were relegated to Division Two. In April 1970 he was transferred to Liverpool for a sum of £57,000. In his time with Wednesday he scored 31 goals in 62 starts, an excellent record of a goal every other match.\\"The Men Who Made Sheffield Wednesday Football Club\\", Tony Matthews, , Page 266 Gives biographical information.The Sheffield Wednesday Archive. Gives details of Sheffield Wednesday career. ===Liverpool=== Whitham was signed by Liverpool as a potential replacement for Roger Hunt who had left to join Bolton Wanderers in December 1969. However, his injury problems continued and he failed to get an extended run in the team. The arrival of John Toshack at Anfield in November 1970 further hindered his chances of first team football. He did well towards the end of 1971 when he scored two late goals in an away win at Coventry City and then scoring a hat-trick in a home 3–2 win against Derby County on 11 December 1971. In four years he would play just 15 games for Liverpool, scoring seven goals.www.lfchistory.net. Gives details of Liverpool career and mor.www.ynwa.tv.

Whitham returned to non-League football in 1976 playing for Worksop Town, Hallam F.C. and then Oughtibridge in the local Sheffield league He then went to Hallam as manager before retiring. ==After football== After retiring from football, Whitham ran the \\"Wadsley Jack\\" a public house in the Wadsley area of Sheffield for 10 years. He then became the manager of the South Yorkshire Police Social Club at Wadsley Bridge. From 1993 until 2007 Whitham was a part-time scout for Sunderland AFC and in 2007 he joined Luton Town as Chief Scout. After Luton Town went into administration in early 2008 Whitham went to Wolverhampton Wanderers for a short spell before becoming head of player recruitment at Sheffield United. He left Sheff United in June 2010 to become European Scout back at Wolverhamton Wanderers. He lives in Sheffield with his wife Jose' and they celebrated their 40th Wedding Anniversary in 2010.

The 68th was most recently part of the 347th Wing at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. It operated General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft conducting air superiority missions. The squadron was inactivated in 2001. ==History== ===World War II=== Established in early 1941 as part of the United States' defense buildup after the breakout of World War II in Europe. Trained under Third Air Force, then deployed to the Southwest Pacific after the Attack on Pearl Harbor for combat duty with Fifth Air Force. Reassigned to Thirteenth Air Force and provided air defense of Tongatabu from, June–October 1942 with a mixture of P-40s and P-39s. Engaged in combat in Solomon Islands, 1943-1944 using long-range P-38 Lightnings; moved to Southwest Pacific and flew missions over New Guinea and Netherlands East Indies during General Douglas MacArthur's island hopping campaign; arrived in the Philippines in February 1945 and spent the remainder of the war clearing the Japanese from those islands. ===Far East Air Forces=== Moved to Japan as part of the occupation forces, December 1945 although most personnel had been demobilized and returned to the United States. From 2 November 1945 to 1 October 1946, the 68th was non-operational and became, in name only, part of the large occupational force stationed in Japan. Then, in October 1946, the squadron began search and patrol missions and participated in exercises and maneuvers out of various bases in Japan flying the P-51D Mustang. In February 1947 assumed the air defense mission of northern Japan with Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighters, personnel, and equipment of the inactivating 421st Night Fighter Squadron.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 517 It replaced war-weary F-61s in 1949 with new North American F-82 Twin Mustangs. 68th Fighter All Weather Squadron F-82G Twin Mustang 46-376 based at Itazuke AB, 1950 Hurriedly engaged in combat operations over Korea, June 1950 as the first USAF squadron operational over war zone. Engaged North Korean Air Force aircraft and scored first aerial victories of the conflict. Replaced by Republic F-84 Thunderjets for combat air patrols in July 1950, engaging largely in long-range reconnaissance and weather flights over North Korea, 1950-1951 as F-51D Mustangs used for ground support and jets for air superiority missions, also maintained air defense of Southern Japan. Also engaged in night-interceptor missions over North Korea. Twin Mustangs replaced by jet Lockheed F-94C Starfire interceptors in 1951 and later to North American F-86D Sabres in 1954. The squadron upgraded to and Convair F-102A Delta Daggers in 1959. It began rotational deployments to Osan Air Base, South Korea in 1960, providing air defense over South Korean airspace. In 1963, Headquarters, United States Air Force instituted Project Clearwater. Clearwater was designed to return overseas F-102 squadrons to United States in order to reduce \\"gold flow\\" (negative currency exchange). The 68th's planes were withdrawn from Japan and dispersed over Air Defense Command squadrons in the United States and the squadron moved on paper to the US in 1964.McMullen, pp. 59–61 ===Vietnam War=== 68th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94B-5-LO 53-5355, Itazuke AB, Japan, 1954 Reassigned to Tactical Air Command, re-equipped with new McDonnell F-4C Phantom IIs in 1964. Deployed to bases in Thailand in 1964-1965 flying air superiority missions, close air support, strategic bombing over North Vietnam and initiating \\"night-owl\\" tactics and procedures in the fall of 1965 over North and South Vietnam during early stages of the United States' involvement in that conflict. Returned to George Air Force Base and became a replacement training unit for F-4 aircrews from February 1966 to October 1968. The unit became nonoperational for a short time. Assigned to Florida in 1968 with TAC's control of Homestead Air Force Base, but deployed to South Korea in 1968 in the wake of the Pueblo Crisis. Returned to the United States in late 1969; leaving F-4 Phantoms in South Korea and being re-equipped with F-100 Super Sabres in Louisiana before being reassigned to the Philippines in 1973 as an F-4E squadron at Clark Air Base. ===Tactical Fighter Squadron=== Returned again to the United States with TAC's activation at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia in 1975. Flew F-4Es and deployed overseas in February 1985 to Panama to take part in exercise Kindle Liberty. It regularly deploys to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, for intensive Red Flag and Green Flag mock combat exercises, then in 1987 being re-equipped with F-16A/B Falcons reassigned from Kadena Air Base, Japan as they upgraded to F-16C/Ds. The F-4Es were reassigned to the Missouri ANG. It deployed aircraft and personnel to Saudi Arabia between 26 June and 22 December 1991. In 1999 the 68th conducted two deployments to Al Jaber Air Base Kuwait in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. During the two deployments the Lancers flew 460 combat sorties dropping their first bombs in combat since the Vietnam War. The 68th was credited with the destruction of numerous 57 and 100 MM AAA guns, radar/cable relay stations, ammunition storage facilities, and surface-to-air missile sites. Of particular note; during the first deployment the 68th delivered 14 GBU-12 and 6 GBU-10 laser-guided bombs on Iraqi targets with a perfect 100 percent hit rate for the entire rotation, a US Air Force record. The 68th was inactivated on 30 April 2001 as part of realignment at Moody. ===Lineage=== * Constituted as the 68th Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor) on 20 November 1940 : Activated on 15 January 1941 : Redesignated 68th Fighter Squadron on 15 May 1942 : Redesignated 68th Fighter Squadron, Single Engine on 20 August 1943 : Redesignated 68th Fighter Squadron, Two Engine on 24 May 1944 : Redesignated 68th Fighter Squadron, Single Engine on 8 January 1946 : Redesignated 68th Fighter Squadron (All Weather) on 20 February 1947 : Redesignated 68th Fighter Squadron, All Weather on 10 August 1948 : Redesignated 68th Fighter-All Weather Squadron on 20 January 1950 : Redesignated 68th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 25 April 1951 : Redesignated 68th Tactical Fighter Squadron on 25 July 1964 : Inactivated on 30 June 1971 * Activated on 30 September 1973 : Redesignated 68th Fighter Squadron on 1 November 1991 : Inactivated on 30 April 2001 ===Assignments=== * 58th Pursuit (later, 58th Fighter) Group, 15 January 1941 * 347th Fighter Group, 3 October 1942 * 18th Fighter Group, 1 November 1945 * 8th Fighter Group, 15 December 1945 * 347th Fighter Group, 20 February 1947 : Attached to 315th Composite Wing, 10 April 1947 – 24 November 1947 : Attached to 8th Fighter-Bomber Group after 1 March 1950 * Fifth Air Force, 24 June 1950 : Remained attached to 8th Fighter-Bomber Group until 11 August 1950 : Further attached to 347th Provisional Fighter Group (All-Weather), 27 June 1950 – 5 July 1950 : Attached to 49th Fighter-Bomber Group, 11 August 1950 – 30 September 1950 : Attached to 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing, 1 October 1950 – 1 December 1950 * 314th Air Division, 1 December 1950 : Attached to 6160th Air Base Wing * Japan Air Defense Force, 1 March 1952 : Remained attached to 6160th Air Base Wing * Fifth Air Force, 1 September 1954 : Remained attached to 6160th Air Base Wing until 20 October 1954 : Attached to 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing, 20 October 1954 – 1 March 1955 * 43d Air Division, 1 March 1955 * 41st Air Division, 1 October 1957 : Attached to 8th Tactical Fighter Wing after 1 December 1961 * Fifth Air Force, 1 June 1962 : Remained attached to 8th Tactical Fighter Wing to 15 June 1964 * 32d Tactical Fighter Wing, 16 June 1964 * 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, 25 July 1964 : Attached to 6234th Tactical Fighter Wing, c. 27 August – 6 December 1965 * 831st Air Division, 6 December 1965 : Attached to 479th Tactical Fighter Wing, 6 December 1965 – 15 May 1968 * 479th Tactical Fighter Wing, 15 May 1968 * 4531st Tactical Fighter Wing, 1 October 1968 : Attached to: 354th Tactical Fighter Wing, 20 June 1969 – 9 December 1969 * 31st Tactical Fighter Wing, 15 October 1970 * 4403d Tactical Fighter Wing, 30 October 1970 – 30 June 1971 * 405th Fighter Wing, 30 September 1973 * 3d Tactical Fighter Wing, 16 September 1974 * 347th Tactical Fighter Wing, 30 September 1975 : Attached to 86th Tactical Fighter Wing, 30 May 1990 – 5 July 1990 * 347th Operations Group, 1 May 1991 – 30 April 2001 ===Stations=== * Selfridge Field, Michigan, 15 January 1941 * Harding Army Air Field, Louisiana, 6 October 1941 * Oakland Municipal Airport, California, 22 January – 17 February 1942 * Camp Ascot, Brisbane, Australia, 8 March 1942 * RAAF Base Amberley, Australia, 16 March 1942 * Tongatabu Airfield, Tonga Islands, 16 May – 28 October 1942 * Nouméa Airfield, New Caledonia, 2 November 1942 * Kukum Field, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, c. 12 November 1942 * Nadi Airfield, Viti Levu, Fiji Islands, 12 April 1943 : Operated from Kukum Field, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands until December 1943 * Buka Airfield, Bougainville, Solomon Islands, 4 February 1944 : Operated from Ondonga Airfield, New Georgia, Solomon Islands, 27 January 1954 – 10 February 1944 * Middleburg Airfield, West Irian Jaya Province, Netherlands East Indies, 17 August 1944 * McGuire Field, Mindoro, Philippines, 23 February 1945 : Operated from Wama Airfield, Morotai, Netherlands East Indies, 12 February 1945 – 25 March 1945 * Puerto Princesa Airfield, Palawan, Philippines, 6 March 1945 * Fukuoka Air Base, Japan, 15 December 1945 * Ashiya Air Base, Japan, 20 May 1946 * Itazuke Air Base, Japan, September 1946 : Deployed at Miyazaki Air Base, Japan, 10–24 August 1947 : Deployed at Tsuiki Air Base, Japan, 29 May – 9 June 1948 * Bofu Air Base, Japan, 19 October 1948 * Ashiya Air Force Base (later Air Base), Japan, 3 May 1949 * Itazuke Air Base, Japan, 1 April 1950 – 15 June 1964 : Detachment operated at Kimpo Air Base (K-14), South Korea, 30 November 1950-c.

It was later ported to the PlayStation under the title Total Eclipse Turbo. The game was copyrighted in 1993 but not made available to the public until 1994,US Copyright Records, Registration number PA0000629438. leading some sources to mistakenly list its release date as 1993. A sequel, Solar Eclipse, was released for Sega Saturn and PlayStation. == Gameplay == The game is played in a third-person perspective as the player's ship flies across each stage. As in other shmups, the player is free to accelerate, decelerate, and maneuver around to dodge obstacles and attack enemies, but the course for each stage is fixed. Rather than space, the player's ship flies over planetary surfaces and through tunnels. On the surface, the player flies over 3D heightmapped terrain, avoiding mountains and obstacles. In tunnels, the player avoids mechanical traps such as large moving doors and twisting passageways. The exit of the tunnel appears later on the surface of the same stage, so the player may miss a power-up (or a challenge) on the surface by taking a tunnel and vice versa. Some tunnels are optional and may contain bonus power-ups, while other tunnels are entered at dead ends on the surface. If the player fails to properly guide his ship into the tunnel at that point, his ship collides with the dead end terrain and explodes, costing a life. Colliding with enemies or terrain, being shot by enemies, and the passage of time all drain the ship's shields. When the shields reach zero, the ship explodes, a life is deducted from the player's stock, and play resumes at a checkpoint. Since there are very few shield refills in the game, the only way to avert this is by destroying enemies and ground installations; upon doing so the player's ship automatically absorbs their power to replenish its shields. Extra lives may be earned by collecting 1-ups and scoring large numbers of points. In addition, the player has a limited supply of continues, which place them back at the beginning of the current stage. When all lives and continues are exhausted, the game is over. Each game world is divided into four stages, for a total of 20 stages. Each stage contains multiple surface and tunnel areas. The fourth stage of each world ends with a fight against a boss, with the exception of the final world, in which the boss appears midway through the stage. By collecting power-ups, the player can change their weapon between five different types. Collecting a power-up of the type they already have upgrades their weapon level, with a maximum level of three. At higher levels the weapon fires more shots at a time. The player can also use bombs which send a wave of energy across the stage. This wave is strong enough to destroy most enemies and installations, and stops when it reaches the game's draw distance. The player starts each life with one bomb, and can collect more within the stages, maintaining a stock of up to three. The player can score additional points by performing aileron rolls, collecting point bonus items, and flying at faster speeds. == Plot == Earth is attacked by an aggressive alien race known as the Drak-Sai. The aliens use their powerful weapon, the Sun Dagger, to initiate a supernova in the sun. The player must pilot their ship across four planets and ultimately destroy the Sun Dagger to prevent further destruction. ==Reception== Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the 3DO version a 6.5 out of 10. They highly praised the graphics but criticized that the controls are too sensitive, the music is inappropriate for the theme of some stages, and that the hit detection is overly punishing. GamePro were held in similar awe of the graphics in the 3DO version and found little to complain about with the gameplay, concluding, \\"Total Eclipse blasts off into familiar fighting space ways, but the graphic look of this cool shooter is truly out of this world.\\" Reviews for the PlayStation version were less positive, as critics commented that despite the \\"Turbo\\" in the title, the PlayStation version made almost no changes to the by-then over a year old game.

The Marow family were in residence for six generations and built a new manor house in about 1670. On the death of Sir Samuel Marow Bt. in 1679, (see Marow baronets), Ursula Marow, the Berkswell heiress married Robert Wilmot of Osmaston . Their grandson John Eardley Wilmot carried out major alterations to the house about 1808 and following his death in 1815 the property was substantially rebuilt, in its present form, by Sir John Eardley-Wilmot Bt. (see Eardley-Wilmot baronets). Between 1843 and 1860 the house was occupied by a school. It was restored as a residence by Thomas Walker in 1861 and sold to Joshua Hirst Wheatley in 1888. Wheatley and his son served as High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1896 and 1934. In 1984 the estate was sold for development and the house was converted into apartments.

It was designed by Perry to act as a framework for urban planners attempting to design functional, self-contained and desirable neighbourhoods in the early 20th century in industrialising cities. It continues to be utilised (albeit in progressive and adapted ways, see New Urbanism), as a means of ordering and organising new residential communities in a way which satisfies contemporary \\"social, administrative and service requirements for satisfactory urban existence\\". ==History== Clarence Perry's conceptualisation of the neighbourhood unit evolved out of an earlier idea of his, to provide a planning formula for the arrangement and distribution of playgrounds in the New York region.Perry, C. 1998 The Neighbourhood Unit (1929) Reprinted Routledge/Thoemmes, London, 1998, p.25-44 The necessity for a formula such as this was attributed to the rise of the auto-mobile in the early 20th century. During a period where road sense had not yet amalgamated with the social conscious, and many of the urban tools we now use to manage the threat posed by vehicular traffic did not exist, or were not in abundance (such as pedestrian crossings, traffic lights and road signs), developing cities such as New York, which embraced the motor car, suffered street fatality rates in excess of one child a day. Clarence Perry conceived of neighbourhoods in this time period as islands locked amidst a burgeoning sea of vehicular traffic, a dangerous obstacle which prevented children (and adults) from safely walking to nearby playgrounds and amenities. Perry's neighbourhood unit concept began as a means of combating this obstacle. Ultimately, however, it evolved to serve a much broader purpose, of providing a discernible identity for the concept of the \\"neighborhood\\", and of offering to designers a framework for disseminating the city into smaller subareas (suburbs). While there is evidence that the concept of the neighbourhood unit emerged as early as 1923, at a joint meeting of the National Community Center Association and the American Sociological Society in Washington, D.C., it was the publication of Clarence Perry's paper, in the 1929 Regional Plan of New York and Its Environs, which led to its promotion as a planning tool.Lawhon, L. 2009, ‘The Neighbourhood Unit: Physical Design or Physical Determinism?’ in Journal of Planning History, 2009, 8: 111 originally published online 3 February 2009, DOI10.177/1538513208327072 Titled, \\"The Neighborhood Unit, a Scheme for Arrangement for the Family-Life Community\\", Clarence Perry's monograph offered in concrete terms a diagrammatic model of the ideal layout for a neighborhood of a specified population size. This model provided specific guidelines for the spatial distribution of residences, community services, streets and businesses.Banerjee, T. Baer, W. 1984 ‘Chapter 1: Introduction’ in Beyond the Neighborhood Unit: Residential Environments and Public Policy, Plenum Press, New York, 1984, p. 1-11 Perry's concept of the neighbourhood unit employed a variety of institutional, social and physical design principles, influenced by such popular notions in the 1920s as the separation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and arterial boundaries demarcating the inwardly focused neighbourhood cell from the greater urban lattice. The cellular nature of the neighbourhood unit allowed it to be utilised as a building block in the development of neighbourhood arrays, leading to its systematic modular usage during periods of rapid residential expansion in many countries across the globe.Allaire, J. (1960) ‘Neighborhood Boundaries’, Information Report No.141, published online by the American Society of Planning Officials, 1313 East 60th St. Chicago Illinois 60637; resource retrieved 9/04/11; http://www.planning.org/pas/at60/pdf/report141.pdf While Perry's name is most commonly associated with the notion of the neighbourhood unit, the idea of \\"re-defining and re-planning the city of the basis of neighbourhoods\\", was not Perry's in isolation. In a paper on the Neighbourhood Unit, Lewis Mumford considers the neighbourhood as it is organically experienced as well as the various – theoretical and practical - influences that lead to Perry's formalisation of the neighbourhood unit as an urban planning mechanism. Mumford credits Perry as taking: \\"the fact of the neighbourhood; and showing how, through deliberate design, it could be transformed into what he called a neighbourhood unit, the modern equivalent of a medieval quarter or parish: a unit that would now exist, not merely on spontaneous or instinctual basis.\\" William E. Drummond - a central architect in Frank Lloyd Wright's studio between 1899-1909 - defined the ‘Neighbourhood Unit’ within his submission to the Chicago City Club's planning competition of 1912. The competition wanted to address, \\"the theoretical and practical parameters, social and physical, of a micro-community in a suburban context with a focus on housing; the second concerned a community centre\\", calling for proposals for a ‘quarter-section’ site south of central Chicago. Drummond's plan advocated for the neighbourhood unit to be the organising basis of the whole city; to be ‘regarded as a unit in the social and political structure of the city’. The competition was largely a reaction to the squalid urban living conditions in the early part of the twentieth-century. It was part of the larger progressive and reformist era in American politics. Progressives saw the slums as a consequence of corruption and exploitation which they believed could be overcome through local political activation. Drummond was influenced by notable sociologist Charles Cooley, who he credited and surmised in his submission saying, ‘in the social and political organization of the city [the neighbourhood] is the smallest local unit’. These sociological and political foundations are interesting when considered against the various applications and permeations of neighbourhood planning (see Urban Application). ==Principles== The neighbourhood unit was conceived of as a comprehensive physical planning tool, to be utilised for designing self-contained residential neighbourhoods which promoted a community centric lifestyle, away from the \\"noise of the trains, and out of sight of the smoke and ugliness of industrial plants\\" emblematic of an industrialising New York City in the early 1900s.Vidyarthi, S. 2010 ‘Inappropriately Appropriated or Innovatively Indigenized?: Neighborhood Unit Concept in Post-independence India’, in Journal of Planning History 2010, 9:250 A diagram of Clarence Perry's neighbourhood unit, illustrating the spatiality of the core principles of the concept, from the New York Regional Survey, Vol 7. 1929 The core principles of Perry's Neighbourhood Unit were organised around several physical design ideals: \\"Centre the school in the neighbourhood so that a child's walk to school was only about one-quarter of a mile and no more than one half mile and could be achieved without crossing a major arterial street. Size the neighbourhood to sufficiently support a school, between 5,000 and 9,000 residents, approximately 160 acres at a density of ten units per acre. Implement a wider use of the school facilities for neighbourhood meetings and activities, constructing a large play area around the building for use by the entire community. Place arterial streets along the perimeter so that they define and distinguish the \\"place\\" of the neighborhood and by design eliminate unwanted through-traffic from the neighborhood. In this way, major arterials define the neighborhood, rather than divide it through its heart. Design internal streets using a hierarchy that easily distinguishes local streets from arterial streets, using curvilinear street design for both safety and aesthetic purposes. Streets, by design, would discourage unwanted through traffic and enhance the safety of pedestrians. Restrict local shopping areas to the perimeter or perhaps to the main entrance of the neighborhood, thus excluding nonlocal traffic destined for these commercial uses that might intrude on the neighborhood. Dedicate at least 10 percent of the neighborhood land area to parks and open space, creating places for play and community interaction\\" The neighbourhood unit was embraced for its community idealism, and many of the public sectors in those countries which were exposed to the theorem have since adopted its purpose; of protecting and promoting the public health and of considering the safety and welfare of citizens. Furthermore, private developers and investors continue to construct and fund planned communities based upon many of the concepts tenets, due to consumer demand for the idealistic community intimacy associated with living with heteronormative homo reciprocans of similar socioeconomic status. These attractive qualities of the concept of the neighbourhood unit are referred to by Allaire, \\"as reflecting a nostalgia for rural living\\". ==Urban application== The Caoyang New Village in Shanghai developed based on the neighborhood unit concept. The concept of the neighbourhood unit is a notable aspect of designs of the new town movement . The neighbourhood unit seems to have an uneasy relationship to the Garden City Movement of the same period – consider garden suburbs. Raymond Unwin – an architect working for Ebenezer Howard – was an advocate of the neighbourhood unit. Mumford observes a bidirectional relationship between the neighbourhood unit realtor's residential subdivision model. Clarence Perry in fact resided within Forest Hills Gardens at the time he presented his treatise on neighbourhoods 1923. While spatial elements of ‘neighbourhoods’ such as Forest Hills Gardens or Westwood Highlands are in keeping with those championed by reformers and progressive planners, these suburbs do not have common ideological origins. Instead realtors playing the role of ‘community builder’ had quite insidious consequences for ideas about public space, community inclusion and political agency. The use of deed restrictions by neighbourhood corporations wanting to control undesirable externalities in the early 1900s (and beyond) has been linked to ongoing racial segregation in the United States. The use of the ‘neighbourhood unit’ in this way emphasises exclusion rather than inclusion as initially intended. Traces of the exclusion remain evident within the streetscape of neighbourhoods such as Forest Hill Gardens with signs delineating the ownership of commonly considered public space. In contemporary Melbourne, Australia, the Owners Corporations Act 2006 enables access restrictions upon facilities generally considered public. Western Leisure Management makes this explicit on their website relating to use of facilities within the ‘un-gated’ neighbourhoods they manage; \\"These estates are part of an Owners Corporation and the facilities within are accessible by Residents Only and are not open to the general public.\\" In Soviet Union, the neighborhood unit schema was being widely criticized and disfavored for its waste of space and \\"bourgeois in nature\\" during the Stalin era. However, the idea of Microdistrict, proposed by the Soviet planners in 1950s and had been practiced in several communist countries, was essentially similar to the neighborhood unit schema. ==Sociological implications== The concept of the neighbourhood unit historically correspond to activities of American wave of school of urban studies and ecology called Chicago school, operating mostly in the 1920s and 1930s. It is closely linked to activities of Jane Jacobs, American urbanist and humanist in the field of migrant integration and child labour force. The schema of neighbourhood unit further refers to Charles Horton Cooley´s theory of primary groups and to the concept of neighbourhood as a type of a residential community. The concept of the neighbourhood unit should have enhanced the feeling of identification with the environment for the incomers, support their spatial integration, foster social cohesion and avoid social pathology, taking the form of alienation and civic indifference. ==Criticism== Several major criticisms of neighborhood unit have been mentioned in the planning literature. In the late 1940s the neighbourhood unit concept came under attack from Reginald Isaacs, then Director of Planning for Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago. Isaacs believed that the overwhelming endorsement of the neighbourhood unit, as a \\"panacea for all urban ills\\", was misguided; suggesting that the mystical powers ascribed to the concept by its most enthusiastic adherents engendered a dangerously sectarian discourse surrounding its application. Isaac's critical commentary of the neighbourhood unit centred on its (mis)use as an instrument for the segregation of racial, ethnic, religious and economic groups by private developers willing to utilise the gated-community aspects of the neighbourhood units physical design for this purpose. Supporting this argument, Isaacs pointed to examples of promotional material for new pre-planned neighbourhoods, as well as excerpts from government planning reports and information provided by social scientists – all championing the neighbourhood unit as a bastion for the gentry, keeping the undesirables, as well as through-traffic, out. Isaac's argument became a rallying point for the collective opposition of the neighbourhood unit, as planners began to question the unintended consequences of its repeated use, its socially divisive nature and its emphasis on the physical environment as the sole determinant of wellbeing. In developed countries across the globe, the spread of urban systems which embrace obsolete or impractical uses of space in order to manifest a synthetic ‘rural’ community lifestyle is increasingly viewed as blight upon attempts to achieve sustainable metropolitan growth. In the past, Isaac's argument was weakened through its inability to provide an alternative framework for community planning, in the present, planning bodies internationally, both private and public as of 2009, continue to adapt and make modular use of the neighbourhood unit when planning new communities. It is becoming increasingly difficult however, to mask the problems associated with the continued and ubiquitous use of variations on this model, and Urban Sprawl is proving to be one such problematic consequence of this usage facing many developed cities.Iaione, C 2010, 'THE TRAGEDY OF URBAN ROADS: SAVING CITIES FROM CHOKING, CALLING ON CITIZENS TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE', Fordham Urban Law Journal, 37, 3, pp. 889-951, Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost, viewed 10 April 2011 It is becoming increasingly apparent that a rethinking of the current heteronormative approach to planning new communities on the urban fringe, or in the redevelopment of existing neighbourhoods, is required to meet density goals and forge sustainable growth. ==References== Category:Metrics Category:Communities ","title":"Neighbourhood unit"},{"id":"17291471","text":"Jelena Janković successfully defended her title, beating qualifier Alizé Cornet in the final, 6–2, 6–2. ==Seeds== The top eight seeds receive a bye into the second round. ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top Half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ===Bottom Half=== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ==Qualifying== ===Seeds=== ===Qualifiers=== ===Lucky Losers=== ===Qualifying Draw=== ====First qualifier==== ====Second qualifier==== ====Third qualifier==== ====Fourth qualifier==== ====Fifth qualifier==== ====Sixth qualifier==== ====Seventh qualifier==== ====Eighth qualifier==== ====Ninth qualifier==== ====Tenth qualifier==== ====Eleventh qualifier==== ====Twelfth qualifier==== ==References== ==External links== * Official results archive (ITF) * Official results archive (WTA) Women's Singles Italian Open – Singles ","title":"2008 Italian Open – Women's Singles"},{"id":"17291479","text":"A diamante poem, or diamond poem, is a style of poetry that is made up of seven lines.

The poem can be used in two ways, either comparing and contrasting two different subjects, or naming synonyms at the beginning of the poem and then antonyms for the second half for a subject. In the poems, the subject is named in one word in the first line. The second line consists of two adjectives describing the subject, and the third line contains three verbs ending in the suffix ing which are related to the subject.

Garbahaarreey, the Gedo region's capital, is situated just away from Burdhubo. The town's inhabitants cultivate crops on farms along the banks of the river. Other residents lead a pastoral lifestyle, herding camels, cattle, goats and sheep. Since the early 1990s, Burdhubo has also seen new business activities and population growth. In March 2014, Somali Armed Forces assisted by an Ethiopian battalion with AMISOM captured the town from Al-Shabaab. The offensive was part of an intensified military operation by the allied forces to remove the insurgent group from the remaining areas in southern Somalia under its control. According to Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed, the government subsequently launched stabilization efforts in the newly liberated areas, which also included Hudur, Rabdhure and Wajid. The Ministry of Defence was providing ongoing reassurance and security to the local residents, and supplying logistical and security support to deliver relief assistance. Additionally, the Ministry of Interior was prepared to support and put into place programs to assist local administration and security. A Deputy Minister and several religious scholars were also dispatched to all four towns to coordinate and supervise the federal government's stabilization initiatives. ==Demographics== The broader Burdhubo District has a total population of 119,006 residents. ==Notes== Category:Populated places in Gedo Category:Jubba River ","title":"Burdhubo"},{"id":"17291582","text":"Pende may refer to: * Pendé a town in France * The Pende people, an ethnic group in Congo * Pendé River, river in Africa * Nicola Pende (1880-1970), Italian endocrinologist ","title":"Pende"},{"id":"17291583","text":"William George Hill (born 7 August 1940) is an English geneticist and statistician.

He studied Genetics at the University of California, Davis graduating with a Master of Science degree in 1963, then moved to Edinburgh to pursue a PhD in population genetics with Alan Robertson. He was awarded a Doctor of Science degree in 1976 for research on quantitative genetics. ==Research and career== Hill distinguished for his theoretical contributions to the study of the population and quantitative genetics of finite populations, in particular with respect to multilocus problems. He was the first to present formulae for the expected association of linked genes in finite populations due to random sampling of gametes and for the estimation of these associations from genotype frequencies. He has made major contributions to the analysis of quantitative variation in random breeding populations, both in the design and interpretation of selection experiments and in the analysis of similarity between relatives. He has applied these concepts in his own selection experiments in the laboratory and in farm animal improvement programmes. Hill served as editor in chief of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B from 2005 to 2009. ===Awards and honours=== Hill was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1979, a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1985 and appointed OBE in 2004.

The NJATC was committed to developing and standardizing education in the electrical industry to properly and effectively train members of NECA and the IBEW, providing the electrical construction industry with the most highly trained and highly skilled workforce possible. The organization worked with subject matter experts, industry leaders, and various manufacturers to ensure that electrical apprentices in the organized labor movement had access to the most-up-to date training initiatives in the electrical construction industry. The organization was known for hosting the National Training Institute (NTI), the largest electrical training seminar in North America. Nearly 2,000 electrical workers attend this event to learn about new industry trends, to see new products, and to attend in-depth training seminars. NTI is also home to one of the largest electrical trade shows in the construction industry. As of 2007, there were more than 40,000 electrical apprentices enrolled in JATC programs throughout the United States and Canada. Since its inception, more than 325,000 electrical apprentices have completed NJATC training programs and become competent journeymen, making the organization one of the largest electrical training and apprenticeship programs of its kind. ==Overview== Across the United States and Canada more than 200 local Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committees (JATCs) used the NJATC’s curricula to help train electrical apprentices. The NJATC developed electrical training curricula for Inside Wireman, Outside Lineman, Voice-Data-Video (VDV), and Residential Wireman programs. Emerging technologies such as photovoltaics (solar), wind power generation and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are also encompassed in the NJATC curricula, along with codes and safety and instrumentation training. The organization is also responsible for spearheading a variety of electrical industry certifications such as cable splicing and conduit bending. Its “Earn While You Learn” initiative allowed electrical apprentices to work and earn living wages while receiving related instructional training. This program also allowed JATC electrical apprenticeship programs to operate without the financial support of taxpayers. With the help of the American Council on Education, the NJATC has also developed a program that allows electrical apprentices to translate their instructional training into college credit. Depending on the area of study pursued, electrical apprentices could transfer up to 60 college credit hours from their electrical apprenticeship to colleges, universities, or community colleges. ==External links== *NJATC website *NECA website *IBEW website Category:Vocational education in the United States Category:Educational institutions established in 1941 Category:Internships Category:International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Category:Apprenticeship ","title":"National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee"},{"id":"17291775","text":"The William Mowry House is an historic farm house on Farnum Pike in North Smithfield, Rhode Island.

Lilian was born to an affluent family, descended on both sides from Huguenots of the old French nobility.The Golden Fountain of the Soul's Love for God Her early life was not one of outward religious observance, but was rather one of privilege and learning. Along with two brothers, she was educated by tutors, governesse, and at boarding schools. She spoke four languages fluentlyStaveley, Lilian, A Christian Woman's Secret, page 3 and spent her summers in Italy. When she came of age in society she entered into a privileged world of balls and suitors. As a young woman she became an atheist; a painful decision with which she struggled for two years. While in Rome, visiting the temples, she was moved by the beauty of her surroundings and \\"a longing for her Lord so painfully real that the longing could not be denied\\".Staveley, Lilian, A Christian Woman’s Secret page x While she was highly sought after and offered many proposals, she entered into a secret engagement with Brigadier General William Cathcart Staveley but her parents refused, due to his lack of money, to allow the romance. Meanwhile, her father, with whom she was quite close, suffered from a heart condition that left him gravely ill for two years before his eventual death in 1897. His death had a profound impact on his daughter. \\"I became a semi-invalid, always suffering, too delicate to marry.\\"Staveley, Lilian, A Christian Woman’s Secret, page 8 When her health returned, she married Staveley on 30 September 1899 at Kensington, LondonGRO Record 1a 241 though they were quickly separated for a time when he left for the Anglo-Boer War. At the end of the First World War she brought to John M. Watkins of London a manuscript. For the sake of her privacy and because her husband was still living and a general in the Army, she insisted on anonymity. It was only after her death that General Staveley learned that his wife of nearly thirty years had led a hidden spiritual life.World Wisdom, \\"Staveley\\" ==Writings== Staveley's writings are notable for their unassuming style – being the personal narrative of one person's spiritual journey - at once deeply personal and humble. It is the journey not of an unusual person; rather it is the progress of a self-described \\"ordinary soul\\" possessing, however, extraordinary love for God. ==Anonymity== The three books sthat appeared in her lifetime were all anonymously published; keeping the \\"white-heat\\" of her \\"spirit-living\\" a secret from the world, even from her beloved husband. It is only recently that her works have been published under her name, and she has yet to receive the fame due her for her prominent works. ==The feminine principle== One of the dilemmas that Staveley struggled with was that of the 'feminine principle'. She saw across history and religion a tendency by those in religious power, by men who were otherwise great and holy, to look down on womankind. She feared that in God's eyes also she was not of the 'acceptable sex'. This apparent disparagement she could not understand: \\"What profound injustice — to suffer so much and to receive no recognition whatever whilst men walked off with all the joys after leading very questionable lives!\\"Staveley, Lilian, A Christian Woman’s Secret, page 9 For several years her shame at being a woman was such that, although she continued to believe in and pay homage to God, she could do so only with a certain reverent sadness, and not with love. Eventually, Staveley came to the conclusion that, the arrogance of certain men aside; \\"Clothed in the body of either man or woman, the soul is predominantly feminine — the Feminine Principle beloved of, and returning to, the Eternal Masculine of God.\\"Staveley, Lilian, A Christian Woman's Secret, page xi The spiritual journey of each soul is a journey shared alike by man and by woman. ==Legacy== In his book Modern Mystics (London: John Murray, 1935; reprinted New York: University Books, 1970), Sir Francis Younghusband, a writer, diplomat and Himalayan explorer, explicitly compares Staveley with the likes of Ramakrishna and St. Therese de Lisieux. Younghusband also points out that the spiritual experiences Staveley describes bear \\"remarkable resemblances to the experiences of Hindu mystics\\".Staveley, Lilian, A Christian Woman's Secret page ix Her writings were also known to Evelyn Underhill, a respected authority on comparative mysticism, as well as to Frithjof Schuon, a pre-eminent writer in the Perennialist school of comparative religion. ==Books== During her lifetime, Staveley published three books: *The Prodigal Returns (John M. Watkins, 1921) *The Romance of the Soul (John M. Watkins, 1920) *The Golden Fountain or, the Soul’s Love for God: Being Some Thoughts and Confessions of one of His Lovers (John M. Watkins, 1919; reprinted by World Wisdom Books, 1982). A later compilation of her writings is *A Christian Woman's Secret (World Wisdom Books, 2008). ==References== ==External links== * All three of her works are available for free from manybooks.net Category:1878 births Category:1928 deaths Category:20th-century Christian mystics Category:20th-century British women writers Category:20th-century British writers Category:Christianity and women Category:Protestant mystics Category:Christian writers Category:Pseudonymous writers Category:Pseudonymous women writers Category:Women mystics ","title":"Lilian Staveley"},{"id":"17291856","text":"This article shows U.S. Census totals for Somerset County, Maine, broken down by municipality, from 1900 to 2000. There are two types of incorporated municipalities in Maine, towns and cities. The tables in the New England Historical U.S. Census Totals series differentiate between towns and cities; there are two cities in Somerset County, Skowhegan and Fairfield. Most areas of New England are entirely divided into incorporated municipalities, with no unincorporated territory. In the three northern New England states, however, some unincorporated territory does exist, generally in areas that are very sparsely populated. Maine contains significantly more unincorporated territory than the other states, with the bulk of it in interior and northern counties, including Somerset County. Some unincorporated territory in Maine is organized into a third type of town-level municipality unique to Maine, called a plantation (considered to be “organized”, but not incorporated), while some is entirely unorganized. Due to the large extent of unincorporated territory in Somerset County, separate sections with detailed historical census totals for such areas follow the main tables below. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality, including any plantations or unorganized entities, should yield the county total. For more information on the New England municipal system, see New England town. ==Corporate changes since 1900== *1935 – Concord disincorporated; subsequently organized as a plantation, but later reverted to unorganized territory *1957 – Moose River Plantation incorporated as a town *1958 – Jackman Plantation incorporated as a town *1977 – Caratunk Plantation incorporated as a town ==1900== County Total: 33,849 *Skowhegan 5,180 *Fairfield 3,878 *Pittsfield 2,891 *Madison 2,764 *Anson 1,830 *Norridgewock 1,495 *Hartland 1,115 *St. Albans 1,037 *Solon 996 *Canaan 977 *Palmyra 915 *New Portland 913 *Athens 896 *Bingham 841 *Cornville 689 *Starks 636 *Harmony 571 *Embden 567 *Detroit 527 *Mercer 493 *Ripley 449 *Smithfield 449 *Moscow 378 *Cambridge 364 *Concord 291 Unincorporated territory reported 2,707 residents.

This consisted of 333 residents in organized plantations, and 781 residents in unorganized territory. ==Plantations== As of 1900, Somerset County contained sixteen plantations. Six still exist today. Three of the plantations in existence as of 1900 have since incorporated as towns (Moose River, Jackman and Caratunk). The remaining seven have all surrendered their organization and reverted to unorganized territory: Carrying Place (apparently sometime in the 1920s; see the notes to the 1930 Census below), Long Pond (1929), Mayfield (1937), Lexington (1939), Bigelow (1940), Flagstaff (1951) and Dead River (1951). The last two dissolved after the area in which they were located was flooded due to dam construction. In addition to those already listed, the former town of Concord operated as a plantation for about four years following its disincorporation as a town, from 1935 to 1939. It then surrendered its organization and reverted to unorganized territory. Brighton, Lexington and Mayfield were all incorporated as towns in the 19th century, but had disincorporated and changed to a plantation form of government prior to 1900. 1900 *Brighton 368 *Jackman 352 *Moose River 239 *Lexington 231 *Caratunk 218 *West Forks 160 *The Forks 157 *Flagstaff 115 *Pleasant Ridge 114 *Dennistown 96 *Long Pond 92 *Dead River 91 *Mayfield 89 *Highland 67 *Bigelow 57 *Carrying Place 22 1910 *Jackman 667 *Brighton 274 *Moose River 251 *Lexington 237 *Caratunk 235 *Long Pond 216 *The Forks 169 *Flagstaff 149 *West Forks 138 *Dennistown 99 *Dead River 94 *Pleasant Ridge 92 *Mayfield 67 *Highland 68 *Bigelow 54 *Carrying Place 16 1920 *Jackman 902 *Moose River 511 *Brighton 293 *Caratunk 193 *Long Pond 177 *Lexington 172 *The Forks 153 *West Forks 120 *Dennistown 120 *Flagstaff 102 *Dead River 95 *Pleasant Ridge 90 *Highland 55 *Bigelow 48 *Carrying Place 35 *Mayfield 21 1930 *Jackman 1,099 *Moose River 277 *Flagstaff 179 *Caratunk 169 *Lexington 166 *The Forks 144 *West Forks 119 *Brighton 114 *Pleasant Ridge 104 *Dead River 82 *Highland 61 *Bigelow 39 *Dennistown 29 *Mayfield 0 1940 *Jackman 1,069 *Moose River 216 *Brighton 183 *Flagstaff 143 *Caratunk 133 *The Forks 123 *West Forks 117 *Pleasant Ridge 92 *Dead River 76 *Highland 53 *Dennistown 48 1950 *Jackman 964 *Moose River 203 *West Forks 108 *Brighton 106 *Caratunk 96 *Pleasant Ridge 80 *Highland 56 *The Forks 45 *Dennistown 24 *Dead River 0 *Flagstaff 0 1960 *Pleasant Ridge 108 *West Forks 93 *Caratunk 90 *Brighton 62 *The Forks 53 *Highland 46 *Dennistown 17 1970 *Pleasant Ridge 116 *Caratunk 96 *West Forks 74 *Brighton 58 *Dennistown 48 *The Forks 45 *Highland 23 1980 *Pleasant Ridge 99 *The Forks 90 *Brighton 74 *West Forks 72 *Highland 60 *Dennistown 30 1990 *Brighton 94 *Pleasant Ridge 91 *West Forks 63 *Highland 38 *Dennistown 32 *The Forks 30 2000 *Brighton 86 *Pleasant Ridge 83 *Highland 52 *West Forks 47 *The Forks 35 *Dennistown 30 ==Unorganized Territory== Like all of Maine's interior counties, Somerset County contains a significant amount of unorganized territory. Most of it is in the northern and central parts of the county, in areas which are very sparsely populated. Historically, only about the southern third of the county has been incorporated or organized. The general divider between the organized and unorganized parts was the northern boundary of Highland Plantation, Pleasant Ridge Plantation, the town of Moscow, and the former town of Mayfield. All territory south of that line was historically organized, with all but Highland and Pleasant Ridge once incorporated as towns (Note that Brighton, Lexington and Mayfield were all towns at one time but had changed to plantations prior to 1900). North of that line, the vast majority of the county was never organized; up until the 1950s there were never any incorporated towns, just a few scattered plantations. The only areas north of the line that have ever been organized are in three clusters: *Three municipalities along the Kennebec River to the north of Moscow: Caratunk, The Forks, and West Forks. All three were historically plantations, but Caratunk eventually incorporated as a town. There was once a fourth plantation in the area, Carrying Place, but it apparently surrendered its organization some time in the early 20th century. *Three municipalities along the Moose River, due west of Moosehead Lake near the Canada–US border: Jackman, Moose River, and Dennistown. All three were historically plantations. There was once a fourth plantation in the area, Long Pond, but it surrendered its organization in 1929. The other three still exist as municipalities today. Jackman and Moose River incorporated as towns in the late 1950s; they are by far the northernmost incorporated towns in Maine anywhere east of Penobscot County. *Though none exist any longer, there were once three plantations along the Dead River to the northwest of Highland Plantation. Much of this area was flooded due to the construction of a dam in the 1950s, by which time all three had surrendered their organization. Most of the northern part of the county is quite remote and has never had any significant population on more than a transitory basis. The distinction between a “township” and a “gore-like entity”, etc. in Somerset County is not always clear, as there are a number of surveyed townships labeled as “gores” or “grants”. There are at least sixty townships in the county which have never been organized, however, along with a number of additional gore-like entities. Note that there are oddly two different unorganized townships in the county commonly known as Bald Mountain Township. Between 1935 and 1945, a large number of municipalities in Maine dissolved and reverted to unorganized townships. In Somerset County, this included one community which had historically been a town (Concord), and three which had historically been plantations (Lexington, Mayfield and Bigelow). In 1951, two additional plantations in the Dead River valley (Flagstaff and Dead River) dissolved and reverted to unorganized territory due to the impending construction of a dam. The areas of Somerset County that are entirely unorganized cover about , with a population of about 800 people. This covers about two-thirds of the county’s land area, but includes only about 1.5% of its population. One unorganized community of particular note is Rockwood Strip (sometimes called Rockwood Township, or just “Rockwood”). Located on the west shore of Moosehead Lake, Rockwood has a significant enough population base to have its own post office and telephone exchange, but it has never organized as a plantation or incorporated as a town. It currently maintains a registrar and clerk, but has never had a true organized municipal government. Over the years, the U.S. Census Bureau has used different methods to compile data for unorganized territory in Maine. From 1900 to 1950, data was tabulated for each individual unorganized entity. In 1960, a single catch-all “Unorganized Territory” listing was provided for each Maine county, generally with no further breakdown. Since 1970, the Census has grouped contiguous areas in each county into one or more “unorganized territories”. As of the 2000 Census, four such areas are recognized within Somerset County: *Seboomook Lake Unorganized Territory: the far northern part of the county. Includes the area north of Dennistown, Moose River and a line running east from Moose River to Moosehead Lake (the line is irregular; it mostly follows roads and does not generally run along township boundaries). None of this area has ever been organized. *Northeast Somerset Unorganized Territory: the area south of the line described above; east of Moose River, Jackman, a line following US 201 between Jackman and West Forks, West Forks, The Forks, Caratunk and Moscow; and north of Brighton Plantation. This includes the former town of Mayfield and the former Long Pond Plantation. (Note that the boundary between Northeast Somerset and Seboomook Lake and the portion of the boundary between Northeast Somerset and Northwest Somerset that follows US 201 generally run along roads, not township boundaries.) *Northwest Somerset Unorganized Territory: the area west of Dennistown, Jackman, a line following US 201 between Jackman and West Forks, West Forks, The Forks and Caratunk. This territory stretches from the Canada–US border (west of Dennistown, in the northwest corner of the county) to Highland and Pleasant Ridge plantations, including the three former Dead River valley plantations that surrendered their organization in the 1940s and 1950s. (Note that the portion of the boundary between Northeast Somerset and Northwest Somerset that follows US 201 generally runs along roads, not township boundaries.) *Central Somerset Unorganized Territory: the former towns of Lexington and Concord. When the Unorganized Territories were first created for the 1970 Census, there were just two in Somerset County: Central Somerset and North Somerset. Central Somerset was the same as it is currently (Lexington and Concord townships). North Somerset was all other unorganized territory in the county (the entire area north of Highland, Pleasant Ridge, Caratunk, The Forks, West Forks and Brighton, except for Dennistown, Jackman and Moose River). For the 1980 Census, North Somerset was broken up into Northeast Somerset, Northwest Somerset, and Seboomook Lake. The listings below provide population figures for 1) all unincorporated territory, including plantations; 2) organized plantations, for which breakouts are available in the main tables above; and 3) unorganized territory, with any available breakouts provided. 1900 All unincorporated territory 2,707 Organized plantations 2,468 Unorganized territory 239 *Rockwood Strip (No.1 R1 NBKP) 87 *Holeb Twp.

No breakdown is available. 1970 All unincorporated territory 1,264 Organized plantations 460 Unorganized territory 804 Starting with the 1970 Census, the unorganized territory in Somerset County was broken into groups of contiguous territory. Two such entities were recognized in 1970. *North Somerset Unorganized Territory 588 *Central Somerset Unorganized Territory 216 1980 All unincorporated territory 1,056 Organized plantations 425 Unorganized territory 631 For the 1980 Census, the former North Somerset Unorganized Territory was broken into three entities, for a total of four recognized within the county. *Northeast Somerset Unorganized Territory 301 *Central Somerset Unorganized Territory 278 *Seboomook Lake Unorganized Territory 37 *Northwest Somerset Unorganized Territory 15 1990 All unincorporated territory 1,041 Organized plantations 348 Unorganized territory 693 *Northeast Somerset Unorganized Territory 377 *Central Somerset Unorganized Territory 289 *Seboomook Lake Unorganized Territory 19 *Northwest Somerset Unorganized Territory 8 2000 All unincorporated territory 1,114 Organized plantations 333 Unorganized territory 781 *Northeast Somerset Unorganized Territory 354 *Central Somerset Unorganized Territory 336 *Northwest Somerset Unorganized Territory 46 *Seboomook Lake Unorganized Territory 45 Note: the unorganized townships in Somerset County are on four different grids: *WELS (west of the Easterly Line of the State): as its name suggests, the baseline for this grid is the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick in Aroostook County. In places, it has up to 20 numbered rows, arranged from north to south. The lower rows of the grid are cut off by Moosehead Lake, however, and the upper rows exist only in Aroostook County, so that only rows 4 through 10 enter the modern borders of Somerset County. The townships on this grid in Somerset County are in ranges 16 through 20, although the shape of the Canada–US border and the arrangement of the NBKP grid (see below) are such that not every possible range/row combination exists. The area of Somerset County covered by the WELS system is very remote and very sparsely populated. Most of the townships are identified only by their row and range numbers and have never developed informal township names. *NBKP (North of Bingham’s Kennebec Purchase): covers the area to the immediate south of the WELS grid, to the west of Moosehead Lake. Range 1 is along the lake’s western shore, with range numbering increasing as one goes west, extending as far as range 6. Jackman is in row 1, with row numbers increasing as one goes north, extending as far as row 5. The shape of the Canada–US border and the boundary with the WELS grid are such that not every possible range/row combination exists. Most of this grid is drawn up at an angle that is skewed well off from due north-south/east-west. There are a few areas along the northwest corner of Moosehead Lake that are part of this grid but do not have range numbers, because they lie east of the first range (Seboomook Twp. is one example). This grid does not extend outside of the modern borders of Somerset County. *BKP WKR (Bingham’s Kennebec Purchase, West of the Kennebec River): covers that portion of the area south of the NBKP grid which lies west of the Kennebec River. The rows of townships on this grid are numbered east to west, with the baseline at the Kennebec River. Lexington Twp. and Concord Twp. are in range 1 of the grid, with range numbers increasing as one goes north, as far as range 7. Because the Kennebec River does run at all due north-south in this area, row numbering is somewhat irregular (e.g., T5R7 is directly north of T4R6, which is directly north of T3R5). Parts of ranges 1, 2 and 3 are within the modern borders of Somerset County. Part of the grid is also within the modern borders of Franklin County. *BKP WKR (Bingham’s Kennebec Purchase, East of the Kennebec River): covers that portion of the area south of the NBKP grid which lies east of the Kennebec River. The rows of townships on this grid are numbered west to east, with the baseline at the Kennebec River. Bingham and Brighton Plantation are in range 1 of the grid, with range numbers increasing as one goes north, as far as range 6. This grid also originally extended eastward into the modern borders of Piscataquis County, to the south of Moosehead Lake. ==Notes== 1910 Census Notes in the 1920 Census reports indicate that the 1910 population of Caratunk Plantation includes the adjacent Bald Mountain Twp. (T2R3 BKP EKR) as well as a “Spaulding” Twp. It is unclear whether this also applies to earlier censuses. 1920 Census The 1920 Census reports contain a single listing for Bald Mountain Twp., combining the two townships by that name in Somerset County, even though they are not adjacent. The 1930 Census reports show the 1920 population of each broken out separately. These separate figures for 1920 are shown in the tables above. 1930 Census The 1930 Census reports show Long Pond as a plantation. The 1940 reports show it as an unorganized township, with no explanation of when or how its status changed. Other sources consulted indicate that Long Pond Plantation surrendered its organization in 1929, however. This article assumes that the 1929 date is correct and the Census showed Long Pond as a plantation in error in 1930. Carrying Place appears to have been organized as a plantation for a time in the late 19th century and early 20th century, but the author of this article has been unable to locate a date for its surrender of organization. One source shows it as a plantation as of 1895, and the Census listed it as a plantation in every census from 1880 to 1930, though typically with population levels that were very small for an organized plantation; it actually reported no population at all in 1930. The 1940 Census reports show it as an unorganized township, with no explanation of when or how its status changed. Until more definite information is discovered, this article lists it as a plantation through 1920, the last census for which it was both listed as a plantation and reported any population. 1980 Census The 1980 Census reports show Caratunk as a plantation, changing to a town for the 1990 Census. The author of this article was only able to locate one source containing a year of incorporation for Caratunk, which indicated 1977. Until information to the contrary is discovered, this article assumes that the 1977 date is correct and that Caratunk should have been shown as a town in 1980. ==See also== *United States Census *Somerset County, Maine Category:Somerset County, Maine Category:Demographics of Maine ","title":"Historical United States Census totals for Somerset County, Maine"},{"id":"17291871","text":"Pomham Rocks Light (also known as \\"Pomham Lighthouse\\") is a historic lighthouse in the Providence River about off the shoreline of the Riverside neighborhood of the city of East Providence, Rhode Island.

The Polish throne was contested by Stephen Báthory and the Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian II. It began on 12 December 1575, when Emperor Maximillian was chosen as monarch by the Polish Senate, while the majority of the szlachta (nobility) had voted for Bathory. It ended on 16 December 1577. Maximilian's II death in fall of 1576 weakened Danzig's position and made the conflict less about the recognition of the ruler than about Danzig's privileges. With neither side being able to defeat the other militarily, a compromise was reached, with economic as well as religious privileges of the city being restored and recognized, in return for a large reparation and recognition of Bathory as Grand Duke of western Prussia. Danzig made its oath conditional on the removal of the Statute of the Karnkowski commission of 1569/70.https://books.google.com/books?id=kpulHjDt8UEC&pg;=PA273&lpg;=PA273&dq;=Prussia+Karnkowski+statute?&source;=bl&ots;=zGExQXoVCa&sig;=lOYfgGxFAkq3-E3FNI2979zeN3s&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjL37WPlKzcAhUiIjQIHdsbB1UQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q;=Prussia%20Karnkowski%20statute%3F&f;=false The Other Prussia, page 111 ==Background== On 20 July 1570, the Polish- Lithuanian king Sigismund II Augustus introduced Karnkowski Statutes, which partly reduced Danzig's special privileges granted by earlier Polish kings after the Prussian Confederation cities recognized their rule in 1454. In 1572, the throne of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was vacated when King Sigismund Augustus died without an heir and Henry III of France after a brief period as a Polish king returned to France. Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was an elective monarchy and (after the Union of Lublin in 1569) in close union with Lithuania, meaning that Polish nobility (szlachta) could vote on who would become the next king. Cities had no vote; Danzig however was invited by primate of Poland and interrex Jakub Uchański to cast a vote but declined to send a representative. Members of the Senate (including most of the Polish episcopate led by Jakub Uchański) decided to elect Emperor Maximilian II, against the will of majority of nobility, which during the royal election voted for Anna Jagiello (the last representative of the former Polish- Lithuanian Jagiellon dynasty) and Stephen Báthory as her husband and de facto King. This led to some unrest in Poland. The town whose economic privileges were reduced by the Karnkowski Statutes, wanted to use the situation to regain its preferential position within the Polish Crown. It also preferred Maximilian,Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes, Oxford University Press, 2005, , p.321. who looked more likely to support the towns' economic privileges, and who could also threaten serious economic repercussions (boycott by the Habsburgs). Thus the city, encouraged by its immense wealth and almost impregnable fortifications, as well as by the secret support of DenmarkStewart P. Oakley, War and Peace in the Baltic, 1560-1790, Routledge, 1992, , p.35 and Emperor Maximilian himself, had supported the latter's election. On 1 May 1576, Stefan Bathory married King Anna Jagiello and was crowned by Stanisław Karnkowski as King of Poland. Jakub Uchański and nuncio Wincenty Laureo recognized Maximillian as a King, but soon they and others accepted the will of majority. When Stefan swore in all of existing rights of Royal Prussia and Duchy of Prussia, Paweł Jasienica: \\"Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narodów\\" (p.101-107), and was recognized as a rightful ruler, Danzig refused to follow along and still recognized Maximillian as King of Poland. The tensions grew as rioters looted and burned down an abbey in Oliwa. The abbey belonged to the bishop of Kujawy, Stanisław Karnkowski, who had under his jurisdiction the whole of Polish Pomerania. The Sejm (parliament) of the Commonwealth did not approve higher taxes for the war. It did however approve a banicja (form of political exile and excommunication), confiscation of the city's property, arrest of its citizens, commercial blockade and rerouting of the important trade via the port of Elbląg (which however was immediately blockaded by Denmark's navy). ==Fighting== In August 1576, Bathory led 2,000 (Polish soldiers and mercenaries from Transylvania and WallachiaE. Liptai: Magyarország hadtörténete (1), Zrínyi katonai kiadó 1984. ; 208. p.) men to Malbork (Marienburg), from there Polish units took control of the area surrounding Gdańsk, capturing Grabina and Głowa, two strategically important villages, thereby blockading Danzig's port from the east and the south. The King left the army under the command of Hetman Jan Zborowski and most of the forces were stationed at Tczew (Dirschau). In the west the main base was at Puck (Putzig), where there was a mercenary force led by Ernest Weyher. While some Polish privateer ships fought the Gdańsk and Danish fleets, for the most part the control of the Baltic Sea belonged to the Danzigers and their allies. Soon after the fighting begun, Maximilian's II death (12 October 1576) was announced; this weakened Danzig's position and made the conflict less about the recognition of the ruler than about Danzig's privileges.Besala and Biedrzycka (2005), \\"Stefan Batory\\". Polski Słownik Biograficzny. XLIII.p.118 Map showing the fortifications of Danzig as they were over 100 years later With the coming of the spring of 1577, the fighting began anew. The Danzig army, led by the German mercenary commander Johann Winkelbruch (Hans Winckelburg von Kölln), was about 7,000-12,000 strong (including mercenaries, among them a Scottish regimentThe regiment of six companies numbering about 700 men was hired by Danzig in 1577–8 and won great fame in the city's rebellion against Poland. - Richard Brzezinski: Polish Armies 1569-1696 (2), Osprey Publishing), but with less than 1,000 cavalry. Winckelburg decided to crush the small army of Zborowski (who had about 2,000 men, half of them cavalry), but the Danzig army was utterly defeated by Zborowski in the battle of Lubiszewo on 17 April 1577.Radosław Sikora, Lubieszów 17 IV 1577, Zabrze 2005. After the battle, the Danzig forces retreated behind the walls, citizens pulled down trees and houses in front of fortifications and a siege began. Reinforcement with King Batory arrived only in July. During it King Stefan was using heated cannonballs and turned back the flow of the Radunia river. Bathory had about 11,000 men, and Danzig, about 10,000. A surprise attack by the Danzigers managed to destroy two-thirds of the Polish artillery, vastly slowing the progress of the siege. In September 1577 Danzig and Danish fleets started a blockade of Polish trade along Elbing and attacked its suburbs. Their troops that landed were soon pushed back by Bathory's Hungarian infantry under Kacper Bekiesza, and the city council send a note thanking the King. However, after a few months, Stephen's army was unable to take the city by force. On 16 December 1577, the siege ended and citizens swore loyalty to Stefan's representatives Eustachy Wołłowicz and Andrzej Firlej. (Treaty of Malbork). ==Aftermath== The Gdańsk merchants had suffered a great deal from the blockade, especially because of lack of trade. In the meantime, Bathory also wanted to end the siege, as Ivan the Terrible of Muscovy broke a three-year truce in the same year and Muscovy tried to gain control of the eastern territories of the Commonwealth (Livonian War).Daniel Stone, The Polish-Lithuanian State, 1386-1795, University of Washington Press, 2001, , p. 123. The siege and all economic restrictions that were passed in the past two years were lifted in return for reparations and recognition of Bathory as the sovereign. Stefan forgave the city's rebellion and again turned Polish trade from Elbing to Danzig. The city, in turn, recognized him as ruler of Poland and promised to pay the large sum of 200,000 złotys and an additional 20,000 repatriation to the abbey of Oliwa in five years. On 26 November 1585 the Karnkowski Statutes from 1570 were lifted, and Danzig again became the most privileged city in the Commonwealth. ==See also== *History of Gdańsk ==References== Category:Wars of succession involving the states and peoples of Europe Category:Wars involving Poland Category:History of Gdańsk Category:1570s in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Rebellions in Poland Category:16th-century rebellions Category:1570s conflicts ","title":"Danzig rebellion"},{"id":"17291932","text":"A bounce address is an email address to which bounce messages are delivered. There are many variants of the name, none of them used universally, including return path, reverse path, envelope from, envelope sender, MAIL FROM, 5321-FROM, return address, From_, Errors-to, etc. It is not uncommon for a single document to use several of these names. All of these names refer to the email address provided with the \`MAIL FROM\` command during the SMTP session. ==Background information== Ordinarily, the bounce address is not seen by email users and, without standardization of the name, it may cause confusion. If an email message is thought of as resembling a traditional paper letter in an envelope, then the \\"header fields\\", such as \`To:\`, \`From:\`, and \`Subject:\`, along with the body of the message are analogous to the letterhead and body of a letter - and are normally all presented and visible to the user. However, the envelope in this analogy is the contents of the \`MAIL FROM\` and \`RCPT TO\` fields from the SMTP session - and neither of these is normally visible to the user. While it is most common for the \`To:\` and \`From:\` information in the letter to be the same as the \\"envelope\\" values, such is not always the case. For example, on electronic mailing lists, the information seen in the \\"From:\\" header will come from the person who sent the email to the list, while the bounce address will be set to that of the mailing list software, so problems delivering the mailing list messages can be handled correctly. Only the envelope information is looked at to resolve where the email should go; the body of the email is not examined. Mail Transfer Agents (MTA) using the SMTP protocol use the \`RCPT TO\` command to determine where the email should go, and the \`MAIL FROM\` command to indicate where it came from. ==Usage== While its original usage was to provide information about how to return bounce messages, since the late 1990s, other uses have come about. These typically take advantage of properties of the bounce address, such as: *It is given early in the SMTP session, so a message can be rejected without receiving its body. *It is typically not seen by users so it can be altered to include additional information without confusing them. *It is a required part of Mail Transfer Agent software, so it is easy for other programs to use. In contrast, the \\"from\\" address in the body of the mail can be on several different headers (e.g. the \`From:\`, \`Sender:\`, \`Resent-from:\`, etc.) or be missing entirely. Extended uses include mailing list handling in Variable envelope return path (VERP), email authentication, spam filtering, and backscatter reduction in Bounce Address Tag Validation. ==Terminology== The various terms have different origins and sometimes different meanings, although these differences have often become moot on the modern internet. * bounce address - When an email can not be delivered, the MTA will create a bounce message and send it to the address given by the \`MAIL FROM\` command. Used in RFC 4406. * return path - When the email is put in the recipient's email box, a new mail header is created with the name \\"Return-Path:\\" containing the address on the \`MAIL FROM\` command. Earlier forms of email (such as UUCP) would require information about each \\"hop\\" along the path that the email traveled to reach the destination, hence the \\"path\\" part of the name. Used in RFC 2821, RFC 3834, RFC 4409. * reverse path - the argument of the SMTP \`MAIL FROM\` command, whose content is supposed to consist of the envelope sender address. Used in RFC 5321, RFC 3464, RFC 3834, Internet Mail Architecture. * envelope from - information that the SMTP protocol uses analogous to the envelope of a letter. Used in RFC 5230, RFC 5233. * envelope sender address - the mailbox address in a non-empty reverse path excluding any (deprecated) reverse routing info. Used in RFC 2821, RFC 3461, RFC 3464, RFC 3798, RFC 5228. * envelope return address - similar to envelope sender address, used in RFC 3461, RFC 3464, RFC 3834, RFC 4952. * MAIL FROM - This variation comes directly from the SMTP \`MAIL FROM\` command name. Used in RFC 5321, RFC 3464, RFC 3834, RFC 4408, RFC 4409, RFC 4952. * 2821-FROM - Until October, 2008, SMTP was defined in RFC 2821, while the body of the email was defined in RFC 2822. The term \\"2821-FROM\\" makes it clear that the address referred to is the \`MAIL FROM\` information, while \\"2822-From:\\" refers to the address in the \\"From:\\" header seen by end users. Used in RFC 5598. * 5321-FROM - Evolution of 2821-FROM as from October, 2008, SMTP has been defined in RFC 5321. * return address - Another term that comes from the letter analogy for email. used in RFC 5321, RFC 3834. * From_ - When an email gets delivered to the user's email box, one file format that may be used is the mbox format. In this format, the email address from the \`MAIL FROM\` command was placed on a line beginning with \\"From\\" followed by a single space, the \\"From_\\" term uses an underscore to represent the space to distinguish it from the \\"From:\\" mail header. In this mailbox format, lines in the actual email that begin with a \\"From \\" have to be escaped and changed into lines that begin with \\">From \\". ==See also== * Bounce message * Email forwarding * Variable envelope return path * Sender Rewriting Scheme Category:Email Category:Email authentication ","title":"Bounce address"},{"id":"17291938","text":"Robert Alexander Palmer, 1st Baron Rusholme (29 November 1890 – 18 August 1977) was a senior official of the British co-operative movement and a Labour Co-operative member of the House of Lords. ==Career== Palmer left school at the age of 14.

The album gave millions of listeners who otherwise were unable to attend a theatrical performance a chance to hear Robeson as Othello and Ferrer as Iago. ==LP influence and educational value== After the advent of LPs, spoken word albums became much more common. *The above-mentioned Ronald Colman A Christmas Carol was transferred to LP, as were many other 78-RPM spoken word albums made by American Decca, such as Moby Dick, with Charles Laughton as Captain Ahab; an uncredited actor provided the voice of Ishmael, the narrator. *Disneyland Records issued many spoken word albums for children, including narrated adaptations of the Disney films in their \\"Disneyland Storyteller\\" series. *Notable Broadway productions, such as Don Juan in Hell (1950, with Charles Boyer, Charles Laughton, Cedric Hardwicke and Agnes Moorehead), the 1953 dramatized reading of the poem John Brown's Body (with Tyrone Power, Judith Anderson, and Raymond Massey), the original 1962 Broadway version of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (with Uta Hagen, Arthur Hill, George Grizzard and Melinda Dillon), and Richard Burton's Broadway production of Hamlet (1964), were all recorded complete with their original casts by Columbia Masterworks. *José Ferrer was heard in an album of excerpts from Cyrano de Bergerac, with members of the cast of the 1946 Broadway revival in which Ferrer first played Cyrano, on Capitol Records. *Caedmon Records recorded the complete plays of Shakespeare as well as recordings of other plays, such as Death of a Salesman with original stars Lee J. Cobb and Mildred Dunnock, The Glass Menagerie with Jessica Tandy, and a nearly complete Cyrano de Bergerac with Ralph Richardson, who had triumphed in the role in London in 1946. Many of these recorded dramas were played in high school literature classes to enable students to hear the play and follow along in their textbooks at the same time. *After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, memorial collections of his speeches began to appear on LP. Most of the soundtrack of the commemorative documentary John F. Kennedy: Years of Lightning, Day of Drums (1966), narrated by Gregory Peck, was released on a Capitol Records LP. *Dialogue excerpts were also released of the film soundtracks of Franco Zeffirelli's The Taming of the Shrew (1967) (on RCA Victor),SOUNDTRACK LP THE TAMING OF THE SHREW TAYLOR / BURTON (1968) and Romeo and Juliet (1968) (on Capitol). RCA Victor also released a virtually complete 2-LP album of the film soundtrack of A Man for All Seasons (1966). RCA Victor was also responsible for complete 4-LP album sets of Laurence Olivier as Othello LAURENCE OLIVIER IN OTHELLO RCA RED SEAL RECORD and Zeffirelli's National Theatre of Great Britain production of Much Ado About Nothing, starring Maggie Smith, Robert Stephens, and Albert Finney.TIME *Emlyn Williams recorded an edition of his one-man performance as Charles Dickens (for Argo Records). *Hal Holbrook recorded excerpts from his one-man Mark Twain Tonight! for Columbia Masterworks. * Having Fun with Elvis on Stage (1974), a spoken word album consisting only of banter by the singer during concerts, was created as a ploy by his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, so he could self-release an Elvis Presley album that his label RCA Records would not own the rights to. ==Decline== With the advent of videocassettes and compact discs, however, original cast albums of non-musical plays, as well as spoken word albums of film soundtracks, went into a serious decline from which they have never completely recovered. CDs usually place more emphasis on music than on the spoken word, and there was little interest in only listening to a play or dialogue excerpts from a film when one could now buy plays and films on video and watch them at home whenever one wished. While the Cosby albums have resurfaced on CD, most of the other albums mentioned above have not. (Some of the Caedmon albums have been released on CD by Harper Audio, a division of Harper Collins, which now owns Caedmon.) The 1968 album of Romeo and Juliet excerpts has also appeared on CD, and Pearl has issued the Robeson Othello in that medium, but the CD edition of the Othello has, unfortunately, attracted little attention in comparison to the history-making vinyl record release of the 1940s,Amazon.com: Shakespeare: Othello: William Shakespeare, Mischa Spoliansky, Uta Hagen, Victor Young, Jose (i) Ferrer, Paul Robeson, Jane Manning, Lawrence Brown: Music and now that Cyrano de Bergerac, A Man for All Seasons, the Olivier Othello, the Zeffirelli versions of Romeo and Juliet and The Taming of the Shrew, the television version of Mark Twain Tonight, and Richard Burton's Hamlet are all available on DVD, this has become for most a more preferred way to experience these productions. Although Naxos Records is a major producer of audiobooks, many famous spoken word recordings of the past, such as Columbia Masterworks' John Brown's Body and Don Juan in Hell have yet to be released on CD, although Don Juan in Hell has become available as an mp3 download. Whether or not it will appear in CD form is still unknown. Also online (but not yet on CD) is Capitol Records' The Story Teller: A Session with Charles Laughton, a Grammy-winning one-man stage performance by the actor, featuring dramatic readings from the Bible, Shakespeare, George Bernard Shaw and Jack Kerouac, as well as autobiographical reminiscences. ==Today's spoken word albums== There have been some spoken word albums over the past 15 years or so recorded specifically for compact disk; these have often been combined with classical music. Among them are the Naxos audiobooks, as well as a Chandos Records series of albums which combine the music William Walton wrote for several Shakespeare production (including the Olivier film adaptations), with readings from the author performed by such actors as John Gielgud and Christopher Plummer. There is also a Hyperion Records stereophonic re-creation of Ralph Vaughan Williams' 1942 radio play adaptation of The Pilgrim's Progress, again with Gielgud. Excerpts from Gielgud's Grammy-winning one-man Shakespeare production Ages of Man (1959), once available on LP, are now available as a manufactured-on-demand CD. Today, such websites as BBC, L.A. Theatre Works, The Hollywood Theater of the Ear, and ZBS offer full- length recordings on CD of their dramatic productions. These recordings are possibly the closest that modern day discs have come to the spoken word albums of the 1960s. == References == Category:Album types ","title":"Spoken word album"},{"id":"17291986","text":"Gareth Andrew Bacon (born 7 April 1972) is a British Conservative politician serving as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Orpington since 2019. == Early life and career == Bacon was born in Hong Kong, and studied at St. Mary's and St. Joseph's School in Sidcup, then at University of Kent at Canterbury where he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts honours degree in Politics and Government in 1996, followed by a Master of Arts degree in European Studies in 1997.

Founded by local man George Cushing, it is now known for the scale of its collection of steam engines, organs and fairground attractions, and its annual Christmas spectacular show, which draws over 100,000 people to the Norfolk countryside. The Thursford Collection is a registered charity under English law. == George Cushing == George Thomas Henry Cushing MBE was born at Thursford on 25 March 1904, the son of a farm labourer. After leaving school aged 12, he became a farmhand, but had developed a childhood fascination with steam engines. In 1920 he travelled to the King's Lynn Mart, and got a job driving a steam roller. Having bought a 1913 Aveling and Porter roller from the local council with savings of £225, Cushing set up his own sub-contracting business, which had expanded to 15 steam rollers and a steam wagon by World War II. == Laurel Farm == By the late 1930s, steam was on the wane from commercial usage as diesel lorries became more popular. To Cushing, it was \\"as though the crown jewels were being sold for scrap\\", and he began to buy up redundant steam engines, storing and then restoring them at Laurel Farm, where he had worked as a child and now owned. This was also where he raised his own family of three boys with his wife Minnie. ==Thursford Museum== Entrance to the Thursford Collection (September 2007) As Cushing's collection grew, more enthusiasts travelled to Thursford to help restore and then view his collection. Thus, in the 1970s Cushing opened his museum in what was then a series of old farm sheds, and would personally tour the audience between exhibits, most often dressed in a countryman's flat cap, tweed jacket and muffler over baggy jumper, trousers and gumboots. He would then shake each visitor's hand, and ask departing guests with a blunt \\"Did yer loik it, then?\\" The original museum had limited opening times, but Cushing expanded the attraction to include a gift shop and tea rooms, and opened seven days a week during the summer season. In 1982 he co-wrote, with Ian Starsmore, Steam at Thursford.Cushing, George and Starsmore, Ian (1982). Steam At Thursford. David & Charles. For the scale of his efforts in saving much of Britain's steam heritage, Cushing was appointed an MBE in 1989. ==Thursford Collection== In 1976 on the death of his wife Minnie, Cushing realised his collection could be subject to death duties when he died, and so set up the Thursford Collection as a trust endowed charity. Now run by his youngest son, John, the Thursford Collection attracts 170,000 visitors a year. Cushing died on 26 February 2003, at the age of 98. The collection today includes a Mighty Wurlitzer which is the fourth-largest in Europe, and has a total of 1,339 pipes. The Wurlitzer was rescued from the Paramount Theatre / Odeon Cinema Leeds. There is also a 19th-century gondola merry-go-round which was built in the Norfolk factory of Frederick Savage, decorated with carved heads depicting Queen Victoria and her family, including the German Kaiser Wilhelm II. ==In popular culture== One of the organs in the collection, a Wellershaus, was seen and heard in the Dad's Army episode Everybody's Trucking, originally aired on 15 November 1974. ==See also== * List of music museums *Scarborough Fair Collection ==References== ==External links== *Thursford Collection website Category:Culture in Norfolk Category:Museums in Norfolk Category:Agricultural museums in England Category:Industry museums in England Category:Music museums in the United Kingdom Category:Transport museums in England Category:Steam museums in England Category:Amusement museums in the United Kingdom Category:Charities based in England ","title":"Thursford Collection"},{"id":"17292059","text":"Mike Florio (born June 8, 1965) is an American sportswriter, radio host, and television commentator.

He was educated at the Liverpool Institute and then joined his father's firm in 1883. ==Career== He was soon given the management of his father's corned beef cannery in Chicago. In 1890 he joined William in his new business of importing refrigerated meat from Argentina. The Union Cold Storage Company was to become one of the world's largest cold storage operations. They began to diversify into other food products and in 1906 also began importing from China. In 1909, they purchased two tramp steamers (Pakeha, renamed Broderick, and Rangatira, renamed Brodmore) for the China trade and converted them into refrigerated ships. This was the beginning of the Blue Star Line, which was registered in 1911. They set up their own cattle ranches in Argentina and Australia. The brothers acquired the Wave Hill Station, a cattle station in the Northern Territory of Australia, in 1914. At that time, legislation permitted Aboriginal Australian workers to be paid in tea, tobacco and other rations. The Vesteys refused to pay their workers in wages, leading to tensions and arguments from the beginning, which continued until the Wave Hill walk-off, a strike beginning in 1967 and lasting eight years. By 1925 the Blue Star Line was the largest refrigerated fleet in the world. In the United Kingdom the Vestey brothers owned 2,365 butcher's shops. Edmund succeeded William as chairman in 1940 and held the post until his death in 1953. He was created a Baronet in the 1921 Birthday Honours for his services in supplying food to British troops during the First World War. ==Personal life== Vestey married Sarah Barker on 15 August 1887; they had seven children. After their divorce, Sarah married Conservative Member of Parliament Sir William Lane-Mitchell. Vestey married Ellen Soward on 10 March 1926, and they remained together until his death in 1953 when he was then aged 87. They had no children. His ashes were buried in Liverpool Cathedral.

The present are a remnant of a much larger property that included Mount Hope, the traditional seat of the Wampanoag people. The main house on the farm was built in several stages, the earliest portion dating to c. 1745. Its builder was Isaac Royall, Jr., a noted merchant and owner of plantations in the West Indies. It was purchased in 1783 by William Bradford, who passed the property on to his children. Samuel W. Church purchased it from Bradford's heirs in 1837; he was a wealthy merchant from Taunton, Massachusetts and he made a major addition to the house in 1840. In 1917, the property was purchased by R. F. Haffenreffer, a wealthy industrialist and collector. The farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It is now operated as a bed and breakfast inn and function facility.

Born with a foot deformity, he could not do heavy labor. After learning to play harmonica at an early age, he moved to Piedras Negras, Mexico at age 13, where he played on radio station XEPN. He met Lonnie Glosson, his longtime musical associate, in 1936, and together they found work on radio in Little Rock in 1938. Later the pair worked for WCKY out of Cincinnati and played on syndicated radio. They also established a harmonica mail order business which ended up being enormously successful; they sold millions of harmonicas and played a major role in turning the harmonica into a widely popular instrument. Raney played with the Delmore Brothers in the years after World War II, then launched a solo career in 1948; his first two singles, \\"Lost John Boogie\\" and \\"Jack and Jill Boogie\\", both reached the Top 15 of the U.S. country charts. His 1949 single, \\"Why Don't You Haul Off and Love Me\\", was a No. 1 country hit and also hit the Top 40 of the pop charts. Raney played the Grand Ole Opry in 1953 and also worked on the California Hayride and the WWVA Jamboree. Late in the 1950s he worked as a DJ, record producer, and label owner, starting Rimrock Records. He wrote the 1959 Christian revival song \\"We Need a Whole Lot More of Jesus (and a Lot Less Rock and Roll)\\" which has been covered by numerous artists in a variety of styles: People!, The Greenbriar Boys and Linda Ronstadt, to name but three. He recorded country music into the early 1960s, including for his own label, and ceased the mail-order business in 1960. After returning to Arkansas, he recorded a gospel album called Don't Try to Be What You Ain't. Eventually he went into semi-retirement, running his own chicken farm and performing only occasionally in the late 1960s and 1970s. While he appeared sporadically on Hee Haw in the 1970s, he lost his voice in the 1980s and ceased performing; in 1990 he published an autobiography entitled Life Has Not Been a Bed of Roses. He died of cancer in 1993. Raney was honored posthumously with the Arkansas Country Music Award for \\"Lifetime Achievement\\" on June 3, 2018 at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. ==References== ==External links== *Wayne Raney and the Delmore Brothers, Sessionography, Discography, Biography *[ Wayne Raney] at Allmusic Category:1921 births Category:1993 deaths Category:American country singer-songwriters Category:Singers from Arkansas Category:King Records artists Category:Starday Records artists Category:Charly Records artists Category:American country harmonica players Category:20th-century American singers Category:American male singer- songwriters Category:Deaths from cancer in Arkansas Category:Deaths from cancer Category:Songwriters from Arkansas Category:Country musicians from Arkansas Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Wayne Raney"},{"id":"17292270","text":"Judith slaying Holofernes by Artemisia Gentileschi, 1614–18 Judith with the Head of Holofernes by Lucas Cranach the Elder, 1530 The account of the beheading of Holofernes by Judith is given in the deuterocanonical Book of Judith, and is the subject of many paintings and sculptures from the Renaissance and Baroque periods. In the story, Judith, a beautiful widow, is able to enter the tent of Holofernes because of his desire for her. Holofernes was an Assyrian general who was about to destroy Judith's home, the city of Bethulia. Overcome with drink, he passes out and is decapitated by Judith; his head is taken away in a basket (often depicted as being carried by an elderly female servant). Artists have mainly chosen one of two possible scenes (with or without the servant): the decapitation, with Holofernes supine on the bed, or the heroine holding or carrying the head, often assisted by her maid. In European art, Judith is very often accompanied by her maid at her shoulder, which helps to distinguish her from Salome, who also carries her victim's head on a silver charger (plate). However, a Northern tradition developed whereby Judith had both a maid and a charger, famously taken by Erwin Panofsky as an example of the knowledge needed in the study of iconography. For many artists and scholars, Judith's sexualized femininity interestingly and sometimes contradictorily combined with her masculine aggression. Judith was one of the virtuous women whom Van Beverwijck mentioned in his published apology (1639) for the superiority of women to men,Loughman & J.M. Montias (1999), Public and Private Spaces: Works of Art in Seventeenth-Century Dutch Houses, p. 81. and a common example of the Power of Women iconographic theme in the Northern Renaissance. ==Background in early Christianity== The Book of Judith was accepted by Jerome as canonical and accepted in the Vulgate and was referred to by Clement of Rome in the late first century (1 Clement 55), and thus images of Judith were as acceptable as those of other scriptural women. In early Christianity, however, images of Judith were far from sexual or violent: she was usually depicted as \\"a type of the praying Virgin or the church or as a figure who tramples Satan and harrows Hell,\\" that is, in a way that betrayed no sexual ambivalence: \\"the figure of Judith herself remained unmoved and unreal, separated from real sexual images and thus protected.\\" ==Renaissance depictions== Cristofano Allori, Judith with the Head of Holofernes (1613) Judith and Holofernes, the famous bronze sculpture by Donatello, bears the implied allegorical subtext that was inescapable in Early Renaissance Florence, that of the courage of the commune against tyranny. In the late Renaissance, Judith changed considerably, a change described as a \\"fall from grace\\"—from an image of Mary she turns into a figure of Eve. Early Renaissance images of Judith tend to depict her as fully dressed and desexualized; besides Donatello's sculpture, this is the Judith seen in Sandro Botticelli's The Return of Judith to Bethulia (1470–1472), Andrea Mantegna's Judith and Holofernes (1495, with a detached head), and in the corner of Michelangelo's Sistine chapel (1508–1512). Later Renaissance artists, notably Lucas Cranach the Elder, who with his workshop painted at least eight Judiths, showed a more sexualized Judith, a \\"seducer-assassin\\": \\"the very clothes that had been introduced into the iconography to stress her chastity become sexually charged as she exposes the gory head to the shocked but fascinated viewer\\", in the words of art critic Jonathan Jones. This transition, from a desexualized image of Virtue to a more sexual and aggressive woman, is signaled in Giorgione's Judith (c. 1505): \\"Giorgione shows the heroic instance, the triumph of victory by Judith stepping on Holofernes's severed, decaying head. But the emblem of Virtue is flawed, for the one bare leg appearing through a special slit in the dress evokes eroticism, indicates ambiguity and is thus a first allusion to Judith's future reversals from Mary to Eve, from warrior to femme fatale.\\" Other Italian painters of the Renaissance who painted the theme include Botticelli, Titian, and Paolo Veronese. Especially in Germany an interest developed in female \\"worthies\\" and heroines, to match the traditional male sets. Subjects combining sex and violence were also popular with collectors. Like Lucretia, Judith was the subject of a disproportionate number of old master prints, sometimes shown nude. Barthel Beham engraved three compositions of the subject, and other of the \\"Little Masters\\" did several more. Jacopo de' Barberi, Girolamo Mocetto (after a design by Andrea Mantegna), and Parmigianino also made prints of the subject. ==Baroque depictions== Judith beheading Holofernes (c. 1610), by Cornelis Galle the Elder (Warsaw University Library) Judith remained popular in the Baroque period, but around 1600, images of Judith began to take on a more violent character, \\"and Judith became a threatening character to artist and viewer.\\" Italian painters including Caravaggio, Leonello Spada, and Bartolomeo Manfredi depicted Judith and Holofernes; and in the north, Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, and Eglon van der Neer used the story. The influential composition by Cristofano Allori (c. 1613 onwards), which exists in several versions, copied a conceit of Caravaggio's recent David with the Head of Goliath: Holofernes' head is a portrait of the artist, Judith is his ex-mistress, and the maid her mother. In Artemisia Gentileschi's painting Judith Slaying Holofernes (Naples), she demonstrates her knowledge of the Caravaggio Judith Slaying Holofernes of 1612; like Caravaggio, she chooses to show the actual moment of the killing. A different composition in the Pitti Palace in Florence shows a more traditional scene with the head in a basket. While many of the above paintings resulted from private patronage, important paintings and cycles were made also by church commission and were made to promote a new allegorical reading of the story—that Judith defeats Protestant heresy. This is the period of the Counter-Reformation, and many images (including a fresco cycle in the Lateran Palace commissioned by Pope Sixtus V and designed by Giovanni Guerra and Cesare Nebbia) \\"proclaim her rhetorical appropriation by the Catholic or Counter-Reformation Church against the 'heresies' of Protestantism. Judith saved her people by vanquishing an adversary she described as not just one heathen but 'all unbelievers' (Jdt 13:27); she thus stood as an ideal agent of anti-heretical propaganda.\\" When Rubens began commissioning reproductive prints of his work, the first was an engraving by Cornelius Galle the Elder, done \\"somewhat clumsily\\", of his violent Judith Slaying Holofernes (1606–1610). Other prints were made by such artists as Jacques Callot. ==Modern depictions== Franz Stuck, Judith (1928) The allegorical and exciting nature of the Judith and Holofernes scene continues to inspire artists. In the late nineteenth century, Jean-Charles Cazin made a series of five paintings tracing the narrative and giving it a conventional, nineteenth-century ending; the final painting shows her \\"in her honoured old age\\", and \\"we shall see her sitting in her house spinning\\". p. 830. Two notable paintings of Judith were made by Gustav Klimt. The story was quite popular with Klimt and his contemporaries, and he painted Judith I in 1901, as a dreamy and sensual woman with open shirt. His Judith II (1909) is \\"less erotic and more frightening\\". The two \\"suggest 'a crisis of the male ego', fears and violent fantasies all entangled with an eroticized death, which women and sexuality aroused in at least some men around the turn of the century.\\" Modern paintings of the scene often cast Judith nude, as was signalled already by Klimt. Franz Stuck's 1928 Judith has \\"the deliverer of her people\\" standing naked and holding a sword besides the couch on which Holofernes, half-covered by blue sheets—where the text portrays her as god-fearing and chaste, \\"Franz von Stuck's Judith becomes, in dazzling nudity, the epitome of depraved seduction.\\" In 1997, Russian artists Vitaliy Komar and Alexander Melamed painted a Judith on the Red Square that \\"casts Stalin in the Holofernes role, conquered by a young Russian girl who contemplates his severed head with a mixture of curiosity and satisfaction\\". In 1999, American artist Tina Blondell rendered Judith in watercolour; her I'll Make You Shorter by a Head is explicitly inspired by Klimt's Judith I, and part of a series of paintings called Fallen Angels.Sarah Henrich, \\"Living on the Outside of Your Skin: Gustav Klimt and Tina Blondell Show Us Judith\\", in As part of his first series of portraits of women An Economy of Grace, American artist Kehinde Wiley depicts Judith as an African American woman, barefoot and wearing a gown designed by Givenchy. Typical of his style, Wiley's Judith is surrounded by a pattern of brightly colored flowers and due to the brightness of her surroundings, it only later becomes apparent that she is holding the severed head of a white woman. ==Gallery== File:Trictrac checker Louvre OA166.jpg12th century French ivory gaming piece File:Giuditta di donatello 04.JPGDonatello, Judith and Holofernes, 1457–64 File:Sandro Botticelli - Retour de Judith 1.JPGSandro Botticelli, The Return of Judith to Bethulia, 1470 File:Andrea Mantegna 099.jpgAndrea Mantegna, Judith and Holofernes, 1490s File:Nuremberg chronicles f 69r 2.pngWoodcut illustration for the Nuremberg Chronicles, 1493 File:Conrat Meit.jpgAlabaster figure by Conrad Meit, c. 1525 File:Judith with the Head of Holofernes.jpgSebald Beham engraving of 1547 File:Giorgione - Judith - Eremitage.jpgGiorgione, Judith (c. 1505) File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 038.jpgMichelangelo, Judith carrying away the head of Holofernes, in the Sistine Chapel (1508–1512) File:Renania, giuditta al banchetto nella tenda di oloferne, 1510-30 ca.JPGStained glass window, c. 1510–1530 File:Judith with the head of Holofernes.jpgFede Galizia, Judith with the Head of Holofernes, 1596 File:Judith Beheading Holofernes-Caravaggio (c.1598-9).jpgCaravaggio, Judith Beheading Holofernes (c. 1598–1599) File:Baglione Judith.jpgGiovanni Baglione, Judith and the Head of Holofernes (1608) File:Artemisia Gentileschi Judith Maidservant DIA.jpgArtemisia Gentileschi, Judith and Her Maidservant with the Head of Holofernes (c. 1625) File:Carlo Saraceni 001.jpgCarlo Saraceni, Judith and the head of Holofernes (c. 1615) File:Judith with the Head of Holofernes Antiveduto Gramatica.jpgAntiveduto Grammatica, Judith with the Head of Holofernes (1620–1625) File:Antonio Gionima - Judith Presenting Herself to Holofernes - 62.45 - Minneapolis Institute of Arts.jpgAntonio Gionima, Judith Presenting Herself to Holofernes (1720s).

They were relegated at the end of the season. They were knocked out of the League Cup in the third round and knocked out of the FA Cup in the quarter-finals (sixth round). Gareth Southgate continued as manager under chairman Steve Gibson. Before the season, Southgate was considering whether to continue with the traditional role of a club captain, but later decided that Emanuel Pogatetz would continue being captain following his performances in the final ten games of the previous season. ==Team kit and sponsors== Middlesbrough's kits were produced by Erreà for the fifteenth and final season, and sponsored by GPS manufacturer Garmin. Back at the start of 2008, the club ran a poll to decide whether the club should return to the white band of prior seasons. The votes came out in favour of the band, and it was then up to the fans to decide between three different designs. The winning shirt was announced on 7 May 2008 to be choice A – the white band with a curl. The away kit, announced on 17 July 2008, would see a return to the popular black and blue striped kit worn by Jack Charlton's side of the mid-1970s. { border=\\"0\\"   } ==Transfers== ===Summer transfer window=== Middlesbrough net spending over the 2008 summer transfer window was almost nil, as money spent bringing in new faces was matched by money brought in through player sales, though it had only been half a year since Afonso Alves' club-record signing during the previous season. The first transfer for the season was thought to have been announced back in May, with Maidstone United's England youth international defender Chris Smalling signing a two-year contract. However, the player changed his mind, the contract was cancelled, and later the same month he decided to join Fulham instead as it was closer to his home. Mark Schwarzer's departure at the end of the previous season saw Gareth Southgate announce that Brad Jones and Ross Turnbull would fight it out for the first choice goalkeeper's shirt, and thus no goalkeepers were amongst the signings during the summer, much to the initial dismay of Boro supporters. Liverpool goalkeeper Charles Itandje later revealed that Middlesbrough tried to sign him on loan during the summer, but that his club refused to allow him to move. The club's first signings of the summer were both announced on the same day in early July, with Dutch forward Marvin Emnes arriving in a deal worth €4 million (£3.2 million at the time) and French midfielder Didier Digard arriving from PSG for €5 million (£4 million). Next up came a series of midfield departures. After six years on Teesside, Dutch midfielder and former club captain George Boateng left for newly promoted Hull City for a fee of £1 million, while academy graduate and England under-21 midfielder Lee Cattermole signed for Wigan Athletic in a deal worth £3.5 million, rising to £4 million based on appearances. Boro's midfield options were further reduced when Hérold Goulon, signed two years earlier, left without playing a senior game for the club. Wellington Phoenix's New Zealand international left-back Tony Lochhead joined the club on a week-long trial at the end of July but the club eventually decided against offering him a contract. Finally, just a week before the season began and after only a year on Teesside, Luke Young moved to Aston Villa for a fee of £5.5 million rising to £6 million based on appearances. Fans were disappointed with the sale but, coupled with Young's wish to make the move, the club felt the offer was too good to turn down, having only paid £2.5 million for him a year earlier. A replacement was brought in when Middlesbrough completed the £3 million signing of Arsenal's Justin Hoyte before the first game of the season, but not in time for him to be eligible to play. The right-back signed a four-year contract. ===January transfer window=== In mid-November, before the window opened, former youth goalkeeper David Knight returned to the club on a month-to-month contract as cover following an injury to third-choice keeper Jason Steele. Middlesbrough and MFK Košice came to an agreement that would see talented young players exchanged between the two clubs. It was verbally agreed that 17-year-old Peter Gál-Andrezly would join the Middlesbrough reserve side for the second half of the season. Two further players, Serbian Under-21 international Nemanja Matić and 18-year-old Juraj Hovančík, came to England on a trial period during December. During December, the club told reporters that there were no funds available for transfers, meaning they needed to sell before they could buy, although at the same time the club were not looking to move on any of their best players either. This became a key element of the January transfer window. The transfer window was once again dominated by reports linking Stewart Downing with a move to Tottenham Hotspur, but this time there was a basis for such reports. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp announced his interest in Downing towards the end of December. With the transfer window open, Spurs put in a bid for the player, reported to be around £6 million, which was described as \\"derisory\\" by Middlesbrough chief executive Keith Lamb. An improved offer was submitted and immediately rejected. Middlesbrough told Tottenham that the player was not for sale and any further interest they had would not be entertained, while chairman Steve Gibson told the media that no senior player would be leaving the club in January. Shortly afterwards, Downing submitted a written transfer request. The request was considered before being rejected. Downing's father, Stewart Senior, revealed his son's reasons for submitting his transfer request, stating that \\"when he signed his new contract [in February 2008] he was assured that there would be significant investment in the squad\\", arguing this had not happened. Reiterating their position that they would not be letting any senior players leave the club during January, the club rejected a £4.5 million offer from Portsmouth to take Gary O'Neil back to his former club. With the club falling into the relegation zone and a number of players ruled out through injury and suspension, Middlesbrough eventually moved into the transfer market on 22 January, with their first move bringing in striker Marlon King on loan from Wigan Athletic until the end of the season. King had been on loan at Hull City but his time there was cut short after he fell out with their manager. A day later, Mido made a move in the opposite direction, also on a loan until the end of the season. Crystal Palace midfielder Ben Watson underwent a medical at Middlesbrough, after the two clubs agreed a £2 million fee. However, Wigan's bid for the player was also accepted and Watson decided to move there instead. Following a successful loan spell, Academy graduate Tom Craddock made a permanent move to Luton Town. The striker started only one game during his time on Teesside before completing his £80,000 move. ===End of season=== Ross Turnbull left the club at the end of the season on a free transfer, to join Chelsea, after rejecting several contract offers, citing that he wanted to play regular first team football. The goalkeeper played less than 30 first team games for Middlesbrough and had been dropped earlier in the season in favour of teammate Brad Jones. David Knight also left at the end of the year, to join Darlington. Out of contract winger Graeme Owens left the club to join Scottish Premier League side Kilmarnock. ===Summary=== ====In==== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:left; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - !C2DDFF\\" width=125px Date !C2DDFF\\" width=170px Player !C2DDFF\\" width=190px Previous Club !C2DDFF\\" width=125px Fee !C2DDFF\\" width=30px Ref -  4 July 2008  Marvin EmnesSparta Rotterdam£3.2 million -  4 July 2008  Didier DigardParis Saint-German£4 million -  16 August 2008  Justin HoyteArsenal£3 million -  4 November 2008  David KnightMansfield TownFree  -  November 2008  Onisiforos RoushiasEnosis Neon Paralimni  } : Roushias made his under-18 debut on 15 November 2008.

Changes saw Julio Arca move from 3 to 20, with Andrew Taylor moving from 33 to 3. Marvin Emnes took the number 11 shirt, vacated by Jérémie Aliadière's move to number 10. Didier Digard received the vacant number 8 shirt. Ross Turnbull and Brad Jones stayed at 21 and 22 respectively, leaving the number 1 shirt empty. Before they left, Luke Young, Lee Cattermole and Hérold Goulon were given numbers 2, 27 and 37 respectively. Justin Hoyte became the new number 2 upon his arrival, while Nathan Porritt was given number 33 before the away match at Portsmouth.

The visitors fielded different outfield sides in both halves, with Brad Jones the only player to appear in both halves. Jonathan Franks put Middlesbrough ahead in the second half, before York scored two goals to take the lead. David Wheater scored a late equaliser to leave the score tied at 2–2. Next up came a trip to Portugal for the Algarve Challenge Cup. The mini- league format would see 3 points awarded for a win and 1 for a draw, with an extra point for every goal scored. Boro's first game was against Scottish champions Celtic. The first half finished goalless, and the manager again elected to make many changes, with only Ross Turnbull and Josh Walker remaining on the field. Jérémie Aliadière put Boro ahead late in the second half after the Celtic goalkeeper's clearance rebounded back off of the Boro forward. Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink leveled the game during stoppage time to end the game at 1–1. It was a similar scenario in the next game, versus Vitória Guimarães. Nine changes at half time saw only Turnbull and Adam Johnson retain their places. Boro conceded another late goal to lose the game 0–1. Boro ended the competition with two points – one for a draw, and one for their solitary goal. Boro picked up their first pre-season win with victory over Carlisle United. French pair Jérémie Aliadière and Didier Digard scored Boro's goals. Aliadière scored within a minute of the second half starting, before Carlisle levelled almost instantly. Digard struck a great shot to win Boro the game. A trip to Scotland for a second year running saw a remarkable comeback versus Hibernian. Hibs took a two-goal lead thanks to Steven Fletcher's goals in either half. Afonso Alves, on as a substitute, put Boro back in the game with a goal within a minute of coming on. Wheater's header levelled the game before Alves got his second goal to win the game 3–2 for Boro. There was bad news however as Julio Arca was injured and ruled out for six weeks. A young Boro side cruised to a comfortable victory over Darlington in the next friendly. Adam Johnson opened the scoring by converting a penalty, with Marvin Emnes scoring his first goal for the club to leave the visitors two-up at the break. A Lewis Hardman own goal and a goal from Tony McMahon put Boro further in front, before Johnson scored his second of the game to complete a comfortable 5–0 victory. Pre-season finished in fantastic fashion, albeit their final game didn't start off in the best way. Sparta Rotterdam opened the scoring after just two minutes, but then Boro took charge. Alves scored three minutes later to level the game. A further three minutes down the line, Aliadière put Boro in front. Josh Walker got the third on thirteen minutes, and Alves got his second two minutes later. Stewart Downing made it five for the visitors just after the half-hour mark, while Rhys Williams added another shortly after half-time. No further goals were forthcoming and the game finished 6–1. ===Results=== Note: Results are given with Middlesbrough score listed first.

Brad Jones was named as Gareth Southgate's new number 1, but there was no place in the starting line-up for any of the club's summer signings, with Didier Digard and Marvin Emnes on the bench, while Justin Hoyte, only signed on the day, was ineligible. An early chance for David Wheater was controversially ruled out for a foul, but he converted again in the second half for Boro's first goal of the season. Mido, on as a substitute, converted a cross/shot from fellow substitute Digard to put the home side two goals up, before Robert Huth conceded an own goal late in stoppage time. There was heartbreak for Middlesbrough at Anfield, as late goals from Liverpool saw them come from behind to win 2–1. Ross Turnbull started in goal after Brad Jones dislocated a finger during the warm-up, but the side were otherwise unchanged. It was goalless until Mido, again on as a substitute, put the visitors ahead after seventy minutes. Meanwhile, Justin Hoyte made his debut as a substitute for the injured Andrew Taylor. Boro looked set to record their first win at Anfield for thirty-two years until Jamie Carragher's shot deflected off Emanuel Pogatetz for an own goal with five minutes to go. Steven Gerrard's goal four minutes into stoppage time completed the comeback. Stoke City were Middlesbrough's next opponents when they came to the Riverside. The visitors frustrated the home side until Amdy Faye was sent off for a two-footed tackle on Mohamed Shawky; Afonso Alves converted the resulting direct free kick. Stewart Downing missed the chance to extend Boro's lead when his penalty kick struck the bar, before for the third time in three league games, Middlesbrough conceded an own goal, this time courtesy of Justin Hoyte. Five minutes from the end, the home side's lead was restored with Tuncay's first goal of the season. The 2–1 victory extended Boro's home record to five wins from the last five home games in all competitions. It also gave the club its best Premier League start in nine years. Gareth Southgate picked up the Premier League Manager of the Month award for August, becoming only the second person after Stuart Pearce to pick up both the Player and Manager of the Month awards, and the first Middlesbrough manager to win the award since Terry Venables in January 2001. ===September=== The international break left Middlesbrough without Tuncay and Shawky after both picked up injuries, while David Wheater could only make the bench after suffering from tonsillitis, so Digard, Riggott and Mido came in. Nathan Porritt was named as a substitute for the first time on an all-Academy bench. Portsmouth were the more dominant side throughout the match, however it was Boro who took the lead after Mido's fourth goal of the season. Jermain Defoe scored a brace for the home side in the second half to give them a 2–1 win. Digard picked up an injury and had to be taken off while Boro thought they should have had a penalty after Downing was brought down in the box. Middlesbrough were on top for much of the game at Sunderland's Stadium of Light, but ultimately came away with nothing from the 2–0 defeat. Mido was set to start, but was injured in the warm-up and was replaced by the initially- benched Alves. Downing and Alves created a host of good chances but none were converted. With sixteen minutes to go before the final whistle, Aliadière was brought down in the penalty area, but Downing sent his penalty kick flying over the bar for his second penalty miss of the season. The visitors were punished for their inability to score when Michael Chopra scored two goals in the final ten minutes. Gareth Southgate's 100th game in charge, which saw Stewart Downing named captain for the first time in Emanuel Pogatetz' absence was a frustrating one. They saw two chances cleared off the line by former Middlesbrough player James Morrison, a shot hit the bar, and a penalty shout turned down as they squandered plenty of chances to beat Tony Mowbray's West Bromwich Albion. Instead, they were left to pick up the pieces after a 1–0 defeat courtesy of Jonas Olsson. ===October=== After going through September with four defeats from four games in all competitions, Middlesbrough picked up their first away win of 2008 against Wigan Athletic. Grounds and Riggott came into the side as Taylor and Huth were out injured, and the weakened defence earned Boro their first clean sheet of the season. Aliadière picked up his first Premier League goal of the season in the dying minutes – Boro's 600th in the Premier League – to snatch a 1–0 victory. Following another international break, Middlesbrough's next game was at home to Chelsea. Both sides were missing first-team players, but the quality of Chelsea's reserves showed as they outclassed Boro and ran out 5–0 victors. Hoyte was ruled out injured before the game and so Grounds covered at right-back, while Alves started the game on the bench. The home side were just a goal behind going into half-time, but four goals in twenty-two minutes after the break left Boro dejected, including an own goal from Wheater that was originally credited to Salomon Kalou. John Johnson came on to make his debut as a substitute for Grounds around the hour mark on a \\"horrendous day\\" for his club. Middlesbrough next travelled to Ewood Park, looking for their second away win in a row. The away side were boosted by the return of Pogatetz and Tuncay from suspension and injury respectively, although Mido picked up an injury on the morning of the game. Although Blackburn had plenty of chances, the first fell to Boro's Aliadière, who hit the bar early on, while Tuncay had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside. Afonso Alves smashed the ball past Paul Robinson on 74 minutes, while Marvin Emnes finally made his Premier League debut after 84. Once again though, Boro conceded a late goal as the home side levelled the game at 1–1 three minutes into injury time. Looking for a much improved performance after their last home game, the midweek game versus Manchester City provided the response that both fans and manager were looking for. City had plenty of possession and chances but Ross Turnbull kept his first home clean sheet of the season. Afonso Alves made it two goals in two games after converting a penalty – Boro's 6000th league goal. There was also a welcome surprise in stoppage time as Boro made it 2–0 with a late goal courtesy of Gary O'Neil – his first for the club. ===November=== Middlesbrough came back from a goal down against West Ham United in their next game to draw the game at 1–1. West Ham dominated much of the game before tactical substitutions from manager Gareth Southgate improved the home side's performance and led to substitute Mido getting Boro's goal – his fifth of the season – late in the second half. An Aston Villa side looking to move into the Champions League spots on their home ground were Middlesbrough's next opponents. Boro gained two goals through defensive mistakes, with Tuncay converting them both, but they weren't the only chances they had, as Alves missed a sitter from three yards out. Villa levelled the game three minutes after Boro's first goal but the visitors won it 2–1 two minutes from the end of normal time. Both Everton and Middlesbrough went into the next match on the back of a four-game unbeaten run, and both sides came out of it with their unbeaten runs intact after a 1–1 draw at Goodison Park. Gary O'Neil got his second goal of the season after just eight minutes to put the visitors ahead, but Boro old-boy Yakubu brought Everton level midway through the second half. The club's unbeaten run came to a disappointing end after a poor home display against Bolton Wanderers. Middlesbrough found themselves two goals down after ten minutes, but had a number of chances to try to get back into the game. Pogatetz got a goal back for the home side after 77 minutes, but just 63 seconds later, Bolton scored their third to wrap up a 3–1 win. When Taylor was substituted during the game, he and a supporter got into an angry exchange of words, a situation for which Taylor later apologised. Next up came the Tyne-Tees derby match at home to Newcastle United. Both sides had chances to win the match but neither one took them, as the game ended in a 0–0 draw. The match was marred for the second year running by racist abusive chanting aimed at Boro striker Mido. Two men were later arrested after being identified by CCTV cameras. One man pleaded guilty to the offence and was fined, while another pleaded not guilty and is awaiting a hearing. Both Middlesbrough and The FA were disappointed by the decision not to issue a banning order, though the club did ban the individual from the ground. ===December=== Nick Barmby marked his 500th career appearance against one of his former clubs as Middlesbrough visited Hull City for the first ever top-flight match between the two sides. Hull lined up with former Boro captain George Boateng in midfield after his departure during the summer. The previous four league meetings between the two sides had all ended in 0–0 draws, and it looked like the match was heading for another until Tuncay opened the scoring on 79 minutes. Boro's lead didn't last long however, as Bernard Mendy's shot hit the post and rebounded off of goalkeeper Ross Turnbull to go down as an own goal. It got worse for the visitors as just a few minutes later, Hull were awarded a soft penalty when Wheater tangled with Geovanni – a challenge which also saw the Middlesbrough defender receive a red card. TV replays showed that Geovanni was offside when the ball was played to him, but nothing was awarded by the assistant referee. Marlon King converted the penalty to give Hull a 2–1 victory. With Wheater suspended, and both Taylor and Hoyte out injured, Middlesbrough had to field a patched-up back four for their home game versus Arsenal, with Tony McMahon returning to the starting line-up after a long time out with injuries, alongside Huth and Riggott, both of whom were returning from injury. There was also a start for Adam Johnson on the right hand side of midfield, as Alves was dropped to the bench. Emmanuel Adebayor put Arsenal into the lead after quarter of an hour, but Aliadière got on the end of a wonderful cross from Tuncay to head home the equaliser twelve minutes later. The home side were then denied a penalty when Johnson was brought down in the box, but the referee didn't award anything. Both sides had further chances but the game ended 1–1. Middlesbrough produced their worst away performance of the season thus far against Fulham, as they slumped to a 3–0 defeat. Julio Arca was lucky not to be red-carded for a late over-the-top challenge on Andy Johnson, earning only a yellow card. Jimmy Bullard got the opening goal after Turnbull could only parry Bobby Zamora's shot. Next, for the third time in three games, a penalty decision went against Boro, as Tony McMahon was adjudged to have handled the ball after the ball struck his arm from close range. Turnbull guessed the right way but was unable to save Danny Murphy's penalty kick. Clint Dempsey got the third to round off Fulham's win. An improved performance was expected but didn't come on Boxing Day, when Everton visited the Riverside Stadium. Middlesbrough rarely troubled the visitors, but striker-less Everton could still only manage a 1–0 win. The performance finally improved but the result stayed the same when Middlesbrough went to Old Trafford, where Matthew Bates started a Middlesbrough game for the first time since the end of the 2005–06 season. Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson had spoken before the game, hoping to banish the rift that existed between the two clubs. Things probably weren't helped when Pogatetz, defending a corner, put his hands around the back of Cristiano Ronaldo's neck a corner and the United player went down, claiming a penalty. The spat continued when the players walked off the pitch for half time. Dimitar Berbatov's goal was the decisive moment in the game when he fired home to give his side a 1–0 victory, and left Middlesbrough hovering above the relegation zone on goal difference and without a win in eight games. ===January=== When league football returned to the Riverside for the derby clash with Sunderland, a lot had happened in the interim. The club had recorded an overdue victory – against Barrow in the FA Cup (see FA Cup section), with Afonso Alves getting back amongst the goals, while the transfer window had seen Stewart Downing's transfer request rejected along with offers from Tottenham, while Portsmouth's moves for Gary O'Neil had all been rebuffed. Josh Walker made his full league debut, starting in central midfield – more than two years after his substitute appearance in the last game of 2005–06, and Downing played centrally, supporting Alves. Downing and Alves linked up well to put Boro ahead before half time. The central midfield partnership of Walker and Digard were both forced off with injuries picked up from opposition challenges, meaning Matthew Bates was pushed into an unfamiliar central midfield role. Sunderland pressed more and more in the second half, and got their equaliser courtesy of Kenwyne Jones. The visitors could have gone on to win the game but Adam Johnson made a backheeled clearance off the goal line, and McMahon won a last-ditch tackle on Djibril Cissé after he was put through on goal on the stroke of full-time. The 1–1 draw extended Boro's winless run to nine games. The winless run entered double figures when Middlesbrough went down 3–0 away to West Bromwich Albion. Injuries to Pogatetz and Walker meant a reshuffle in both defense and midfield, and after just four minutes Boro were behind. The defense appealed in vain for offside as Chris Brunt fired home a heavily deflected shot. Another deflection saw Robert Koren's strike roll past Ross Turnbull to put the home side two goals up early in the second half. It got worse for the visitors had Didier Digard sent off for appearing to jump into a challenge on Borja Valero. Koren got his second goal not long after to add to Boro's misery. West Brom's win over Boro, added to their win earlier in the season, meant they completed their first ever Premier League double. The Middlesbrough players reaction to Digard's sending off lead to The FA charging the club with failing to control their players. A handful of Boro players surrounded referee Mark Halsey to protest as he tried to push Digard off of the pitch, with Halsey dropping one of his cards as a result. Middlesbrough finally dropped into the relegation zone following Tottenham's victory over Portsmouth the following day. Middlesbrough went into their next game following a cup win away at Wolverhampton Wanderers, but that didn't signal a change in fortunes in the league. Set pieces were once again the side's undoing. Away at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge, Middlesbrough started with new loan signing Marlon King as sole striker, with five men in midfield. Boro held out until 58 minutes into the game, when Salomon Kalou put his side ahead. He got his second on 81 minutes, condemning Middlesbrough to a 2–0 defeat. Gareth Southgate elected to make changes for the home tie versus relegation rivals Blackburn Rovers. Brad Jones returned for his first league start since the opening day of the season as Ross Turnbull was dropped to the bench, while the side featured five centre backs – Wheater, Huth, Riggott and Pogatetz at the back, while Matthew Bates once again operating in central midfield alongside the quickly-recovered Josh Walker. The set-up allowed Middlesbrough to gain their first clean sheet for two months, but limited themselves to a solitary shot on target over the course of the game. The 0–0 draw earned Boro a point but they fell to 19th in the table, with Blackburn joining them in the relegation zone in 18th, following Stoke's victory over Manchester City. ===February=== A trip to the City of Manchester Stadium for Saturday's early kick-off was next on Middlesbrough's agenda. Manchester City's new signing Shay Given made a solid debut, denying Afonso Alves with four fine saves. Both sides had chances throughout the game but City were the only one to convert – Craig Bellamy's shot across goal went between Robert Huth's legs and beyond the reach of Brad Jones into the corner of the net. Boro's defense remained solid when Wigan came to the Riverside Stadium, but continued to struggle in attack. A line-up unchanged from the midweek FA Cup draw with West Ham was forced into a change midway through the first half. Summer departure Lee Cattermole's strong-but-fair challenge on Didier Digard forced the midfielder off with injuries to both legs that would likely rule him out for the remainder of the season. Neither side could muster enough chances for a goal and the game ended 0–0. Middlesbrough's dire run stretched to fourteen games without a win, with only one goal in nine games. A letter from the club's Safety Officer, Sue Watson, was handed out to supporters in block 53A. It was intended to ask supporters to refrain from constantly standing and to stop banging on the plastic sheeting on the back of the stand, but its bad wording caused much anger among fans who interpreted it as asking them to sit down and be quiet. The club was forced to apologise to the fans and clarify the confusion. A victory in their FA Cup fifth-round replay sent Middlesbrough into the home match with Liverpool with optimism that their disastrous run of form in the league would finally come to an end, and their hopes came true. Liverpool were riding high in second place, while Boro began the day in second bottom. A stroke of luck put the home side ahead as Xabi Alonso diverted the ball into his own net from a corner. Tuncay doubled the advantage in the second half, and they could have had more as the visitors left themselves open at the back as they tried to find a way back. Brad Jones kept a fourth consecutive home clean sheet and Boro moved out of the relegation zone with their 2–0 win, while Liverpool had now failed to win at the Riverside for seven seasons. ===March=== Middlesbrough were brought back down to Earth with a big loss away to Tottenham Hotspur. The home side came into the game on the back of a Carling Cup final defeat, while Boro remained unchanged. The mood was set within the first fifteen minutes as Robbie Keane and Roman Pavlyuchenko gave the home side an early two-goal lead, while Aaron Lennon made it three five minutes before half time. Tuncay twice had the ball in the back of the net but both times he was caught narrowly offside. Lennon got his second goal of the game late in the second half to condemn Boro to a heavy 4–0 defeat. Fellow relegation-battlers Portsmouth were next up as they visited the Riverside Stadium. Middlesbrough were caught napping at a corner on the half- hour mark and Peter Crouch put the visitors ahead. The second half saw Boro dominate the game but once more spurned plenty of chances. Things got worse as Matthew Bates was sent off after picking up a second yellow card when he was adjudged to have dived in the penalty area. Four minutes into injury time, Marlon King grabbed his first Middlesbrough goal as volleyed in from close range. Alves had a chance to hand Boro a win with the last kick of the game as he was through on goal but David James saved his shot and the game ended 1–1. Towards the end of the game, before the equaliser, some fans began to chant \\"we've only got one player\\", referring to Tuncay's efforts compared to his teammates. Southgate came out to say he was unhappy with the chant, calling it \\"disrespectful\\" and saying \\"we survive as a club and as a town by everyone pulling together.\\" Middlesbrough next visited Stoke City's Britannia Stadium in another important game. Like much of the season, the team once again failed to score. As expected, Rory Delap's throw-in's were Stoke's main offensive weapon. Although they dealt with most of them well, Ryan Shawcross headed one home on 84 minutes, giving them a vital 1–0 win over their relegation rivals. The loss left Middlesbrough four points from safety, with the battle against relegation taking its toll on the club's morale. ===April=== April began as March had ended with a defeat, this time at the hands of Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium. Middlesbrough's Gary O'Neil had cancelled out Bolton's opener to make the scores 1–1 but bad defending saw the home side score three more. The 4–1 defeat left Boro languishing in 19th place, five points from safety. The home tie against Hull was labelled as a \\"must-win\\" tie as they battled to avoid relegation. Middlesbrough got off to a perfect start as Tuncay opened the scoring after just three minutes, but Hull quickly hit back through Manucho. Boro regained the lead after Matthew Bates scored his first ever goal for the club, stabbing home from a corner. All three vital points were secured after a defensive slip by former Boro captain George Boateng let Marlon King in to make the score 3–1. Results later that day left Boro in 19th place but they were now only two points from safety. Another home tie followed a week later, and Boro did everything but score against a Fulham side featuring former Boro keeper Mark Schwarzer in goal. The keeper kept out several good efforts but his side's steady defence frustrated the home side and meant the game ended 0–0. Middlesbrough's dire away form continued at the Emirates Stadium as a Cesc Fàbregas double condemned them to a 2–0 defeat, a club record tenth straight away loss. Boro had reason to complain about the opening goal when an offside player was interfering with the goalkeeper's view, but the visitors failed to really test the opposition goal. ===May=== Despite Middlesbrough's placing in the relegation zone, they went into the home tie against Manchester United unbeaten at home in 2009. Jérémie Aliadière had an early low shot saved by Ben Foster, but other than that failed to threaten a United side who rested several key players in preparation for their upcoming UEFA Champions League match. Ryan Giggs and Park Ji-Sung scored the visitors' goals and left Boro still entrenched in the relegation battle. The \\"must-win\\" game at relegation rivals Newcastle's St James' Park was likely to determine both sides' chances of avoiding the drop. Tuncay's early shot rebounded off of the Newcastle keeper and then off Habib Beye, who put the ball into his own net for an own goal, giving the visitors the lead after just three minutes. Steven Taylor brought the scores level six minutes later as Boro conceded another poorly defended corner. The game was close, with both sides having several good opportunities, before substitute Obafemi Martins scored for Newcastle straight after coming on. Peter Løvenkrands settled the game as he put in his side's third goal. The 3–1 win was Alan Shearer's first as Newcastle manager and Middlesbrough's eleventh away defeat in a row. With Middlesbrough three points from safety, and a considerable inferior goal difference with just two games to go, relegation looked even more likely. A great escape looked on the cards when Middlesbrough went a goal up at home to Aston Villa in their penultimate game of the season, courtesy of an overhead kick from Tuncay. Boro were dealt a huge blow however, when Stewart Downing was brought down under a challenge from Stiliyan Petrov, and needed treatment. He was able to briefly continue before needing to be substituted. John Carew brought Villa level when Boro failed to get started again in the second half. The visitors looked most likely to score again as they continued to press forward, while Boro needed to get forward themselves in their relegation fight. The game eventually ended in a 1–1 draw, with Boro needing a miracle in the final game to avoid the drop. In order to stay in the top flight, Middlesbrough needed relegation rivals Newcastle and Hull City to lose, while they needed a five-goal swing to Hull in goal difference. Stewart Downing's injury kept him out of a Premier League game for the first time since November 2006, also throwing doubt on a possible summer transfer, and Tuncay captained the side. Boro had to go for it, but instead they fell behind. Gary O'Neil temporarily brought his side level, but they again conceded and lost 2–1. With Newcastle and Hull both losing, the opportunity to escape was there for Middlesbrough, but they had failed to take it. Their twelfth consecutive away defeat extended the club record, and equalled a Premier League one, and saw their eleven-year run in the top flight ended, with the club needing to prepare for the next season in the Football League Championship. ===Results=== Note: Results are given with Middlesbrough score listed first.

It turned out to be a comfortable victory for the home side. Gareth Southgate fielded a slightly weakened side, though handed Marvin Emnes his debut, along with first starts for Justin Hoyte and Didier Digard. Mido made his record three goals in three games after he opened the scoring, before Digard got his first goal for the club. Jérémie Aliadière added the third before Gavin Tomlin pulled one back for Yeovil. Emnes got a goal on his debut just after half-time, then Adam Johnson got the final goal to make it 5–1. Meanwhile, there was a full debut for Rhys Williams and a home debut for Josh Walker as they both came on as substitutes. Middlesbrough were handed a tough away tie against Manchester United for the third round. Brad Jones started in goal in place of Ross Turnbull, while Robert Huth was rested. Cristiano Ronaldo was making his first start of the season for United, and marked it with the opening goal. Substitute Adam Johnson put Boro level, before Emanuel Pogatetz was sent off for a rash challenge on Rodrigo Possebon. Ryan Giggs and Nani made it a 3–1 win for the home side. ===Results=== Note: Results are given with Middlesbrough score listed first.

Middlesbrough went into the game without a win in eight league games. They named a strong line-up while giving Josh Walker his first Boro start as he lined up in the centre of midfield. The game saw Middlesbrough dominate in chances, but poor finishing meant they only won 2–1, with both of the home side's goals coming from Afonso Alves – his first goals for over two months – and both assisted by Stewart Downing. Middlesbrough's failures in front of goal meant they got a late scare as Barrow pulled a goal back after more bad defending at a set piece, but they failed to take a chance to level the game late on. A sour moment of the game saw Jérémie Aliadière injured and ruled out for two months. Boro still hadn't registered a league win by the time their fourth round tie came around, while their opponents Wolverhampton Wanderers sat top of the Football League Championship. Considering the two sides' recent form and with Middlesbrough playing away from home, many pundits were predicting a home win. It was more of a shock then that Middlesbrough were the side to advance through to the fifth round courtesy of a 2–1 victory. Boro winger Adam Johnson spurned several chances before Afonso Alves chipped the goalkeeper on the stroke of half-time. Wolves headed home an equaliser in the second half, but substitute Marvin Emnes fired in off the post seven minutes from time. Middlesbrough faced an away tie with West Ham United in the fifth round. Stewart Downing's first goal of the season put the visitors ahead midway through the first half, while Afonso Alves spurned several chances to extend their lead. Once again, a set piece was Middlesbrough's downfall, as Hérita Ilunga headed in the home side's equaliser after 83 minutes. The 1–1 draw meant a replay would be played at the Riverside Stadium. The replay was played in front of a small but very vocal Boro crowd who were fired up by an unfortunately worded letter from the club seemingly asking them to sit down and be quiet in their last home game. The fans didn't have to wait long for a goal as in the fifth minute Stewart Downing curled an unstoppable free-kick over the wall and into the top-right hand corner of the net. Tuncay doubled the lead with a volley as West Ham's defense failed to clear the ball. The visitors dominated the possession but could not convert it to goals, and with Middlesbrough threatening on the counterattack, they couldn't afford to neglect their defensive duties. In the end, the 2–0 was enough to see Middlesbrough through to the last eight for the fourth consecutive season. Middlesbrough faced Everton in the sixth round. Boro were unchanged for a fourth successive game coming into the match and were the better side in the first half. David Wheater rose to head home a Matthew Bates cross on the stroke of half time to send them in at half time as the happier side. Everton's assistant manager, and former Middlesbrough coach, Steve Round gave an angry team-talk to his side at half time which fired his side into a much better second half performance. It took only five minutes for Everton to get an equaliser – Marouane Fellaini heading home over a stranded Brad Jones. Six minutes later, Louis Saha scored Everton's second. Middlesbrough did little to threaten for the rest of the tie. The 2–1 defeat left Gareth Southgate lamenting his side's inability to see matches out. ===Results=== Note: Results are given with Middlesbrough score listed first.

First team coach Steve Harrison left the club in early July following seven years at the club. Steve Agnew stepped up from being Reserve team coach to replace Harrison, while Academy coach Martin Scott took over as new Reserve team coach. Former midfielder Mark Proctor, who had also had prior spells as a Reserve and youth coach with the club, returned to Middlesbrough as under-18 coach during mid-September. { colspan=3Key: - { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:left; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\\" - !colspan=2 C2DDFF\\"Executive members - !width=150pxRole !!width=140pxPerson - Chairman  Steve Gibson - Chief Executive  Keith Lamb - Chief Operating Officer  Neil Bausor - Chief Financial Officer  Alan Bage } { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text- align:left; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\\" - !colspan=2 C2DDFF\\"Senior team management - !width=150pxRole !!width=140pxPerson - Manager  Gareth Southgate - Assistant manager  Malcolm Crosby - First team coach  Colin Cooper - First team coach  Steve Agnew - Reserve team coach  Martin Scott - Goalkeeping coach  Stephen Pears } { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text- align:left; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\\" - !colspan=2 C2DDFF\\"Academy team management - !width=150pxRole !!width=140pxPerson - Academy manager  Dave Parnaby - CCFFCC\\" Academy coach  Mark Proctor - Academy coach  Craig Hignett - Academy coach  Kevin Scott } width=\\"5\\" { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:left; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\\" - !colspan=2 C2DDFF\\"Medical - !width=180pxRole !!width=140pxPerson - Head of medical  Grant Downie - Head of sports science  Chris Barnes - Head of physical development  Frank Nuttall - Conditioning coach  Nick Allamby - Senior physiotherapist  Chris Moseley } { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text- align:left; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\\" - !colspan=2 C2DDFF\\"Recruitment - !width=180pxRole !!width=140pxPerson - Head of senior recruitment  Dave Leadbeater - First team scout  Gordon McQueen - First team scout  David Mills - Head of Academy recruitment  Ron Bone } ==Other events== ===Compensation case=== On 11 August 2008 it was announced that former Manchester United youngster Ben Collett, who five years earlier had a \\"career-ending\\" injury as a result of a tackle in a game versus Middlesbrough's reserves, had been awarded more than £4.5 million in compensation. The fee would be paid by Middlesbrough's insurers. An appeal against the ruling, heard in June, failed. ===Debt reduction=== Middlesbrough's debts, reported to be around £85–90 million, were cut by two thirds over the summer following relegation. The reduction would leave the club in a healthier financial position and better placed for the Football League Championship, though Steve Gibson announced the debt reduction before relegation was confirmed and denied relegation was part of a cost-cutting plan. ==References== Category:Middlesbrough F.C. seasons Middlesbrough ","title":"2008–09 Middlesbrough F.C. season"},{"id":"17292357","text":"thumb Mang Ke (芒克, original name Jiang Shiwei), born in 1951, is a prominent Chinese poet and co-founder (with Bei Dao) of the underground literary journal Jintian (Today), which appeared irregularly between 1978 and 1980 before being shut down by the Chinese Government.

He had previously served three terms as the Mayor of College Park from 1963 to 1969, a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of Maryland, 1967–68 and a Presidential Elector for Maryland in 1972. ==Early life== Gullett was born in Springfield, Illinois to parents Noah and Clara Virgin (Willett) Gullett. He served in the US Army Air Corps in World War II as a B-17 pilot based in England. Gullett married Helen Jaunita Hammons in Springfield on March 20, 1943. He graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, after which he settled in Prince George's County with an interest in metallurgy; Gullett held 21 US patents in the area. The couple's first son, William, Jr., was born in St. Louis, Missouri, followed by Christopher and twin daughters, Michele and Nicole, in Washington, D.C. Gullet managed metallurgical projects at Diamond Shamrock and was president of Chicago Development Corp., a metallurgical research firm in Riverdale, Maryland. ==Public service== An interest in zoning issues that affected his home in College Park, Maryland influenced Gullett's entry into community affairs. He was elected to the city council in 1961, and became mayor two years later, serving for three terms until 1969. Gullett was elected as County Executive in a 1971 special election to choose the county's first executive under a new home rule charter, defeating one Republican and five Democratic candidates. Although initially supported by a broad coalition of Republicans and a pro-charter, anti-development group led by local activist Julian C. Holmes, he lost support because of perceived poor performance and constant conflict with the Democratic-controlled County Council. He lost his bid for reelection in 1974 when the Prince George's County Democratic Party swept Republicans from power, defeating every Republican running for state or local office. On leaving office, Gullett was asked to serve in a USAID mission and did so, working as the Assistant Director for Management in Haiti from 1982 to 1985. ==Personal life and death== Gullett's son, William, was shot and killed on February 16, 1969, while on duty as a young Prince George's County police officer.

The ballet premiered on May 4, 2005 at the New York State Theater. Wheeldon later directed and choreographed the musical adaptation of the An American in Paris film. ==Production== Choreographer Christopher Wheeldon was first invited to choreograph the musical version of the film An American in Paris, though the project was abandoned. Wheeldon, who said George Gershwin's orchestral piece of the same name was \\"a great piece of classical music\\" in addition to being a film score, decided to make a ballet version instead. On the choreography, Wheeldon said he wanted to create a more \\"balleticize\\" version with his own choreography, as the film's choreography is simple and uninteresting, but the cinematography made the film work on screen. He said he considered to have one of the dancers be off pointe, but went against it as it is a ballet. The set, designed by Adrianne Lobel, was inspired by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso. Holly Hynes and Natasha Katz were brought in to design costumes and lighting respectively. An American in Paris premiered on May 4, 2005 at the New York State Theater, the three lead roles were originated by Carla Körbes, Jenifer Ringer and Damian Woetzel, and Andrea Quinn conducted the orchestra. The ballet received mixed reviews. A New York Times reviewer wrote that Wheeldon was \\"clever in capturing idealized Paris street life\\" though \\"the dance never quite coheres.\\" Another New York Times reviewer wrote that the scenes were unmemorable but \\"well crafted that the overall result is amiable entertainment.\\" Wheeldon later claimed he \\"never felt entirely happy\\" with the ballet. ==Musical== Wheeldon later went on to direct and choreograph musical adaptation of the An American in Paris film, which was Wheeldon's directorial debut. The musical opened at the Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris in 2014, Palace Theatre, Broadway in 2015, and Dominion Theatre, West End in 2017.

A driving position was sited on a platform above the engines, with dual sets of controls for driving in either direction to avoid the need to turn the vehicle. A canopy was fitted over the driving position, and wooden dropsides and ends were fitted at the front and rear of the vehicle. Some examples had rails added to support a tarpaulin over the load spaces. Towing hooks were fitted at both ends of the chassis.

Copies of the film exist in Moscow and in the George Eastman House Motion Picture Collection. In 2012 the National Film Preservation Foundation awarded a grant to preserve a print that has Czech language intertitles which were translated back into English. ==Synopsis== Cassie Cook had played the opium selling game until fate and a bad shuffle compelled her to team up with her biggest rival, Jules Repin, and then the horror of the whole thing weighed down upon her and she determined to quit and leave China before it was too late. She had bought a lot of new gowns on credit, believing in Repin's promise that he had a big shipment of opium coming in which would give them both plenty of money. Now those gowns had to be paid for and Cassie's chum, Molly Morton, taken out of the country before a growing taste for opium got a final hold on her. So Cassie bet on a sure thing in the races and lost. \\"But I'm going to get you out, Kid,\\" she told Molly, and as a last resort she went back to the game. Up in Hang Chow, a trouble- infested village near the poppy fields, she tried to trace the shipment Repin expected. A white man was there — supposed to be opening an abandoned mine. It was her business to find out if he was a government inspector seeking the den of the dope dealers. She posed as a novelist, and he, believing in her, told her that he was there to fight the dope menace. Cassie felt like a cheat of the lowest order and she turned against her comrades, but they, by trickery, found out what she had learned from the mine superintendent. In a flash they set the little world ablaze with rebellion and the soul of Cassie Cook was cleansed in the fires of remorse as she battled for what she believed was the right cause, and out of it came a love that was clean and honorable. ==Cast== * Priscilla Dean as Cassie Cook / Lucille Preston * Matt Moore as Capt.

Donagh MacDonagh gives the following sleeve note 'One of a group of Execution Songs written in Newgate Cant or Slang Style in the 1780s, others being The Kilmainham Minuet, Luke Caffrey's Ghost and Larry's Ghost in which, as promised in the seventh stanza of the present ballad, Larry comes \\"in a sheet to sweet Molly\\"!' The Newgate Cant or Slang Style is not unique to Dublin and all the cant and slang is to be found in Partridge's A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English (1937). Nubbing cheat or Nubbin chit is cant for the gallows, while Darkmans is cant for night. Joyce, working out of Thomas Dekker's The Gul's Hornbook and The Belman of London (1608), wrote: > White thy fambles, red thy gan > And thy quarrons dainty is. > Couch a hogshead with me then. > In the Darkmans clip and kiss.James Joyce, Ulysses, p. 59, Writing in \\"Three Centuries of Canting Songs and Slang Rhymes (1536-1896)\\" (published 1896), John S Farmer asserted that neither the song's date nor its author were definitely known. He gave 1816 as an approximate date, and wrote \\"According to the best authorities, Will Maher, a shoemaker of Waterford, wrote the song. Dr. Robert Burrowes, Dean of St. Finbar’s Cork, to whom it has been so often attributed, certainly did not.\\" In Ballads from the Pubs of Ireland, p. 29, James N Healy attributes the song to a William Maher (Hurlfoot Bill), but doesn't note when Maher lived. However, the song is attributed to a 'Curren' in The Universal Songster, 1828, this possibly being the witty barrister John Philpot Curran or JW Curren. ==Text== The Newgate cant in which the song was written was a colloquial slang of 18th-century Dublin, similar to the thieves' cant still used in London (an example of the London use is seen in the 1998 film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels). This is only one of a group of execution songs written in Newgate Cant or slang style somewhere around 1780, others being The Kilmainham Minuet, Luke Caffrey's Ghost and Larry's Ghost, which, as promised in the seventh verse, \\"comes in a sheet to sweet Molly\\".Harte, Frank, Songs of Dublin, 1993, Ossian Publications, A French translation of the song called La mort de Socrate was written by Francis Sylvester Mahony, better known as \\"Father Prout\\" for Fraser's Magazine, and is also collected in Musa Pedestris, Three Centuries of Canting Songs and Slang Rhymes [1536―1896], collected and annotated by John S Farmer. ==Melody== The tune is not an Irish one, but stems from the first line of an English song, The Bowman Prigg's Farewell. The British Union-Catalogue of Early Music (BUCEM) lists four single sheet copies with music, all tentatively dated c 1740, and there is another copy in the Julian Marshal collection at Harvard. However, the tune To the Hundreds of Drury I write is in the ballad opera The Devil of a Duke, 1732, Air No 4 Bowman Prig is mentioned in song No 22 of the ballad opera The Fashionable Lady, 1730, but this may not be a reference to the song. \\"Bowman Prigg\\" is a cant term for a pick-purse. The melody and first verse of To the Hundreds of Drury I Write are in John Barry Talley's Secular Music in Colonial Annapolis, 1988. The Night Before Larry Was Stretched is just possibly a reworking of, or may at least have been inspired by To the Hundreds of Drury. ==Recordings== *The song provides the narrative basis for the film O'Donoghue's Opera , filmed in 1965 with members of The Dubliners; \\"The Night Before Larry was Stretched\\" was performed by Johnny Moynihan. *The song was recorded by Frank Harte for the album Dublin Street Songs (1967). As in this recording, the last line of each verse is often performed spoken for effect. *Elvis Costello recorded the song for 1996's Common Ground – Voices of Modern Irish Music. *Recorded by The Wolfe Tones for Irish to the Core (CD-S-52033). ==See also== * List of Irish ballads * List of songs about Dublin ==References== ==External links== * O'Donaghue's Opera – A film based around the song Category:Folk ballads Category:Irish songs Category:Irish folk songs Category:Traditional ballads ","title":"The Night Before Larry Was Stretched"},{"id":"17292855","text":"Matao is a village in Chipwi Township in Myitkyina District in the Kachin State of north-eastern Burma.Maplandia world gazetteer ==References== ==External links== *Satellite map at Maplandia.com Category:Populated places in Kachin State Category:Chipwi Township ","title":"Matao, Chipwi"},{"id":"17292870","text":"Claudine Rosalie Gras (October 22, 1878 - January 29, 1936), professionally known as Rose Dione, was a French-American actress who appeared in numerous silent era and pre-code films.

It was originally developed as the High Mobility Combat Vehicle, or HMCV (not to be confused with the JGSDF MCV, which was also called the \\"HMCV\\" for a short time). ==Development== An XR311 with six-tube recoilless rifle cluster. Development of the XR311 commenced as a private venture in 1969, with the first of two prototypes being completed in 1970. The vehicle was developed as a possible replacement for the by that time over ten years old M151 jeep, years prior to the Lamborghini Cheetah and other competitors, including AM General's design for the HMMWV, which was eventually selected. As a result of the trials of these two prototypes the US Army purchased ten improved or second generation models in 1971. Of these ten vehicles, four had a TOW missile installation for use in the anti-tank/AFV role, three had an M2HB machine-gun for use in the reconnaissance role and three had 7.62mm M60 machine guns and the crew armor kit for use in the escort/security role. These trials were completed in 1972. They were then tested by the 2nd Armored Division. In 1974 they were also tested in the 2nd Armored Reconnaissance Scout Vehicle competition along with a number of vehicles including the original FMC Technologies and Lockheed Martin designs. It has been stated that an XR311 with TOW missile installation cost around $50,000. The XR311 was designed to carry out a wide variety of roles including anti-tank, reconnaissance patrol, convoy escort, command and control, medivac, military police, mortar carrier, internal security and forward air defense communications vehicle. ==Variants== Detail of the six-tube recoilless rifle cluster There were several models of the XR311: * Support: A 106 mm Recoilless rifle mounted above the crew compartment, and a total of six rounds of ammunition, * Anti-tank: TOW installation with a total of 10 TOW missiles * Reconnaissance: Fitted with a ring-mounted .50cal M2HB machine gun with a 360 degree traverse * Convoy Escort/ Security Vehicle: This could be provided with a pintle-mount 5.56mm or 7.62 mm GPMG's, XM174 automatic grenade launchers and various other similar weapons. These weapons could also be mounted on the reconnaissance model on the ring mount. The following kits were available for the basic vehicle: crew compartment armor kit, consisting of a high-hardness steel doors, side body panels, toe panel, firewall, bulletproof windshield and bulletproof side windows, armored radiator, armored fuel tank, top and door kit (waterproof fabric with plastic windows and hinged doors) various communications installations, high output alternators (100 and 180 amp), litter-carrying kit, jump seat for two additional passengers, explosion- resistant reticulated foam fuel-tank filler, radial tires or foam-filled run- flat tires, extreme climate kits for winterization or desert temperatures, tool kit and portable fire extinguisher. ==Overview== The XR311 is built around a tubular-steel frame safety roll-cage which protects the passenger compartment if the vehicle rolls over. This cage is covered by a heavy-gauge sheet metal forming the skin of the vehicle. An internally mounted electrical extraction winch with a capacity of can be mounted at the front of the vehicle if required, and the 2-piece windshield can be removed to provide greater visibility and protect from flying glass fragments. The glass halves are stored in a mounting bracket on the hood until needed again. The passenger compartment is in the center of the vehicle with the driver on the left and the passenger seat to the right. There is space for of cargo behind the passenger seats. The engine and transmission are at the rear of the hull and there is an external load-carrying platform above this which can take a maximum load of . The minimum ground clearance is 11 inches, and a full length skid pan protects the hull and drivetrain, which allows the vehicle to slide over obstacles. The transmission is a Chrysler A-727 \\"TorqueFlite\\" torque converter automatic, with three forward and one reverse gears. The XR311 is a full-time 4WD vehicle. \\"Trak-lok\\" limited-slip differentials with a 5.89:1 drive ratio are used front and rear, and a lockable center differential ensures traction to all wheels. The fully independent suspension uses modified Dana 44 centersections, and used many off the shelf parts from the front wheel drive Oldsmobile Toronado / Cadillac Eldorado (e.g., CV joints and boots, spindle and bearings, and 11 inch disk brakes), and is of a double-wishbone design with a torsion-bar spring and hydraulic telescopic shock absorber at each station. A stabilizer bar is provided for the rear suspension to limit body roll. Maximum speed is 80-90 mph for vehicles with the 318ci engine, dropping to 67 mph at full load. Acceleration was 12 seconds 0-60 mph time, falling to 10 seconds with the 360ci engine. The steering is power-assisted and the tubeless tires feature a special high-pressure inner tire tube, which provides a built-in backup in case air pressure is lost from the main tire itself, as well as providing lateral support to eliminate leakage from the tire bead during high speed cornering. The tires are self-cleaning, meaning mud and other materials are flung free from the tread grooves by centrifugal force, rather than sticking to the tire (more commonly known as a \\"mud tire\\"). Disc brakes are fitted on all four wheels. The electrical system is 24V DC, and two batteries with a capacity of 45 Amp/Hr are provided. The alternator is of the integral rectifier and regulator type. The XR311 is provided with a heavy duty towing pintle as well as a trailer wiring harness receptacle. It is air-transportable and can be air-dropped. ==See also== * Lamborghini Cheetah * Interim Fast Attack Vehicle ==References== * http://www.meisterburg.com/xr311.htm * http://www.bellum.nu/armoury/FMCXR311.html * http://svsm.org/gallery/xr311 * http://www.angelfire.com/nb2/jeeppickups/humvee.html * http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/129-1302-february-2013-backward-glances/ * FMC XR311 patent US3709314 * FMC XR311 patent US3858901 Category:Military vehicles of the United States Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Off- road vehicles Category:Military light utility vehicles Category:FMC Corporation ","title":"FMC XR311"},{"id":"17292901","text":"PubGene AS is a bioinformatics company located in Oslo, Norway and is the daughter company of PubGene Inc.

Designated by the Smithsonian trinomial 25SF1, it was one of the first pre-contact Native American sites to be formally investigated in the central plains. The archaeological sites are located atop the eponymous butte west of Robidoux Pass and Gering, Nebraska. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961. The site is not open to the public. ==Description== The eponymous Signal Butte rises about above the plains in the watershed of the North Platte River in westernmost Nebraska. The butte is covered by a layer of gravel and windblown soil, in which there are three distinct layers of cultural material. The oldest layers have been dated to 5,000 years ago, in the Middle Archaic Period. Finds at the site include stone projectile points and drills, and bone tools such as awls. The butte first came to the notice of professional archaeologists in 1931, when a local amateur notified William Duncan Strong of materials found there. Strong led investigations of the butte in 1931 and 1932, during which numerous artifacts were found, as well as features such as storage pits, fireplace hearths, and other signs of repeated habitation. The site is one of the first from which a radiocarbon date was obtained, although the exact dates of habitation have been the subject of some controversy and ongoing debate. The site was investigated further in the 1940s and 1950s, at which time it was established that the sites probably represented seasonal hunting camps. ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in Nebraska ==References== Category:National Historic Landmarks in Nebraska Category:Geography of Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Nebraska Category:National Register of Historic Places in Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska ","title":"Signal Butte"},{"id":"17292958","text":"CECS may refer to: * Centro de Estudios Científicos, a multidisciplinary research centre in Valdivia, Chile * Canine epileptoid cramping syndrome, a disease affecting dogs and also known as Spike's Disease * Computers in education and cognitive systems ","title":"CECS"},{"id":"17292967","text":"Mansan is a village in Chipwi Township in Myitkyina District in the Kachin State of north-eastern Burma.Maplandia world gazetteer ==References== ==External links== *Satellite map at Maplandia.com Category:Populated places in Kachin State Category:Chipwi Township ","title":"Mansan, Chipwi"},{"id":"17292971","text":"Karim Belhocine (born 2 April 1978) is a retired French footballer who played as a midfielderKarim Belhocine  FOOTGOAL : Le webzine n°1 de l'actualité du Football Belge et International and currently managing Charleroi. ==Biography== Belhocine was born in Vénissieux, France, to Algerian parents.

Nadal came back from 4-2 down and saved two match points in the final set before triumphing 6–7(0–7), 7–6(7–5), 6–4, 2–6, 7–6(7–5). The win, which took over five hours, took Nadal to 53 straight wins on clay, matching Guillermo Vilas' record. It also put the 19-year-old level with Björn Borg on 16 titles as a teenager. Federer, who had beaten Nadal only once in five attempts before the Rome Masters, started well, clinching a high- quality first set after playing a near-perfect tiebreak. And the world number one was on top for most of the second set but Nadal's trademark battling qualities kept him in it and out of the blue, he somehow earned a set point at 5–4. The teenager was unable to take that one but edged another tiebreak to draw level. The momentum was by now with Nadal and he looked to have made a decisive move when a break at 2–2 gave him the third set. He had chances to break early in the fourth set but the Spaniard let his struggling opponent off the hook and Federer made him pay. The top seed raced through the fourth set and took control of the decider by taking a 4–1 lead. The Rome crowd, including Prince Albert of Monaco and Omar Sharif, looked on in disbelief as first Nadal levelled at 4–4 then fought off Federer again at 5–6. Nadal's double fault, the first of the match from either player, helped Federer earn two match points but the world number one's usually reliable forehand failed him on both occasions and the Spaniard survived. Federer still had chances to win in the tiebreak which he led 5–3, in particular when he mishit a forehand which would have given him a 6–3 lead. However, Nadal underlined his talent on the dirt by clinching the tiebreaker and wrapping up his fifth win in six attempts over Federer. ==Seeds== A champion seed is indicated in bold text while text in italics indicates the round in which that seed was eliminated. ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top Half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ===Bottom Half=== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ==Qualifying== ===Seeds=== ===Qualifiers=== ===Qualifying Draw=== ====First Qualifier==== ====Second Qualifier==== ====Third Qualifier==== ====Fourth Qualifier==== ====Fifth Qualifier==== ====Sixth Qualifier==== ====Seventh Qualifier==== ====Eighth Qualifier==== ==External links== *Singles draw *Singles qualifying draw Italian Open – Singles Men's Singles ","title":"2006 Italian Open – Men's Singles"},{"id":"17293021","text":"Estrella is a mixed-use master-planned community located in Goodyear, Arizona, in the United States.

Also within that year he graduated to the Shandong's senior team and played within the top tier of Chinese football. In 1979 Shandong were allowed to participate in the Chinese National Games, which they won; however, despite being a loyal servant to the club throughout his entire career and often seeing them being title contenders, this was his only medal he won before he retired in 1988 due to hepatitis. ==Management career== ===Shandong=== After Yin retired he remained with Shandong, where he became their youth team manager in 1990. After a brief stint he attracted the interests of the Chinese Football Association and worked with the Chinese U-17 team in 1991. After that short spell he returned to the Shandong youth team and went on to win the 1993 National Youth League title. This then saw him promoted to managing the senior team of Shandong Taishan where he won the Chinese FA Cup in 1995. His time at the club ended at the end of the 1997 league season after he was unable to improve the club's league results; however, he remained faithful towards the team and returned to the club near the end of the 1998 league season to aid the club in their relegation battle. While he did not remain as manager, he did stay on as the administrative manager of the team when they won the national championship in 1999 before leaving the club. ===Changchun Yatai=== In 1999, Yin became the manager of lower league club Changchun Yatai, and during his reign he guided the club to a runners-up position within the second tier at the end of the 2001 Chinese league season; however, the club were denied promotion after it was discovered that certain players and coaches had fixed matches. Yin remained as coach and at the end of the 2003 league season went on to win the division championship. ===China U-20=== Yin coached China national under-20 football team in 2004, where he coached them in the AFC U-19 Championship tournament, where they eventually became the runner-up in that competition against Korea Republic. Yin was praised as a shrewd tactician and for encouraging many members of that team to subsequently graduate to the national side. ===Qingdao Jonoon=== He coached another Shandong club Qingdao Jonoon from 2005 to 2008. ===China=== Yin became the last minute care-taker coach for the Chinese U-23 team, which had already qualified for the Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics as hosts. During his short time as coach for the China U-23 team he was assigned with the task of coaching the team to a minimum of three competitive games against New Zealand, Belgium and Brazil. However, due to his short time, he couldn't implement his ideas in the team, and China were eliminated within the group stages. On 9 December 2008, he was called as Interimscoach for China after Vladimir Petrovic stepped down in the wake of China's exit from the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification in the Asian Zone. Yin was assigned to coach the two imminent 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification matches to be held in the 14th and 21 January 2009 as well as the immediate friendlies leading up to the qualifiers where his reign as coach was mixed with a loss against Syria and a win against Vietnam. ==Honours== ===Manager=== Shandong Taishan *Chinese FA Cup: 1995 Changchun Yatai *Chinese Jia B: 2003 ==References== ==External links== *Xinhua Net's page on Yin Tiesheng (in Chinese) *Biography at sports.sina.com.cn Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Jinan Category:Chinese footballers Category:Chinese football managers Category:Footballers from Shandong Category:Qingdao Jonoon F.C. managers Category:Shandong Luneng Taishan F.C. players Category:Shandong Luneng Taishan F.C. managers Category:China national football team managers Category:Changchun Yatai F.C. managers Category:Association footballers not categorized by position ","title":"Yin Tiesheng"},{"id":"17293064","text":"The Day of Faith is a 1923 American silent drama film directed by Tod Browning.The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1921-30 by The American Film Institute, c.1971 The film is considered to be lost. ==Cast== * Eleanor Boardman as Jane Maynard * Tyrone Power, Sr. as Michael Anstell (credited as Tyrone Power) * Raymond Griffith as Tom Barnett * Wallace MacDonald as John Anstell * Ford Sterling as Montreal Sammy * Heinie Conklin as Yegg Darby (credited as Charles Conklin) * Ruby Lafayette as Granny Maynard * Jane Mercer as Red Johnston's child * Edward Martindel as Uncle Mortimer * Winter Hall as Bland Hendricks * Emmett King as Simmons * Jack Curtis as Red Johnson * Frederick Vroom as Marley Maynard * John Curry as Isaac * Henry Hebert as Samuel Jackson (credited as Henry Herbert) * Miles McCarthy as Kelly (credited as Myles McCarthy) * Robert Dudley as Morris ==References*Additional lobby poster *Stills at silentfilmstillarchive.com *Stills at silenthollywood.com Category:1923 films Category:1923 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Tod Browning Category:Lost American films Category:Lost drama films Category:1923 lost films ","title":"The Day of Faith"},{"id":"17293089","text":"The Public Image is a novel published in 1968 by Scottish author Muriel Spark and shortlisted for the Booker Prize the following year.http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/220 It is set in Rome and concerns Annabel Christopher, an up-and-coming film actress.

The gardens and archaeological site are located roughly 20 miles northeast of central Mexico City, Mexico. Texcotzingo is adjacent to the Aztec capital city of Texcoco and acted as the summer imperial gardens, resplendent in all the royal trappings of the time, including imperial and courtly residences and fantastic waterworks. Tetzcotzingo however should also be seen as a hedonist/sacred space, agricultural space, political statement or emblem, performance space, and earthworks.Avilés (2006) ==History== Structure known as \\"el Baño del Rey\\" Texcotzingo was designed and created by Nezahualcoyotl, the then-ruler of Texcoco, in the 15th century. These imperial gardens were used to collect and display plant and animal specimens, aiming towards an encyclopedic understanding of the flora and fauna of the whole of the Aztec empire, as well as the cultivation of medicinal plants. They were conceived as a place for sensual gratification on one hand and as a recreation of paradise on the other. Dedicated to the rain god Tlaloc, (He Who Makes the Plants Spring Up), Texcotzingo was designed by incorporating Aztec myths through sculpture depicting gods and observances of sacred numbers (such as the number 52). New hydraulic projects and terrace gardens transformed the previously un-arable land into lush edible gardens containing the three ubiquitous staples of the Americas: maize, beans, and squash. Waterways were also used to connect pools imbued with historical and mythical significance through monolithic sculptures and symbolic representations, therefore reasserting the Aztec's empire connection to mythic cosmographies and preceding empires. One clear example is a bath/pool flanked by three frogs representing the three city states of Tenochitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan, the cities which made up the Aztec Triple Alliance. The baths in the Texcotozingo site were carved from solid rock and were surrounded by lush gardens and waterworks. Aesthetic manifestations of practiced myths, vital to Aztec culture, also occupied an important place at Texcotzingo, with spaces designed for the performance of poetry, singing, dancing and oration. This transformation of the mountain of Texcotzingo into art, and the perception that the mountain itself was art, in that it held special significance (mythical or otherwise) in pre-Columbian culture, classifies Texcotzingo as an earthwork. There is also a tangible connection between the ideas of art, culture and nature manifested in rocks and sculptures, existing flora and plantings, etc. in the design of Texcotzingo. ==Notes== ==References== : : ==External links== Category:Aztec sites Category:Texcoco (altepetl) Category:Botanical gardens in Mexico Category:Gardens in Mexico Category:Archaeological sites in Mexico Category:Natural history of the State of Mexico Category:Protected areas of the State of Mexico Category:15th-century establishments in the Aztec civilization ","title":"Texcotzingo"},{"id":"17293135","text":"Bombie may refer to: ==Chiefs of Clan Maclellan== Any of a number of chiefs of Clan MacLellan: *Thomas Maclellan of Bombie *Patrick Maclellan of Bombie ==Other== * Bombie the Zombie, a fictional character in the Scrooge McDuck universe * Mother Bombie, the main character in the Elizabethan era stage play of the same name ==See also== * Bomby ","title":"Bombie"},{"id":"17293149","text":"The Old Congregational Church is an historic church building on Greenville Road (Rhode Island Route 116) in the Smithville-North Scituate village of Scituate, Rhode Island.

She has been considered a scholar on the subject of animation and an experienced animator herself. Bond's animations and short films have been shown at film festivals including the Sundance Film Festival. Bond is also known for her architectural animation installations. She shown work at Exeter Castle in 2010 and created a prototype animation for the Smithsonian. Bond's hand-painted films are held in the film collection at the Museum of Modern Art. == Biography == Bond was born in Canada and raised in Oregon. She reports that she had been drawing and recognized for her art since she was in kindergarten. Bond graduated from Portland State University (PSU) with a bachelor's degree in 1971 and later with a master's degree in education in 1976. Bond struggled with making her creative visions a reality while she was in college, and believed that teaching art was the only way she could make a living. Later, she received a masters of fine arts from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where she studied experimental film-making. On September 18, 2001, Bond created and registered a business for her animations in Oregon under the name Rose Bond Moving Pictures. Currently, Bond teaches at the Pacific Northwest College of Art (PNCA) in Portland, Oregon, where she is an associate professor and a lead faculty in Animated Arts. == Work == Bond started out using traditional methods of creating animation with flipbooks and inking by hand. Later she began to experiment with using computers. She uses digital tablets, like those made by Wacom, to teach her students at PNCA. Her current work is mainly public art featuring site-specific animations which use a combination of hand- drawn and digital art. Bond's earlier films deal with feminist issues, questioning whether one gender should rule over another through the medium of animated Irish legends. In these stories (Deirdre's Choice, Macha's Curse and Cerridwen's Gift), based on figures from Irish legends, Bond painted directly onto clear 35 mm film to create the effect of animation. Her hand-drawn and hand-painted images for these films were considered dramatic by reviewer, Wendy Jackson, who also felt that Bond's choice of heroines showed a \\"feminist sensibility.\\" Bond's first animation installation was staged in 2002 in Portland, using the historic Seamen's Bethel Building. Her installation work \\"challenges people to think about how they perceive time, space, and memory.\\" When beginning a new animation projection, Bond researches the history of the building and incorporates it into the projection. She visits each spot where she will be creating an installation, exploring the buildings and gleaning interesting historical facts to use in her animations. In Broadsided!, her animation commissioned by the Exeter Arts Council for Exeter Castle, Bond discovered the story of a man who was hung for stealing sheep which she uses in her animated story. One of her most shown installations, Intra Muros (2007), was shown at the first Platform Animation Festival in Portland and consists of projected animations in the windows that loop every eight minutes. Intra Muros invites viewers to wonder what is going on in the spaces they cannot see. Bond's installation, Gates of Light, reached audiences that were not familiar with experimental film. Bond's projected animations also have the unique capacity to turn the mundane building people see everyday into something special and to challenge with her work, a viewer's \\"sense of familiarity.\\" Bond is excited about the potential for animation to change the \\"cultural landscape.\\" === Films === * Electroflux (2008) * Ward of Court: Country of Origin (2007) * Memoria Mortalis (2000) * Rain Tiles (1997) * Deirdre's Choice (1995) * Remote Control (1992) * Mallacht Macha / Macha's Curse (1990) * Cerridwen's Gift (1987) * Nexus (1984) * Gaia's Dream (1982) === Installations === * Intra Muros (Zagreb) (2013) * Intra Muros (Toronto) (2011) * Broadsided!

Retrieved on 28 October 2017. ==Schools== Gibraltar has fifteen state schools, one MOD school, one private school. ==Further education== * Gibraltar College (formerly known as the Gibraltar College of Further Education) ==Higher education== The Arms of The University of Gibraltar On 31 March 2015 the government of Gibraltar announced the adoption of the University of Gibraltar Act and The University of Gibraltar, the first university of the territory, opened in September 2015. Previously, all students must study elsewhere at degree level or equivalent and certain non-degree courses. The Government of Gibraltar operates a scholarship/grant system to provide funding for students studying in the United Kingdom. All Gibraltarian students follow the student loans in the United Kingdom, where they apply for a loan from the Student Loans Company which is then reimbursed in full by the Government of Gibraltar. In 2008, there were 224 Gibraltarian students enrolled in British universities, the highest figure to that date.Abstract of Statistics 2008 ==Teaching== All teacher-training takes place in British universities and colleges, where students can opt to enrol on a teaching degree or a Post Graduate Certificate of Education (PGCE). Students obtaining Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) in any constituent country of the United Kingdom and who have a registration number issued by the DfES (UK) is eligible to teach in Gibraltar. ==Early history== The Duke of Kent during his brief period as a resident Governor of Gibraltar recommended that schools be set up for the regiments. These were reorganised in 1916 by General Don into a school at Buena Vista and another on Castle Street, Gibraltar. The priority given to the schools however can be judged by their closure in 1828 when the Barrack Master was demanding the premises. This was unfortunate as examinations were in progress and the schools were open to better off civilians who could afford the dollar a week charges. Of the 180 children available, 70 had been attending. The regrowth of the schools can be assigned to Mary Ann Rule who was the wife of William Harris Rule a newly arrived Methodist missionary in Gibraltar. They had both learnt Spanish and Mary was asked to teach one child to read. She was joined by her brother and then other Catholics and then Jewish children. Rule noted that he became unawares the founder of the first charity school in the garrison\\". The Jews eventually withdrew on religious grounds and Rule was involved when the Lieutenant Governor Sir William Houston set up the first official free school on Flat Bastion Road in 1832 and he sent his own children there. The following year Rule restarted his school requiring his pupils to attend Methodist services each Sunday. In reply the Catholics arranged for two teachers from the Congregation of Christian Brothers to start the Christian Brothers School in 1835. Rules school however was popular across the faiths but this came to a head in 1839 when his school marched down Main Street on the centenary of Methodism with 400 children of all faiths and denominations waiving messages in support of Methodism. ==See also== * Education in England * University of Gibraltar ==References== ==External links== * List of schools in Gibraltar.

The term can also be used to describe forces protecting lines, such as communication lines, behind an army.Oxford English Dictionary: *rearguard n.1.b: A body of troops detached from the main force to bring up and protect the rear, esp. in the case of a retreat. Also fig. and in extended use.\\" *\\"rear guard, n.2: Chiefly Brit. The guard at the rear of a railway train.\\" Even more generally, a rearguard action may refer idiomatically to an attempt at preventing something though it is likely too late to be prevented; this idiomatic meaning may apply in either a military or non-military context. ==Origins== The term rearguard (also rereward, rearward) originates from the medieval custom of dividing an army into three battles or wards; Van, Main (or Middle) and Rear. The Rear Ward usually followed the other wards on the march and during a battle usually formed the rearmost of the three if deployed in column or the left-hand ward if deployed in line. ==Original usage== The commonly accepted definition of a rearguard in military tactics was largely established in the battles of the late 19th century. Before the mechanization of troop formations, most rearguard tactics originally contemplated the use of cavalry forces.Burnham, W.P. (Lt.) Manual of Guard Duty, U.S. Army, Syracuse, New York: C.P. Bardeen, Publisher (1893) pp. 92-95 This definition was later extended to highly mobile infantry as well as mechanized or armored forces. Narrowly defined, a rearguard is a covering detachment that protects the retreating main ground force element (main body), or column, and is charged with executing defensive or retrograde movements between the main body and the enemy to prevent the latter from attacking or interfering with the movement of the main body.Bond, Paul Stanley (Lt. Col.) and Crouch, Edwin Hunter (1st Lt.), New York: The American Army and Navy Journal (1922) Tactics: the practical art of leading troops in war, pp. 247-253Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, 5-166: Spoiling Attack, Army Field Manual FM 3-90 (Tactics) (July 2001), p. 12-25 ==Contemporary usage== A more expansive definition of the rearguard arose during the large-scale struggles between nation-states during the First and Second World Wars. In this respect, a rearguard is a minor unit of regular or irregular troops that protect the withdrawal of larger numbers of personnel (military or civilian) during a retreat, by blocking, defending, delaying, or interfering with advancing enemy forces in order to gain time for the remainder to regroup and reorganize. Rearguard actions may be undertaken in a number of ways, either in defense, such as by defending strongpoints or tactically important terrain, or by pre-emptively assaulting the enemy as he prepares his own offensive operations with a spoiling attack.Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, 5-166: Spoiling Attack, Army Field Manual FM 3-90 (Tactics) (July 2001), pp. 5–39, 5–40: A spoiling attack is a defensive attack, undertaken to preempt or seriously impair an enemy assault by attacking the enemy while the latter is in the process of assembly or preparation for offensive operations. Two examples of rearguard actions are: *Rorke's Drift during the Zulu War (1879)Crowley, Liz and Hand, David. Football, Europe and the Press, p. 31 (Routledge 2013). *Battle of Dunkirk (1940) Another contemporary example is the rearguard action fought by small units of the Serbian Army to protect retreating Serbian troops, the royal family, and Serbian refugees from advancing forces of the Central Powers during their retreat through Albania and Montenegro in 1915–1916.Corey, Herbert, The Serbian Tragedy As I Saw It, Harper's Monthly Magazine (June 1917), p. 334Big Guns Blast Way in Serbia: Population Joins Retreat, The New York Times, 3 November 1915Frucht, Richard (ed.), Eastern Europe: an introduction to the people, lands, and culture, Vol. 3, (2005) p. 542: The Serbian rearguard actions allowed some 125,000–145,000 soldiers of Marshal Putnik's Serbian Army together with several thousand civilian refugees to reach Adriatic ports in Albania, where they were eventually evacuated, reorganized, and reequipped for the campaign in Salonika. The nature of combat in rearguard actions involving combat between armies of nation-states is typically desperate and vicious, and rearguard troops may be called upon to incur heavy casualties or even to sacrifice all of their combat strength and personnel for the benefit of the withdrawing forces.Sebag-Montefiore, Hugh, Dunkirk: Fight to the Last Man, (1st ed.), Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, (2006), p. 233Bimberg, Edward L., World War II: A Tale of the French Foreign Legion, World War II Magazine (September 1997), p. 32: On 9 June 1940, the 97th Foreign Legion Divisional Reconnaissance Group, equipped with light armored cars, made a spoiling attack against German armored forces equipped with Pzkw Mk III tanks in order to protect the withdrawal of French Forces. In two consecutive assaults, the unit lost all its armored cars, incurring heavy casualties. ===Idiomatic expression=== Fighting or mounting a rearguard action is also sometimes an idiomatic expression, outside any military context. That idiom refers to trying very hard to prevent a thing from happening even though it is probably too late.Cambridge Idioms Dictionary (2nd ed., Cambridge University Press, 2006) via The Free Dictionary. An example of a famous rearguard action outside the military context is the effort by Roman emperor Julian around 362 A.D. to restore Paganism as the state religion instead of Christianity.Corey, Melinda and Ochoa, George. Fitzroy Dearborn Chronology of Ideas: A Record of Philosophical, Political, Theological and Social Thought from Ancient Times to the Present, p. 47 (Routledge 2013). Sportswriters employ the idiom as well.Reavis, Tracey.

The site was in open beta in an effort to replace the now defunct Stage6 site with a viable alternative. Using a similar style to Stage6, VReel also received a licence from DivX, Inc. to use their video codec, and signed an agreement with Edgecast to distribute the web site globally. ==Early development== VReel began in 2008 under the title DivXIt.net, drawing attention from the Internet community by means of social bookmarking web sites, such as Digg. DivXIt.net's inbound traffic gained the attention of DivX, Inc., who immediately issued a cease and desist order against the web site for trademark infringement. Following this event, DivXIt staff responded to the order offering to sign the domain name over to DivX, Inc. in return for a free licence for the web site. This arrangement was met and the site renamed itself VReel, and the DivXIt.net domain was transferred to DivX, Inc. Having moved to a new domain (VReel.net), a short time later VReel was contacted by Limelight Networks, and was offered a hosting plan on their network. The original beta test of VReel.net was scheduled to begin on 18 May 2008, with the full release occurring at the 31st of the same month. However, on May 23, VReel released a statement stating that its programming team was late in releasing the beta version of the site, and that as of that date, their contract legally allowed for 2 more days to deliver the beta release. This did not occur however, and the site's lead developer started an arbitration process. The May 23rd statement also stated that a new development team was to be selected \\"in the next 5 days\\", a period which would end on May 27. VReel servers went down on Saturday 31 May 2008 due to a fire at The Planet data center. The site recovered on Wednesday 4 June 2008. === Downtime === On August 3, 2008, VReel disabled all video playback. This was due to multiple \\"leech sites\\" stealing bandwidth and causing high operating costs that were needed to fund the development and launch of the second beta. VReel announced that the web site would be back online by August 30, 2008. Financial problems forced the company to postpone. == Relaunch == Alexa In October 2008, VReel announced a partnership with Lavasoft. Eoghan stated \\"VReel.net, the home of high definition and high speed online video has today announced its software partnership with Lavasoft, for their highly acclaimed and award winning Ad-Aware anti-spyware software. VReel Beta 2 introduced several new features, including expanded community features and premium accounts. ===Closed beta=== On November 10th, VReel enabled private access to its second beta. They introduced beta testers in waves, and applications were available for users to apply. The second wave began on November 14, and finally the third Began on the 21st. During the closed beta period there were free keys given to those who won \\"Treasure Hunts\\" that Eoin made. === Open beta === VReel announced a 24-hour trial period during which the site would be openly accessible to the public. Following the 24-hour trial on 28 November, the site remained open indefinitely. VReel acquired the StageHD.com domain, and forwarded all traffic to the VReel video portal. VReel's traffic share continued to rise since its launch. The site was taking in more than 500,000 unique hits per day and continued to rise. In July 2009, the site was ranked #30,500 by Alexa. By October 2009, the site had risen to rank #16,824. === Hosting and distribution === May 5, 2009 the site announced that in addition to its original partnership with EdgeCast Networks, it is now also directly peering with various ISPs, including Level-3 and AT&T.; The announcement also stated the site's backend was moved to a new set of servers. It was previously hosted on 3 servers in Germany and moved to 10 servers in the United States. ===VReel-Player=== VReel has been working on their own webplayer, based on the VLC media player, to replace the DivX Web Player. With the new web player, VReel would natively support 4 formats. The VReel Player has not yet been released to the public. The May 2009 announcement stated that contrary to previous announcements, the VReel Player will not be based on the VLC player and neither will it be open source. After the project has been put on hold it has now been continued and will be (re)built from the ground up in closed source. Among concerns, the primary concern for going closed-source (instead of open-source) was the confrontation with too many security issues when having the source open for everyone. The VReel Player would be redeveloped under a closed source license, and will be fully capable of DivX, XviD and h.264 playback. ==Shutdown== == References == == External links == * Category:American entertainment websites Category:Video hosting ","title":"VReel"},{"id":"17293349","text":"at Freedom Park.

Thanks to a career of high-risk urban ascents, the French climber has gained the nicknames The French Spiderman and The Human Spider. The title With Bare Hands refers to his practice of climbing without the use of any safety equipment. The book follows Robert's achievements, from his childhood climbing cliffs in the gorges of southwestern France, to travelling the world looking for new skyscrapers to climb. The book offers insights into the mentality and motives of the world's most famous urban climber. It was first published by Blacksmith Books in Hong Kong and was edited and adapted by John Chan. The book was also published by Maverick House Publishers in the English language across Europe and in Australia and New Zealand. ==Contents== * Prologue Rock climber Alain Robert is asked by a film director to climb a tower in Chicago. It has never before been done. Chaos reigns as a reluctant Alain risks life and limb to scale his first building. * Chapter 1: A Newly Discovered Mountain Range Suddenly struck by the possibility of climbing buildings, Alain climbs skyscrapers in Paris and New York – experiencing arrest, media exposure and courtroom drama. * Chapter 2: Le Tour de Paris Alain is in demand by the media and teams up with a major magazine to scale famous landmarks in Paris in a series of bizarre escapades. * Chapter 3: The Hatchling Emerging from a coma after a fall from a cliff, Alain looks back over his life – his colourful childhood, his wild adolescence and two terrible falls which left him partially disabled. * Chapter 4: European Trilogy Alain gains fame in France and is set an assignment by a magazine editor. He has 12 days to travel across Europe and make three daring climbs. * Chapter 5: Jailhouse Rock Alain completes a perilous climb of the Golden Gate Bridge. He compares his experience in a tough US jail with prisons around the world, most notably his abuse in a dungeon in Asia. * Chapter 6: Fantastico! Alain is invited to Brazil where he is greeted as a superstar. His new fame does not go to his head as he befriends three impoverished children and visits them in their favela. * Chapter 7: Liberty Bell In Philadelphia by accident, Alain grows obsessed with climbing a seemingly impossible tower. After exhaustive attempts he cracks it but ends up in court – this time facing two years in jail. * Chapter 8: Alain and the King After failing to climb the world’s tallest building Alain finds himself in a nightmarish Malaysian jail. A minister intervenes and he is suddenly thrown into the high life, enjoying dinner with the King of Malaysia. * Chapter 9: Spider-Man Alain risks a caning in Singapore, performs an outrageous rock climb and makes his first ascents in Venezuela and London dressed as Spider-Man. * Chapter 10: Fears and the Sears The toughest assignments Alain has ever taken on – a deadly rock climb and the sheer glass walls of the Sears Tower almost kill him and force him to confront his deepest fears. * Chapter 11: Asia Rising Alain scales Taipei 101, the world’s tallest tower – and does it injured after falling off a traffic light. He dodges security to climb the Jin Mao Tower, China’s tallest building and is beaten up by police in Tokyo. * Chapter 12: The Sands of Time Alain rubs shoulders with the elite of the Arab world, and then climbs before an audience of 100,000. He looks to the future, considers his ageing body, and concedes that climbing may well kill him. ==References== *Human Spider Alain Robert comes to London -- Daily Telegraph ==External links== *With Bare Hands: The Story of the Human Spider -- publisher's site (Maverick House Publishers) *Alain Robert -- official website of Alain Robert Category:2008 non-fiction books Category:Sports autobiographies Category:Mountaineering books ","title":"With Bare Hands"},{"id":"17293399","text":"Georgi Georgiev Dimitrov (Bulgarian: Георги Георгиeв Димитров; born 14 January 1959) is a former Bulgarian footballer who played as a defender.

The squadron provided close air support for United Nations ground forces and attacked enemy airfields and installations. Transitioned in late 1952 to the new Republic F-84G, designed with more speed and range. New targets included enemy ports, railroads, and airfields. The squadron attacked the major supply port of Sinuiju in September, inflicting heavy damage without loss of personnel or aircraft. Combining with other fighter-bomber units, it attacked the Kumgang Political School at Odong-ni in October 1952 and the North Korean tank and infantry school at Kangso in February 1953. In May, the 58th Fighter-Bomber Group bombed North Korean dams, flooding enemy lines of communication and rice fields. On 27 July 1953, it attacked the runway at Kanggye and, with the 49th Fighter-Bomber Group, bombed Sunan Airfield for the final action of fighter- bombers in the Korean War. Re-equipped with North American F-86 Sabres after the 1953 armistice, remained in South Korea to enforce cease-fire with North Korea, squadron elements rotating frequently to Taiwan until inactivated in 1958 due to budget reductions. ===F-104 Training Unit=== An F-4C-15-MC Phantom II (s/n 63-7420), top, and a German Lockheed F-104G Starfighter (63-13269) aircraft on a training mission from Luke AFB The squadron was reactivated at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona in October 1969. This took place when the 58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing was activated, replacing the 4510th Combat Crew Training Wing as the host unit at Luke. Concurrently, the 69th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron and the 418th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron were activated as Lockheed F-104G Starfighter training units, replacing the 4512th and 4518th Combat Crew Training Squadrons to support foreign military sales of the F-104. Pilots from Greece, Norway, Turkey, Denmark, and Spain trained at Luke. In addition, many F-104Gs owned by the West German Luftwaffe operated with the 58th Wing where they sported USAF insignia and carried USAF serial numbers. Training of West German Air Force pilots in the F-104G continued until late 1982. The Germans flew more than 900 Starfighters totaling an excess of 269,750 hours and produced 1,868 F-104 pilots. The squadron inactivated on 16 March 1983. ===Tactical Fighter Squadron=== F-4E-39-MC Phantom II (s/n 68-0424) from the 69th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 347th Tactical Fighter Wing, 1981 Reactivated as a McDonnell F-4E Phantom II tactical fighter squadron at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia on 1 July 1983, assuming the personnel and aircraft of the 339th Tactical Fighter Squadron which inactivated the same day.

His sole diplomatic posting was as U.S. Minister to Hungary, between 1933 and 1941. This ambassadorial assignment placed Montgomery at the center of the seething intrigue and gathering storm that characterized 1930's Hungary and Central Europe; in particular he was witness to the rise of Adolf Hitler's influence in Budapest, and the complex struggle over the alliance between Hungary and Nazi Germany. His memoirs, entitled Hungary: The Unwilling Satellite, are considered a valuable document of that era. ==Background== Montgomery was a native of Missouri, born September 20, 1878 in the town of Sedalia and educated there. At the age of 26, he married Hedwig Wildi, and the couple had two daughters. Montgomery built a successful career in the dairy industry, specifically in the processing of condensed milk. From 1925 to 1933, he was the president of the International Milk Company in Vermont. He was a loyal and generous supporter of the Democratic Party, and after Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt claimed the White House in 1932, Montgomery was rewarded with the promise of a diplomatic job.Frank, Tibor, Dreaming Peace, Making War: The Budapest Conversations of U.S. Minister John F. Montgomery 1934-1941, in The Hungarian Quarterly, Volume 63, No. 168, Winter 2002 ==Budapest posting== In June 1933, Montgomery was sworn in as U.S. Minister to Hungary (he had hoped to be sent to Vienna, but Budapest was what he was offered). Montgomery was clearly expected to watch over the political intrigues not only in Budapest but, from his central location on the Danube, to monitor the goings-on in Hungary's neighbors (Austria, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia) and other countries in the region as well, including Bulgaria, Poland, Germany and Italy.Montgomery, The Unwilling Satellite, p. 11 Roosevelt invited Montgomery to report to him personally, an opportunity the ambassador took occasionally.Frank, Tibor, Discussing Hitler: Advisors of U.S. Diplomacy in Central Europe, 1934-1941, Central European University press, 2003, pp. 14-16 Although he had no career experience as an international diplomat, Montgomery proved to be an enthusiastic and dedicated ambassador. He cultivated hundreds of friendships among the Hungarian and European political class, with whom he socialized regularly; he faithfully dictated records of almost every conversation he held with important political players, and kept a detailed journal.Frank, Dreaming Peace, Making War He avidly collected and recorded information about his many contacts, including their earlier jobs, their families and hobbies, and even gossip he heard about them from his other friends.Frank, Tibor, Discussing Hitler, pp. 22-23 At the same time, Montgomery was hindered by his background: he spoke only English, which limited most of his meaningful contacts to those Hungarians and other Europeans who had studied English themselves and spoke it fluently. By definition, this meant that most of his close relationships in Budapest were with educated aristocrats and members of the ruling political elite. His inability to read local newspapers or understand casual conversations in the street meant that Montgomery was cut off from much of the middle- and working- class political activity in the Hungarian capital. Montgomery was also plainly charmed by Budapest's Gilded Age atmosphere, and enchanted by the capital's old-world pageantry – the elaborate costumes and glittering, semi-feudal rituals to which Hungary clung. In particular, he was won over by the considerable charisma and personal charm of Hungary's head of state, the regent Miklós Horthy. ==Montgomery and the rise of Hitler== Unquestionably the most critical trend which Montgomery was required to monitor from Budapest was the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime in Germany - and Hitler's growing influence in Hungarian political circles. Like many American diplomats, Montgomery was suspicious of Hitler from early in the dictator's reign; the ambassador's scathing reports on Hitler delighted FDR, who shared his contempt for the German dictator. The Hungarian leadership was aware of American hostility toward Hitler's Nazi regime; as Hungary crept deeper into Hitler's sphere of influence throughout the 1930s, Horthy and his colleagues took pains to assure Montgomery that they, too, disliked and feared Hitler – a message which Montgomery dutifully passed back to Washington, as they doubtless hoped he would. What Hungary's various leaders actually thought of Hitler and alliance with Germany is the subject of a complex debate that lasts to the present day. Hungary had its own home-grown fascist movements and right-wing politicians, and anti-Semitism was embedded in Hungarian culture, but much of the political elite in Budapest was genuinely wary of Hitler. The German Fuehrer was generally seen as a useful but dangerous ally: he clearly had his own designs on Hungary's natural resources, and after the 1938 Anschluss, Hitler had a well-equipped army standing directly on Hungary's borders. At the same time, Horthy was hoping to make use of Hitler: the regent, like most of the political class, was virulently anti-Communist, and he was gambling that Hitler would keep Hungary safe from the dangers posed by Joseph Stalin's \\"Asiatic barbarians.\\" Horthy was also dedicated (as was virtually every Hungarian) to re-acquiring territories which Hungary had been forced to cede to neighboring nations at the end of the First World War - and some of which were re-annexed by Hungary with Hitler's help between 1938 and 1940. Nevertheless, Montgomery's Hungarian friends convinced him that Hungary's capitulations to the Nazis were essentially pragmatic, the only possible path for a weak nation facing a well-armed and ruthless neighbor. As Montgomery wrote in Hungary: The Unwilling Satellite: In this, Montgomery echoed the stance of the regent Horthy, who wrote in his own memoirs: This similarity of opinion is not unusual: a comparison of Horthy's memoirs and Montgomery's yields a regular alignment of their views, especially regarding Hungary's political choices before and during the Second World War. The friendship between the two men was cemented during a famous episode on March 15, 1939. Both men were attending a gala performance at the Budapest Opera House, when supporters of the fascist Hungarian Ferenc Szálasi (recently jailed on Horthy's order) disrupted the opening ceremonies by chanting, from a box above the regent's, \\"Justice for Szálasi!\\" Horthy, enraged, dashed out of his royal box, and Montgomery followed to see what was happening. When he caught up with Horthy, he reported that: Horthy apparently believed that Montgomery was coming to offer help, because he thanked Montgomery later with a gift of a photograph of the opera event, a present which Montgomery treasured. The two men became close (according to Tibor Frank, a Hungarian scholar who closely studied Montgomery's private papers, Montgomery even shared Horthy's \\"drawing- room anti-Semitism,\\" and viewed the pre-war anxieties of Budapest's large Jewish upper-middle class with a mixture of sympathy and condescension).Frank, Tibor, Discussing Hitler, p. 28 Montgomery did his best to foster a sense of personal connection between the regent and President Roosevelt – a connection which Horthy apparently felt, but which Roosevelt did not.Frank, Tibor, Discussing Hitler, pp. 15-18 On the whole, Montgomery resented the way in which Roosevelt held him at arm's length, and complained that FDR was insufficiently curious about real reports from the field. ==After Budapest== Montgomery was recalled from his posting Budapest in March 1941, three months before Hungary finally joined the Axis as a full war partner during the invasion of the Soviet Union. When the United States entered the Second World War that December, Horthy's alliance with Hitler placed the minister's beloved Hungary in America's enemies column; but Montgomery remained committed to Hungary's independence and well-being. He viewed with anguish the destruction of virtually half the capital during the Battle of Budapest, and he bitterly mourned the ceding of Hungary to Soviet control at the war's end. Montgomery also remained committed to the well-being of Miklós Horthy, who was captured by American troops at the war's end: as the Allies prepared for the Nuremberg Trials, Montgomery used his influence in Washington to help extricate Horthy from indictment and trial. Horthy was interviewed extensively, and later was called to testify at the trial of a Nazi administrator in Budapest, but was never charged for any of his actions during or before the war. After the trials, Montgomery continued to support the Horthys in their exile (they could not and would not return to Budapest, which was now controlled by a Soviet-led Communist government). After the Horthy family relocated to Estoril, Portugal, Montgomery raised funds for their upkeep from a small committee of wealthy Hungarians in America. After Montgomery died in 1954, his daughter Jean continued supporting the ex-regent and his wife until their deaths.Frank, Tibor, Discussing Hitler, pp. 44-46 In 1947 Montgomery published a heartfelt memoir of his Budapest days called Hungary: The Unwilling Satellite. The book was, and remains, a widely read and widely quoted source for examinations of Hungarian pre-war politics, in some measure because it is unique as a thorough Western lens on interwar Hungary; the Soviet-dominated Hungarian leadership after 1947 vilified Horthy and promoted an official view that Horthy was a fascist and a Nazi collaborator. The stories Montgomery told in The Unwilling Satellite were further illuminated by the discovery, among Montgomery's personal papers, of his own private notes on many of his discussions with Hungary's leaders.

The high-performance computing cluster is operated by Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP), the university's central information technology organization. ITaP also operates clusters named Coates built in 2009, Rossmann built in 2010, and Hansen and Carter built in 2011. Steele was the largest campus supercomputer in the Big Ten outside a national center when built. It ranked 104th on the November 2008 TOP500 Supercomputer Sites list. ==Hardware== Steele consisted of 893 64-bit, 8-core Dell PowerEdge 1950 and nine 64-bit, 8-core Dell PowerEdge 2950 systems with various combinations of 16-32 gigabytes RAM, 160 GB to 2 terabytes of disk, and Gigabit Ethernet and SDR InfiniBand to each node. The cluster had a theoretical peak performance of more than 60 teraflops. Steele and its 7,216 cores replaced the Purdue Lear cluster supercomputer which had 1,024 cores but was substantially slower. Steele is primarily networked utilizing a Foundry Networks BigIron RX-16 switch with a Tyco MRJ-21 wiring system delivering over 900 Gigabit Ethernet connections and eight 10 Gigabit Ethernet uplinks. ==Software== Steele nodes ran Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with release 4.0 and used Portable Batch System Professional 10.4.6 (PBSPro 10.4.6) for resource and job management. The cluster also had compilers and scientific programming libraries installed. ==Construction== The first 812 nodes of Steele were installed in four hours on May 5, 2008, by a team of 200 Purdue computer technicians and volunteers, including volunteers from in-state athletic rival Indiana University. The staff had made a video titled \\"Installation Day\\" as a parody of the film Independence Day. The cluster ran 1,400 science and engineering jobs by lunchtime. In 2010, Steele was moved to an HP Performance Optimized Datacenter, a self-contained, modular, shipping container-style unit installed on campus in order to make room for new clusters in Purdue's main research computing data center. ==Funding== The Steele supercomputer and Purdue's other clusters were part of the Purdue Community Cluster Program, a partnership between ITaP and Purdue faculty. In Purdue's program, a \\"community\\" cluster is funded by hardware money from grants, faculty startup packages, institutional funds and other sources. ITaP's Rosen Center for Advanced Computing administers the community clusters and provides user support. Each faculty partner always has ready access to the capacity he or she purchases and potentially to more computing power when the nodes of other partners are idle. Unused, or opportunistic, cycles from Steele are made available to the National Science Foundation's TeraGrid (now the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment) system and the Open Science Grid using Condor software. A portion of Steele also was dedicated directly to TeraGrid use. ==Users== Steele users came fields such as aeronautics and astronautics, agriculture, biology, chemistry, computer and information technology, earth and atmospheric sciences, mathematics, pharmacology, statistics, and electrical, materials and mechanical engineering. The cluster was used to design new drugs and materials, to model weather patterns and the effects of global warming, and to engineer future aircraft and nano electronics. Steele also served the Compact Muon Solenoid Tier 2 Center at Purdue, one of the particle physics experiments conducted with the Large Hadron Collider. ==DiaGrid== Unused, or opportunistic, cycles from Steele were made available to the TeraGrid and the Open Science Grid using Condor software. Steele was part of Purdue's distributed computing Condor flock, and the center of DiaGrid, a nearly 43,000-processor Condor-powered distributed computing network for research involving Purdue and partners at nine other campuses. ==Naming== The Steele cluster is named for John M. Steele, Purdue associate professor emeritus of computer science, who was involved with research computing at Purdue almost from its inception. He joined the Purdue staff in 1963 at the Computer Sciences Center associated with the then-new Computer Science Department. He served as the director of the Purdue University Computing Center, the high-performance computing unit at Purdue prior to the Rosen Center for Advanced Computing, from 1988 to 2001 before retiring in 2003. His research interests have been in the areas of computer data communications and computer circuits and systems, including research on an early mobile wireless Internet system. ==See also== * Rossmann (supercomputer), another Purdue University supercomputer ==ReferencesCategory:X86 supercomputers Category:Purdue University ","title":"Steele (supercomputer)"},{"id":"17293914","text":"Parbatipur may refer to: *Parbatipur, South 24 Parganas district, West Bengal, India *Parbatipur Upazila, Bangladesh *Parbatipur Junction, Bangladesh * Parbatipur, Chitwan district, Nepal ","title":"Parbatipur"},{"id":"17293993","text":"Cyclopaedia Hornwork The Weber Church of Zittau inside a hornworkEuropaeum Theatrum, Volume 5, plate 12.

It was built in 1929 for Kaye Don. Powered by two supercharged engines of 24 litres each, it looked impressive but failed to achieve any records. Sunbeam's 1927 200 mph land speed record won with the Sunbeam 1000HP had been broken by 1929, and the company decided to build a car capable of reaching so as to recover it. Only aero engines offered enough power to do this, and such a car would also provide a test bed for developing a new generation of Sunbeam aero-engines. == Sunbeam 2,000 hp engine == Sunbeam decided to develop a new aero engine of , and the car would be powered by two of them. This new engine was a water-cooled V-12 with a 50° angle between the banks. Ideal balance usually favours an angle of 60°, but this choice made the engine narrower overall. Cylinder bore was and stroke was , for a capacity of 24.02 litres. This oversquare geometry was a first for Sunbeam, but encouraged a high-revving and thus more powerful engine. The engines were supercharged, using a large centrifugal blower, geared to 17,000 rpm. This was increasingly common aero engine practice of the time, in both the Napier Lion and the Rolls-Royce R-type, but again was a first for Sunbeam. When installed in the record-attempt car the engines had an unusual cooling system using melting ice rather than a radiator. This avoided the drag of an open radiator, but obviously could only cool for as long as the ice lasted. It was a workable system for land speed records, used by the contemporary Golden Arrow and more recently by the JCB Dieselmax. Silver Bullet had an ice tank, filled with 5.5 hundredweight (about 280 kilograms) of ice before each run, and a one-gallon mixing tank in the nose. === Photographs & Video === Photographs of the car are rare, although there are some at the Brooklands photo archive. These show it outside Delaney & Sons. garage, a popular location for racing in this era. Some also show close-ups, including the innovative rear aerofoil that could be adjusted to generate downforce. Rare Movietone News footage on YouTube shows the car outside the Sunbeam factory in Wolverhampton, England with a crowd of Sunbeam workers. Kaye Don arrives driving the Sunbeam V12 racing and land speed record car \\"Sunbeam Tiger\\". He is met by Louis Coatalen, Sunbeam's Managing Director and Chief Engineer who describes the effort to make the car. Don describes the planned attempt on the Land Speed Record at Daytona Beach on Florida == Specifications == == Unsuccessful record attempts == Competition for the land speed record between Segrave's Golden Arrow and Malcolm Campbell's new Blue Bird was fierce, so the car was built quickly, working around the clock in shifts. This left little time for thorough static testing of the engines, made even worse as only two engines were ever built and so the only engines available for testing were the race engines themselves. Silver Bullet first appeared in public on 21 February 1930. Following the other teams, the first record attempt was to be made on Daytona Beach, in Florida, with Kaye Don driving. The car arrived at Daytona on 8 March and Louis Coatalen himself on 16th. The record attempts went poorly though, with engine reliability problems and the car proving difficult to control. The fastest speed attained was , well below Sunbeam's own record of three years earlier. After the team returned home, further attempts were made to improve the car with testing on Pendine Sands. Sunbeam aircraft engines had never recovered from the financial effects of the end of the Great War. Coupled with the Depression of the 1930s, Sunbeam simply could not afford a competition program of this scale. Although other UK car companies even did well in this period, Sunbeam did not and went into receivership in 1935. The Silver Bullet was sold to Jack Field, a Southport hotelier and garage owner. He tested the car on Southport beach, scene of Segrave's earlier success with the Sunbeam Tiger, but couldn't solve its problems and eventually the car was scrapped. == Tribute to the 'Silver Bullet' in Public Art == Steve Field and John McKenna's bronze panel of the Silver Bullet In 1996 a redevelopment of the former works site of Star cars, in St. John's, Wolverhampton into a new Retail Park saw a themed set of public art features referencing the Sunbeam Land speed record attempts. A bronze relief panel tribute to the Silver Bullet car was depicted in a bas relief, attempting the speed record with reference to Kaye Don as the driver. The whole series of artworks around the Retail site were a design collaboration of artist Steve Field and the sculptor John McKenna A.R.B.S and rendered in 1930's Art Deco manner. They showed other Sunbeam Record attempts and reference the historical industrial car making heritage of Wolverhampton. == References == ==External links== * \\"Speeding Back To Yesterday\\", January 1931, Popular Mechanics * Category:Sunbeam vehicles Category:Wheel-driven land speed record cars Category:Sunbeam aircraft engines ","title":"Silver Bullet (car)"},{"id":"17294121","text":"Colonel Abraham Bowman (October 16, 1749 – November 9, 1837) was an 18th- century American frontiersman and American Revolutionary War military officer.

His father George Bowman and grandfather Jost Hite were both well-known Virginian pioneers and the first to explore and settle Shenandoah Valley. ==Biography== Born to George Bowman and Mary Hite (the eldest daughter of Jost Hite), he was raised on the Bowman family estate on Cedar Creek near Strasburg, Virginia. In 1766, the 17-year-old Bowman played a prominent role in the defence of the area against an Indian raiding party. When one of his neighbors, the daughter of George Miller, arrived at his home seeking help from an Indian raiding party, he took a gun and rode to Miller's home where he was joined by another young man, Thomas Newell. However, they arrived too late to save Miller and his family who were found \\"weltering in their own blood\\".

The coat of arms was designed in the year 1951 by Hobart architect and alderman, I.G. Anderson, and it replaced an earlier unofficial crest used by the Corporation since the 1850s. ==Blazon== ===Shield=== The shield is of divided into two colours silver and blue. * The upper part of the shield has a red lion walking to the right on a silver background. The red lion is taken from the Tasmanian flag and its location at the top of the shield signifies Hobart's position as the Capital City. *The lower part of the shield has a gold six-pointed star with wavy rays on a blue background. The star is derived from the arms of Lord Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire, he was the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in 1804 at the time of colonial settlement, and after whom city of Hobart is named. The colour used on the arms of Lord Hobart was, in fact, sable (black), rather than blue. ===Crest=== Above the shield is the silver helmet with gold and blue mantling and above the helmet is a silver and blue wreath, upon which is set a gold three-masted ship (the Flying Childers). The helmet has mantling of blue and gold. The helmet is associated with civic heraldry and is often used for municipal authorities. The ship was a whaling ship, built in Battery Point by John Watson in 1846, and signifies the importance of shipping and whaling to Hobart's industrial and economic development. ===Supporters=== On the left side of shield there are the same animals which are an emu, and on the right side a kangaroo, both with their heads looking back, and each with a collar, comprising a small garland of apples and leaves. The Tasmanian emu and the forester kangaroo are taken from the Council's unofficial crest, used from the 1850s, and also provide a connection with the Coat of arms of Australia. The animals have collars to deliberately distinguish them from the national coat of arms; the apples signify the importance of the apple industry to the state, commonly known for many years as the \\"Apple Isle\\". ===Compartment=== The base of the shield is a green island, and the blue wavy lines represent the surrounding seas. Growing upon the island are two of native flora, the Richea and the Tasmanian Waratah. ===Motto=== A scroll below the arms reads Sic Fortis Hobartia Crevit translates as Thus in strength did Hobart grow. The motto Sic fortis Hobartia crevit was part of the Council's old Common Seal and was retained when the new Coat of Arms was introduced. ==See also== ==References== *City of Hobart Coat of Arms Hobart Category:Hobart Hobart Hobart Hobart Hobart Category:Symbols introduced in 1951 ","title":"Coat of arms of Hobart"},{"id":"17294386","text":"Honda Sparta is a scooter that was built from the 1970s through the 1990s.

It explores the careers and musical styles of prominent rock guitarists Jimmy Page, the Edge, and Jack White. The film premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, and received a wide release in the United States on August 14, 2009, from Sony Pictures Classics. ==Plot== The film documents the varied playing and recording styles of guitarists Jimmy Page, The Edge, and Jack White. Page's history with guitar traces back to his childhood when he played in a skiffle band. After desiring to do more than play pop music, Page \\"retires\\" from guitar playing to attend art school. He later revives his music career as a session guitarist, only to be discouraged by the realization that he is playing others' music and stifling his own creativity. At that point, Page begins to write and perform in the bands The Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin. Page discusses the skiffle and blues music that influenced him at the time. For many of Page's scenes, he is seen visiting Headley Grange, where several songs from Led Zeppelin IV were recorded, and in one scene, explains how the distinctive drum sound from \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" was achieved from the acoustics of the house in which it was recorded. The Edge's history with guitar traces back to building a guitar with his brother Dik and learning to play. In the film, he visits Mount Temple Comprehensive School and recalls forming U2 in his childhood. He also demonstrates his playing technique, in how he eliminates certain strings from chords, as well as his use of echo and delay effects to \\"fill in notes that aren't there\\". He also discusses his purchase of his signature guitar, the Gibson Explorer, in New York City and the punk music that influenced him. In other scenes, he plays early demo tapes of \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", discusses his inspiration for \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", and spends time experimenting with guitar effects for the riffs to \\"Get on Your Boots\\". Jack White traces his musical background to his childhood in a rundown neighborhood of Detroit. Living with two drum sets and a guitar occupying his room and sleeping on a piece of foam due to taking out his bed for more room for his music, White struggled to find a musical identity, as it was \\"uncool\\" to play an instrument and his nine siblings all shared a musical propensity. His strong interest in blues and roots music opposed the hip hop and house music popular in the predominantly Latino south Detroit neighbourhood at the time. White eventually finds a niche in a garage rock band called The Upholsterers while working as an upholsterer, which paves the way for his future bands The White Stripes and The Raconteurs. White's philosophy is to limit and challenge himself in various ways to force creative approaches to recording and playing. The touchstone of the film is a meeting of the three guitarists dubbed \\"The Summit\\". In these scenes, the three guitarists not only converse about their influences and techniques, but they also play each other's songs together, showing each other how to play \\"I Will Follow\\", \\"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\\", and \\"In My Time of Dying\\". The film concludes with the men playing an impromptu cover version of The Band's \\"The Weight\\" on acoustic guitars. == Reception == U2 guitarist The Edge on route to a press conference for the film at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival The film premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, and played at both Sundance Film Festival and the 59th Berlin International Film Festival in 2009. The film received generally favorable reviews, achieving an average critic review score of 70% on Metacritic, and currently holds a certified fresh percentage of 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, with a consensus of: \\"An affectionate tribute to rock's most distinctive instrument, It Might Get Loud is insightful and musically satisfying\\". According to Phil Alexander, who gave the film a four star review in Mojo magazine, \\"It Might Get Loud is undoubtedly both a triumphant and truly absorbing 90-minute spectacle that provides the viewer with unique insight and entertainment in equal measure. Barney Hoskyns of Uncut called it an \\"absorbing film\\". Paul Elliott of Classic Rock describes the movie as \\"a bold, unique and insightful exploration into the lives of three very different guitarists with three very different stories to tell\\". \\"All highly mouth- watering stuff\\" he concludes. == Box office == It Might Get Loud opened at #37 (shown in 7 theaters with $13,240 average) and took in a gross income of $92,679 in the opening weekend. The final domestic gross income was $1,610,163 while the foreign gross income was far lower at $197,343 for a worldwide gross income of $1,807,506.MOVIES: IT MIGHT GET LOUD 2009. Box Office Mojo.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The fund receives its investment capital from the state budget. Its head office is located in Oslo with local offices in Thailand, Costa Rica, Kenya, Mozambique and Ghana. Norfund's mission is to help developing countries fight poverty through supporting economic growth, employment and technology transfer. The investments are done on commercial terms directly in companies or through local investment funds. Norfund invest in developing countries, and has chosen a strategic focus on Sub-Saharan Africa, and selected countries in Central America and South-East Asia. Clean energy, financial services and agribusiness are the three main sectors in which Norfund invests. Norfund is mainly an equity investor (normally no higher share that 35%), but the fund can also give loans. Norfund is monitoring the economic, environmental and social consequences of its investments to ensure a sustainable impact. The largest investment made by Norfund is in the strategic subsidiary SN Power (originally established in partnership with Statkraft), a company producing hydroelectric power in developing countries. At the end of 2017 Norfund had invested NOK 20.4 billion (US$2.5 billion) directly and indirectly in 874 different companies. In total, 292,000 persons were employed world-wide in businesses where Norfund had invested, and the companies paid NOK 9.3 billion in local taxes in 2017. The share of investments by Norfund to LDC was 36%. The Norwegian efforts to promote private sector development in poor countries was evaluated in 2010. The report refers to Norfund as one of the main policy instruments in development assistance towards business. In 2010 a followup of an earlier revision of the fund (from 2007) was presented by the Office of the Auditor General. In 2007 the Auditor General meant that Norfund so far had not reached the defined targets for the fund. In the follow up from 2010 it is emphasized that the fund now invests more than 30% in LDCs and that the reporting of results, both financial and developmental, has improved considerably, and the case was brought to a close. On May 13, 2020 the fund revealed that it had been the victim of a cyberattack, which it referred to as \\"an advanced data breach\\", that took place on March 16, 2020. The attack resulted in USD 10 million (approximately NOK 100 million), intended for a microfinance institution in Cambodia, being routed to an account in Mexico. According to the fund's statement, the breach was discovered on April 30 when the fraudsters attempted a second attack. ==References== Category:Private equity companies of Norway Category:Government-owned companies of Norway Category:1997 establishments in Norway Category:Financial services companies established in 1997 Category:Companies based in Oslo ","title":"Norfund"},{"id":"17294664","text":"Seven ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Winchester, after the English city of Winchester: * was a 60-gun fourth rate launched in 1693.

Subsequently they were formalised in the Finance Act 1998 and in the Code for Fiscal Stability, approved by the House of Commons in December 1998. The sustainable investment rule states that public sector net debt as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) will be held over the economic cycle at a stable and prudent level. The Chancellor has stated that, other things being equal, net government debt will be maintained below 40% of GDP over the current economic cycle.

The building has been evaluated due to its historic interest as a Grade II listed building. ==Description== The towermill stands over four storeys and is 32 feet tall. In its operational days the mill was powered with common sails and a tailpole. The configuration powered two pairs of grindstones. The doors and windows are unusual in that they have Gothic arches, probably installed during rebuilding work in the 1800s. Also during this period four patent double-shuttered sails were installed. These were struck by rack and pinion via a chain pole and drove three pairs of stones. Photographs from that period show that the windmill had one pair of sails had seven bays of three shutters and the other pair had eight bays of three shutters. The top of the mill was capped with a dome with a finial. This capping was boarded horizontally and it had a sixteen-sided petticoat. There was also a gallery and an eight-bladed fan. ==References== ==External links== * Blakeney Towermill Category:Blakeney, Norfolk Category:National Trust properties in Norfolk Category:Windmills in Norfolk Category:Grade II listed buildings in Norfolk Category:Tower mills in the United Kingdom Category:Grinding mills in the United Kingdom Category:Windmills completed in 1769 Category:North Norfolk Category:Grade II listed windmills ","title":"Blakeney Windmill"},{"id":"17294894","text":"Robert Wynne (c. 1661 - 1743) was a Welsh cleric and academic. ==Life== Wynne, from Llanvaur, Caernarvonshire, was the eldest son of Robert Wynne (a canon of Bangor Cathedral and rector of Llanddeiniolen and Llaniestyn) and his wife Catherine Madryn, heiress of Llannerch Fawr).

Some scholars have placed his work in the 3rd century BC,Yavneh, Naomi, \\"Lost and Found; Veronese's Finding of Moses\\", in Gender and Early Modern Constructions of Childhood, p. 305, 2016, Eds. Naomi J. Miller, Naomi Yavneh, Routledge, , 9781351934848, google books and google books – ebook, with different pages viewable though the evidence of the date is not definitive. His only known work, Exagōgē, is the earliest known Jewish play. It survives only in fragments found in the writings of Eusebius, Clement of Alexandria, and Pseudo-Eustathius. Nevertheless, the extensive quotations by these writers make possible the assembly of 269 lines of text, about 20-25% of the whole.Joel Stevens Allen. The Despoliation of Egypt: In Pre-rabbinic, Rabbinic and Patristic Traditions, Brill, 2008, page 59, \\"First, Ezekiel's Exagôgê, with its extant 269 lines of iambic trimeters, is the most extensive example of the Greek dramatic literature of the Hellenistic period. Second, it is the earliest Jewish play in history, and as such provides important information as how a Hellenized Jew would try to mould biblical material into Greek dramatic forms by means of techniques developed by Greek tragedians.\\" The only more extensive remnant of the Greco-Jewish poets is that found in the Sibylline Oracles.John J. Collins, Between Athens and Jerusalem: Jewish Identity in the Hellenistic Diaspora, Crossroad, 1983, page 224: \\"Ezekiel the Tragedian - Another early specimen of \\"mystical\\" Judaism is found in the drama on the Exodus by Ezekiel, which, at 269 lines, is the most extensive remnant of the Greco-Jewish poets apart from the Sibylline Oracles\\" Exagōgē is a five-act drama written in iambic trimeter, retelling of the biblical story of The Exodus from Egypt. Moses is the main character of the play, and parts of the biblical story have been altered to suit the narrative's needs. These changes probably point to Ezekiel's intention to stage the play, since certain scenes that are impossible to stage were converted into monologue. This drama is unique in blending the biblical story with the Hellenistic tragic drama. The main modern edition is a parallel-text English-Greek edition by classical scholar Howard Jacobson.Jacobson, Howard 1940-The Exagoge of Ezekiel, ed. Howard Jacobson, 2009: \\"Professor Jacobson accompanies the text of the play with a translation.

She won a scholarship to fashion school, and trained as a dress designer in Paris, returning to London at the outbreak of the Second World War. She then became engaged to an American admiral and travelled to New York, but after some time in America, and after delaying her wedding, she met and began an affair with Armand Denis. He was a Belgian-born adventurer and film-maker who had already had wide experience of making documentary films in remote areas around the world, many made with his first wife, Leila Roosevelt Denis. Armand and Leila Denis divorced, and in 1948 Michaela and Armand married by special licence in Potosi, Bolivia.Obituary In order to finance their plans to make wildlife documentaries, the couple travelled to Africa in 1950 to work on the feature film, King Solomon's Mines, in which Michaela acted as Deborah Kerr's double. In 1953 they made a new film together, Below The Sahara, and appeared on BBC radio to promote it. The BBC saw the couple's potential for television work, and in 1954 they produced a pioneering and successful TV programme, Filming Wild Animals. The quality of Armand Denis' film-making, combined with his heavy accent and Michaela's enthusiasm and glamorous appeal, made them fixtures on BBC TV screens in Britain during the 1950s and early 1960s. Accompanied by Armand's commentary, the two would be filmed getting as close to animals as possible, in a style later much parodied. Typically, there would be a trademark moment for Michaela to apply lipstick or comb her hair; she once commented that she could not possibly get into the water with crocodiles until she had put on her eyebrow pencil. The couple made several series for both BBC and ITV, including Filming In Africa (1955), Armand and Michaela Denis (1955-58), On Safari (1957-59), and Safari to Asia (1959-61), which were repeated until well into the 1960s.WildFilmHistory Michaela Denis also wrote books, including Leopard in My Lap (1955) and Ride on a Rhino (1960).Obituary The couple made their home in Nairobi, Kenya. Armand Denis died in 1971. Michaela then apparently discovered she had healing powers, and opened a spiritual healing clinic at their home. In 1975 she married her lawyer, Sir William O'Brien Lindsay, the former Chief Justice of the Sudan, who died in his sleep three months later. She also dealt in property in Kenya.Obituary Michaela Denis died in Nairobi in 2003, aged 88. ==References== Category:1914 births Category:2003 deaths Category:British television presenters Category:British people of Russian descent ","title":"Michaela Denis"},{"id":"17294981","text":"Momberg is a surname, and can refer to: *Jacques Momberg (born 1991), South African rugby union player *Dutch Momberg (1934-1995), professional wrestler better known as Killer Karl Krupp ","title":"Momberg"},{"id":"17294984","text":"SN Power AS invests in clean, renewable energy on a commercial basis in emerging markets.

Bonnie Cone's final resting place in the Van Landingham Glen on the campus of UNC Charlotte, with Cato Hall and Fretwell Hall in the background. Cone was a teacher at Central High School in Charlotte (now Garinger High School) when the University of North Carolina system opened an extension center in 1946. At the urging of principal Elmer Garinger, Cone became the center's first director. When the state began closing the extension centers in 1949, Cone was instrumental in convincing the state to keep the Charlotte Center open, clearing the way for the Charlotte City Schools to take it over and rename it Charlotte College, a two-year junior college with Cone as president. In 1957, she chose the school's current site in northeastern Mecklenburg County and helped draw up the original campus master plan. She believed that Charlotte College would grow into a university within 10 years, and believed the site was best suited to serve Charlotte and the surrounding area. Under her watch, Charlotte College became a state-supported community college in 1958, and a four-year college in 1963. In 1965, four years after Charlotte College moved to its current location, it was upgraded to university status as part of the UNC system. Cone stated that March 2, 1965–the day that the North Carolina General Assembly voted to make Charlotte College the fourth member of the UNC system–was \\"the happiest day of my life.\\" Charlotte College officially became part of the UNC system on July 1, 1965. Cone served as acting Chancellor of the newly-minted university until 1966, when Dean Colvard arrived to take over as full-time chancellor. Even though she had led the college since 1946, university system officials wanted a leader with experience running a four- year, public university. Cone and the university were profiled in the July 16, 1965 issue of Time magazine. In the article, she stated, \\"we are not here to elevate ourselves but the institution,\\" when asked about the chancellor position. She served in various official positions until her retirement in 1973, at which time the main campus's student union was renamed the Cone University Center. Cone continued to work on behalf of the school in unofficial capacities until her death in March 2003. She is interred in the Van Landingham Gardens on the east side of the main campus, and a non- denominational meditation center is planned near the site. She is posthumously known as the founder of the school, a title she rejected during her lifetime because she felt many people had a hand in creating and building the university. During her lifetime, she received 10 honorary degrees and was inducted posthumously into the Order of the Long Leaf Pine in recognition to her contributions to North Carolina history. In 2004, the stretch of U.S. Highway 29 near the main campus was officially renamed the \\"Dr. Bonnie Cone Memorial Highway.\\" ==References== ==External links== *Bonnie Cone Papers: J.

The linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem is one of the most fundamental optimal control problems. It concerns uncertain linear systems disturbed by additive white Gaussian noise, incomplete state information (i.e. not all the state variables are measured and available for feedback) also disturbed by additive white Gaussian noise and quadratic costs. Moreover, the solution is unique and constitutes a linear dynamic feedback control law that is easily computed and implemented. Finally the LQG controller is also fundamental to the optimal perturbation control of non-linear systems. The LQG controller itself is a dynamic system like the system it controls. Both systems have the same state dimension. Therefore, implementing the LQG controller may be problematic if the dimension of the system state is large. The reduced-order LQG problem (fixed-order LQG problem) overcomes this by fixing a-priori the number of states of the LQG controller. This problem is more difficult to solve because it is no longer separable. Also the solution is no longer unique. Despite these facts numerical algorithms are available Associated software download from Matlab Central. Associated software download from Matlab Central. to solve the associated optimal projection equations. ==Mathematical problem formulation and solution== ===Continuous-time=== The reduced-order LQG control problem is almost identical to the conventional full-order LQG control problem. Let \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(t) represent the state of the reduced-order LQG controller. Then the only difference is that the state dimension n_r=dim(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(t)) of the LQG controller is a-priori fixed to be smaller than n=dim({\\\\mathbf{x}}(t)) , the state dimension of the controlled system. The reduced-order LQG controller is represented by the following equations: : \\\\dot{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}}_r(t) = A_r(t)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(t) + B_r(t){\\\\mathbf{u}}(t)+K_r(t) \\\\left( {\\\\mathbf{y}}(t)-C_r(t)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(t) \\\\right),\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(0)={\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(0), : {\\\\mathbf{u}}(t)= -L_r(t) \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(t). These equations are deliberately stated in a format that equals that of the conventional full-order LQG controller. For the reduced-order LQG control problem it is convenient to rewrite them as : \\\\dot{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}}_r(t) = F_r(t)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(t) + K_r(t) {\\\\mathbf{y}}(t),\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(0)={\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(0), : {\\\\mathbf{u}}(t)= -L_r(t) \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(t), where : F_r(t)=A_r(t)-B_r(t)L_r(t)-K_r(t)C_r(t). The matrices F_r(t), K_r(t), L_r(t) and {\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(0) of the reduced-order LQG controller are determined by the so-called optimal projection equations (OPE). The square optimal projection matrix \\\\tau(t) with dimension n is central to the OPE. The rank of this matrix is almost everywhere equal to n_r. The associated projection is an oblique projection: \\\\tau^2(t)=\\\\tau(t). The OPE constitute four matrix differential equations. The first two equations listed below are generalizations of the matrix Riccati differential equations associated to the conventional full-order LQG controller. In these equations \\\\tau_\\\\perp(t) denotes I_n-\\\\tau(t) where I_n is the identity matrix of dimension n. : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{P}(t) = {} & A(t)P(t)+P(t)A'(t)-P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t) C(t)P(t)+V(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & {} +\\\\tau_\\\\perp (t)P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t) C(t)P(t)\\\\tau'_\\\\perp (t), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] P(0)= {} & E \\\\left({\\\\mathbf{x}}(0){\\\\mathbf{x}}'(0) \\\\right), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & {} -\\\\dot{S}(t) = A'(t)S(t)+S(t)A(t)-S(t)B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t)+Q(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & {} + \\\\tau'_\\\\perp (t)S(t)B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t) \\\\tau_\\\\perp (t), \\\\end{align} : S(T) = F. If the dimension of the LQG controller is not reduced, that is if n=n_r, then \\\\tau(t)=I_n, \\\\tau_\\\\perp(t)=0 and the two equations above become the uncoupled matrix Riccati differential equations associated to the conventional full-order LQG controller. If n_r the two equations are coupled by the oblique projection \\\\tau(t). This reveals why the reduced-order LQG problem is not separable. The oblique projection \\\\tau(t) is determined from two additional matrix differential equations which involve rank conditions. Together with the previous two matrix differential equations these are the OPE. To state the additional two matrix differential equations it is convenient to introduce the following two matrices: : \\\\Psi_1(t)=(A(t)-B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t))\\\\hat{P}(t)+\\\\hat{P}(t) (A(t)-B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t))' :::: {}+P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t)C(t)P(t), : \\\\Psi_2(t)=(A(t)-P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t) C(t))'\\\\hat{S}(t)+\\\\hat{S}(t)(A(t)-P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t)C(t)) :::: {}+S(t)B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t). Then the two additional matrix differential equations that complete the OPE are as follows: : \\\\dot{\\\\hat{P}}(t)=1/2 \\\\left(\\\\tau(t)\\\\Psi_1(t)+\\\\Psi_1(t)\\\\tau'(t) \\\\right),\\\\hat{P}(0)=E({\\\\mathbf{x}}(0))E({\\\\mathbf{x}}(0))', \\\\operatorname{rank}(\\\\hat{P}(t))=n_r almost everywhere, : -\\\\dot{\\\\hat{S}}(t)=1/2 \\\\left(\\\\tau'(t)\\\\Psi_2(t)+\\\\Psi_2(t)\\\\tau(t) \\\\right),\\\\hat{S}(T)=0, \\\\operatorname{rank}(\\\\hat{S}(t))=n_r almost everywhere, with : \\\\tau(t)= \\\\hat{P}(t) \\\\hat{S}(t) \\\\left( \\\\hat{P}(t) \\\\hat{S}(t) \\\\right)^*. Here * denotes the group generalized inverse or Drazin inverse that is unique and given by : A^*=A(A^3)^+A. where + denotes the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse. The matrices P(t),S(t),\\\\hat{P}(t),\\\\hat{S}(t) must all be nonnegative symmetric. Then they constitute a solution of the OPE that determines the reduced-order LQG controller matrices F_r(t), K_r(t), L_r(t) and {\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(0): : F_r(t)=H(t)\\\\left( A(t)-P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t) C(t)-B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t) \\\\right)G(t)+\\\\dot{H}(t)G'(t), : K_r(t)=H(t)P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t), : L_r(t)=R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t)G'(t), : {\\\\mathbf{x}}_r(0)=H(0)E({\\\\mathbf{x}}(0)). In the equations above the matrices G(t),H(t) are two matrices with the following properties: : G'(t)H(t)=\\\\tau(t),G(t)H'(t)=I_{n_r} almost everywhere. They can be obtained from a projective factorization of \\\\hat{P}(t)\\\\hat{S}(t). The OPE can be stated in many different ways that are all equivalent. To identify the equivalent representations the following identities are especially useful: : \\\\tau(t)\\\\hat{P}(t)=\\\\hat{P}(t)\\\\tau'(t)=\\\\hat{P}(t), \\\\tau'(t)\\\\hat{S}(t)=\\\\hat{S}(t)\\\\tau(t)=\\\\hat{S}(t) Using these identities one may for instance rewrite the first two of the optimal projection equations as follows: : \\\\dot{P}(t) = A(t)P(t)+P(t)A'(t)-P(t)C'(t)W^{-1}(t)C(t)P(t)+V(t)+\\\\tau_\\\\perp(t)\\\\Psi_1(t)\\\\tau'_\\\\perp (t), : P(0)= E \\\\left({\\\\mathbf{x}}(0){\\\\mathbf{x}}'(0) \\\\right), : -\\\\dot{S}(t) = A'(t)S(t)+S(t)A(t)-S(t)B(t)R^{-1}(t)B'(t)S(t)+Q(t)+\\\\tau'_\\\\perp\\\\Psi_2(t)\\\\tau_\\\\perp(t), : S(T) = F. This representation is both relatively simple and suitable for numerical computations. If all the matrices in the reduced-order LQG problem formulation are time-invariant and if the horizon T tends to infinity, the optimal reduced-order LQG controller becomes time-invariant and so do the OPE. In that case the derivatives on the left hand side of the OPE are zero. ===Discrete-time=== Similar to the continuous-time case, in the discrete-time case the difference with the conventional discrete-time full-order LQG problem is the a-priori fixed reduced-order n_r of the LQG controller state dimension. As in continuous-time, to state the discrete-time OPE it is convenient to introduce the following two matrices: : \\\\Psi^1_i=\\\\left(A_i- B_i(B'_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i)^{-1}B'_iS_{i+1}A_i)\\\\right)\\\\hat{P}_i \\\\left(A_i- B_i(B'_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i)^{-1}B'_iS_{i+1}A_i)\\\\right)' :::: {}+A_iP_iC'_i(C_iP_iC'_i+W_i)^{-1}C_iP_iA'_i : \\\\Psi^2_{i+1}=\\\\left(A_i- A_iP_iC'_i(C_iP_{i}C'_i+W_i)^{-1}C_i\\\\right)'\\\\hat{S}_{i+1} \\\\left(A_i- A_iP_iC'_i(C_iP_{i}C'_i+W_i)^{-1}C_i\\\\right) :::: {}+A'_iS_{i+1}B_i(B'_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i)^{-1}B'_iS_{i+1}A_i Then the discrete- time OPE is : P_{i+1} = A_i \\\\left( P_i - P_i C'_i \\\\left( C_i P_i C'_i+W_i \\\\right)^{-1} C_i P_i \\\\right) A'_i+V_i+\\\\tau_{\\\\perp i+1}\\\\Psi^1_i \\\\tau'_{\\\\perp i+1}, P_0=E \\\\left( {\\\\mathbf{x}}_0{\\\\mathbf{x'}}_0 \\\\right). : S_i = A'_i \\\\left( S_{i+1} - S_{i+1}B_i \\\\left( B'_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i \\\\right)^{-1} B'_i S_{i+1} \\\\right) A_i+Q_i+\\\\tau'_{\\\\perp i}\\\\Psi^2_{i+1} \\\\tau_{\\\\perp i}, S_N=F. : \\\\hat{P}_{i+1}=1/2(\\\\tau_{i+1}\\\\Psi_i^1+\\\\Psi_i^1\\\\tau'_{i+1}),\\\\hat{P}_0=E({\\\\mathbf{x}}(0)) E({\\\\mathbf{x}}(0))', \\\\operatorname{rank}(\\\\hat{P}_i)=n_r almost everywhere, : \\\\hat{S}_{i}=1/2(\\\\tau'_i \\\\Psi_{i+1}^2+\\\\Psi_{i+1}^2\\\\tau_i),\\\\hat{S}_N=0, \\\\operatorname{rank}(\\\\hat{S}_i)=n_r almost everywhere. The oblique projection matrix is given by : \\\\tau_i=\\\\hat{P}_i\\\\hat{S}_i \\\\left(\\\\hat{P}_i\\\\hat{S}_i \\\\right)^*. The nonnegative symmetric matrices P_i,S_i,\\\\hat{P}_i,\\\\hat{S}_i that solve the discrete-time OPE determine the reduced-order LQG controller matrices F_i^r, K_i^r, L_i^r and {\\\\mathbf{x}}_0^r: : F_i^r=H_{i+1}\\\\left( A_i-P_i C'_i \\\\left( C_i P_i C'_i+W_i \\\\right)^{-1}C_i-B_i\\\\left( B'_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i \\\\right)^{-1} B'_i S_{i+1}\\\\right)G'_i, : K_i^r=H_{i+1}P_i C'_i \\\\left( C_i P_i C'_i+W_i \\\\right)^{-1}, : L_i^r=\\\\left( B'_iS_{i+1}B_i+R_i \\\\right)^{-1} B'_i S_{i+1}G'_i, : {\\\\mathbf{x}}_0^r=H_0E({\\\\mathbf{x}}_0). In the equations above the matrices G_i,H_i are two matrices with the following properties: : G'_iH_i=\\\\tau_i, G_iH'_i=I_{n_r} almost everywhere. They can be obtained from a projective factorization of \\\\hat{P}_i\\\\hat{S}_i. To identify equivalent representations of the discrete-time OPE the following identities are especially useful: : \\\\tau_i\\\\hat{P}_i=\\\\hat{P}_i\\\\tau'_i=\\\\hat{P}_i, \\\\tau'_i\\\\hat{S}_i=\\\\hat{S}_i\\\\tau_i=\\\\hat{S}_i As in the continuous-time case if all the matrices in the problem formulation are time-invariant and if the horizon N tends to infinity the reduced-order LQG controller becomes time- invariant. Then the discrete-time OPE converge to a steady state solution that determines the time-invariant reduced-order LQG controller. The discrete-time OPE apply also to discrete-time systems with variable state, input and output dimensions (discrete-time systems with time-varying dimensions). Such systems arise in the case of digital controller design if the sampling occurs asynchronously. ==References== Category:Optimal control Category:Control theory Category:Stochastic control ","title":"Optimal projection equations"},{"id":"17295312","text":"The Belgrade Fair – Hall 1, is Belgrade Fair's largest exhibition space.

He is considered the father of French hydrography. Little is known of his life. He was probably born at Arques-la- Bataille. The earliest known documentary source for his life places him there as a priest in 1537. Desceliers' father was an archer at the Chateau d’Arques and his family possibly originated from the d’Auge area, where the family name survives between Honfleur and Pont-l’Évêque. Desceliers was also an examiner of Maritime Pilots and was authorised to award patents on behalf of the French king, as evidenced by the seal found bearing his initials. He probably also taught hydrography. He made a hydrographic chart of the coast of France for Francis, Duke of Guise. Nothing is known of his life after the creation of the 1553 map; the Dictionnaire de biographie française suggests that he died after 1574, but none of its sources support this statement. ==Cartographic work== He was close to Jean Ango and Dieppois, explorers Giovanni da Verrazzano and the brothers Jean and Raoul Parmentier. Although it seems unlikely that he took part in any voyages, he was able collect information including portolans, and he incorporated this information into his own maps. A school of cartography formed around him in Dieppe and included Nicolas Desliens among its members. Desceliers made several large world maps in the style of nautical charts: * The 1543 world map mentioned in 1872 in the inventory of the collection of Cardinal Louis d'Este under the title The descriptione carta del Mondo in pecorina scritta a mano, miniata tutta per P. Descheliers. The fate of this map is unknown. * The 1546 world map (2560 × 1260 mm), made to order for Francis I. It later belonged to a certain Jomard, then to the Earl of Crawford and is now stored in England at the John Rylands Library, Manchester (French MS. 1*) * The 1550 world map (2150 × 1350 mm), made for Henry II, showing his arms as well as those of Anne de Montmorency (Marshal of France) and Admiral Claude d'Annebaut. This chart is preserved in London, at the British Library (Additional MS 24065), which purchased it from Cristoforo Negri. * The 1553 world map. This was lost in a fire in Dresden in 1915. A copy is on display in Dieppe Castle. It was displayed at the Exposition internationale de géographie of 1875 in Paris: this has been reported to be another map from 1558, but the catalogue confirms that it was the 1553 map. The Dieppe maps show a precise knowledge of coastlines, and also included representations of imaginary places, fantastic people and bizarre animals. The representation of eastern Canada was well detailed, along with most of the America north and south, just fifty years after the voyage of Columbus. In the southern hemisphere section, a landmass entitled Jave la Grande was shown in the approximate position of Australia. This has led to speculation that the Dieppe maps are evidence of European (possibly Portuguese) exploration of Australia in the 16th century; one hundred years before its well documented exploration by the Dutch. The image of Java Major on Desceliers' 1550 map was based on the accounts of Marco Polo and Ludovico di Varthema in the Novus Orbis Regionum ac Insularum Veteribus Incognitarum of Simon Grynaeus and Johann Huttich, published in Paris by Antoine Augurelle in 1532. This is made clear by the inscription on the map describing Java. Desceliers' representation of the Southern Continent, titled LA TERRE AVSTRALLE NON DV TOVT DESCOVVERTE (“Terra Australis, recently discovered but not yet fully known”), is derived from Oronce Fine’s 1531 world map, which was also published in 1532 in the Novus Orbis: it bears the same title as given it by Fine in Latin: Terra Australis recenter inventa sed nondum plene cognita (“Terra Australis, recently discovered but not yet fully known”). Desceliers seems to have identified the promontory of Regio Patalis on Fine's Terra Australis with Marco Polo and Ludovico di Varthema's Java Major; hence, his Jave la Grande is an amalgamation of the known north coast of Java with Fine's Regio Patalis. Despite their great value, both artistic and cartographic, the charts quickly fell into disuse after the end of the 16th century, when the market came to be dominated by Flemish and Dutch mapmakers. ==References== ==External links== *Pierre Desceliers, World map of 1550: London, British Library, Add.

The second Mississinewa was laid down by New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, in May 1953 and was launched on 12 June 1954, sponsored by Mrs. Wright. She was commissioned on 18 January 1955, Captain M. J. Jensen in command. ==Service history== ===United States Navy, 1955-1976=== Mississinewa, second of a class designed to provide fuel, food, stores, and mail services rapidly and for sustained periods to ships at sea, operated primarily along the U.S. East Coast, with one brief Mediterranean deployment, until 1 May 1956. She then departed her original home port, Newport, Rhode Island, for Naples, Italy. With Naples as her home port, the tanker cruised the Mediterranean servicing the 6th Fleet in normal and crisis operations until 1964. During the fall of 1956 and early winter 1957, she supported 6th Fleet ships as they stood by in case they were called on to intervene in the Suez Crisis and the tense period that followed. Again, in mid‑July 1958, she got underway on short notice to provide logistic support to ships of the 6th Fleet during an emergency in the Middle East, this time in Lebanon. Remaining off the Lebanese coast until September, she refueled over 200 ships as the U.S. 6th Fleet landed the U.S. Marine Corps and then stood by at the request of President Chamoun of Lebanon, in \\"Operation Blue Bat\\". From 1962 to 1964, Mississinewas responsibilities were increased as she served as flagship of Commander Service Force, 6th Fleet. Prior to the reassignment of Newport as her home port in September 1964, Mississinewa had returned to the United States only for regularly scheduled yard periods. During those intervals she received new equipment during overhaul, which included in 1957 the installation of a helipad and the assignment of a helicopter for use in vertical replenishment. Since 1964, into 1969, she operated in the western Atlantic, from Newfoundland to the Caribbean, with regular deployments to the Mediterranean and one, in August 1966, to northern Norway for NATO exercises. ===Military Sealift Command, 1976-1991=== USNS Mississinewa in 1986. Mississinewa was decommissioned on 15 November 1976 by the U.S. Navy, and placed in service with the Military Sealift Command as USNS Mississinewa (T-AO-144), continuing her service with a civilian crew. She was placed out of service in 1991 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 February 1994. ==Disposal== Mississinewa was transferred to the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) on 1 May 1999 for lay up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River, Fort Eustis, Virginia. Mississinewa departed the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River Group, under a disposal contract on 30 January 2007 to be scrapped at International Shipbreaking Ltd. (ESCO), Brownsville, Texas.

His name is taken from a diptych that once belonged to the Cistercian Abbey of Heiligenkreuz, located in southeastern Austria near the present-day border with Hungary.Master of Heiligenkreuz The left panel depicts the Annunciation on the obverse; the reverse is a depiction of the Madonna and Child. The right panel depicts the Mystical Marriage of Saint Catherine, with Saint Dorothy on its reverse. Details of costume and iconography combine with associations with the International Style to indicate a date of around the first decade of the 15th century. It was initially proposed, by Betty Kurth in 1922, that the artist was French and had some association with the court in Paris. Other writers have disagreed, and various nationalities including French, Austrian, German, or Bohemian have been posited for the Master. Some have further suggested that he was an itinerant court artist, trained in France but active in Austria. Various clues have been used in an attempt to describe his nationality. These include his use of finely-worked gold decoration, in which some have seen a link to Franco-Burgundian goldsmith's work of the late 14th century. Others, instead, see it as a link to the school of panel painting then active at the court in Prague. Consequently, it seems highly unlikely that the artist's nationality will be conclusively established. Stylistically, the Master's work is distinguished by use of some Gothic decorative elements, as well as oddly- proportioned figures with long, thin limbs and fingers. ==Notes== Category:15th-century Austrian painters Category:Gothic painters Category:14th-century births Category:15th-century deaths Category:Anonymous artists ","title":"Master of Heiligenkreuz"},{"id":"17295365","text":"Leroy Jenkins may refer to: *Leroy Jenkins (jazz musician) (1932–2007), composer and free jazz violinist and violist *Leroy Jenkins (televangelist) (1934–2017), American televangelist *Leeroy Jenkins, a player character and Internet meme originating in the computer game World of Warcraft ","title":"Leroy Jenkins"},{"id":"17295392","text":"Billy Morgan may refer to: *Billy Morgan (Gaelic footballer) (born 1945), Gaelic football player and manager with Cork GAA *Billy Morgan (footballer, born 1878) (1878–1939), English football player for Newton Heath, Manchester United, Bolton Wanderers, Watford and Leicester *Billy Morgan (footballer, born 1891), English football player for Birmingham, Coventry City and Crystal Palace *Billy Morgan (footballer, born 1896) (1896–1993), English football player *Billy Morgan (snowboarder) (born 1989), British snowboarder ==See also== *Bill Morgan (disambiguation) *William Morgan (disambiguation) ","title":"Billy Morgan"},{"id":"17295404","text":"Hagan Stone Park during the 2016 Greensboro Invitational Cross Country Meet Hagan-Stone Park is a wildlife refuge and family campground owned and operated by Guilford County, North Carolina located on Hagan Stone Park Road off U.S. Highway 421.

It is bounded on the south by Bloor Street, on the west by Runnymede Road, on the north by Annette Street, Quebec Avenue and Humberside Avenue, and on the east by the GO Transit Weston Subdivision rail tracks (formerly owned by Canadian National Railway). It is located in the Parkdale—High Park provincial and federal electoral districts. The area east of Keele Street is also known informally as the \\"West Bend\\" neighbourhood. ==Character== alt=red, black and white streetcar with some houses in the background High Park North is mainly residential, containing many semi- detached homes built in the early 20th century. North of High Park, the neighbourhood has several high-rise apartment buildings, built after the construction of the Bloor-Danforth subway. Bloor Street is the main east-west thoroughfare. It is a four-lane road and is mostly commercial with storefront- type businesses that have residential second and third storeys. North-south roads include Keele Street and Dundas Street. Both are primarily residential within the neighbourhood. The oldest residential houses in High Park North were built in the late 1800s and early 1900s and are mostly Victorian, Edwardian and Tudor-style. The houses are typically two- and three-storey detached brick homes. Many homes have leaded and stained glass windows, wood trim, French doors, hardwood doors, and fireplaces.High Park real estate from ilovetoronto.com retrieved on May 20, 2011. Just north of the park is a district of high-rise apartment buildings, dating from the 1960s and 1970s. These are primarily located on Gothic, High Park, and Quebec Avenues. ==History== HIgh Park North exists within the traditional territories of the Missisauga Anishinaabeg. The area however has also been home to Huron-Wendat and Haudenosaunee nations throughout history. High Park North exists on part of an old trading trail that led down toward the lake. This trail is the namesake for Indian Road, Indian Road Crescent, and Indian Grove. High Park North falls entirely within the boundaries of the town of Toronto Junction, which was purchased from the Keele estate in 1882 by Daniel Clendenan who subdivided the farm and racetrack for a residential district (now called High Park North) to serve the Junction commercial district. As Bloor Street was still an uneven and a mostly undeveloped street, early housing in the area was concentrated to the north and east, where it was easier to access the stores and industry along Dundas Street. High Park Avenue in particular was the site of many early homes of the Junction wealthy, as was modern Evelyn Crescent; many of these houses are still standing. High Park North emerged as a neighbourhood once Bloor Street was widened and evened out following World War I, when most of the residential homes which still exist today were built. ===20th Century=== In 1915, Bloor Street was the site of a major public works at the north-west corner of High Park. The street, west of High Park Avenue, was crossed by creeks that emptied into Grenadier Pond. The creek banks were steep, making the roadway treacherous and difficult for traffic. A rail trestle was built to cross the gap at a level of 60 feet. The rails were used for rail cars to dump soil around the trestle. The trestle was completely buried and the present Bloor Street roadway built on top. Existing north-south roadways connecting to Bloor Street were raised to meet the new level of Bloor Street and this facilitated the development of the neighbourhood. The first building in Canada designed by a Canadian trained female architect was constructed in the neighbourhood during this period. This landmark building by Jean Hall is a 1925 fourplex located at 63 Jerome Street. View of the area from Keele station, 1968. Concurrent with the arrival of the subway line in the 1960s, there were many residences razed in order to build apartment buildings. In the 1960s, the area directly north of High Park was the site of 'block-busting' development. After the construction of the Bloor-Danforth subway line in the 1960s, the nearby residences on High Park Avenue, Quebec Avenue and Gothic Avenue were bought up by developers, razed and large apartment buildings were built. The area from north of the subway line to Glenlake Avenue is now almost entirely high-rise towers. At the time, the City government was very much pro-development, and there were no local ratepayer/community associations as is seen today. Local City alderman Ben Grys, along with his wife, owned properties on Gothic Avenue and voted to approve the apartment project on the site before his family's land holdings were revealed by John Sewell through a search of local property tax rolls. Under vague conflict-of-interest guidelines, Grys continued as alderman until he was defeated in the following municipal election. Grys sued Sewell over Sewell's attempt to remove him but eventually withdrew his case when it became clear that Sewell would get access to further information about his business dealings. By the 1970s, local residents formed associations in harmony with new reform Council members, partly to fight the block-busting north of High Park. ===21st Century=== The desirability of living close to High Park and the subway keeps developers operating in the neighbourhood, although not on the scale of the past. In the first decade of the 2000s, a condominium development was built on the site of a former gas station on the south side of Bloor Street, overlooking High Park on the landfill of the former bridge over Wendigo Creek. One block east of High Park Avenue, between Pacific and Oakmount, a block of Edwardian-era homes was purchased for demolition. The area is the site of a condominium development overlooking High Park. A tenant of one of the homes remained while the other homes became vacant and boarded up until eviction in 2010, much like the block-busting of the 1960s and 1970s. This is the first block of older homes directly on Bloor Street, facing High Park, to be demolished for apartment building. ==Demographics== The High Park neighbourhood has a population of 22162.https://www.toronto.ca/ext/sdfa/Neighbourhood%20Profiles/pdf/2016/pdf1/cpa88.pdf ===Generation Status=== Between the years of 2006 and 2011, there were changes in the generation status of the population aged 15 years and older.

It offers a Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8 program. St. Cecilia School was established by Father Joseph McCann, a priest at St. Helen's Church, who purchased land on Edwin Avenue in November 1887 to establish a new Catholic church and school. Originally the parish was to be named after St. Charles. According to historical records, however, the first school—a small wooden structure—was named St.Mary's. In 1890 the school was replaced with a brick building and renamed St.Cecilia's. Legend has it that St. Cecilia, the patron saint of sacred music, was chosen as the new name because the Heintzman Piano factory stood in view, across the railway tracks, from the school. The present St. Cecilia's Church, at the corner of Annette Street and Pacific Avenue, was opened in 1909, replacing a smaller structure first occupied in 1895. Father Eugene Gallagher was the pastor.

The present St. Cecilia Catholic School at the corner of Annette Street and Evelyn Avenue opened in 1914 with additions in 1918, 1954 and 1964. The school's first teachers and administrators were the Loretto Nuns, who lived in the former Heintzman family residence at Annette and Laws Streets, providing another musical connection with St. Cecilia. ===Toronto Public Library=== The Runnymede Branch of the Toronto Public Library, housed in a renovated heritage building built in 1930, is located within High Park North at Bloor Street West and Glendonwynne Road.

Illustration from The Children's Encyclopædia. \\"After Blenheim\\" is an anti-war poem written by English Romantic poet laureate Robert Southey in 1796. The poem is set at the site of the Battle of Blenheim (1704), with the questions of two small children about a skull one of them has found. Their grandfather, an old man, tells them of burned homes, civilian casualties, and rotting corpses, while repeatedly calling it \\"a famous victory\\". The poem depicts the common man's ignorance of the motives of wars. ==Characters and summary== The speaking characters are Old Kaspar, whose father lived in Blenheim, his granddaughter Wilhelmine, and his grandson Peterkin. Old Kaspar had finished his work and was sitting in the sun in front of the cottage, watching his little granddaughter playing. Peterkin, his grandson, has been rolling a hard round object he found near the stream. He brings it to the old man, who explains \\" 'Tis some poor fellow's skull,\\" said he (line 17-18). He admits that he often finds them while ploughing in the garden (line 22-18). The children anticipate a story--\\"And little Wilhelmine looks up/with wonder- waiting eyes\\" (ln 26-27). Kaspar explains to the children the story of the battle, that the Duke of Marlborough routed the French, although he admits he never understood the reason for the war himself. He also mentions that his father had a cottage by the rivulet--\\"My father lived at Blenheim then\\"--where Peterkin found the skull. The soldiers burned it to the ground, and his father and mother had fled, with their child. The following verse refers to a childing mother, or a mother with child (ln 45-46) and many of them died with their newborns, possibly alluding to his own mother. Thousands of corpses lay rotting in the fields, but he shrugs it off, as part of the cost of war (ln 53 --54). Wilhelmine says it was a wicked thing, but he contradicts her, no, he says, it was a famous victory. The poem is a scathing commentary on \\"man's cruelty to man\\". ==Criticism== While Southey's verse \\"After Blenheim\\" is considered to be an anti-war poem, arguably Southey was not himself anti-war. Byron considered Southey a puzzle: on the one hand, he denigrated the English victory at Blenheim; on the other, he praised the Battle of Waterloo in The Poet's Pilgrimage to Waterloo, a popular poem that generated £215 in two months of publication.Lionel Madden. Robert Southey: the critical heritage. Taylor and Francis, 1996, , p. 21, p. 267. It is one of Southey's most famous poems.William Arthur Speck. Robert Southey: entire man of letters. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006, , p. 74. The internal repetition of but 'twas a famous victory juxtaposed with the initial five lines of each stanza, establish that the narrator does not know why the battle was fought, why thousands died, why his father's cottage was burned.

Kerry defeated Tipperary GAA in the quarter-final of the Munster Junior Football Championship. They then overcame Limerick GAA in a replay to reach the final. However, Cork GAA, who subsequently won the All-Ireland championship, beat them in the final.Munster Junior Football Teams – Munster GAA Web Site Senior Later in 2005 O'Sullivan joined the Kerry senior football panel. The team entered the championship as the hot favourites to retain their All-Ireland title. All was going to plan as Kerry reached yet another provincial final. O'Sullivan remained on the bench for that game as his side defeated arch-rivals Cork by 1–11 to 0–11. Following this win Kerry cruised through the All-Ireland series to reach the championship decider against Tyrone. In one of the great finals of the decade, the result remained in doubt until the final whistle. Dara Ó Cinnéide powered his team ahead with a goal after just six minutes. Tyrone responded in kind with a Peter Canavan goal just before half-time. O'Sullivan entered the game as a substitute as Tomás Ó Sé launched the Kerry comeback in the 57th minute with Kerry's second goal; however, it was too late. Tyrone hung on to win by 1–16 to 2–10. It was O'Sullivan's first defeat in an All- Ireland final. In 2006 Kerry reached the final of the National Football League and played Galway. O'Sullivan's side could only manage three points in the opening half, however, the introduction of Eoin Brosnan transformed the team. At the end of the seventy minutes a 2–12 to 0–10 score line gave Kerry their 18th National League title and a first for O'Sullivan. The league win was a false dawn as Kerry went out tamely to Cork in a replay of the Munster final. The team, however, bounced back against Longford to set up a meeting with Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter-final. At half-time it looked as though the Ulser hoodoo would strike again but Kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half with Darragh Ó Sé dominating midfield while Kieran Donaghy shone at full-forward. Darran was introduced to the action on 56 minutes. Kerry won an absorbing contest by a score of 3–15 to 1–13, with Darran scoring the third and decisive goal and in the process putting paid to the notion that Kerry had no answer to the northern style of defensive play. Kerry again beat Cork in the subsequent semi-final before lining out against Mayo in the All-Ireland final. An unbelievable opening first-half saw Kerry go 2–4 to no score ahead after just ten minutes, courtesy of goals by Declan O'Sullivan and Kieran Donaghy. Colm Cooper slotted a third Kerry goal, however, Mayo settled and reduced the deficit to 3–8 to 3–2 at half-time. The second thirty-five minutes saw Kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points. A final score of 4–15 to 3–5 gave Kerry another All- Ireland title and gave substitute O'Sullivan a first All-Ireland winners' medal. In 2007 Kerry faced Cork in the provincial decider once again. A close game developed, however, at the full-time whistle Kerry were the champions by 1–15 to 1–13. O'Sullivan came on as a substitute to collect his second Munster winners' medal and his first on the field of play. Kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their All-Ireland quarter-final against Monaghan, setting up a glamour All-Ireland semi-final tie with Dublin. Kerry put an end to a Dublin comeback in that game and won by two points. The subsequent All- Ireland final was an historic occasion as Kerry faced Cork in the very first all-Munster championship decider. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. Cork goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3–13 to 1–9. Once again O'Sullivan didn't start the game but came on in the second half to collect his second consecutive All-Ireland winners' medal. In 2008 Kerry were on course to secure their first three-in-a-row since 1986. All did not go to plan as O'Sullivan's side lost team captain Paul Galvin to suspension after an incident with referee Paddy Russell in the Munster semi-final against Clare. The subsequent Munster final saw Kerry take an eight-point lead over Cork at half-time. 'The Rebels' fought back and, in a massive downpour, Kerry could only muster three points in the second period of play as Cork secured a remarkable 1–16 to 1–11 victory. Kerry worked their way through to the All- Ireland semi-final where they faced Cork once again. After a thrilling draw and an exciting replay Kerry emerged victorious. An All-Ireland final appearance against Tyrone was the reward for this victory, with O'Sullivan starting on the bench again. An exciting game developed, one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years. The sides were level seven times before Colm Cooper nudged Kerry 0–8 to 0–7 ahead before the interval. Tyrone simply wore Kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from Tommy McGuigan and a string of late points inspired Tyrone to their third All- Ireland title of the decade. In 2009 O'Sullivan was honored by being appointed captain of the Kerry senior football team after Mid Kerry winning the County Championship in 2008. The year began well with his side's National League victory over Derry to capture his third winners' medal in that competition. Kerry's next game was a Munster semi-final meeting with Cork. That game ended in a draw, however, Kerry were well beaten in the replay. 'The Kingdom' were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over Longford, Sligo and Antrim. Kerry later lined out in the All-Ireland quarter-final and demolished Dublin, with O Sullivan contributing 0-3. Kerry then defeated Meath in a disappointing semi-final , with O'Sullivan scoring 1-1, the goal from an early penalty. For the second year in-a-row Kerry faced Cork in the All-Ireland final. Surprisingly, the men from 'the Kingdom' went into the game as slight underdogs. This tag appeared to be justified when O'Sullivan's side trailed by 1–3 to 0–1 early in the opening half. The Kerry team stuck to their game plan, helped in no small part by a Cork side that recorded fourteen wide's. At the final whistle Kerry were the champions again by 0–16 to 1–9. Darran lifted the Sam Maguire as captain of Kerry , becoming the first man from his club to do so. In 2011, despite a narrow defeat by 1-12 to 1-11 in the All Ireland Final, Darran was nominated for Footballer of the Year, ultimately losing out to Alan Brogan In October 2018, O'Sullivan announced his retirement from inter-county football. ==References== Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:All-Ireland-winning captains (football) Category:English Gaelic footballers Category:Gaelic footballers who switched code Category:Glenbeigh-Glencar Gaelic footballers Category:Kerry inter-county Gaelic footballers Category:Munster inter- provincial Gaelic footballers Category:Sportspeople from London Category:Tír Chonaill Gaels Gaelic footballers Category:Winners of four All-Ireland medals (Gaelic football) ","title":"Darran O'Sullivan"},{"id":"17295805","text":"Alexis Sinduhije (born 5 May 1967) is a Burundian journalist and politician. After founding Radio Publique Africaine during the Burundi Civil War, Sinduhije received a CPJ International Press Freedom Award and was named to the Time 100 list of most influential people. In 2007, he left journalism to run for president, but was arrested in 2008 on a charge of \\"insulting the president,\\" Pierre Nkurunziza, drawing protests on his behalf from the U.S., U.K., and Amnesty International. He was found not guilty and released in 2009. The film \\"Kamenge, Northern Quarters\\" follows Sinduhije before, during, and after his incarceration. ==Background== From 1991 to 1993, Sinduhije was a news reporter for National Radio and Television of Burundi and then became the chief news editor for La Semaine, an independent weekly newspaper that was shut down by the National Army during a military coup. He worked at Studio Ijambo, a 10 full-time journalists (Hutu and Tutsi correspondents are equally represented) independent radio production studio in Bujumbura providing programming to the BBC, Reuters, Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, and to national radio. His accomplishments as a journalist were recognised by Harvard University who invited him to the Kennedy School as a Shorenstein Fellow in 1997. During the ethnically divisive Burundi Civil War, Sinduhije, who is a Tutsi, adopted a Hutu war orphan. ==Radio Publique Africaine== In 2001, Sinduhije founded Radio Publique Africaine (RPA), along with Samantha Power, as a means of bringing about peace between his fellow Tutsi and the Hutu in his often war-torn country. He thought of the idea while working at the state radio station. RPA's stated purpose is \\"to humanize relations between the ethnic groups.\\" Sinduhije later stated that it was initially hard to find donors for the project, given the regional distrust of public radio after the role that the Rwandan public radio station Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines had played in that nation's recent genocide. Sinduhije's house was broken into in February 2003 and his security guard murdered in apparent retaliation for the station's reporting. The incident led Amnesty International to call on Burundian authorities to guarantee Sinduhije's safety and that of other journalists. The government of Burundi briefly banned the station on 17 September 2003 for broadcasting an interview with a spokesman for Agathon Rwasa's rebel group, the National Liberation Forces. However, other stations refused to broadcast news in solidarity until the ban was removed, and the government allowed the station to resume transition within three days. For Sinduhije's work with the station, he was honored with the 2004 International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). In 2009, Time named him to its Time 100, an \\"annual list of the world's most influential people\\". ==Presidential candidacy== Sinduhije left the station in December 2007 in order to pursue a political career, announcing his candidacy for the 2010 presidential elections. On 3 November 2008, Sinduhije was arrested for holding an unauthorized meeting. After nine days of detention at Mpimba Central Prison, he was additionally charged with \\"insulting the president\\", Pierre Nkurunziza, based on documents the police had confiscated. The BBC reported that his detention was widely viewed as politically motivated, given the impending presidential election. The United States Embassy in Burundi described Sinduhije's arrest as \\"unacceptable\\" and demanded his release. The British government also noted its concern, stating that the arrest threatened \\"the ability of Burundians to exercise their civil and political rights\\". Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience, \\"held solely for expressing his political views\\", and called for his immediate release. Burundi's ambassador to the United States responded that the Sinduhije's arrest was unconnected to the election and that Burundi was \\"committed to human rights\\". Sinduhije was found not guilty on 13 March 2009 and released from prison. Following a series of candidate withdrawals and boycotts of a poll that opposition candidates accused of being rigged, Nkurunziza stood unopposed and was re-elected with 91.62 percent of the vote. == Sanctions and alleged involvement in rebel activity == In 2010s he was subject to US and UN sanctions for the violence instigated by members of his party. In course of the Burundian unrest (2015–2018), the Burundian government accused Sinduhije and his party, the Movement for Solidarity and Democracy, of organizing the \\"Resistance for the Rule of Law in Burundi\\" (RED-Tabara) rebel group. However, members of RED-Tabara denied that Sinduhije was leading them. ==References== Category:1967 births Category:Burundian journalists Category:Living people Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Burundi Category:Burundian prisoners and detainees Category:Burundian politicians Category:Tutsi people ","title":"Alexis Sinduhije"},{"id":"17295821","text":"Middle-of-the-night insomnia (MOTN) is characterized by having difficulty returning to sleep after waking up during the night or very early in the morning. This kind of insomnia (sleeplessness) is different from initial or sleep-onset insomnia, which consists of having difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of sleep. The disrupted sleep patterns caused by middle-of-the- night insomnia make many sufferers of the condition complain of fatigue the following day. Excessive daytime sleepiness is reported nearly two times higher by individuals with nocturnal awakenings than by people who sleep through the night. Sleep research conducted in the 1990s showed that such waking up during the night may be a natural sleep pattern, rather than a form of insomnia. If interrupted sleep (called \\"biphasic sleeping\\" or \\"bimodal sleep\\") is perceived as normal and not referred to as \\"insomnia\\", less distress is caused and a return to sleep usually occurs after about one hour. ==Causes== * Pain * Pregnancy * Anxiety * Difficulty breathing / sleep apnea * Need to use the bathroom * Hunger or thirst * Illness * Shift work * Erratic sleep schedule Nocturnal awakenings are more common in older patients and have been associated with depressive disorders, chronic pain, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, alcohol consumption, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, heart disease, menopause, prostate problems, and bipolar disorders. Gastro-intestinal discomfort arising from food that has not been fully cooked, is also a contributor to middle of the night insomnia. Nocturnal awakenings can be mistaken as shift work disorder. ==Treatment== Middle-of-the-night insomnia is often treated with medication, although currently Intermezzo (zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets) is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved medication specifically for treating MOTN awakening. Because most medications usually require 6–8 hours of sleep to avoid lingering effects the next day, these are often used every night at bedtime to prevent awakenings. Medication may not be prescribed in some cases, especially if the cause turns out to be the patient ingesting too much fluid during the day or just before they go to sleep. Sleep restriction therapy and stimulus control therapy as described in insomnia have shown significance in treating middle of night insomnia. Some studies have shown that zaleplon, which has a short elimination half-life, may be suitable for middle-of-the-night administration because it does not impair next day performance. ==Prevalence== Waking up in the middle of the night, or nocturnal awakening, is the most frequently reported insomnia symptom, with approximately 35% of Americans over 18 reporting waking up three or more times per week. Of those who experience nocturnal awakenings, 43% report difficulty in resuming sleep after waking, while over 90% report the condition persisting for more than six months. Greater than 50% contend with MOTN conditions for more than five years. A 2008 \\"Sleep in America\\" poll conducted by the National Sleep Foundation found that 42% of respondents awakened during the night at least a few nights a week, and 29% said they woke up too early and couldn’t get back to sleep. Other clinical studies have reported between 25% and 35% of people experience nocturnal awakenings at least three nights a week. ==See also== *Biphasic and polyphasic sleep ==References== Category:Insomnia ","title":"Middle-of-the-night insomnia"},{"id":"17295841","text":"John P.

The rapid economic development of the country after the Dutch Revolt in the years 1585–1620 accompanied by an equally rapid accumulation of a large fund of savings, created the need to invest those savings profitably. The Dutch financial sector, both in its public and private components, came to provide a wide range of modern investment products beside the possibility of (re-)investment in trade and industry, and in infrastructure projects. Such products were the public bonds, floated by the Dutch governments on a national, provincial, and municipal level; acceptance credit and commission trade; marine and other insurance products; and shares of publicly traded companies like the Dutch East India Company (VOC), and their derivatives. Institutions like the Amsterdam stock exchange, the Bank of Amsterdam, and the merchant bankers helped to mediate this investment. In the course of time the invested capital stock generated its own income stream that (because of the high propensity to save of the Dutch capitalists) caused the capital stock to assume enormous proportions. As by the end of the 17th century structural problems in the Dutch economy precluded profitable investment of this capital in domestic Dutch sectors, the stream of investments was redirected more and more to investment abroad, both in sovereign debt and foreign stocks, bonds and infrastructure. The Netherlands came to dominate the international capital market up to the crises of the end of the 18th century that caused the demise of the Dutch Republic. ==Introduction== Dutch East India Company factory in Hugli-Chuchura, Mughal Bengal. Hendrik van Schuylenburgh, 1665 To fully understand the peculiarities of the history of the system of public finance, and that of the closely related system of private (international) finance and banking of the Dutch Republic, one has to view it in the context of the general history of the Netherlands and of its institutions, and of the general Economic history of the Netherlands (1500–1815). In contrast to that general history this is a sectoral history, concerning the fiscal and financial sector. It is important to realize that those general histories differ in an important way from those of centralized Western European monarchies, like Spain, France, England, Denmark and Sweden in the early modern era. The Netherlands were highly decentralized from their origins in the Habsburg Netherlands in the late 15th century, and (other than the monarchies just mentioned) successfully resisted attempts to bring them together under the centralized authority of a modern state. Indeed, the Dutch Revolt that gave rise to the Republic of the United Netherlands, effectively resulted from resistance against attempts by the representatives of king Philip II of Spain, the Habsburg ruler of the country, to institute such a centralized state and a centralized system of public finance. Where in other instances the modern fiscal system resulted from, and was made subservient to, the interests of a centralizing monarchical state, in the Dutch instance the emerging fiscal system was the basis of, and was mobilized in the interests of the defense of, a stubbornly decentralised political entity. Ironically, the Habsburg rulers themselves pushed through the fiscal reforms that gave the rebellious provinces the wherewithal to resist the power of the sovereign. Emperor Charles V needed to increase the borrowing capacity of his government to finance his many military adventures. To that end it was necessary to put in place a number of fiscal reforms that would ensure that the public debt could be adequately serviced (thereby increasing the creditworthiness of his government). In 1542 the president of the Habsburg Council of State, Lodewijk van Schoor, proposed the levy of a number of taxes throughout the Habsburg Netherlands: a Tenth Penny (10 percent tax) on the income from real property and private loans, and excise taxes on beer, wine, and woollen cloth.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 92 These permanent taxes, collected by the individual provinces, would enable the provinces to pay enlarged subsidies to the central government, and (by issuing bonds secured by the revenue of these taxes) finance extraordinary levies (beden in old Dutch) in time of war. Other than expected, these reforms strengthened the position of the provinces, especially Holland, because as a condition of agreeing to the reform the States of Holland demanded and got total control of the disbursement of the taxes. Holland was now able to establish credit of its own, as the province was able to retire bond loans previously placed under compulsion as enforced loans. By this it demonstrated to potential creditors it was worthy of trust. This brought a market for voluntary credit into being that previously did not exist. This enabled Holland, and other provinces, to float bonds at a reasonable interest rate in a large pool of voluntary investors.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 93-94 The central government did not enjoy this good credit. On the contrary, its financing needs increased tremendously after the accession of Philip II, and this led to the crisis that caused the Revolt. The new Regent Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba tried to institute new taxes to finance the cost of suppression of public disturbances after the Iconoclastic Fury of 1566 without going through proper constitutional channels. This brought about a general revolt in the Netherlands, particularly in the northern provinces. Those were able to withstand the onslaught of the royalist forces militarily, because of the fiscal basis they had built in previous years. Of course, they now withheld the subsidies to the central government their taxes were supposed to finance. That central government was therefore forced to finance the war by transfers from other Habsburg lands, especially Spain itself. This led to an enormous increase in the size of the Spanish public debt, which that country was ultimately unable to sustain, and hence to the need to accept Dutch independence in 1648.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 94-95 As explained in the general article on the economic history of the Netherlands, the political revolt soon engendered an economic revolution also, partly related to political events (like the rise of the Dutch East India Company, from which, during the period of Proto-industrialization, the empire received 50% of textiles and 80% of silks imported from the India's Mughal Empire, chiefly from its most developed region known as Bengal Subah.Nanda, J. N (2005). Om Prakash, \\"Empire, Mughal\\", History of World Trade Since 1450, edited by John J. McCusker, vol. 1, Macmillan Reference USA, 2006, pp. 237–240, World History in Context. Retrieved 3 August 2017, and its West-Indies colleague), in other respects unrelated (like the revolutions in shipping, fisheries, and industry, that seem to be more due to technological innovations). This economic revolution was partly the cause of, and partly helped along further, by a number of fiscal and financial innovations that helped the Dutch economy make the transition to \\"modernity\\" in the early 17th century. ==Public finance== The \\"constitution\\" of the new Republic, the Union-of-Utrecht treaty of 1579, tried to lay the basis of a revolutionary new fiscal system. It put in place a rudimentary confederal budget system that charged the Raad van State (Council of StateThe current Wikipedia article discusses only the modern Dutch Council of State. The Council of State under the Republic was more of an executive council, accountable to the sovereign States-General of the Netherlands.) with drafting an annual Staat van Oorlog (war budget). This budget was presented in a \\"General Petition\\" to the States-General for (unanimous) approval.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 96 The treaty next required that the tax revenues for the financing of this budget would be levied \\"...equally in all united provinces, and at the same rate\\". Furthermore, it prohibited internal tariffs and other taxes discriminating against residents of other provinces. Alas, these two latter provisions were never implemented. Instead, the provinces continued the practice under the Habsburg rulers that the provinces paid a fixed quotum (the repartitie) of the budget. Holland's contribution was the norm from which the contributions of other provinces were derived. After some changes the quota were fixed in 1616 as follows (to remain unchanged till 1792): Friesland one-fifth of Holland's share; Zeeland (after some diligent bargaining) 16 percent; Utrecht and Groningen one-tenth each; Gelderland 9.6 percent; Overijssel 6.1 percent; and Drenthe (though not represented in the States-General) 1 percent.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 99 The States-General had only two direct sources of income: it taxed the Generality Lands directly, and the five Dutch admiralties set up under its authority, financed their activities nominally from the Convooien en Licenten levied on trade.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 98 Otherwise, the provinces determined themselves how they would collect the revenues to finance their repartitie. Within the provinces there were other quota systems to determine the contributions of the cities and of the countryside. In Holland, the city of Amsterdam was by far the largest contributor (though this was different from Habsburg times, when Delft made the relatively largest contribution), which explained the influence that city wielded, even at the national level. This system remained in place throughout the life of the Republic. Simon van Slingelandt made an attempt in 1716 to reform it by giving more power to the center. He convened the Groote Vergadering (a kind of constitutional convention) in that year, prompted by the fact that the Generality faced a liquidity crisis in 1715, when most provinces fell into arrears on their contributions. However, this august body rejected all reform proposals, opting instead for \\"muddling through\\". Ten years later Van Slingelandt was made Grand Pensionary of Holland, but on condition that he not press for constitutional reforms.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 122 Except for a reshuffling of the provincial quota in 1792, a real reform of the system had to wait till after the demise of the Republic. The public debt was consolidated on a national level in 1798, and the system of taxation only unified in 1806. ===Taxation=== As Holland was the most important province, usually paying 58 percent of the total budget,De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 99; as other provinces were often in arrears, and Holland then took up the slack, it often paid even more. it is probably useful to concentrate the discussion on this province (also because other provinces modeled themselves on the Holland system). It based its fiscal structure on the system inherited from the Habsburg era, mentioned above, but extended it in important respects. Pachtersoproer The most important source of revenue, collectively known as gemene middelen (common means), were a set of excise taxes on first necessities, especially on beer, wine, peat, grain, salt, and the use of market scales. These were essentially transaction taxes, as they were levied at a fixed rate, not ad valorem (the revenue stamps introduced later in the 17th century basically fall in the same category as they tax transactions in commerce). In the 1630s this type of tax accounted for two- thirds of Holland's revenue. It then amounted to about ten guilders per capita (while per capita income for most people may have been much lower than the average of about 150 guilders a year). These taxes were levied on the seller of the good, who presumably passed them on to the consumer. They were collected by tax farmers, who bought their farms at auction, at least until the Pachtersoproer in 1748 put a stop to this practice. In Holland the real abuses of the system, though perceived to be great, may not have been as serious as the French abuses of the tax farms in that country. This was, because the tax farmers were numerous, low-status, and politically subordinate to the city Regenten, for which they formed a convenient barrier against popular discontent. Because of this weak position the Dutch tax farmers may have been less able than their French colleagues to exploit their privileges.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 103 Though the excises were a heavy burden on the common man, at least in the first quarter of the 17th century, somewhat surprisingly this regressive taxation burden may have abated somewhat in later years. There were several factors for this. Many excises incorporated mitigating provisions, like exemptions and sliding scales, that reweighed their impact in the direction of higher-income people (like graduation of the beer tax according to quality; conversion of the grain and salt taxes to per- capita taxes on assumed consumption; a progressive tariff for the tax on household servants, and on weddings and burials, that may be seen as wealth taxes, as most people were exempt). Finally, the relative importance of these excises in total revenue declined in later years. It accounted for 83 percent of total revenue in 1650, but only 66 percent in 1790.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 105-106 The types of tax that were next in importance were the real and personal property taxes like the verponding, a kind of rates. This amounted to 8.5 percent (the Twelfth Penny) of the rental value of all real property. This tax, first introduced in 1584, was based on assessments of land described in registers that were not updated. To remedy the problems resulting therefrom a new survey in 1632 resulted in new registers, and at this time the tax was fixed at 20 percent of land rents and 8.5 percent of house rental values, all levied on the landlords. Whether they passed these on was determined by economic conditions, of course.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 106 Unfortunately, 1632 proved from hindsight to be a top year for property prices. As rents plunged after the middle of the century, the real burden of the verponding therefore increased sharply. Also, in the war years after 1672 extraordinary levies, up to three times a year, were often imposed, amounting to 100 percent of the normal verponding. Pressure for new assessments was therefore high, but in 1732, after a century, the registers were only revised for house rents. The loss of revenue was otherwise deemed to be unacceptable. Farmers had to wait for the lifting of the agricultural depression after 1740 for relief through higher incomes.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 106-107 Finally, direct taxes on income and wealth were the third major pillar of the tax system in Holland. Due to the difficulty of assessing incomes, at first the emphasis was put here on taxes on capital, like the inheritance tax, and a number of forced loans that amounted to taxes. Income taxes were attempted in 1622, and again in 1715, but they proved impracticable. In 1742 Holland tried to impose the personeel quotisatie (whose registers offer a useful source to the social historian), which remained in force for eleven years, before it was abandoned. This was a progressive income tax, levied on incomes over 600 guilders (the highest quintile) at a rate, ranging from 1.0 to 2.5 percent.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 107 Wealth taxes proved to be more feasible. The Hundredth and the Thousandth Penny were regularly levied on real and personal property (as distinguished from the income from property, like the verponding) from 1625. In the difficult years after 1672, when war required high repartities, extraordinary wealth taxes were imposed very frequently, amounting to a total levy of (theoretically) 14 percent of all real property, seigneurial rights, tithes, bonds, and personal objects of value. In 1674 Holland put this ad hoc taxation on a regular footing by founding a new register (the personele kohier). From then on the 100th and 200th penny could regularly be collected.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 107-108 Finally, a curious predecessor of a tax like the dividend tax was the levying after 1722 of the 100th and 200th penny on the income from provincial bonds, which then replaced the general wealth tax just mentioned. This withholding tax proved to be very convenient, but had the unintended consequence that the effective yield of Holland bonds (other bonds were not taxed) was commensurately lowered. Holland therefore had to pay a higher rate on its bonds, which more or less defeated the purpose. All these taxes imposed a considerable burden on the Dutch tax payer, compared to his contemporaries in neighboring countries.An exception to the dismal character of most taxes may be the state lottery, founded in 1726, and still existing, though usually categorized as a tax, and a regressive one at that There were no exemptions for churchmen or aristocrats. The Republic had sufficient authority to have these burdens accepted by its citizens, but this was a function of the \\"bottom-up\\" implementation of the taxes. Municipal and provincial tax authorities possessed more legitimacy than central authorities, and this legitimacy was reinforced by the fact that the broad tax base enabled local authorities to tailor taxes to local circumstances. The taxation system thereby underpinned the federal structure of the Dutch state.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 108 Other than for other provinces, a reasonably accurate picture can be sketched of developments in revenue and tax burden in the province of Holland. In the two decades of the Revolt after 1568, Holland's revenues exploded in a tenfold increase compared to pre-Revolt years, proving that Dutchmen were not opposed to paying taxes per se (despite the fact that they had started a revolution about Alva's taxes). The revenue kept growing after 1588, rising threefold in the period till 1630. However, the real per-capita tax burden remained constant in the years up to 1670. This reflected the tremendous economic growth in the Golden Age, on the one hand, and a rapid expansion of the tax base, commensurate with this growth, on the other hand.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 109 As in the economy in general, there was a sharp break after 1672. Whereas the economy stagnated, expenditures in connection with the wars, and hence taxes too, rose. Taxes doubled by the 1690s, but nominal wages (as distinguished from real wages, which rose due to the general decline in price levels) remained constant. At the same time the tax base almost certainly shrank as a consequence of the economic decline. This resulted in a doubling of the per-capita tax burden. This development levelled off after the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, when the Republic entered a period of peace and neutrality (though there was a spike when it was dragged into the War of the Austrian Succession). However, it did not result in a reduction of the per-capita tax burden up to the final crisis of the Republic and its economy after 1780. Then that tax burden again sharply increased. Presumably, the other provinces globally followed these developments, though at a distance, because of their different economic circumstances.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 108-110 Other than for Holland (for which more data are known) revenue figures for the Republic as a whole are available for 1716, when it amounted to 32.5 million guilders, and again for 1792 (when the repartitie-system was revised for the first time), when it came to 40.5 million (inflated) guilders. After 1795 the Batavian Republic collected regular revenue statistics. These figures allow the following observations: in 1790 the per-capita tax burden at the national level in the Republic was comparable to that in Great Britain, and twice that in France (which had just started a revolution about that tax burden). This reflected a rapid rise in tax burdens in both France and Great Britain during the 18th century in which both countries made up a large difference with the Republic (but also in income levels, of course). Extrapolating backward, the Dutch level of taxation in 1720 probably was double that of Britain. Dutch innovations like excises and stamp taxes were followed with a lag of a century in the larger countries.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 111 The stagnation of the growth in the Dutch per-capita tax burden during the 18th century (while the Republic's rivals made up their arrears) may reflect both a lack of political will on the part of the authorities to exact higher burdens, and economic limits to taxation. The latter hypothesis is indirectly supported by the fact that after 1672 the tax system became far less regressive than before. Apparently, the common man was spared a further increase of his tax burden. Henceforth, \\"the rich\\" were burdened more severely by efforts at direct taxation, than during the Golden Age. However, this applied more to people rich in land and (provincial) bonds, than to people investing in commerce and foreign bonds. Source of income was therefore very important. This also contributed to the peculiar developments around the public debt in the 18th century.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 112-113 ===Public debt=== Usually, taxation and borrowing are seen as alternative means of financing public expenditures, at least if they are available with equal ease. Borrowing is sometimes inevitable when a spike in expenditures would necessitate an unsupportable spike in taxation otherwise. This was the usual justification for taking on public debt in the days of the Habsburg Netherlands, when the province of Holland built up an enviable public credit. Alas, in the first years of the RevoltThe usual English sense of the term \\"Dutch Revolt\\" is used here, denoting the years 1568–1588 of the Eighty Years' War; the Dutch usually don't distinguish a specific \\"revolt\\" this credit evaporated and Holland (let alone the Republic) was forced to increase taxation very strongly (as we have seen), partly by resorting to forced loans (which at least offered the solace of paying interest and holding out the hope of ultimate redemption). Voluntary loans were only to be had from people related to government (like the Prince of Orange) and from the Office of Ecclesiastical Property, the institution that managed the expropriated real property of the Roman Catholic Church. That office was charged with continuing the charitable works of the Church foundations, which it could conveniently do by selling its choice properties and investing the proceeds in interest-bearing public bonds.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 114 At first the scarcity of funds available for public borrowing was no doubt due to pessimism about the prospects of the new state. However, soon a new reason of a more propitious nature was the explosive economic boom in trade of the 1590s and early 17th century, that required financing from private capital and offered far better returns than the measly 8.33 percent (12th penny) the state could pay. This competing demand for funds can be illustrated by the fact that most people voluntarily investing in public debt up to the Twelve Years' Truce (1609) were widows and orphans. Also the phenomenon of the emergence of a secondary market for forced loans, offered by some municipalities in Holland, which enabled merchants to free up their forced loans, and reinvest those in private ventures, points in this direction. With the Truce more normal times arrived. The borrowing requirement went to zero with the arrival of the temporary peace and this probably helped the transition to voluntary lending. After the Truce ended in 1621 expenditures for war again rose steeply, but this time the Republic, and in particular Holland, had no trouble borrowing on average 4 million guilders annually, which helped keep down the rise in taxation that might otherwise have been necessary. By 1640 confidence in Holland's public debt (and the supply of funds available for borrowing) had risen so much, that a refinancing of the outstanding debt with a much lower interest rate of 5 percent was possible (followed in 1665 by a conversion to 4 percent).De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 115 A bond from the Dutch East India Company, dating from 7 November 1623, for the amount of 2,400 florins; written out and authorized in Middelburg, but signed in Amsterdam Provincial and municipal borrowers in these days issued three types of debt instrument: *Promissory notes (called Obligatiën), a form of short-term debt, in the form of bearer bonds, that were readily negotiable; *Redeemable bonds (called losrenten) that paid an annual interest to the holder, whose name appeared in a public-debt ledger (not as convenient as bearer bonds, but the bonds were still readily negotiable) until the loan was paid off; *Life annuities (called lijfrenten) that paid interest during the life of the buyer, or nominee, whereas the principal is extinguished at his or her death (this type of debt was therefore self- amortizing). Unlike other countries, where the markets for public debt were often mediated by bankers, in Holland the state dealt directly with prospective bondholders. The tax receivers doubled as registrars of the public debt. The receivers were also free to tailor bond offerings to local circumstances. They often issued many bonds of small coupon that were attractive to unsophisticated small savers, like craftsmen, and often women. This made for a kind of \\"popular capitalism\\", at least during the Golden Age of the 17th century, that often amazed foreign observers.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 116 Lijfrenten paid a higher rate of interest than losrenten, which made them rather popular, the more so, because Holland at first did not make the interest dependent on the age of the nominee. It took no less an intellect than that of Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt to figure out that this omission made lijfrenten too expensive. This contribution to actuarial science also helped bring down the Dutch debt service appreciably. In practice, however, by the middle of the 17th century the Dutch Republic enjoyed such good credit, that it was able to dispense with lijfrenten and finance its borrowing requirements with long-term redeemable bonds at rates that were equal to, or lower than, the lowest interest returns available in the private sector. In fact, redemption could often be postponed indefinitely, making such loans \\"interest-only\\". This enabled the Republic in practice to spend according to its needs without practical limit, greatly exceeding its short-term ability to tax. This greatly enhanced its politico-military power, as it was able to field mercenary armies equal in size to the armies of countries with much larger populations, like France and England. The positive side of a well- managed public debt, like the Dutch one, is that it expands the purchasing power of the state in a timely fashion, without putting undue burdens on the tax payer. However, there are prices to pay. One of those prices is an appreciable redistributive effect, when via the debt service money is channelled from a large proportion of the population (the tax payers) to a much smaller number of bondholders. In the beginning (thanks also to the forced character of the lending) this effect was limited by the broad distribution of debt-holders across the population. In the course of the 17th century, however, bondholding became more concentrated. One of the reasons for this was that new bonds were often financed by reinvesting retained interest by existing bondholders. This effect increased commensurately with the increase of the debt and the debt service. It was reinforced by the fact that bondholders were thrifty people (a tendency possibly explainable by the Ricardian equivalence-theorem, though people at the time were of course unaware of this theoretical underpinningDe Vries and Van der Woude, p. 124). In the course of the final third of the 17th century, and especially of the 18th century, this concentration of the public debt in the hands of a few gave rise to the emergence of a rentier class that amassed an important proportion of total wealth in the Republic, thanks to this redistributive effect, and despite the often confiscatory levies on wealth of the 18th century described above. This development went hand in hand with the development of the public debt itself after 1672. During the second half of the Golden Age (especially the years 1650–1665) the borrowing requirements of commerce and the public sector fell short of the amount of savings supplied by the private sector. This may explain the boom in real estate of those years, that sometimes acquired a \\"bubble\\" character. However, after the beginning of the Franco- Dutch War of 1672 these savings were rechanneled to the public sector (explaining the collapse of the housing bubble at the same time). Nevertheless, the holders of this rapidly increasing public debt were still awash in cash, which explains the low interest rates in the years up to 1689. This availability of funds also helped finance the great expansion of the VOC (and of its debt) in these years. With the great conflicts that started with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 (financed with a bank loan that a consortium of Amsterdam bankers threw together in three days) these markets tightened appreciably, however. Holland was now forced to reintroduce the unprofitable lijfrenten, and to resort to gimmicks like lottery bonds to entice lenders to buy its bonds. As the supply of funds from redemptions and retained earnings now fell short of government demand, these new loans must have been partially financed by disinvestments in the commercial, industrial and agricultural sectors of the economy (admittedly depressed in these years). By 1713 Holland's debt had reached a total of 310 million guilders, and that of the Generality of the Republic of 68 million (illustrating the relative preponderance of Holland in the Republic's finances). The debt service of this debt amounted to 14 million guilders. This exceeded the ordinary tax revenues of Holland. Most of this debt was now concentrated in the hands of only a relatively few families, that not so coincidentally also had privileged access to political office.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 118-119 This conjuncture of factors (decision making in the hands of a political group that also owned the public debt, a debt that surmounted the ability of the economy to service it) explains in large part the \\"withdrawal\\" of the Republic as a Great Power after 1713.On the other hand, the possibility of withdrawal existed only now, when the war with France was won; in 1701 the Republic did not have the luxury to ignore the aggression of France. Once the reform proposals of Van Slingelandt, that might have provided a viable alternative by enhancing the financial capacity of the Dutch state, had been rejected by this conservative political class, there was simply no alternative to austerity in public finance, and dismantling the military power of the Republic (paying off the mercenaries and laying up the fleet). Due to adverse economic circumstances in the first decades of the 18th century even these austerity measures offered little solace in practice. The only effect was that at least the public debt did not grow during these years, but even this trend was reversed after the forced entry into the War of the Austrian Succession caused another spike in military outlays (unfortunately with little positive effect, in view of the disastrous outcome of this war for the Republic), and therefore a spike in the growth of the debt.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 122-123 The levelling-off of the growth of the debt in the years before 1740, and again after 1750, caused a curious dilemma for the Dutch rentiers: they kept accumulating capital from bond redemptions and retained bond earnings, due to an undiminished high average propensity to save (though their wealth allowed them to wallow in luxury at the same time). However, there were few attractive investment opportunities for this new capital in the domestic Dutch economy: as explained in the article on the economic history of the Netherlands, structural problems militated against expansion of the private sector, and the public debt hardly expanded (even decreased after 1750). This development gave undeniable discomfort to Dutch investors. It presented them with two unenviable alternatives: hoarding (which apparently happened on an appreciable scale, leading to a large increase in the amount of money in circulation, while the velocity of circulation droppedDe Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 88-89, 125), or investing abroad. The rentiers therefore switched on a major scale to foreign direct investment, especially in infrastructure in Great Britain (where the Industrial Revolution of that country was about to begin, preceded by an agricultural revolution that needed financing), and also in public debt in that country. The Republic in this way for the first time in history became an international capital market, especially geared to foreign sovereign debt in the second half of the 18th century. By 1780 the net value of Dutch foreign government lending exceeded 350 million guilders, about two- thirds of which British government debt. This brought annual foreign earnings of 16 million guilders. After 1780, other than one might expect in view of the crises following that year, this trend sharply increased. This can only be explained by wholesale disinvestment in the Dutch economy, and reinvestment in especially foreign sovereign debt. Foreign investment probably doubled to 20 million guilders annually. The result was that Dutch residents held foreign debt instruments exceeding an estimated value of a billion guilders in 1795 (though other estimates are more conservative, the lower ones are still in the 650 million range).De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 144 ==Banking and finance== ===Merchant banks and the international capital market=== The remarkable growth of Dutch involvement with the international capital market, especially in the second half of the 18th century, was mediated by what we now would call merchant banks. In Holland these grew out of merchant houses that shifted their capital first from financing their own trade and inventories to acceptance credit, and later branched out specifically into underwriting and public offerings of foreign government bonds (denominated in Dutch guilders) in the Dutch capital markets. In this respect the domestic and foreign bond markets differed appreciably, as the Dutch government dealt directly with Dutch investors (as we have seen above). Amsterdam City Hall, Source: Amsterdam Municipal Department for the Preservation and Restoration of Historic Buildings and Sites (bMA) Dutch involvement with loans to foreign governments had been as old as the Republic. At first such loans were provided by banking houses (as was usual in early-modern Europe), with the guarantee of the States General, and often also subsidized by the Dutch government. An example is the loan of 400,000 Reichstalers to Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden around 1620 directly by the States General. When the king could not fulfill his obligations, the Amsterdam merchant Louis de Geer agreed to assume the payments in exchange for Swedish commercial concessions (iron and copper mines) to his firm.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 141 Similar arrangements between Dutch merchants and foreign governments occurred throughout the 17th century. The transition to more modern forms of international lending came after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The new Dutch regime in England imported Dutch innovations in public finance to England, the most important of which was the funded public debt, in which certain revenues (of the also newly introduced excises after the Dutch model) were dedicated to the amortization and service of the public debt, while the responsibility for the English debt shifted from the monarch personally, to Parliament. The management of this debt was entrusted to the innovatory Bank of England in 1694. This in one fell swoop put the English public debt on the same footing of creditworthiness in the eyes of Dutch investors, as the Dutch one. In the following decades wealthy Dutch investors invested directly in British government bonds, and also in British joint-stock companies like that Bank of England, and the Honourable East India Company. This was facilitated as after 1723 such stock, and certain government bonds, were traded jointly on the London and Amsterdam Stock Exchanges.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 142 But this applied to a safely controlled ally like England. Other foreign governments were still deemed \\"too risky\\" and their loans required the guarantee, and often subsidy, of the States General, as before (which helped to tie allies to the Dutch cause in the wars against France). After 1713 there was no longer a motivation for the Dutch government to extend such guarantees. Foreign governments therefore had to enter the market on their own. This is where the merchant banks came in, around the middle of the 18th century, with their emmissiebedrijf or public-offering business. At first, this business was limited to British and Austrian loans. The banks would float guilder- denominated bonds on behalf of those (and later other) governments, and create a market for those bonds. This was done by specialist brokers (called entrepreneurs) who rounded up clients and steered them to the offerings. The banks were able to charge a hefty fee for this service.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 143 The rapid growth of foreign investment after 1780 (as seen above) coincided with a redirection of the investment to governments other than the British. Many Dutch investors liquidated their British portfolios after the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (which immediately resulted in a rise in British interest rates) and reinvested in French, Spanish, Polish (an especially bad choice in view of the coming Partitions of Poland), and even American government loans.By 1803 Dutch investors held one-quarter of the U.S. federal debt; De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 144 The appetite for such placements abated a little after the first defaults of foreign governments (like the French in 1793), but even under the Batavian Republic (which itself absorbed the bulk of available funds after 1795) investment in foreign funds did not fall-off completely. This may have been because Dutch investors did not always realize the riskiness of this type of investment. They were often badly served by the merchant banks, who had a vested interest in protecting their sovereign clients to the detriment of the bondholders. This is also indicated by the very slight agio of the interest rate of these risky loans over that for domestic bonds. This apparent credulity on the part of the Dutch bondholders resulted in serious losses in the final years of the independent state, and during the annexation to France. The Dutch state for the first time in centuries defaulted after that annexation (a default that the new Kingdom of the Netherlands continued after the Netherlands became independent again in 1813). This tiercé (a dividing of the debt into two parts repudiated debt and one part recognized debt) followed the earlier repudiation of the French debt that had also devastated Dutch bondholders that had switched into French debt shortly before. The losses in the period 1793 to 1840 may have totalled between one-third and one half of Dutch wealth.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 146-147 ===The Wisselbanken=== International payments have always posed a problem in international trade. Though exchange rate risks were less in the era in which the intrinsic value of money was usually equal to the face value (at least absent debasement of the coin, of course), there was the problem of the risk and inconvenience of transporting money or specie. An early innovation was therefore the bill of exchange (called wisselbrief in Dutch, or wissel for short), which obviated the need to transport coins in payment. After the development of this financial instrument by Italian and later Iberian merchants and bankers, Antwerp added a number of legal innovations in the mid-16th century that enhanced its value as such an instrument appreciably. These were assignment, endorsement, and discounting of bills of exchange. The Antwerpse Costuymen (commercial laws of Antwerp), which were adapted in Amsterdam from 1597, allowed unlimited chains of endorsement. This may have been convenient, but it increased the risk of default with each additional endorsement in the chain. For that reason the Amsterdam city government prohibited this practice. The Old Town Hall of Amsterdam (by Pieter Saenredam with Wisselbank Instead, in 1609 a new municipal institution was established (after the example of the Venetian Banco della Piassa di Rialto, established in 1587) in the form of the Amsterdamsche Wisselbank, also called the Bank of Amsterdam. This bank (with offices in the City Hall) took deposits of foreign and domestic coin (and after 1683 specie), effected transfers between such deposit accounts (the giro function), and accepted (i.e. paid) bills of exchange (the more important of which—over 600 guilders in value—could now be endorsed—to the bank—only once). The latter provision effectively forced Amsterdam merchants (and many foreign merchants) to open accounts with this bank. Though Amsterdam established the first such bank in Holland, other cities, like Delft, Middelburg, and Rotterdam, followed in due course. The Amsterdam establishment was, however, the most important and the best known.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 131-132 The giro function had the additional advantage (beside the obvious convenience) that the value of the underlying deposit was guaranteed. This was important in an era in which Metallism still reigned supreme. As a matter of fact, depositors were prepared to pay a small \\"fee\\" in the form of an agio for this \\"bank money\\" or bankgeld (which was an early example of fiat money) over normal circulating coin, called courantgeld.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 83, 132 Though the wisselbank was not a mint, it provided coins deposited with it for melting and recoining at Dutch mints in the form of a high-quality currency, called \\"trade money\\" (or negotiepenningen in Dutch). These coins were used in trade with areas where the Dutch and other West Europeans had a structural trade deficit, like the Far East, the Baltic countries, Russia and the Levant, because they were highly valued there for their quality as commodity money. These trade coins were distinguished from the circulating currency (Dutch: standpenningen) that after the reform of the currency of 1622, that allowed the minting of coins with a lower-than-face-value metal content, had the character of fiat money. This development recognized the reality that most money in circulationWhich need not even have been Dutch coin, as most coins circulating were in fact ducatons from the Southern Netherlands during the 17th century;De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 83 had a fiduciary character. Toward the end of the 17th century the Republic became (thanks to its general balance-of-trade surplus, and the policy of the Wisselbank) a reservoir of coin and bullion, which was regularly (re-)minted as trade coin, thereby \\"upgrading\\" inferior circulating money.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 83-84 Unlike the later Bank of England, the Bank of Amsterdam did not act as a lender of last resort. That function was, however, performed by other institutions in the course of the history of the Republic, be it on a rather ad hoc basis: during financial crises in the second half of the 18th century lenders of last resort were briefly brought into being, but liquidated soon after the crisis had abated.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 155 The function of bank of issue was often performed by small private operations, called kassiers (literally: \\"cashiers\\") that accepted courantgeld for deposit, and issued promissory notes for domestic payments. These notes functioned as an early type of paper money. The same went after 1683 for the Bank of Amsterdam when its receipts for foreign coin and bullion were accepted as fiduciary money.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 132, 134 Those kassiers engaged also in fractional-reserve banking, as did the other wisselbanken outside Amsterdam, though this \\"risky\\" practice was officially frowned upon. During the crisis of 1672 the Middelburg wisselbank, that had actively lent deposited funds to local businessmen, faced a bank run which forced it to suspend payments for a while. The Amsterdam wisselbank, at least at first, officially did not engage in this practice. In reality it did lend money to the city government of Amsterdam and to the East-India Company, both solid credit risks at the time, though this was technically in violation of the bank's charter. The loophole was that both debtors used a kind of anticipatory note, so that the loans were viewed as advances of money. This usually did not present a problem, except when during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War the anticipated income did not materialize, causing a liquidity crisis for both the bank and its debtors.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 133 Another important business for Dutch bankers was foreign exchange trading. The bills of exchange originated in many countries and specified settlement in many different foreign currencies. Theoretically the exchange rates of these currencies were fixed by their intrinsic values, but (just as in modern times) trade fluctuations could cause the market exchange rate to diverge from this intrinsic rate. This risk was minimized, however, at Amsterdam, because the freedom there to export and import monetary metals tended to stabilize the exchange rates. Besides, Dutch merchants traded all over the known world and generated bills of exchange all over. This helped to generate regular exchange-rate quotations (an important information function) with many foreign locations. For these reasons Amsterdam attracted a business in bills of exchange that went far beyond the needs of its own already appreciable business. Merchants from many Mediterranean countries (where exchange rates with northern currencies were seldom quoted) bought bills on Amsterdam, where other bills on the intended final destinations could be acquired. Even London merchants long relied on the Amsterdam money market, especially for the English trade on Russia, at least till 1763.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 136 In sum, most \\"modern\\" banking practices were already present in the Republic, and often exported abroad (like the fractional banking practices of the predecessor of the Swedish Riksbanken, the Stockholms Banco, founded by Dutch financier Johan Palmstruch; and later the Bank of England). They were, however, often not institutionalized on a \\"national\\" level, due to the stubbornly confederal nature of the Republic. For this reason the Netherlands only in 1814 got a formal central bank. ===Commercial credit and insurance=== As explained in the general article on the economic history of the Netherlands under the Republic, the Dutch entrepôt function was very important. One of the reasons Amsterdam was able to win this function after the Fall of Antwerp was the commercial credit offered to suppliers and buyers, usually as part of the discount on the bill of exchange. By prolonging and rolling-over such short- term credits, suppliers and customers could easily be tied to the entrepôt. The low interest rates usually prevailing in the Republic made the maintenance of large inventories feasible, thereby enhancing Amsterdam's reputation as the world's Emporium.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 135 Though this commercial credit was originally tied to the trading operation of merchant firms, the sheer scope of the entrepôt created the opportunity for the trading in bills apart from this direct business, thereby serving third parties, even those not doing direct business with the Netherlands. Two kinds of financial trading, divorced from commercial trading, began to emerge by the beginning of the 18th century: trading on commission, and accepting houses. The first consisted of trading of agents (called commissionairs) on behalf of other merchants for a commission. Their role was therefore intermediation between buyers and sellers, leaving the conclusion of the business to those parties themselves. The second consisted in guaranteeing payment on bills of exchange from third parties. If the third party issuing the bill would default, the accepting house would pay the bill itself. This guarantee of course was provided for a fee. This service need not have any connection with Dutch traders, or even with the Dutch entrepôt. It served international trade in general. Though this divorce between credit provision and trade has been interpreted as undermining Dutch trade itself in the age of relative decline of Dutch commerce, it probably was just a defensive move in a time of increasing foreign competition, protecting a share for Dutch commerce, and providing another outlet for commercial capital that would otherwise have been idle. The size of this business was estimated to be about 200 million guilders around 1773.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 136-137 Much lending and borrowing of course occurred outside the formal economy. Unfortunately, it is difficult to document the size of this informal business. However, the archived registers of the notaries form an important source of information on this business, as those notaries acted as intermediaries bringing lenders and borrowers together (not least in the mortgage-loan business). Also, probate inventories, describing the estate of deceased persons, show the intricate web of credit transactions that occurred on a daily basis in the Republic, even between its humblest citizens.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 139 Shipwreck off a rocky coast by Adam Willaerts Mercantile trade brought risks of shipwreck and piracy. Such risks were often self-insured. The East-India Company armed its vessels, and maintained extensive military establishments abroad, thereby internalizing protection costs. Arming merchantmen was quite usual in those days. However, the type of cargo vessel most often used by the Dutch, the Fluyt ship, went usually without guns, or was but lightly armed. This made ship and crew vulnerable to capture by Dunkirk privateers and Barbary pirates. In the latter case captured crews were often sold as slaves. To finance the ransoming of these slaves so-called slavenkassen (slave treasuries) were set up with the support of the government, some of which still exist as charitable foundations, like the one in Zierikzee. Other examples of self-insurance were the partnerships of ship owners, known as partenrederijen (which is probably best translated as \\"managed partnership\\", although these were precursors of joint stock companies). These spread the financial risks over a large number of investors, the participanten. This type of business organization was not limited to ship owning, of course. Investment in windmills and trekschuiten often took this form also.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 137, 139 But insurance was also formalized as a contractual business, first offered by merchants as part of their normal trade, later by specialized insurers. This type of business started with marine insurance. In 1598 (three years before a similar institution was established in England) the city of Amsterdam instituted a Kamer van Assurantie en Avarij (Chamber of Marine Insurance) which was charged with regulating this business. This drew on the example of Antwerp where this business had been going on for a long time before that. From 1612 on the Assuradeuren (insurance brokers) had their own corner in the Amsterdam stock exchange, where they offered policies on hulls and cargoes to many different destinations. From 1626 the prijscourant (offering stock and bond prices) of the Dutch stock exchanges offered quotations for ten destinations. A century later that number had grown to 21. A large number of private firms insured domestic and foreign shipping alike, making Amsterdam Europe's principal center for marine insurance until the third quarter of the 18th century. One of these companies, founded during the 1720 Dutch financial Bubble (related to the English and French bubbles of the same year) as the Maatschappij van Assurantie, Discontering en Beleening der Stad Rotterdam has been continuously doing business as an insurance firm, Stad Rotterdam Verzekeringen, to this day.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 137-138 These marine insurers at the end of the 18th century branched out to fire insurance.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 138 However, that type of insurance had already been pioneered at the end of the 17th century by a remarkable mutual insurance company of owners of paper-making windmills, called the Papiermakerscontract, though other types of industrial windmills were also admitted. The first known such policy dates from 1694. In 1733 no less than 72 windmills were insured with an insured value of 224,200 guilders. The company remained in business till 1903.Bouwens, B. (2004) Op papier gesteld: de geschiedenis van de Nederlandse papier- en kartonindustrie in de twintigste eeuw, Uitgeverij Boom, , p. 29, fn. 26 Another form of insurance that was popular from time to time was life insurance. However, private insurance companies could usually not compete with government life annuities when the government was active in this market. We therefore see this activity only in the period between 1670 and 1690, when Holland suspended the issuance of lijfrenten, and again after 1710, when the province again withdrew from this market. After 1780 the French government started to dominate this market with its life annuities. The private life-insurance contracts often took the form of group investment pools that paid pensions to nominees. A peculiar feature was often a tontine format that offered windfall profits to surviving nominees. In the 18th century these pools were marketed and controlled by brokers, which gave them a professional character. ==The Stock Market== Bringing together the savers that accumulated the growing stock of capital in the Republic and the people that needed that capital, like the Dutch and other governments, merchants, industrialists, developers etc. constitutes the formation of a market in the abstract economic sense. This does not require a physical meeting place in principle, but in early modern times markets commonly did come together at certain places. This was necessary, because the main function of a market is the exchange of information (about prices offered and accepted) and in the absence of means of telecommunication people had to meet in the flesh to be able to do that. In other words, abstract markets in the economic sense still had to be linked to physical markets. This applied as well to markets for commodities, as to financial markets. Again, there is no reason why financial markets and commodity markets should share the same physical space, but again, due to the close linkage of trade and finance, they in practice invariably did. We therefore see financial markets emerging in the places where commodities were also traded: the commodity exchanges. Commodity exchanges probably started in 13th-century Bruges, but they quickly spread to other cities in the Netherlands, like Antwerp and Amsterdam. Because of the importance of the trade with the Baltic area, during the 15th and 16th centuries, the Amsterdam exchange became concentrated on the trade in grain (including grain futures and forwards and options) and shipping. In the years before the Revolt this commodity exchange was subordinate to the Antwerp exchange. But when the Antwerp entrepôt came to Amsterdam the commodity exchange took on the extended functions of the Antwerp exchange also, as those were closely linked.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 150 What changed the Amsterdam commodity exchange to the first modern stock exchange was the evolvement of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) into a publicly traded company. It is important to make a few distinctions here to avoid a number of common misunderstandings. The VOC has been called the first joint-stock company, but this is only true in a loose sense, because its organization only resembled an English joint-stock company, but was not exactly the same. Like other Dutch merchant ventures, the VOC started out in 1602 as a partenrederij, a type of business organization that had by then already a long history in the Netherlands. As in the joint-stock company the investors in a rederij owned shares in the physical stock of the venture. They bore a part of the risk of the venture in exchange for a claim on the profits from the venture.Kohn, p. 24 ff. A number of things were new about the VOC, compared to earlier Dutch companies: its charter gave it a monopoly in the trade on the East Indies, and other than in earlier partenrederijen the liability of the managing partners was limited to their share in the company, just like that of the silent partners. But the innovation that made the VOC really relevant for the history of the emergence of stock markets came about serendipitously, not as part of its charter, but because of a decision by the managing partners in the early years of the company to disallow the withdrawal of paid-in capital by partners. As this had been a right of shareholders in other such partnerships it necessitated a feasible alternative for the direct liquidation of the interest of shareholders in the company. The solution was to enable shareholders that wished to get out to sell their share on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange that had just got a new building, but otherwise was just the continuation of the commodity exchange that existed beforehand.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 385 It is important to recognize that shares were still registered by name in the VOC's register, and that transfer of shares was effected by an entry in that register, witnessed by the company's directors. Such transfers were allowed at infrequent opportunities (usually when a dividend was paid). The \\"shares\\" that are presented as \\"the world's first shares\\" therefore were in reality what we now would call either stock certificates or else stock options (depending on the concrete circumstances). This secondary market in VOC stock proved quite successful. The paid-in capital of the company, and hence the number of shares, remained the same during the life of the company (about 6.5 million guilders), and when the company proved to be very successful the demand for its shares drove up their price till they reached 1200 percent in the 1720s.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 448 Remarkably, the VOC did not raise new capital by issuing new shares, but it relied on borrowing and retained profits for the financing of its expansion. This is remarkable, because previous ventures on the contrary did not borrow, but used additional subscriptions if they needed extra capitalKohn, op. cit., p. 25 and fn. 108 The real innovation, therefore, was that next to physical commodities henceforth financial rights in the ownership of a company were traded on the Amsterdam exchange. The stock market had come into being. Soon other innovations in financial trading were to follow. A disgruntled investor, Isaac Le Maire (father of Jacob Le Maire), in 1609 initiated financial futures trading, when he tried to engineer a bear market in VOC shares by short selling them. This is the first known conspiracy to drive down share prices (as distinguished from manipulating and speculating on commodity prices). The Dutch authorities prohibited short selling the next year, but the frequent renewal of this prohibition indicates that it was usually honored in the breach.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 151; Van Dillen, pp. 54-59 By the middle of the 17th century many \\"modern\\" derivatives apparently already were quite common, as witnessed by the publication in 1688 of Confusion de Confusiones, a standard work on stock-trading and other financial-market practices, used on the Amsterdam stock exchange, by the Jewish Amsterdam banker Joseph Penso de la Vega. In it he describes the whole gamut, running from options (puts and calls), futures contracts, margin buying, to bull and bear conspiracies, even some form of stock-index trading.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 151 Cartoon about John Law and the Windhandel (1720) Trading in financial instruments, let alone speculation, was not limited to the stock exchange, however. Notorious is the speculative bubble in tulip futures, known as the 1637 Tulip mania. This mostly unfolded in coffee houses throughout the country as a pastime for common people. The stock exchange and its brokers were hardly involved, though the techniques used were quite common on the stock exchange.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 150-151 Similarly, the Dutch speculative bubble of 1720 (that coincided with John Law's activities in France and the South Sea bubble in England, but had its own peculiarities), for a large part existed outside the formal confines of the stock exchange. Still, this pan-European speculative mania illustrates the way in which by that time the European capital markets were already interconnected. The London Stock Exchange did not yet exist as a separate building, but its precursor operated in the Change Alley, where licensed stock traders did their business in coffee houses. Since the Glorious Revolution the Dutch and English stock exchanges operated in tandem, certain stocks, and bonds being quoted on both exchanges. English shares of the Bank of England and the British East India Company were continuously traded in both London and Amsterdam. They communicated via the packet-boat connection between Harwich and Hellevoetsluis that sailed twice a week. Information on stock and bond prices in both markets was regularly published in Dutch price courants (that originated in Amsterdam in 1583, and were published biweekly from 1613 on De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 147). Analysis of the information from these lists shows that the London quotations were apparently spot prices, whereas the Amsterdam quotations were forward prices, reflecting the fact that Amsterdam traded futures on English stocks.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 152 Of course, this need not signify stock speculation, but when the British and French speculative bubbles of 1720 erupted, the Dutch capital market soon got involved also, because Dutch investors were able to participate. The main Dutch bubble came afterward, however. When the bubble burst in France, short- term capital fled to the Netherlands, because this market was seen as a \\"safe haven\\". This influx of liquidity helped spark a domestic Dutch speculative bubble in dodgy public companies that burst in due course. Without the dire consequences of the British and French crashes, however, because the Dutch market was more mature.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 153 It occasioned a lot of satirical comment, however, as shown in the illustration from a contemporary tract on the follies of speculation, Het Groote Tafereel der Dwaasheid (English Translation: The Great Mirror of Folly). The great import of this episode is that it shows that by this time the capital market had become truly international, not only for long-term bonds but now also for short-term capital. Financial crises easily propagated because of this. Examples are the Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763, after the end of the Seven Years' War in which the Netherlands had remained neutral, occasioned a collapse of commodity prices, and debasements of the currency in Middle and Eastern Europe disrupted the bullion trade. Some Amsterdam accepting houses, as the Neufville Bros. became overextended and failed as a consequence. This caused a brief credit crunch. Ten years later the bursting of a speculative bubble in British-East-India-Company stock, and a simultaneous default of Surinam planters forced Dutch merchant bankers to liquidate their positions. As a result, acceptance credit evaporated temporarily, causing another credit crunch which brought down a number of venerable banking houses. This time a short-lived ' (a kind of bank of last resort) was erected by the city of Amsterdam, but dissolved again after the crisis abated. This experiment was repeated a few times during the crises of the end of the century, but equally without lasting results. The need for them was probably less than abroad, because the Dutch citizens were still extremely liquid, and possessed large cash hoards that obviated the need for a lender of last resort. Besides, the by then extremely conservative Dutch financial community feared that a paper currency beside the metal currency would undermine confidence in the Amsterdam capital market. ==Collapse of the system== Though the 18th century has often been depicted as an age of decline of the Dutch economy, the picture is more nuanced. It is true that the \\"real\\" economy of trade and industry (and initially agriculture also, though there was a resurgence later in the century) went into at least relative decline, compared to neighboring countries. But it has to be admitted that those neighboring countries had to make up a big lag, which they actually only accomplished toward the end of the 18th century, when British per-capita GNP finally overtook the Dutch per- capita GNP.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 706 Meanwhile, within the Dutch economy there was a decided shift toward the \\"service\\" sector (as the British economy would experience a century or so later), especially the financial sector. Nowadays we would consider that a sign of the \\"maturity\\" of the Dutch economy at the time. At the time (and by later historians with an ax to grind) this shift was often evaluated negatively. Making money from money, instead of from toil in trade or industry was seen as a lazy-bones' pursuit. The \\"periwig-era\\" has become a byword for fecklessness in Dutch historiography. The 18th-century investors are seen as shunning risk by their overreliance on \\"safe\\" investments in sovereign debt (though those proved extremely risky from hindsight), while on the other hand they are excoriated for their predilection for speculative pursuits. But do those criticisms hold up under closer scrutiny? First of all it has to be admitted that many modern economies would kill for a financial sector like the Dutch one of the 18th century, and for a government of such fiscal probity. In many respects the Dutch were unwittingly just ahead of their time. Their \\"speculative pursuits\\" are now seen as a necessary and integral part of commodity and financial markets, which perform a useful function in cushioning external shocks. It is as well that the Dutch performed that function for the wider European economy.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 156-157 It is true, however, that the way the 18th-century financial sector worked had its drawbacks in practice. A very important one was the detrimental effect the large Dutch public debt after 1713 had on the distribution of income.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 157 Through its sheer size and the attendant size of the necessary debt service, which absorbed most of the tax revenue, it also cramped the discretionary spending possibilities of the government, forcing a long period of austerity on it, with its attendant \\"Keynesian\\" negative effect on the \\"real\\" economy. The structurally depressed economy this caused made investment in trade and industry unattractive, which reinforced the vicious circle leading to more foreign direct investment. In itself such foreign investment is not seen as a bad thing nowadays. At least it engenders a foreign-income stream that helps the balance of payments of a country (though it also helped keep the Dutch guilder \\"hard\\" in a time when exports were already hindered by high real-wage costs). Unfortunately, the signals the market for foreign investments sent to Dutch investors were misleading: the very high risk of most foreign sovereign debt was insufficiently clear. This allowed foreign governments to exploit Dutch investors, first by paying interest rates that were far too low in hindsight (there was only a slight agio for foreign bonds), and finally by defaulting on the principal in the era of the Napoleonic Wars. As John Maynard Keynes has remarked: after the default of foreign borrowers the lending country has nothing, while after a domestic default the country has at least the physical stock that was bought with the loan., \\"Foreign investments and national advantage\\", in: London Nation (August 9, 1924), p.584 The Dutch were to experience this vividly after 1810.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 157-158 In any case, the periwigged investors had in certain respects no choice when they shifted to acceptance credit and commission trade, for instance. This can be seen as a rational \\"second best\\" strategy when British, French and Spanish protectionism closed markets to the Dutch, and they lacked the military means to force retraction of protectionist measures (as they had often been able to do in the 17th century). Also, apart from protectionism, the old comparative advantage in trade simply disappeared when foreign competitors imitated the technological innovations that had given the Dutch a competitive advantage in shipping and industry, and it turned into a disadvantage when the Dutch real- wage level remained stubbornly high after the break in the upward secular trend in price levels after 1670. From this perspective (and from hindsight by comparison with other \\"maturing\\" economies) the growth of the financial sector, absolutely and relative to other sectors of the Dutch economy, may not only be seen neutrally, but even as a good thing. The sector might have been the basis for further growth during the 19th century, maybe even supported a new industrial revolution after the British model. Ironically, however, crises in the financial sector brought about the downfall of first the political structures of the old Republic, and finally the near-demise of the Dutch economy (most of all the financial sector) in the first decade of the 19th century. Sansculottes The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, which from the English point of view was caused by Dutch greed in supporting the American Revolution with arms and funds (the British pretext for declaring war was a draft-treaty of commerce between the city of Amsterdam and the American revolutionaries), Patriots and Liberators: Revolution in the Netherlands, 1780-1813, New York: Vintage Books, 1992 [1977], , pp. 61-63 brought about a liquidity crisis for the VOC, which almost brought down the Bank of Amsterdam also, as this bank had been making \\"anticipatory\\" loans which the company could not pay back. Both were saved by the government, especially the States of Holland, which provided emergency credit, but financial confidence was severely damaged. Investor confidence was also damaged by the political troubles of the Patriot Revolt after the war. That revolt was sparked by popular demand for thoroughgoing political reforms and reforms in public finance, to cure the ills exposed by the dismal conduct of the war by the regime of Stadtholder William V. When his regime was restored by Prussian force of arms, and the would-be reformers were driven into exile in 1787, many investors lost hope of economic improvement, and they started liquidating their assets in the \\"real\\" economy for a flight in foreign bonds and annuities (especially French ones, as the French monarchy happened to have a large borrowing requirement at this time).De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 685-686 When soon afterward the French Revolution of 1789 spread by military means, and put the exiled Patriots in power in a new Batavian Republic, for a while the reform of the state, and the reinvigoration of the economy, seemed to be assured. Unfortunately, the reformers proved to be unable to overcome the conservative and federalist sentiments of the voters in their new democracy. In addition it took autocratic, un-democratic measures, first French-inspired, later by direct French rule, to reform the state. Unfortunately, the influence of the French on the economy was less benign. The French \\"liberators\\" started with exacting a war indemnity of 100 million guilders (equal to one-third of the estimated Dutch national income at the time of 307 million guilders).De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 704-705 They did more damage, however, by first defaulting on the French public debt, and later (when the Netherlands were annexed to the French empire after 1810) on the Dutch public debt. This was the first such default for the Dutch ever. Bonds that had paid a dependable income since 1515 suddenly lost their value. This loss devastated the financial sector as up to half of the national wealth (and the source for future investments) evaporated with the stroke of a pen. NapoleonNapoleon may have acquired a certain animus against especially Amsterdam bankers, when those proved unable (or unwilling in his view) to provide loans to the French state in 1800; Schama, op. cit., pp. 407-408 concluded the process of destruction of the Dutch economy by enforcing the Continental System effectively, snuffing out Dutch contraband trade with the British, while at the same time keeping French markets closed to Dutch exports even when the Netherlands were part of the French empire.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 146, 686; Schama, op. cit., p. 569 Consequently, Amsterdam lost its position in the international capital market forever to London. The merchant bankers left en masse. Though for a while cities in the maritime Dutch provinces lost urban population, while grass grew in their streets, and their ports were empty, and even though the Netherlands' economy experienced deindustrialization and pauperization, with a concomitant re- agriculturalization, it did not revert to premodern days. It even managed to hang on for another fifty years, resistant to attempts at industrialization in the British mode, even though those attempts did take hold in the former Southern Netherlands (now Belgium), with which it shared a state until 1830. Only in the mid-19th century, after the final liquidation of the repudiated public debt (and the attendant restoration of public credit) did the Dutch economy start a new epoch of modern economic growth.De Vries and Van der Woude, pp. 686-687 ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== *Het Groote Tafereel Der Dwaasheid - One of over 2,000 finance books in the IFA Library *J.G. van Dillen et al., Isaac Le Maire and the early trading in Dutch East India Company shares *Meir Kohn, Business organization in Pre-Industrial Europe *Larry Neal, Venture shares of the Dutch East India Company Category:Capital markets of Europe Category:Economic history of the Dutch Republic Category:Economies by former country Category:Financial history by country ","title":"Financial history of the Dutch Republic"},{"id":"17295945","text":"Soure Castle.

The appropriate ward of the Amber Valley Council is called Ironville and Riddings. The population of this ward as at the 2011 census was 5,821. It is located south of Alfreton near the hamlet of Golden Valley. The name derives from Ryddynges, a clearing or riding in a wood. This was the ancient forest known as Alfreton Grove within the manor of Alfreton. The settlement goes back at least to the 12th century, when Hugh de Ryddynges received half of the manor of Riddings and half of Watnall from his relative Ralf Ingram of Alfreton.Johnson, Reginald. 1968, Page 140 'A History of Alfreton'. ==Industrial development== The surrounding area had traditional industries of coal and ironstone mining, which remained small in scale until the opening of a branch from the Cromford Canal in 1793 gave impetus to the construction of iron furnaces. In 1800 Derby ironfounders Thomas Saxelby, James Oakes and Forrester opened the Riddings Iron Works. By 1806 Thos. Saxelby & Co. had become the largest producers of pig iron in Derbyshire. Oakes became sole owner of the Iron Works in 1818 with the purchase of Forrester's shares (Saxelbye having sold up in 1808). Throughout the nineteenth century Oakes and his family expanded their industrial holdings to include several local collieries. In 1888 they established the Riddings and District Gas Company in partnership with the Butterley Company. By-products of gas production were used to produce tar, sulphuric acid and other chemicals; local supplies of clay were fired to make bricks and pipes. St James' Church, Riddings The Oakes family contributed extensively to the fabric of the village. In addition to their family home of Riddings House these contributions included a substantial part of the parish church of St James (1833) and the National School of 1845. The church has a north – south alignment. Riddings House is now (2008) a residential home for the elderly, the surrounding park is now public, and the associated Model Farm has been converted to housing. The German chemist Robert Bunsen, who gave his name to the Bunsen burner in scientific experiments, was brought to Riddings in 1844 by Scottish scientist Professor Lyon Playfair to examine the behaviour of the coke fired blast furnaces. The buildings in which he worked still stand today on the former ironworks site. The heavy industries have now gone but employment is now provided on a modern estate by lighter industries. There is one family business in Riddings that has spanned 8 generations and is still trading after more than 200 years. This is the Luke Evans Bakery, founded by Henry Evans in 1804 on a site on Green Hill Lane. The business still trades from premises on Green Hill Lane in 2015. At various times, the business has diversified into other, non-food, areas but currently concentrates on wholesale baking, delivering to about 300 food retail businesses in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and some neighbouring counties. It employs about 50 staff. ==Shopping and housing== Riddings has adequate shopping facilities and modern housing developments have extended on all sides of the village. The Guinness Trust has modernised the old village cottages and built new ones in keeping with their original character. ==Public houses== The village has six public houses: the Red Lion, the Greenhill, the Queens Head, the Newlands Inn (destroyed by fire in 2011), the Moulders Arms and the Seven Stars. The latter was built in 1702 on the site of a chapel of ease dedicated to St Mary Magdalen. ==Windmills== James Oakes also built two tower windmills, named James and Sarah (after his wife Sarah Haddon). These were built in a yard () on Greenhill Lane in 1870Gifford, Alan. 1995. Page 69. Derbyshire Windmills. Midland Wind and Watermills Group. or 1877, possibly on the site of a post mill advertised for sale in 1829. James was a brick tower high of 7 storeys, diameter at the base, driven by six double-bladed patent sails and with eight- bladed fantails. Sarah appears to have had only 6 storeys. There were 2 open galleries on both mills, above the second floor and below the cap. The windshafts were of iron, diameter. Other internal equipment has not been recorded. Because the mills were close together one of the towers would 'rob the wind' (or obstruct the airflow to the sails) of the other. Consequentially before 1890 the Sarah mill had its sails removed and the milling machinery powered by a vertical-boilered stationary steam engine. It is possible that Sarah never had the sails fitted. The mills were used for grinding grain from the Oakes' estates, both for flour and for animal feed. In 1918 the sails of the James mill were removed and the steam plant replaced by a oil engine which powered both mills. The mills stopped work c. 1927. The floors of James were removed some time after 1927 and the mill used by the Granwood company, manufacturers of composition block flooring, to store sawdust.Gifford, Alan. 1995. Page 70. Derbyshire Windmills. Midland Wind and Watermills Group. Ownership of the mills passed to the National Coal Board in 1947. In 1948 the N.C.B. sold the mills and some surrounding land to Deosan Ltd., who had a nearby chemical factory. Both mills were used by Deosan as storage space. In the winter of 1949 Deosan contracted an Alfreton scrap dealer to remove most of the metal from the mills, including the windshafts, in preparation for the installation of working plant. From Sarah of scrap were removed; from James (after erecting scaffolding inside the tower) . The floors of James were re- instated and it was used for storage; Sarah had chemical plant installed. In 1959 the Diversey Corporation of Chicago bought Deosan,Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society, Feb. 1959 (VOL. 36) and the mills passed into the ownership of its subsidiary Diversey (UK) Ltd. In the early morning of Tuesday 29 January 1963 a fire started in Sarah, gutting the mill and destroying nearby storage sheds. Both mills were demolished soon afterwards. The land has since become a housing estate. ==References== ==External links== *Relevant page of Kelly's Directory of the Counties of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, 1891 *Photograph of workers at the Oakes Iron Works at Riddings c. 1916 Category:Villages in Derbyshire Category:Unparished areas in Derbyshire Category:Geography of Amber Valley ","title":"Riddings"},{"id":"17296004","text":"Rais Anis Sabri from Najibabad, Uttar Pradesh, India is one of the youngest performing Sufiana Qawwals.

Feral hybrids exist throughout Eurasia, the Americas, Australia, and in other places where European settlers imported wild boars to use as game animals. In many areas, a variable mixture of these hybrids and feral pigs of all-domesticated original stock (even environmental, agricultural, hunting, and other regulatory agencies often do not bother to distinguishing between them) have become invasive species. Their status as pest animals has reached crisis proportions in Australia, parts of Brazil, and parts of the United States, and the animals are often freely hunted in hopes of eradicating them or at least reducing them to a controllable population. When bred intentionally, the hybrid is intended to visually re-create – to \\"back-breed\\" – the look of pigs represented in prehistoric artworks of the Iron Age and earlier in ancient Europe. A project to create them, under the name Iron Age pig, started in the early 1980s by crossing a male wild boar with a Tamworth sow to produce an animal that looks like the pig from long ago. Iron Age pigs are generally only raised in Europe for the specialty meat market, and in keeping with their heritage are generally more aggressive and harder to handle than purebred domesticated pigs. British Iron Age figures of pigs or boars == In Australia == Feral pigs in general are considered to be the most important mammalian pest of Australian agriculture (a difficult title to hold, given the country's long-running invasive rabbit problem). However, it is unclear to what extent they are hybrids. Known hybridization between wild and domesticated pigs has occurred naturally in the country for a long time, with populations of the wild boar (imported by European settlers for hunting) freely interbreeding with domestic pigs, either where the latter escaped and became feral, or where there is reasonable access by wild boars to penned pig populations. The appearance and temperament of the wild boar is dominant, and after three generations of interbreeding, most domesticated characteristics disappear. Prior to closure of the meat export market, Australian hunters with the appropriate qualifications and certificates sold hybrid and feral pig meat to be exported to specialty meat markets in Russia and Italy. == In North America == Suine hybrids, known as razorbacks, range throughout the United States and Canada as feral populations. Their genetic makeup varies widely from area to area, from being all-domestic to a mix of recent domestic with long-feral pigs that have partially reverted to wild traits to an interbreeding of both with wild boars that, as in Australia, were apparently imported for hunting during the colonial era and in the southern United States were definitely re-introduced from Russia for hunting as recently as the 1990s. Razorbacks have been hunted for sport for centuries. Because of their increasing numbers (at least 6 million in 2014, having approximately tripled since 1990), in more recent decades they have been hunted more programmatically to reduce their impact as an invasive species; they have become a pest animal responsible for significant agricultural and property damage and environmental harm, especially in the U.S. Deep South from Florida to Texas; The Southwestern Naturalist estimated about 2.6 million free-roaming porcines in Texas in 2013, which may cast doubt on the 6-million nationwide estimate. A 2014 Outdoor Alabama article termed them \\"wildlife enemy number one\\" in that state. They have become problematic even in cooler, forested northern states (and into Canada); a particular conservation problem is that they strip plant life in woodland areas of their berries and other nutrients needed by the native American black bear. Wisconsin, for example, imposes no hunting restrictions of any kind on them to promote their elimination. Only a few animals are large enough to prey on hybrid and feral pigs, and are too few in individual numbers to control their population. Free- ranging Eurasian pigs that have also been problematic in Hawaii, a U.S. state in the Pacific Ocean and far from the mainland, are apparently of all- domesticated stock (simply feral pigs, not hybrids) and were brought by early European visitors. ==In South America== Domesticated pigs were introduced to the Americas and allowed to become feral from the 16th century onward, beginning with Christopher Columbus in the West Indies. Actual wild boars were introduced in the early 20th century into Uruguay, again for hunting, and have since spread into Brazil, where they have been deemed an invasive species since at least 1994, especially in Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and São Paulo. Since 2005, Brazil has issued hunting licenses for hybrid and feral pigs, and expanded this hunting program in 2008. Unrelated, smaller, and entirely wild suids, known as peccaries or javelinas, range throughout Latin America into the U.S. Southwest, are native to western hemisphere, and are not pest animals, though they compete with resources with hybrid and feral pigs. The dynamics between these populations are not yet well studied. Jaguars appear to prefer boar/pig over peccary prey when available. ==See also== * Feral pig * Hogzilla ==References== Category:Mammal hybrids Category:Pigs Category:Wild boars ","title":"Boar–pig hybrid"},{"id":"17296095","text":"Philippa of Luxembourg (1252 – 6 April 1311) was the daughter of Count Henry V of Luxembourg and his wife, Marguerite of Bar.

Bivona is in Sicily, which had been conquered by Peter III of Aragon in 1282. It was given to people related to the powerful medieval Aragonese family of Luna, Zaragoza. ==\\"de Luna\\" dukes and duchess (1554–1619)== ===1st Duke of Bivona=== The title was bestowed on 22 May 1554 to Pedro de Luna – Peralta y Medici- Salviati, (c. 1520–1575), who had married Isabel de Vega y Osorio, (born c1525), daughter of the Ambassador Juan de Vega y Enríque, and Leonor Perez – Osorio y Sarmiento, (died 30 March 1550, Palermo). He was 10th Count of Caltabellotta, and also Count (Conte in Italian) of Calatafimi, Sclafani, and Caltavuturo. Two of their children were 2nd and 3rd Dukes of Bivona. ===2nd Duke of Bivona=== Piero Giulio de Luna e Vega (Pedro Julio) in 1575 became 2nd Duke of Bivona and 11th Count of Caltabellota. He married the Spanish \\"Angela De la Cerda y Manuel\\" in 1562, daughter of Juan II de la Cerda, 4th Duke of Medinaceli. He died in 1592. ===1st Duchess of Bivona=== Aloisia de Luna e Vega, (3rd Duchess of Bivona by her own rights), (deceased Caltanissetta, 1619). The Duchess, was named after her grandmother, an Italian Salviati – Medici woman, sister of Pope Leo X \\"Medici\\", In 1568 Duchess Aloisia married Cesare Moncada – Aragona y Pignatelli, 2nd principe di Paternò, Conte di Adernò, Conte di Sclafani, Conte di Caltabellota, Vicario generale y capitano d’arme nelle città di Siracusa e Catania, (+ Caltgirone July 1591). Cesare Moncada, the Duke Consort, was the son of Don Francesco Moncada, Conte di Adernò, Conte di Sclafani (con la terra di Caltavuturo e Scillato), Conte di Caltanissetta, 1st principe di Paternò, (* 1518 – married 1532 – + 23 February 1568) and of Caterina Pignatelli, the daughter of Camillo Pignatelli, Conte di Borello, 3rd duca di Monteleone, (+ 28 March 1583), and Donna Girolama Colonna, the daughter of the 2nd duca di Paliano. Nine years later, Aloisia, not a widow yet from her supposed 1st husband till 1591, seems to have married widower Don Antonio d’Aragona y Folch de Cardona, (1543 – Naples, Italy, 8 February 1583), 4th Duke of Montalto, Count of Collesano or Golisano. Over 350–400 years later, these Sicilian, Italian, and Spanish families would be absolutely connected with both the Austrian and Spanish Empires and their successors the Bourbons after the Spanish Habsburg Kings eclipse becoming Diplomats, Ministers, Knights of the Golden Fleece Order, and so on. The Moncada family, for instance, almost one of the first Catalan-Aragonese families after the Medieval Aragonese Kings, can be tracked today as important rulers for over 700–800 years nowadays. ==\\"Moncada de Aragón\\", Dukes and Duchess (1619–1728)== ===3rd Duke of Bivona=== The 3rd Duke of Bivona was Francesco son of Cesare de Moncada and Aloisia de Luna,(13 March 1572 – Martos, Province of Jaén, 1595, aged 23), he was also 3rd Principe di Paternò, Count of Adernò, Count of Caltanisseta, Count of Caltabellotta. Francesco, had, however, married at the age of 12 on 12 March 1584 the orphan Lady Donna Maria d’Aragona y de la Cerda, 5th duchess of Montalto, Contessa di Collesano, (died 2 December 1610), the daughter of the 4th Duke of Montalto and Count of Colisano, Antonio d’Aragona – Folch de Cardona, (deceased the year before on 8 February 1583) and granddaughter through her mother's side of Juan II de la Cerda, 4th duke of Medinaceli de Medinaceli, 4th Count of Puerto de Santa María, 3rd Marquis of Cogolludo, (around 1505 – Madrid, 1 August 1575), Viceroy of Captain General of Sicily and Navarre, and of the Portuguese noblewoman Joana Manuel, or Juana de Noronha Manuel, (deceased Pamplona, Navarre, 19 June 1568), from the family of the six Counts of Odemira. ===4th Duke of Bivona=== The 4th Duke of Bivona was Don Antonio de Moncada y Aragón (1589 – 15 April 1631, aged 42), awarded the Grandee of Spain at age 6 and the succession to the titles when his father Francesco died aged 23 at Martos (Jaén, Spain). He was also 4th principe di Paternò, 6th Duke of Montalto, Conte di Adernò con Centorbi e Biancavilla, Conte di Sclafani, Conte di Caltanissetta, Conte di Caltabellotta, Conte di Collesano, and other Italian titles. Antonio de Moncada, 4th Duke of Bivona, married again within the \\"De la Cerda\\" family, the father of his father-in-law being his uncle, i.e. his mothers brother, named Juan Luis de la Cerda y Manuel de Portugal, (1544 – married 1565 – married again 1580 – 29 May 1594), 5th Duke of Medinaceli, 5th Count of Puerto de Santa María, 4th Marquis of Cogolludo, Ambassador in Portugal, Grandee of Spain, a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1585. His father-in-law was the Spanish-Italian known to Spanish genealogists as Juan de la Cerda y Aragón, (Cogolludo, province of Guadalajara, Spain, 1569 – 8 December 1607, aged 38), 6th Duke of Medinaceli, 6th Conde del Puerto de Santa María, 5th Marqués de Cogolludo, a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1599. He married twice, the first on 21 November 1580 with his step sister, Ana de la Cueva y de la Lama, a daughter of Gabriel de la Cueva, 5th Duke of Alburquerque, and Juana de la Lama. His second marriage, circa 1606, brought about the much-wanted male inheritor of the Medinaceli Dukedom and lands thereto in Spain. It was a daughter of this couple, the one from the first marriage, Juana de la Cerda y de la Lama, (born September 1591), the wife of the 4th Duke of Bivona, aforementioned. It seems as if this marriage was declared void, although the couple was alive around 1626, with Juana, the Duchess Consort, being around 35 years old and the Duke Don Antonio de Moncada, some 37, and that the Duke \\"received the call of God\\" to be a Jesuit and then renounced to honours, titles and privileges to follow San Ignacio de Loyola, (before 23 October 1491 – 31 July 1556), heavenly calls. The Duke died in 1631, aged 42. ===5th Duke of Bivona=== Nevertheless, their first male inheritor after Don Antonio mystical call of 1626, is known to some genealogists as Luis Guillermo de Moncada y de la Cerda, a.k.a. Luis de Moncada) was also 7th Duque de Montalto, 5th Príncipe di Paternò, Knight of the Order of Alcantara (1630), a Captain General and Viceroy of Sardinia, 1644, Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece (1651). This 5th Duke of Bivona was born in Collesano (1.1.1614). He achieved the status of Grandee of Spain in 1631, aged 17, became after 1638 a childless widower of Maria Enriquez Afan de Ribera, the 4th Duchess of Alcalá de los Gazules and 7th Marchioness of Tarifa, marrying then another collateral, Catalina de Moncada y Alagón, (21 August 1611 – deceased 1660), the daughter of Francisco de Moncada, (1586 – Grandee of Spain in 1626 – Battle of Goch 1635), 3rd Marqués de Aytona, 11th Count of Osona, and Margarita de Alagón – Espés, Marchioness of Puebla de Castro in Aragón, (deceased 1624). When his second wife, Catalina, died towards the end of 1660, he became a priest around 1662, being promoted to the honour of Cardinal without title of the Holy Roman Church on 7 March 1667, dying while staying in Madrid on 4 March 1672, five years later. ===6th Duke of Bivona=== A male baby from the first marriage and another two males from the second one did not reach adult status, being thus 8th Duque de Montalto, 6th Duque de Bivona, 6th Principe de Paternò, and some half a dozen of Italian counties plus a handful of lesser titles Fernando Moncada de Aragón y Moncada, (20 October 1644 – married 1665, aged 21 – Grandee of Spain from 1672 when his father, late Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, died – 11 November 1713). The 6th Duke of Bivona would be the last male member bearing the family name Moncada de Aragón: Fernando de Moncada – Aragón married in 1665 the powerful heiress María Teresa Fajardo y Alvarez de Toledo – Portugal, 7th Marchioness de los Vélez, 6th Marchioness of Molina de Segura, 3rd Marchioness of Martorell, Grandee of Spain by inheritance since 1697, with extensive lands, military honorary titles, and agricultural mills in Murcia, Lorca and Catalan areas. Her father, Pedro Fajardo de Zúñiga y Recqueséns, (Mula, province of Murcia, June 1602 – Palermo, Sicilia, 3 November 1647) had been 4th Marquis of Molina de Segura, 5th marquis de los Vélez, big land owner from Murcia married to the powerful Catalan -Italian family of the Recquesens, Captain General of the so-called Kingdom of Murcia, Viceroy of Aragon, Navarre, Catalonia and Sicily, Ambassador of Spain in Rome, President of the \\"Consejo de Indias\\", the administrative body keeping track of several million square kilometers, thousands of priests and nuns in America as well as hundreds of thousands of new settlers there and millions of Indian Aborigines more or less protected by the Imperial Crown. Her mother, second wife of Don Pedro Fajardo de Zúñiga, had been María Engracia Alvarez de Toledo – Portugal y Pimentel, (deceased 1 January 1696), daughter of Fernando Álvarez de Toledo – Portugal, 6th Count of Oropesa, Count de Deleitosa, 2nd Marquis de Frechilla y Villarramiel, and of Mencía Pimentel, daughter of the 8th condes-duques de Benavente, a Portuguese family who had settled in Spain at the end of the 14th century. ===2nd Duchess of Bivona=== The 2nd (Duchess) of Bivona was also 9th Duchess of Montalto, 8th Marchioness de los Vélez, Marchioness of Molina de Segura, Marchioness of Martorell, and over a dozen of other lesser titles (Counties, Baronetcies, and Lordships in Spain and in Italy) succeeded in her own right through a lack of male inheritors. Teresa Caterina Moncada de Aragon y Fajardo, (1665 – 29 January 1728), was baptized in Madrid on 4 November 1665; married in October 1680, aged 15, but was widowed without issue and remarried on 29 September 1683, aged 18. Her husband was José Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo y Fernández de Córdoba, 8th Marqués de Villafranca del Bierzo, 3rd Marqués de Villanueva de Valdueza, 5th Duque de Fernandina, and 5th principe di Montalbano, (deceased 30 July 1728). He was the son of Fadrique III Alvarez de Toledo y Osorio, 7th Marquis of Villafranca del Bierzo, Grandee of Spain, 2nd Marquis of Villanueva de Valdueza, 4th Duke of Fernandina, 4th Principe di Montalbano, Captain General of the Spanish Galleys, Viceroy of Sicily, member of the Council of State, (27 February 1635 – 1705), and of Manuela Fernández de Córdoba y Cardona, (deceased 1679), the daughter of Antonio de Córdoba, 7 Duke of Sessa, 9 Count of Cabra, and of Teresa Pimentel, from the 9 Counts – Dukes of Benavente. ==From \\"Alvarez de Toledo\\" (1728–1802)== ===7th Duke of Bivona=== The succession, from her second marriage, including between the titles the one of 7th Duke of Bivona was handled then to her son, with different family name taking his father family name, his father being the Duke Consort José Fadrique: Fadrique Vicente Álvarez de Toledo y Moncada, (Madrid, 5 April 1686 – Madrid, 12 November 1753), 9th Marqués de Villafranca del Bierzo, 7th Duque de Bivona, 9th Duque de Montalto, 9th Marqués de los Vélez, 8th Principe di Paternò, 6th Duque de Fernandina, 6th principe di Montalbano, 4th Marqués de Villafranca de Valdueza, 4th Conde de Peña Ramiro, 12th Marqués de Molina, 5th Marqués de Martorell, 15th Count di Adernò, 16th Count di Caltabellota, 15th Count di Sclafani, 12th Count di Collesano, 13th Count di Caltanisseta, 18th Count di Centorvi, four times a Grandee of Spain, Barón of Castellví de Rosanes, Adelantado mayor del Reino de Murcia, Alcaide perpetuo de los Reales Alcázares de Lorca and many other honorary military titles such as Knight of the Golden Fleece in 1750, fell over his shoulders. He married in 1713, aged 27, the impressive noblewoman described by genealogists as Juana Pérez de Guzmán y Silva while others call her with the somewhat baroque name of Juana Pérez de Guzmán el Bueno y Silva – Mendoza (after circa 1681 – ????). She was one daughter of the Spanish Portuguese family constituted by Manuel Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, 12th Duque de Medina Sidonia, 17th Conde de Niebla, 11th Marqués de Cazaza, Grandee of Spain, (Huelva 1671 – ????), and Luisa María de Silva y Mendoza, (Madrid 25 August 1680 – ????)), daughter of Gregorio María Domingo de Silva Mendoza y Sandoval, 5th Duque de Pastrana, 5th Duque de Estremera, 9th Duque del Infantado, and of María de Haro y Guzmán, from the 6th Marqués del Carpio. ===8th Duke of Bivona=== Antonio María José, (Antonio Álvarez de Toledo y Pérez de Guzmán) 8th Duke of Bivona, son of the 7th Duke was born in Madrid on 24 September 1716. He was invested as a Knight of the Golden Fleece in 1763 and also became Gran Cruz de la Orden de Carlos III in the same year. He held many other Dukedoms, Marquees, Counties, and lesser titles. He died in Madrid on 4 December 1773, aged 57. He married firstly Teresa, daughter of the 10th Duke of Medina Sidonia in September 1735, (one daughter); and secondly married Maria Antonia Gonzaga Caracciolo, daughter of the Duke of Solferino, (two females and two males) ===9th Duke of Bivona=== Joé María (Madrid, 16 July 1756 – Sevilla 9 June 1798), the first male son of the 2nd marriage of the 8th Duke, inherited the title. By the time of his death in 1798, he was holder of six Grandees of Spain, four Dukedoms (the Medina Sidonia Duchy from a childless cousin, a Perez de Guzmán y Pacheco, and the Duchy of Alba through marriage to the famed Cayetana de Alba, one of the widowed aristocrat women friends of Court Painter Francisco de Goya), two Principalities, eight Marquisates, eight Countships, two Baronetcies, and many other lesser titles, (Spanish and Italian). Together with the Dukes of Osuna, the Tellez-Girón family, he became one of the biggest private land owners in Andalusia. ===\\"Cayetana\\", (1762–1802)=== \\"Cayetana\\", (1762–1802), 13th Duchess of Alba, 11th Duchess Consort of Bivona, granddaughter of the President of the Real Academia Española de la Lengua: We believe it is worth to explore, something obvious but curiously lacking till now about the intellectual background surrounding the ignored 11th Duke of Bivona and his wife, frequently named, (wrongly), as Cayetana de Silva, 13th Duchess of Alba on her own rights. Chiefly, they seem to have been much abused later by their supposed \\"populist\\" background in the late romantic, bullfighting loving, popular and oversexed Spain derived from the Napoleonic invasions, the rather rough following up Borbon Kings and Queens of Spain, and the rising of the so- called liberal and conservative political options of bourgeois Roman Catholic 19th-century Spain. The 9th Duke of Bivona, José María, married on 15 January 1775, being a descendant from a cadet branch named \\"Alvarez de Toledo\\" himself, related to the Dukes of Alba in the 16th century, and on the verge of such family name disappearing since 1728 altogether from the Alba nobility registers. A woman, very well known even today as \\"Cayetana\\", her real name being Cayetana de Silva y Silva – Bazán, who descended through her female side grandmother, of Maria Teresa Alvarez de Toledo y de Haro, 11th Duchess of Alba, (? – married 1714 Count Manuel José de Silva – Duchess of Alba by succession in 1739–1755). There was the possibility that if Jose Maria and Cayetana got any male children that the \\"Alvarez de Toledo\\" name could came back again to be used both, the Marquis of villafranca del Bierzo (and Duke of Bivona and many other titles) José María and also to the Dukes of Alba (with many pother titles), in other words, as it was in the 16th century. This grandmother of Cayetana, who arrived to be 11th Duchess of Alba, was the mother, between others, of the 12th Duke of Alba, now named, as his father (the 10th Count of Galve), Fernando de Silva y Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Huéscar, between other titles during his childhood, his mother being nevertheless the 11th Duchess till her death in 1755. This 12th Duke of Alba since 1755, Don Fernando, i.e., Fernando de Silva y Alvarez de Toledo, (1714 – 15 November 1776), would be the father of the 13th Duke of Alba, Francisco de Paula de Silva, the later being the father in law, through \\"Cayetana\\", of the 11th Duke of Bivona, José María. Fernando, 9th Duke of Huescar who became 12th Duke of Alba after 1755, besides being grandfather of the famous \\"Cayetana\\" was Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1746, Ambassador in France (1746–1749). He was also a Director of the Real Academia Española de la Lengua for 22 years, from 9 April 1754 till his death in November 1776. The Duke Academician Fernando was also 5th Conde-Duque de Olivares and Duque de Sanlúcar-la-Mayor, Grandee of Spain, 10th Marqués del Carpio, 10th Conde de Monterrey, 13th Conde de Lerín, Condestable de Navarra, 11th Conde de Galve, 14th Conde de Alba de Tormes, 17th Señor de Valdecorneja, etc. He had married Ana María Alvarez de Toledo y de Portugal, (1710–1738), 9th Duchess Consort of Huéscar, Grandee of Spain, daughter of the 9th Conde de Oropesa. They were the parents of: Francisco de Paula de Silva y Alvarez de Toledo, (1733–1770), 10th Duque de Huéscar (1755), Conde de Siruela, who married Maria del Pilar Ana de Silva- Bazán y Sarmiento (n. 1740 – m. 1784), 10th Duchess Consort de Huéscar, daughter of Pedro Artal de Silva Bazán, 8th Marqués de Santa-Cruz. María del Pilar Teresa Cayetana de Silva-Alvarez de Toledo y Silva Bazán, ( 1762 – married 1775, aged 13 – 1802) m. 1802, Duquesa de Montoro, 13th Duchess de Alba de Tormes, G.E. (1776), 11th Duchess de Huéscar, Grandee of Spain, (1770), 6th Condesa-Duquesa de Olivares and Duquesa de Sanlúcar-la-Mayor, with Grandee of Spain, 11th Marquesa del Carpio y Condesa de Monterrey, with Grandee of Spain, 14th Condesa de Lerín, 12th Condesa de Galve, etc. The Duke Academician Fernando, having lost his son Francisco de Paula, would have the satisfaction of managing to see his granddaughter, famous Maria del Pilar Cayetana de Alba or really speaking, Maria del Pilar Cayetana de Silva y de Silva – Bazán, (10 June 1762 – married 1775, aged 13 the 11th Duke of Bivona here mentioned – became a widow in 1798, aged 36 when her husband was 42 – Madrid, 23 July 1802, aged 40). There was no issue from this socially brilliant marriage between José María and Cayetana. Young Cayetana was through herself and through her husband José María 16th Duchess Consort of Medina Sidonia and 13th Duchess of Alba by her own rights moreover and many other titles, eight times a Grandee of Spain. As her father Francisco de Paula de Silva died before the 12th Duke of Alba, Royal Academician Fernando, her grandfather, she became the 13th Duchess of Alba after November 1776, being also: 16th Duchesse Consort of Medina Sidonia, Duchess of Huéscar, Duchess of Galisteo and Duchess of Montoro. She was also by her own inheritances Countess of Olivares, Countess of Lerín, Countess of Monterey, Countess of Osorno, Countess of Salvatierra, Countess of Piedrahita, Countess of Morente, Countess of Fuente de Valdepero, Countess of Galve, Countess of Deleitosa, Countess of Alcaudete, Marchioness of Del Carpio, Marchioness of Coria, Marchioness of Villanueva del Rio and Marchioness of Villar de Grajanejos besides many other lesser titles and great amounts of land properties, castles and palaces, etc. ===10th Duke of Bivona, (1802–1821)=== The 10th Dukedom of Bivona, (1802–1821), and 16th Dukedom of Medina Sidonia was a setback in the hereditary line: with no issue from the male 9th Duke of Bivona and the female 13th Duchess of Alba de Tormes, the Dukedom of Bivona would then go back one generation, sometime after 1802, when Duchess Cayetana died aged 40, four years after she has become a widow of Don Antonio, aged 42, in such a way that the 10th Duque de Bivona would be the uncle of José Maria, brother of the 10th Duke Antonio, named Francisco de Borja Álvarez de Toledo y Gonzaga-Caracciolo, (Madrid, 9 June 1763 – married, aged 35, Madrid, 28 January 1798, 18-year-old Maria Tomasa de Palafox y Portocarrero – Successor to the Dukedom of Bivona and connected family titles after 1802 – Madrid 12 February 1821, aged 57). This Maria Tomasa, (Madrid, 8 March 1780 – married aged 18 on 28 January 1798 – a widow in 1821, aged 41 – Portici, Italy, 14 October 1835, aged 55), was a daughter of deceased Lieutenant General Felipe Antonio de Palafox y Croy, (San Sebastián 3 July 1739 – married before 1780, aged 40 or so-Madrid 24 October 1790), son of the 6th Marqués de Ariza, and of María Francisca de Sales Portocarrero y López de Zúñiga, 7th Countess of Montijo, 6th Countess of Fuentidueña, 11th Marchioness de la Algaba, 12th Marchioness de Ardales, 13th Countess de Teba, Marchioness de Osera, Grandee of Spain, (Madrid, 10 June 1754 – married before 1780, aged 25 or so – Lograno (¿Logroño?) 15 April 1808). The 17th Duque de Media Sidonia would be then the eldest male son from this couple, namely: Pedro de Alcantara Alvarez de Toledo y Palafox, (Madrid 11 May 1803 – married Madrid 9 October 1822 – Madrid 10 January 1867), with many other titles. ==Split of Medina Sidonia and Bivona Dukedoms== ===11th Duke of Bivona=== The \\"Alvarez de Toledo\\" family blocks successions: 11. Therefore, the 11th Duke of Bivona, 14th Count of Niebla, and many family connected titles was, apparently, the young teenager Duke, Pedro de Alcantara younger sibling: Francisco Alvarez de Toledo y Palafox (Madrid, 9 June 1799 – Madrid, 31 January 1816, aged 16 only). It seems that, for some reason, the eldest brother, Pedro de Alcántara, inherited a part of the titles with the 15th-century title of Dukedom of Medina Sidonia, while another part went to the unfortunate younger brother Francisco, in spite that their father died in 1821. The outcome was then a succession; the 14th Duke of Bivona, and annexed titles, passed to the third male alive in the family Alvarez de Toledo- Palafox. ===12th Duke of Bivona=== José María Alvarez de Toledo y Palafox, described as \\"Giuseppe\\" by Italian genealogists, Grandee of Spain, (Cádiz, Spain, 1 February 1812 – married in Paris, France, 22 June 1837, aged 25, 20 years old María del Carmen Lucía de Acuña y Dewitte, (Paris 22 June 1817,(¿?) – Naples, Italy, 15 January 1888, aged 71) – Naples, Italy, 7 January 1885, aged 72). ===13th Duke of Bivona=== Paris 1838 and Madrid 1898: Marrying within the new Spanish military structures and into wealth: Then, the 15th Duke of Bivona would be José María Álvarez de Toledo y Acuña, (Paris, France, 6 August 1838 – married in San Sebastian, Spain, on 21 August 1864, aged 26, the 16-year-old only lady thereto described as \\"Jacinta\\" – Madrid, 31 August 1898, aged 60). Sixteen-year-old \\"Doña Jacinta\\", the 13th Duchess Consort, was the daughter of a most significant General Governor of the Spanish Island of Cuba, José Gutierrez de la Concha e Irigoyen, (Cordoba, Argentina, 1809–1895) and also the uterine sister of another \\"Doña Jacinta\\", the wife of one of the more significant \\"Military and Politician\\" Generals of 19th-century Spain, Baldomero Espartero, (27 February 1793 – 8 January 1879). ==References== ==External links== *This Table 15, provides the genealogical tree for five generations (5 is Eleanor, ten are 16 males and 16 females, (great-great- grandparents)) for the Great Duchess Consort of Tuscany, Leonor Alvarez de Toledo or Eleanor Alvarez de Toledo, (1522–1562), here mentioned.

It extends for from an intersection with New York State Route 51 (NY 51) in the town of Butternuts to the Oneida County line at Plainfield, where it becomes CR 2\\\\. The highway runs along the eastern bank of the Unadilla River and parallels NY 8, which follows the western bank of the river. CR 18 enters the vicinity of several villages and hamlets, including the village of New Berlin and the hamlet of Unadilla Forks. The portion of CR 18 between Unadilla Forks and U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Plainfield—a distance of —was originally maintained by the state of New York. It was added to the state highway system in 1916 and designated as New York State Route 413 . The NY 413 designation was removed in the early 1950s. ==Route description== ===Mount Upton to New Berlin=== CR 18 begins at an intersection with NY 51 in the town of Butternuts, located east of the hamlet of Mount Upton on the eastern bank of the Unadilla River. CR 18 heads northward, passing along the base of the Unadilla River valley as it heads along the east bank of the river and parallels NY 8, which runs along the western bank. As the route heads away from Mount Upton, it heads through a dense forest situated at the foot of the valley's eastern edge. The forest continues to surround CR 18 until the vicinity of Lathams Corners, where the forest gives way to open fields and smaller, isolated patches of trees. North of Lathams Corners, CR 18 serves as a divider between a series of cultivated fields on the east bank of the river and a dense forest enveloping the eastern edge of the valley. The route continues to parallel both NY 8 and the Unadilla River into the hamlet of South New Berlin, a community centered around the intersection of NY 8 and NY 23\\\\. CR 18 meets NY 23 a short distance to the east at a junction situated on the Butternuts–Morris town line. Past the intersection, CR 18 passes through the eastern extents of the hamlet before continuing northeastward through open fields. NY 413 topo map, depicting its entire length Roughly northeast of South New Berlin in the town of Pittsfield, CR 18 turns back to the north as it continues to mirror the twists and turns of the Unadilla River. It passes by the hamlet of Silver Lake, named for a small lake of the same name to the west of the highway and east of the community, as it approaches the village of New Berlin. Southeast of New Berlin, CR 18 intersects CR 13, a southeastward extension of New Berlin's South Main Street. While NY 8 directly enters the village, which is situated on the west bank of the river, CR 18 bypasses it to the east. The route crosses over Wharton Creek and intersects NY 80 in an area known as Hoboken before leaving the vicinity of New Berlin. === New Berlin to Bridgewater === North of New Berlin, CR 18 continues to follow a routing parallel to that of the Unadilla River and NY 8, which is joined by NY 80 in New Berlin. NY 80 splits off to the northwest just over later while NY 8 and CR 18 continue northward. The highways reenter a rural area, with forests and fields again surrounding the highways as CR 18 passes into the town of Edmeston. The county route enters the hamlet of South Edmeston, where it intersects with CR 20\\\\. CR 18 turns east here, overlapping CR 20 for approximately before leaving the route and turning back to the north. CR 18 north from CR 20 in South Edmeston CR 18 continues on through the rural town, passing along the eastern base of the river valley as it intersects CR 18C (Welsh Road), a connector route linking CR 18 to the hamlet of West Edmeston and NY 8\\\\. From there, the route heads northeastward through open fields and isolated forests before crossing into the town of Plainfield. Here, CR 18 meets CR 19, an east–west highway connecting CR 18 to the community of Leonardsville. Roughly north of Leonardsville, CR 18 enters the small hamlet of Unadilla Forks. Here, it connects to its two other suffixed routes, both of which connect to county routes in adjacent counties. As the name implies, Unadilla Forks is the location where the Unadilla River splits into two branches. Just north of its junction with CR 18A, CR 18 crosses over the Unadilla River's eastern branch. While the east branch heads off to the northeast, CR 18 follows the west branch northward through a low-lying area in the center of the Unadilla River valley composed mostly of open fields. The west branch of the river continues north into the village of Bridgewater, a community based around the junction of NY 8 and US 20; however, CR 18 bypasses the village to the east. CR 18 intersects US 20 east of the village before crossing into Oneida County and becoming that county's CR 2. ==History== The portion of CR 18 between CR 18A in Unadilla Forks and US 20 in Plainfield—a distance of —was originally a state-maintained highway. It was added to the New York state highway system on January 12, 1916, and designated as NY 413 . The NY 413 designation was removed in the early 1950s.

She was Abbess of Chelles. ==Biography== Marie Louise Adélaïde d'Orléans was born at the Palace of Versailles on 13 August 1698. After the marriage of her aunt Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans, Louise Adélaïde was known at court as Mademoiselle de Chartres. She assumed the style of Mademoiselle d'Orléans in 1710 after her older sister Marie Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans married Charles, Duke of Berry. Her siblings were: *Mademoiselle de Valois (17 December 1693 - 17 October 1694) *Marie Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans, Duchess of Berry (20 August 1695 - 21 July 1719) *Charlotte Aglaé d'Orléans, Duchess of Modena and Reggio (20 October 1700 - 19 January 1761) *Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Chartres, later Duke of Orléans (4 August 1703 - 4 February 1752). *Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans, Queen of Spain (11 December 1709 - 16 June 1742) *Philippine Élisabeth d'Orléans, Mademoiselle de Beaujolais (18 December 1714 - 21 May 1734) *Louise Diane d'Orléans, Princess of Conti (27 June 1716 - 26 September 1736). ===Character=== Very close to her sisters Marie Louise Élisabeth and Charlotte Aglaé, Louise Adélaïde was considered the most beautiful of the Orléans daughters. Her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, described her in the following manner: > ...[She is] well made, and is the handsomest of my granddaughters. She has a > fine skin, a superb complexion, very white teeth, good eyes, and a faultless > shape. Her hands are extremely delicate, the red and white are beautifully > and naturally mingled in her skin. I never saw finer teeth; they are like a > row of pearls.Letters from Liselotte: Elizabeth-Charlotte, Princess Palatine > and Duchess of Orléans Pierre Drevet. Also according to her grandmother, Louise Adélaïde was very passionate about music and showed an interest in both theology and the sciences.The Memoirs of Reign of Louis XIV: Elizabeth-Charlotte of The Palatinate In particular, she was intrigued with the science of surgery which was then going through an era of change and improvement. On her entrance into a convent, Louis Racine composed a verse about her: :Plaisir, beauté, jeunesse, honneurs, gloire, puissance, :Ambitieux espoir que permet la naissance, :Tout au pied de l'Agneau fut par elle immolé.\\"Pleasure, beauty, youth, honors, glory, power; Ambitious hope allowed by birth; At the feet of the Lamb were by her offered in sacrifice.\\" Louise Adélaïde and her sister Charlotte Aglaé were both placed in the Abbey of Chelles from a young age. Their education was briefly interrupted in 1710 for the wedding of their oldest sister Marie Louise Élisabeth. Louise Adélaïde and Charlotte Aglaé held her train.The Orléans Daughter Initially, young Louise Adélaïde was considered as a possible bride for her cousin, Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Prince of Dombes. He was the eldest son of her uncle, the Duke of Maine and his wife, Anne Louise Bénédicte de Bourbon. As the eldest son, he was the heir to his father's immense fortune. Louise Adélaïde, very pious by nature, though, refused his hand in marriage. The young prince then turned to her younger sister, Charlotte Aglaé, who also refused his hand. Both the Prince of Dombes and Louise Adélaïde eventually died unmarried. Another possible candidate was James Francis Edward Stuart, the \\"Old Pretender\\" to the British throne. In 1716, Louise Adélaïde wanted to marry the Chevalier de Saint-Maixent; he was one of the King's pages, who had saved her from an accident during a hunt at the cost of an injury which nearly proved fatal. Louise Adélaïde tried as much as she could to try to get her parents' permission to marry the young Chevalier but both refused. The Duchess of Orléans was horrified at the suggestion of such a mesalliance and reportedly treated Louise Adélaïde so harshly on the subject that it caused her to \\"take the veil\\" and become a nun. It was on 31 March 1717 that she took the veil officially; the ceremony was held in front of her parents. ==Abbesse de Chelles== As a result of the scandalous life led by her older sister, the Dowager Duchess of Berry who was notoriously promiscuous and concealed several pregnancies, Louise Adélaïde decided to become a nun. Her parents, as well as her paternal grandmother, were opposed to it, but she became a nun anyway. As a nun, she took the name of Sœur Sainte-Bathilde (Sister Saint Bathilde) in 1717. She held that name until the next year. While at Chelles, Louise Adélaïde showed a slight interest in Jansenism. During the Regency of Louis XV, Louise Adélaïde was seen as the preeminent religious figure in the country. In 1719, she became the Abbess of Chelles, a post she held until her death. She was also the Abbess of Val-de-Grâce, a church built under the auspices of her maternal and paternal great-grandmother, Anne of Austria, the wife of King Louis XIII. Her elder sister, the Duchess of Berry died on 21 July 1719 and was found to be pregnant again, just over three months after suffering a horrendous confinement during which she had been denied the Sacraments.The Memoirs of the Duke of Saint-Simon on the reign of Louis XIV and the Regency, chapter XXIII, pp. 206-220. In 1720, when Charlotte Aglaé had to leave France to meet her husband in Modena, she insisted on seeing her sister before she left. According to their grandmother, it was a sad scene. While at Chelles Louise Adélaïde greatly embellished the Abbey: she ordered the repaving of the cloisters, the restoration of the Chapter Room, had an infirmary constructed, and had a system where drinkable water could be accessed by the Abbey members as well as the town. Louise Adélaïde also allowed the Sisters of the Abbey of Nevers to build a house in the town in order to help educate the local girls. She was known as Madame d'Orléans while at Chelles from 1719 until 1734.thePeerage.com - Person Page 4471 She died at the age of forty-four from smallpox at the Convent de la Madeleine de Traisnel in Paris. ==Ancestors== ==Titles and styles== *13 August 1698 - 6 July 1710 Her Serene Highness Mademoiselle de Chartres *6 July 1710-1719 Her Serene Highness Mademoiselle d'Orléans **She took on this style due to the marriage of her older sister to the Duke of Berry.

It is his twenty-ninth book. ==Plot== Set in America in 1951, the second year of the Korean War, Indignation is narrated by Marcus Messner, a Jewish college student from Newark, New Jersey, who describes his sophomore year at Winesburg College in Ohio. Marcus transfers to Winesburg from Robert Treat College in Newark to escape his father, a kosher butcher, who appears to have become consumed with fear about the dangers of adult life, the world, and the uncertainty that awaits his son. At Winesburg College, Marcus becomes infatuated with a fellow student, Olivia Hutton, a survivor of a suicide attempt. The sexually inexperienced Marcus is bewildered when Olivia performs fellatio on him during their one and only date. Marcus' mother objects to his dating someone who attempted suicide and makes him vow to end their relationship. Marcus has an adversarial relationship with the dean of men, Hawes Caudwell. In a meeting in Dean Caudwell's office, Marcus objects to the chapel attendance requirement on the grounds that he is an atheist. In this meeting, he quotes extensively from Bertrand Russell's essay \\"Why I Am Not a Christian\\". Later, the dean finds Marcus guilty of hiring another student to attend chapel in his place; when Marcus refuses to attend double the number of chapel services as punishment, the dean expels him. His expulsion allows the U.S. Army to draft him and send him to fight in Korea where he is killed in combat. Early in the novel, Marcus explains that he is dead and telling his story from the afterlife; later it is revealed that he is unconscious from his combat wounds and the morphine that has been administered. The Winesburg setting is a homage to Sherwood Anderson's book Winesburg, Ohio. ==Film== Film producer Scott Rudin bought the rights to Indignation in April 2008, five months before the book was scheduled to be published. In September 2008, Lauren Lipton argued on Portfolio.com that Rudin was unwise to acquire the rights to the book \\"given Roth's Hollywood track record,\\" saying that, \\"of his many tomes, only a few have made it to the big screen to date.\\" A film adaptation, Indignation, was eventually made in 2016, without Rudin's involvement. It was directed and written by James Schamus (in his directorial debut), and starred Logan Lerman as Marcus, Sarah Gadon as Olivia, and Tracy Letts as Dean Caudwell. The film received positive reviews. ==References== ==External links== *Arise!

The division of Cordova formed itself in order of battle near the hermitage of Arquijas (Ermita de Nuestra Señora de Arquijas), which commanded the rapids near the bridge. Artillery was stationed by the Liberals near this spot to protect the passage of the Liberal forces. A column of picked men, composed of carabiniers and peseteros, attempted to cross the bridge. The Carlist Fourth Battalion of Navarre, reinforced by the tercios of Guipuzcoa,Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, Historia de la Revolución Española (La Enciclopedia democrática, 1891), 644. protecting the bridge, threw the Liberals back.Louis Xavier Auguet de Saint-Sylvain, The career of don Carlos, since the death of Ferdinand the Seventh (Original from Oxford University, 1835), 265. \\"A few of the most adventurous [Liberal soldiers] succeeded, with great trouble, in gaining the opposite bank; but soon the bridge was covered with carcasses, and, despite all their efforts, they could not advance a step further.\\" ==Oraá's Feign== Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri Córdova decided to attempt passage at another point, and gave orders to Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri to get, by a concealed march, into the rear of the Carlists, and to General Lopez, to feign a similar movement, thereby distracting the Carlists. There were about 2,000 troops under Liberal general Oraá that had been detached by Córdova and sent to attack the Carlist rear.F. Duncan, The English in Spain: The Story of the War of Succession Between 1834 and 1840 (Vols. 1-6) (UK: Pallas Armata). Original work published 1877.B. Saiz, Carlist Wars (1999). The Liberals' leading column, led by Oraá, advanced against the Carlist center, leaving another division to oppose the Carlist right wing.“Memoir of Zumalacárregui,” Colburn’s United Service Magazine (London, H. Hurst, 1847), 543. Sources disagree on what happened next. One source states that Zumalacárregui sent Ituralde's advanced guard, which had not yet seen action, to counter this rearguard action. Another states that Ituralde, \\"urged by an inconsiderate ardour which overcame his judgment, brought forward into sight his four battalions.\\"\\"Memoir of Zumalacárregui,\\" Colburn’s United Service Magazine (London, H. Hurst, 1847), 543. These battalions, forming the left wing, had been concealed from view by the hill beneath which they were stationed. Oraá instantly saw the snare into which he was about to fall, and changed his line of advance from north to west, moving directly upon Ituralde’s division, throwing out at the same time two battalions so as to outflank him. The Carlist left wing, thus enveloped and outnumbered, was driven back in confusion.“Memoir of Zumalacárregui,” Colburn’s United Service Magazine (London, H. Hurst, 1847), 543. ==Zumalacárregui's intervention== Zumalacárregui then supported Ituralde, leaving only 2 or 3 battalions in observation; Zumalacárregui hastily marched to support his left wing under Ituralde. The Liberals had already compelled Ituralde to retreat. However, Zumalacárregui’s unexpected reinforcement threw the Liberals into disorder.Louis Xavier Auguet de Saint-Sylvain, The career of don Carlos, since the death of Ferdinand the Seventh (Original from Oxford University, 1835), 265-6. The Liberals gave way, falling back on their second line. One source states that \\"it is said that, at this juncture, Cordova, believing the day to be lost, gave Oraa orders to retreat; the latter, however, more experienced in such affairs, took upon himself the responsibility of disregarding the order.\\" Córdova did in fact retreat in disorder, abandoning the division. The division, under Oraá, found itself opposed to Ituralde in the valley of Lana. A 5-hour long combat followed. The sources again disagree on what happened next. One source states that Oraá attacked but his detachment of over 2,000 men was dispersed in the Lana valley and fled, the nighttime covering their retreat. However, another source states that “the superiority of position and numbers had given the [Liberals] an advantage against which the Carlists found it impossible to contend.” \\"One has to recognize that in the battle at Arquijas,\\" Vicente Blasco Ibáñez has written, \\"the victory would have been the Carlists' had it not been for the skill and daring of Oráa, who knew how to extricate himself from a dire situation, as General Córdova had shown lamentable irresolution retreating from the battlefield before hostilities had ceased.\\"Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, Historia de la Revolución Española (La Enciclopedia democrática, 1891), 645. ==Aftermath== Córdova was replaced by Manuel Lorenzo as a result of this defeat. Córdova had withdrawn to Los Arcos, where he got orders from Espoz y Mina to quit his command and go to Madrid. On February 5, 1835, the Liberals attacked the same spot at the Second Battle of Arquijas but were repulsed. == Scheme of the battle == 100px ^^^^^(1)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (2) ^^ (3) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(4)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (5) (6) (7) (8) ^^ (9) ^^^^^^(4)^^^^^ ^^^(10)^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(4)^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(4)^ ^^^^^(11)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(12)^^^^^^^(13)^^^^^^^^^^^^^(14)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(15) (16)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(17)^^^^^^(18)^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (19)^^ ^^ (20)^^ (1) Sierra de Andía.

The population was 220 in the 2010 United States Census, compared to 184 at the 2000 census.MuniNetGuide - Liberty, Oklahoma ==History== The earliest settler recorded in this area was Wallace W. Baird, a farmer from Illinois, who arrived in Tulsa County in 1912, and settled on a farm. Liberty was incorporated as a dispersed rural community on October 1, 1978. It incorporated a second time on June 29, 1982. ==Geography== Liberty is located at (35.857244, -95.969284). Liberty is east of Mounds, south of both Tulsa and Glenpool, and north of both Okmulgee and Preston, directly on the east side of US Route 75. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 6.1 square miles (15.8 km2), all land. ==Demographics== As of the 2000 American census there were 184 people, 63 households, and 52 families residing in the town. The population density was 30.1 people per square mile (11.6/km2). There were 72 housing units at an average density of 11.8 per square mile (4.5/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 85.33% White, 9.78% Native American, and 4.89% from two or more races. There were 63 households, out of which 41.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.7% were married couples living together, 11.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 15.9% were non-families. 14.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.92 and the average family size was 3.21. In Liberty, the population was spread out, with 30.4% under the age of 18, 9.8% from 18 to 24, 26.1% from 25 to 44, 22.8% from 45 to 64, and 10.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 106.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.9 males. The median income for a household in the town was $25,833, and the median income for a family was $35,625. Males had a median income of $30,781 versus $26,875 for females. The per capita income for the town was $12,421. About 9.4% of families and 6.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.7% of those under the age of 18 and none of those 65 or over. ==Economy== Agriculture has been the base of the town economy. By 2000, over 86 percent of the inhabitants commuted to work in other towns. ==\\"Liberty-Mounds\\"== The signs on US Route 75 pointing in the direction of Liberty east of the highway show the name as “Liberty-Mounds”. The Liberty town name was taken from the nearby Liberty School District. Given the district's proximity to Mounds, Oklahoma on the west side of US-75, a former school superintendent referred to the district as “Liberty-Mounds” to distinguish it from another Liberty school district near Morris in Okmulgee County. So the highway signs reference the school, although both the town and the school district are actually named Liberty. ==References== ==Further reading== *Fact Sheet, Liberty town, Oklahoma.

It was designed by Ken Parker and Larry Fishman, and first produced in 1993. The Fly is unique among electric guitars in the way it uses composite materials. It is notable for its light weight (4.5 lb; 2.0 kg) and resonance. It was also one of the first electric guitars to combine traditional magnetic pickups with piezoelectric pickups, allowing the guitarist to access both acoustic and electric tones. Production ended in 2016 and the company has not released a new model of any kind since. Inspired by earlier musical instruments like the lute, Ken Parker began experimenting with hardwood exoskeletons to provide rigidity to the instrument but hardwood was too difficult to work with and did not achieve satisfactory results. Inspired by a friend who used carbon fiber to build speed boats, Ken Parker started experimenting with the material. Flys were built with an exoskeleton along the back and around the neck of the guitar. It was made from a carbon fibre/glass/epoxy composite material that is thinner than the paint finish. The same composite also comprised the fretboard material. The exoskeleton supposedly provided the guitar with strength and rigidity, as well as increasing the guitar's sustain. It also possibly gave the added benefit of allowing a smaller, more efficient body. One of Ken Parker's primary goals in designing the Fly was to build a guitar with less mass than a traditional electric guitar but with the same or even more rigidity. The composite exoskeleton was one of the primary reasons why such a design is possible, he claimed. ==Frets== The frets on the Parker Fly were constructed of hardened stainless-steel, they had no tangs, and were instead attached using an adhesive. Parker Fly guitars typically had twenty-four frets. ==Vibrato System== The Parker Fly had a vibrato system that allowed the player to select from a fixed-bridge mode, a bend-down-only mode, and a free- float mode. The vibrato system used a flat spring allowing the user to easily adjust the tension. The spring's natural tension was selected according to the gauge of strings used by the guitar player. The original Fly design incorporated a wheel on the face of the guitar to adjust the spring tension, while more recent models have moved the tension adjustment to inside the guitar. The bridge had been designed to stay in perfect tune, even with heavy use of the vibrato bar. ==Pickups== Most versions of the Parker Fly featured a set of two magnetic Humbucker style pickups and a Fishman developed piezoelectric pickup designed to emulate acoustic guitar sounds. The piezoelectric pickup was aided by an onboard active pre-amplifier that required the use of a 9 volt battery. The magnetic pickups were passive, but sat within the active circuit path. Fly guitars featured a stereo output jack, allowing the piezo and magnetic pickups to be sent to different amplifiers, or blended into a mono signal. Some Fly models had only magnetic pickups, for traditional electric guitar sounds, while some models had only piezo pickups, for use as solid-body acoustic-electric guitars. The Parker Fly's magnetic pickups are based on the traditional humbucker design, but feature a proprietary mounting system which eliminates the need for pickup rings and mounting brackets. The pickups are instead mounted via two extended pole pieces that screw into bushings sunk into the pickup cavities of the guitar. This mounting system produces a cleaner looking interface between the pickups and the instrument. The first Humbuckers used for the fly were produced by Dimarzio based on their Air Norton (neck position), and ToneZone (bridge position) designs. These pickups are commonly referred to as \\"Gen 1 Dimarzios\\". Responding to complaints about their non traditional hi-fi sound, Dimarzio introduced a new set of humbuckers in the spring of 1999. Commonly referred to as \\"Gen 2 Dimarzios\\", these new pickups were custom designed for the Fly's unique voicing. Featuring ceramic magnets, the Gen 2 design had more mid range focus, and higher output than their predecessors, and are still used on many current fly models. ==Sperzel tuners== The Parker Fly guitars are equipped with Sperzel tuners, which allow the string to be locked into place at the pole in which it winds. This feature allowed the string to remain fastened into the pole without requiring more than one wind. ==Refined Fly== Shortly before Parker Guitars was acquired by US Music Corporation, the Fly was changed to make it more production-friendly and less expensive to produce. The biggest change was moving the tension wheel, which adjusts the spring tension of the bridge, from its original through body position to behind a cover. The battery compartment was made more accessible and the 3 way vibrato arm switch was moved. The stereo button was removed and replaced with a smart switch. Additionally the ribbon wiring harness was replaced with the less expensive Nite Fly wiring. ==Notable Users== Parker Flys have been played by John Lees , Martin Barre, Gustavo Cerati, Adrian Belew, Matthew Bellamy, David Bowie, Carlos Alomar, Steve DeMarchi, Amir Derakh, The Edge, Mark Farner, Reeves Gabrels, Synyster Gates, Daniel Gildenlöw, Phil Keaggy, Brian May, Joni Mitchell, Dan Schafer, Dave Navarro, Lou Reed, Trent Reznor, Paul Simon, Pete Townshend, Juan Luis Guerra, Joe Walsh, Vernon Reid, Bob Weir, Jason Mendonca, Harvey Mandel, David Lynch, Daniel Jones, Jon Gutwillig, Kitchie Nadal, Drew Edel, Deron Miller, Greg Gonzalez, Richard Manktelow and J Mascis. ==Fly models== 5-string Fly bass * Fly Deluxe The Fly Deluxe has a solid poplar body, basswood neck, and Dimarzio pickups. * Fly Classic The Fly Classic has a mahogany body, basswood neck, and Dimarzio pickups. * Fly Mojo The Fly Mojo has a body and neck of solid mahogany, and Seymour Duncan pickups. * Fly Artist The Fly Artist has a solid Sitka spruce body, basswood neck, and Dimarzio pickups. * Fly Supreme The Fly Supreme has a solid big leaf maple body, basswood neck, and Dimarzio pickups. * Spanish/Nylon Fly Designed to appeal to classical guitar players, this is strung with nylon strings, and has no magnetic pickups. * Nite Fly Constructed of a variety of different tone woods and featuring various pickup combinations, the Nite Fly uses a bolt-on neck, and lacks the intricate sculpting found on the Fly body. * Fly Deluxe, Adrian Belew Edition This is a Fly Deluxe with a Sustainiac pickup, Variax components, and a specialized piezo pickup that allows for guitar synthesizer applications. * MIDI Fly Based on a Nite Fly body and made between 1999–2002, the MIDIFly has a mahogany body and Parker's TurboTone neck (also constructed of mahogany) with Virtual DSP Corp.'s MidiAxe guitar-to-MIDI converter system.

It was developed by Gusella and Zatti at the University of California, Berkeley in 1989. Like Cristian's algorithm, it is intended for use within intranets. == The algorithm == Unlike Cristian's algorithm, the server process in the Berkeley algorithm, called the leader, periodically polls other follower processes. Generally speaking, the algorithm is: # A leader is chosen via an election process such as Chang and Roberts algorithm. # The leader polls the followers who reply with their time in a similar way to Cristian's algorithm. # The leader observes the round-trip time (RTT) of the messages and estimates the time of each follower and its own. # The leader then averages the clock times, ignoring any values it receives far outside the values of the others. # Instead of sending the updated current time back to the other process, the leader then sends out the amount (positive or negative) that each follower must adjust its clock. This avoids further uncertainty due to RTT at the follower processes. With this method the average cancels out individual clock's tendencies to drift. Gusella and Zatti released results involving 15 computers whose clocks were synchronised to within about 20-25 milliseconds using their protocol. Computer systems normally avoid rewinding their clock when they receive a negative clock alteration from the leader. Doing so would break the property of monotonic time, which is a fundamental assumption in certain algorithms in the system itself or in programs such as make. A simple solution to this problem is to halt the clock for the duration specified by the leader, but this simplistic solution can also cause problems, although they are less severe. For minor corrections, most systems slow the clock (known as \\"clock slew\\"), applying the correction over a longer period of time. Often, any client whose clock differs by a value outside of a given tolerance is disregarded when averaging the results. This prevents the overall system time from being drastically skewed due to one erroneous clock. == References == Category:Distributed algorithms ","title":"Berkeley algorithm"},{"id":"17296897","text":"The Federal University of Uberlândia' (', UFU) is a Brazilian public university, located in the southwest of Minas Gerais, in Uberlândia, Brazil.

Cristian observed that this simple algorithm is probabilistic, in that it only achieves synchronization if the round-trip time (RTT) of the request is short compared to required accuracy. It also suffers in implementations using a single server, making it unsuitable for many distributive applications where redundancy may be crucial. == Description == Cristian's algorithm works between a process P, and a time server S connected to a time reference source. Put simply: # P requests the time from S # After receiving the request from P, S prepares a response and appends the time T from its own clock. # P then sets its time to be T + RTT/2 This method assumes that the RTT is split equally between request and response, which may not always be the case but is a reasonable assumption on a LAN connection. Further accuracy can be gained by making multiple requests to S and using the response with the shortest RTT. We can estimate the accuracy of the system as follows. Let min be the minimum time to transmit a message one-way. The earliest point at which S could have placed the time T, was min after P sent its request. Therefore, the time at S, when the message by P is received, is in the range (T + min) to (T + RTT - min). The width of this range is (RTT - 2*min). This gives an accuracy of (RTT/2 - min). ==See also== * Allan variance * Berkeley algorithm * Clock synchronization * Daytime protocol, older time synchronization protocol using TCP or UDP port 13 * ICMP Timestamp and ICMP Timestamp Reply, older time synchronization protocol using ICMP * International Atomic Time * NTP pool, a collection of worldwide computers that provide a highly accurate time via the Network Time Protocol * NTP server misuse and abuse * ntpd, OpenNTPD and Ntpdate * Precision Time Protocol * Synchronization * Time Protocol, older time synchronization protocol using TCP or UDP port 37 * Time server ==References== Category:Distributed algorithms Category:Synchronization ","title":"Cristian's algorithm"},{"id":"17296956","text":"Rupert Hill (born August 14, 1954) was a West Indian cricketer who played for Glamorgan.

See Eastern Lithuanian linguistic areal around 1900-1910 for a detailed view of the eastern part. Ethnographic Lithuania is a concept that defines Lithuanian territories as a significant part of the territories that belonged to Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Lithuanians as all people living on them, regardless of whether those people contemporarily or currently speak the Lithuanian language and considered themselves Lithuanian. The concept was in contrast to those of \\"historic Lithuania\\", the territories of the Duchy, and the \\"linguistic Lithuania\\", the area where Lithuanian language was overwhelmingly spoken.Thomas Lane, Lithuania: Stepping Westward, Routledge, 2001, , Google Print, p. 30 The concept of ethnographic Lithuania clashed with the right for self-determination of people living in that large territory, particularly Poles and Belarusians, who, according to the supporters of the ethnographic Lithuania, were \\"slavicized Lithuanians\\" who needed to be re- Lithuanized. They argued that an individual cannot decide on his ethnicity and nationality, which are decided by not language but ancestry. In 1920 Lithuanian politician Mykolas Biržiška wrote about nationality: > \\"One cannot define it according to the opinion of every individual. > Belonging or not to a given nationality is not something everybody can > decide for themselves, it is not something that can be solved according to > political liberalism, even if hidden under the cloak of democratic slogans. > It is too complex, too tied with ancient history, too related with the > history of a given nation, for the will or passivity of any individual to > challenge it. [...] Ethnographic Lithuania does not end where the locals no > longer speak Lithuanian, it spreads further, to the regions which do not > speak - but used to - Lithuanian, since it is composed of one Lithuanian > nation, regardless of whether it speaks Lithuanian, has forgotten the > language or even holds it in contempt.\\" The geographical scope of ethnographic Lithuania was noted in 1905, the year of Great Seimas of Vilnius, when Russian prime minister Sergei Witte received the following memorial: > \\"Lithuanians, knowing that territory inhabited by them since the historical > times consists of the Lithuanian gubernyas of the Northwestern Krai: Vilna > Governorate, Kovno Governorate and Grodno Governorate, part of Courland and > Suwałki Governorate (incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland), consider them > in the ethnographic perspective Lithuanian, and their inhabitants living > there alongside the Lithuanians as either newcomers - such as Poles, Jews > and Russians - or slavicized Lithuanians, such as Belarusians.\\" Demands of this early program would only slightly be modified in the coming decades (some would also include part of the Minsk Governorate around Naugardukas and the Lithuanian Minor territory around Memel). In essence, Lithuanian elites demanded the creation of a Lithuanian country with , from the Baltic Sea in the West, Daugava River in the north, to Bug River and Polesie marshes in the south. That territory was inhabited in the early 20th century by 5,850,000 people; out of those, according to the official Russian Empire statistics, linguistic Lithuanians formed 1,659,000 - i.e. less than 30%. Out of the regions mentioned in the 1905 declaration, only the Kovno Governorate and the northern part of Suwałki Governorate had a clear Lithuanian-speaking majority. The concept of ethnographic Lithuania conflicted with newly Polish state, which sought to recreate the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (and hence sought the rest of Lithuania, Polish-speaking or not). Currently, the Republic of Lithuania has no territorial claims. ==See also== *Krajowcy *Lithuania proper *Lithuanian National Revival *Lithuanization *Polonization *Russification *Regions of Lithuania *Tutejszy *Miedzymorze ==References== ==External links== *T.

The name of the village first appears on the “Vályi” map from 1781. The word Maros derives from the Latin \\"Mures\\" word and means waterfront, village or fortress. By the end of 18th century the population of Kismaros reached about 200-250 persons. With the effort of all villagers the catholic church was finished in 1827. Agriculture specifically the cultivation of grapes and other fruits provided livelihood for most residents. At the beginning of the 20th century the most spoken language is German. ===\\"Malenkiy robot\\"=== After the Second World War the Soviets took control in Hungary. Although prior to the war most people of Kismaros claimed Hungarian ethnicity already, their German origin meant that in January 1945 eighty of Kismaros’ youths (aged between 16-19) were taken by the Red Army to the Soviet Union, where they were subjected to forced labor in mines and factories.

Survivors remember it, just as the Soviets put it, \\"Malenkiy robot\\" or little labour. ===Modern life=== From 1976 until 1990 Kismaros had a joint local government with neighbouring Verőce and was called Verőcemaros. Today's Kismaros is a busy suburban settlement of Budapest. Many of the locals work in the capital city, commuting every day by train or by car. After 1989 Kismaros became a hotspot for Budapesters trying to escape the hassles of city life; many of them settled down in the village permanently. Tourism plays an increasingly important role, providing jobs for local businesses. ==Demographics== According to the 2001 national census, Germans account for 6% of the population whereas over 90% claimed Hungarian ethnicity. About 3/4 of all residents are Roman Catholic. The population of the village has been growing constantly in the last decade reaching just over two thousand in 2009. ==Tourism== ===Börzsöny Hills' Children's Railway=== Kismaros is the southern terminus for one of Hungary’s oldest light railways. The railway station is located in the centre of the village providing regular service throughout the year. The Börzsöny Hills' Children's Railway is a narrow gauge railway and is very popular among tourists. Every year thousands of people come to Kismaros to take a ride up to the Börzsöny Hills. Information about the Gauge Railway in Kismaros Steam train whistle ===Marus Napok=== Each year end of September the locals hold the festival “Marus Napok” to celebrate their rich German heritage. The festival's main attraction is when people march through the village with horse-drawn carriages, singing and dancing dressed in traditional clothes. Originally this was to celebrate a good vintage. The festivity is also a unique opportunity for visitors to taste the local cuisine and to listen to some authentic Swabian music. ===Kismaros Village Museum=== The museum houses a permanent historic exhibition to give visitors some insights into the villagers everyday life.

It is located in the barony of Ballinacor South on the Military Road originally constructed between 1804 and 1809, in the wake of the 1798 rebellion. It is so remote that inhabitants say that \\"Aghavannagh is the last place God made\\". ==Location== The village is situated near the base of the Lugnaquilla massif, the highest mountain in eastern Ireland, and within a few miles of Aughrim, Glenmalure and Tinahely to the east and south, and Kiltegan, Hacketstown and Baltinglass to the west. The area is mainly surrounded by forests and is composed of mountains and mountain land. This fact may indicate an original name in Irish as achadh mbeannach whose meaning is \\"hilly field\\". This mountainous terrain is where the Ow river rises on the southern slopes of Lugnaquilla, flows through a glacial valley and passes the outskirts of the village meeting the Aghavannagh river, which is much smaller and flows through the village, a short distance to the south. One of the earliest references to the place is in 1623 to \\"Aghavanny\\" in the Calendar of Patent Rolls of James I, followed by five other 17th century references with three different spellings of \\"Aghamanagh\\", \\"Aghamannagh\\" \\"Aghavannagh\\", and lastly \\"Aghavanagh\\" on A.R. Neville's Map of Co. Wicklow dated c 1810. There is no commercial centre to the village that only comprises residences and a school (on map— no longer in use). Between 1896 and 1899 a sub-post office was opened in Aghavannagh under the nearby post town of Aughrim but this was already closed by 1909. ==Military barracks== Aghavannagh Barrack, along with similar structures in Glencree, Laragh and Glenmalure, was one of a series of barracks built along the route of the military road, to house British forces and give them access to the Wicklow Mountains where many 1798 rebels, such as Michael Dwyer, sought refuge. The barracks each accommodated 100 men, while a larger 200-man barracks was built in the Glen of Imaal, that together cost of £26,500 with an additional £1,500 for a bridge at Aghavannagh. The property came into the ownership of Charles Stewart Parnell's grandfather after the British War Office vacated it in 1825 because he was the ground landlord and was used by him as a hunting lodge. The Parnell family shared the building with up to 50 men of the Irish Constabulary. Several of the outhouses were totally ruined at this time as were the two redoubts. Upon Parnell's death, John Redmond bought the barracks. Later, An Óige ran the building as a youth hostel for several years before acquiring ownership in 1944. They closed it in 1998 when a tower of the structure was declared unstable by engineers. Síle de Valera, then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, answered a question in the Dáil whether the property would be acquired by the government as a heritage building saying that Dúchas, the heritage service of the department, did not have the resources to protect or preserve the building. After 20 years, in 2010, a restoration project extensively restored the building's interior and exterior. It is now privately owned and used as a family home and guesthouse. ==See also== * Pat O'Brien * Wicklow Way ==References and sources== ==External links== * The County Wicklow Military Road Greystones Archaeological & Historical Society: Journal: Volume 4, 2004.

The mall took its name from combining the names of these two roads. The original owner of the mall was the Randhurst Corporation (a joint venture of Carson Pirie Scott, Wieboldt's, and Montgomery Ward). At the time of its 1962 opening, it was the first enclosed regional mall in the Chicago area and the largest enclosed air-conditioned space in the United States. In 2009, the mall was demolished and rebuilt as Randhurst Village. Currently owned by DLC Management, this open-air mixed-use center features national and regional retailers, several restaurants, second-floor offices, a 140-room hotel and a 12-screen cinema. It is now anchored by AMC Theatres, Costco Wholesale and Hampton by Hilton. Other stores include Bed Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, Jewel- Osco, PetSmart, and TJ Maxx among others. ==History== ===Origins=== Randhurst was born out of a desire by Carson Pirie Scott to expand its business into Chicago's northwest suburbs, an untapped market at the time. Spurred by Marshall Field's expansion into Skokie at the new Old Orchard Shopping Center in 1958, Carson Pirie Scott secured an lot in Mount Prospect for purposes of building a shopping mall. Studies showed the mall would have a service area of 300,000, with another 100,000 expected by 1965. By 1959, the department stores Wieboldt's and Montgomery Ward had created a joint venture with Carson Pirie Scott, named the Randhurst Corporation. Instead of using the Montgomery Ward nameplate, however, Montgomery Ward would use the nameplate of its subsidiary brand, The Fair Department Store (a.k.a. \\"the Fair\\"), on its anchor store. Randhurst was designed by Victor Gruen, a pioneer of modern shopping mall design. Unlike most shopping malls of the time, which were built in a straight line between two anchoring department stores, Gruen's design was shaped like an equilateral triangle, with an anchoring department store at each angle. Additional stores lined the sides of the triangle on two levels: a conventional level (termed the \\"mezzanine\\" level), continuous with the first floors of the anchor stores, and a level located half a floor below the first level (termed the \\"bazaar\\" level), located down a flight of stairs facing the first level. A floor of offices occupied the level above this \\"subfloor\\" of stores. A ring of clerestory windows was mounted in a domed area over the center of the mall; mounted just inside these windows were numerous stained glass windows in various oval and round shapes, oriented in such a way as to cast beams of colored light into the mall itself. As the mall was built at the height of the Cold War, it included a fallout shelter big enough to hold every citizen of Mount Prospect. Thus, at the time of its 1962 opening, the Randhurst had three major department store anchors: Wieboldt's, Carson Pirie Scott, and The Fair. All three anchors had two above-ground floors and a full basement. Of the three anchors, the Carson Pirie Scott anchor was the most distinctive, featuring turquoise-colored accents at the entrances and multi- colored lights around its perimeter. Other stores included Baskins, Charles A. Stevens, Jewel Food Stores, S.S. Kresge, and Woolworth's. In 1963, the Randhurst Fair store would be the first Fair store to be renamed as a Montgomery Ward store; Montgomery Ward also built an auto service center at the perimeter of the mall. Randhurst would retain this configuration well into the 1980s. ===1980s=== In 1981, The Rouse Company acquired Randhurst from the Randhurst Corporation. In 1985, Rouse converted the upper sub-level of offices into a food court–one of the first in the Chicago area–and more retail space; a complete conventional second floor of retail space would be constructed by 1990. The \\"subfloor\\" of stores was also made larger and easier to access. In 1987, the entire Wieboldt's chain went bankrupt and closed its stores; Peoria, Illinois-based Bergner's acquired the empty Randhurst location. Shortly thereafter, Elgin-based specialty department store Joseph Spiess Company built a minor anchor, , next to the Wieboldt's/Bergner's anchor, and MainStreet added another minor anchor near the Montgomery Ward anchor (just before the chain was acquired by Kohl's). Spiess expanded too rapidly and too late for the market; as a consequence of this, the chain went bankrupt, and the store at Randhurst closed on January 31, 1992. ===1990s=== In 1990, Bergner's–which had acquired Carson Pirie Scott in 1989–closed its Randhurst store, allowing the Carson Pirie Scott anchor to move into the grander ex-Wieboldt's building while JCPenney took over the former Carson Pirie Scott anchor. Wickes Furniture briefly occupied the Spiess anchor, until Circuit City and Old Navy took over the space in 1995; meanwhile, a new Filene's Basement minor anchor occupied the majority of the \\"bazaar\\" level. This brought Randhurst to its greatest level of occupancy ever–three major anchors and four minor anchors–and an all-time peak of of retail space. The next ten years, however, would be much more difficult for Randhurst. The construction and expansion of multiple shopping malls in the area, especially the improvements to Woodfield Mall in nearby Schaumburg, devastated Randhurst's shopping base, as did the local population's general change in shopping tastes. In 1996, the mall's management tried to compensate by updating the mall's decor and adding new Jewel-Osco and Home Depot stores at the perimeter of the mall (the Home Depot replacing the closed Child World building, formerly the Randhurst Ice Arena, and Wards Auto Center); despite this, foot traffic fell, and stores began disappearing from the mall at a rapid rate. This included the Filene's Basement minor anchor, which closed in 1999 (along with three other Chicago- area Filene's Basement stores). In June 1999, Borders added and closed in April 2011. ===2000s=== The problems for Randhurst continued as one of Chicago's first lifestyle centers, Deer Park Town Center, opened in north suburban Deer Park in 2000, and The Streets of Woodfield, which opened in 1997, and is located a mile outside Illinois' largest mall, Woodfield Mall. This open-air shopping center became increasingly popular and may have attracted patrons who would have otherwise traveled to Randhurst or nearby Woodfield Mall. Meanwhile, Randhurst suffered the loss of its JCPenney and Montgomery Ward anchors within months of each other in 2001. JCPenney had labeled the Randhurst store as an \\"underperformer,\\" and therefore closed the location as they did many other \\"underperforming\\" locations. The Montgomery Ward anchor was remodeled and rebranded as Wards in 2000 as part of a chain- wide \\"last-ditch\\" effort to revive the brand; when this failed, Wards closed its entire chain of stores and went out of business. In 2003, Kohl's moved its store to a space formerly occupied by Venture/Big Kmart near the corner of Elmhurst Road and Dempster Street on the south end of Mount Prospect. Following the sudden departure of these three anchor tenants, many stores inside the mall closed as well. The devastating loss of numerous tenants and anchors led many to believe that Randhurst was about to become a dead mall. In 2004, some revitalization did occur for the mall, as a grand remodeling and repositioning scheme for the mall was put in motion. The former JCPenney and Kohl's anchors were demolished to build a new Costco anchor with no entry to the mall proper. Similarly, the former Montgomery Ward anchor was mostly torn down to create a grand new \\"promenade\\" entrance for the mall. Unfortunately, no upscale stores ever moved into the new addition, however Applebee's did move from another section of the mall. Unlike its previous home, which had both exterior and interior entrances, the new location was serviced by an outdoor entrance exclusively. A Buffalo Wild Wings was built on an outlot close to Carson's and Jewel-Osco. Circuit City closed in early 2005, and Old Navy moved to nearby Arlington Heights, all in the midst of the new construction. Bed Bath & Beyond and Steve & Barry's quickly took their places–Bed Bath & Beyond moved into the former Circuit City retail space, while Steve & Barry's opened in the former Applebee's restaurant and Old Navy spaces in 2004 and 2005. The Gruen design had been partially destroyed, and the renovation only helped temporarily stem the tenant outflow. ===Redevelopment=== In April 2007, the village of Mount Prospect approved a plan that included the demolition of the core of Randhurst. Designs by Larry Beame of Beame Architectural Partnership enabled the existing anchors to remain standing and be integrated into the redeveloped lifestyle center. Beame said the goal was to create \\"a traditional Main Street shopping experience\\" that features a primary retail street with diagonal parking and public spaces for socializing. The redevelopment was set to begin within two years. Randhurst's final shopping day was Tuesday, September 30, 2008. By then, only two stores remained open inside the mall: Fashion Plus, and Your Choice Gifts. Both stores were ordered by management to be vacated by 9:00pm CST. Demolition began in the winter of 2008/2009 with the mall offices near Carson Pirie Scott so a new loading ramp could be constructed for the department store. The mall was then gutted as it still contained hazardous asbestos insulation. By the following summer, visible demolition work had resumed. Less than eleven months after Randhurst closed, the mall's signature dome was pulled down on August 28, 2009, ending the existence of Cook County's first enclosed mall. Center Court, Randhurst ===2010s=== Construction of Randhurst Village began in the fall of 2009. Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. announced a remodeling of the former mall's Carson Pirie Scott anchor in May 2009, which was completed in November 2010. A new AMC movie theater, with 12 screens, replaced the Randhurst 16 (it was General Cinema until 2002) outparcel theater (originally the General Cinema Fourplex (1962–1998)) in April 2011. T.J.Maxx and Old Navy also opened in Randhurst during 2011 while The Sports Authority replaced Steve & Barry's. Several signification changes occurred in 2012. A 120-room Hampton Inn & Suites opened alongside several of new retailers and restaurants that included PetSmart, Five Guys and Chipotle. The mall’s existing bomb shelter had been converted into underground parking for hotel guests. It was also announced that Experience, Parmida Homes and Torrid would be moving into the lifestyle center by the end of the year. Construction began on new buildings for BlackFinn Ameripub, @The Children’s Place and Panera. During this time, there were roughly 320,000 people in the area and very little restaurant competition for the lunchtime crowds. In early 2013, Chef Rodelio Aglibot and his partners opened E+O (Earth and Ocean) Food and Drink in Randhurst Village. This spacious restaurant featured an upscale menu and oversized patio to satisfy the demand from nearby business employees. After owning Randhurst Village for 22 years, JPMorgan Chase announced plans to sell the 1 million-square-foot lifestyle center in 2014. Several development companies expressed interest in purchasing the property over the next year until it was finally sold to New York-based DLC Management. At the time, it was the largest asset in DLC’s portfolio. Sports Authority closed due to Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 2016. Michael's took this place in 2017. On April 18, 2018, the Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. company (owner of Carson's) announced that all of its stores will be going into liquidation and wrap up corporations on August 29, 2018 due to financial reasons. The Carson's store at Randhurst has had a little over 56 years of service in the Mount Prospect shopping community, and after 10 years of the indoor mall's closure, this store closed for good. Plans for entertainment or residential venues are likely options for filling in this vacant facility. ===2020s=== In January 2020, it was announced that the Bed Bath & Beyond store located at Randhurst will eventually close along with 40 other stores in the United States and Canada due to financial issues with their parent company and no longer meeting company and consumer expectations.https://www.businessinsider.com/bed-bath-and-beyond-closing- stores- locations-2020-1#illinois-8https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/01/21/bed- bath-beyond-store-closings-2020-these-locations-closing/2751235001/ ==Bus routes == Pace * 234 Wheeling/Des Plaines * 696 Randhurst/Woodfield/Harper College https://www.pacebus.com/sub/schedules/search_results.asp?TYPE=generator&KEYWORD;=Randhurst ==References== Category:Shopping malls established in 1962 Category:Mount Prospect, Illinois Category:Shopping malls in Cook County, Illinois Category:Victor Gruen buildings Category:1962 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Randhurst Village"},{"id":"17297290","text":"Alf Martinius Grindrud (2 July 1904 - 17 May 1959www.natzweiler.info) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party.

Furthermore, the court held: ==Residence halls== In residence halls of colleges and universities, the common areas are those spaces in a dorm that are for the use of all the student residents. In order to paint murals, improve with fixtures, or otherwise change the common area, permission may have to be obtained from the director of residential life.Appalachian State University, Dept. of Housing and Residence Life web site (Boone, NC). (Pdf document.) Accessed May 8, 2008. Legally, there is nothing that a tenant can do if they do not approve of their common area furnishings, decorations, etc. unless it interferes directly with a disability. Anything pertaining to religion or beliefs are all covered under the Fair Housing Law. The only way to control common areas in this regard is if a serious threat was posed. State-run universities do have the authority to prohibit use of common areas should they see fit (whether that be decorating, furnishings, or physical use). For-profit housing can only limit these things to some extent. They cannot legally control every aspect of common area use because of the aforementioned Fair Housing Laws. ==Business spaces== Common area also applies to organizations such as shopping malls and strip malls, in which multiple businesses operate. Oftentimes, business parks, malls, and other multi-company facilities will have a common area. This could be any one of the examples listed above or it could take form of a “break room”. These areas are generally centrally located and for everyone's use within the businesses involved. There can be stipulations on conduct within the common areas as well as availability of the common areas. Businesses may also have common areas within themselves. Typically the businesses with common areas will have their own rules that cater to their business type, policy, and company vision. ==Real estate taxation of common areas== States vary in how they tax common areas, for real estate tax purposes. It may depend on whether it is a condo or a co-op. For example, the state of Arizona taxes \\"residential common areas\\" in housing developments with a flat tax, but common areas of condominiums and golf courses are assessed separately.Arizona Department of Revenue, Property Tax Division, Guideline, Residential Common Areas, March 31, 2000, citing Arizona Revised Statutes sections 42-13401 et seq., found at Pinal County, AZ web site . (pdf doc). Accessed May 8, 2008 ==Stipulations with Various Common Area Types== Dependent upon the common area type (i.e. Business, Residential, State-owned) there are certain precautions one must take with utilizing them. Some require leases, some require contracts, and some only require only “at your word”. For example, businesses may share common areas in a store like Black Lion or a store that accepts vendors from multiple backgrounds. It is understood in a lease or contract that they will share space with these different vendors. With apartments, there are two different types of common areas you can have. One would be under contract and the other would be under lease. Apartments that rent by the unit (i.e. conventional housing) are signed for by one individual. That one individual legally decides the use of the common area should they ever gain a roommate in the future. If an apartment complex leases by the bedroom, there is a clause or paragraph detailing how the space is to be used equally between all lease holders. Lastly, there are state-owned and mandated common areas. Forts and bases, government run facilities, and even jails have common areas. There is no agreement in a lease stating how those areas should be used. There are different kinds of common areas and all of them have different rules and stipulations. The all have different legal proceedings should something happen in those areas. == Loss factor == In commercial real estate in the US, a building's loss factor is the percentage of the building's area shared by tenants or space that are dedicated to the common areas of a building used to calculate the difference between the net (usable) and gross (billable) areas. That portion of the space is considered \\"lost\\" because it cannot be directly leased and the maintenance and operation costs must be covered by the other rentable areas. The loss factor is often confused with load factor, but the formulas for each term vary. The loss factor is calculated as follows: Loss Factor = (Rentable Area – Usable Area) / Rentable Area The Building Owners and Managers Association has established a standard with American National Standards Institute, ANSI/BOMA Z65.1-2010 for measuring floor area and calculating gross leasable area and loss factor. ==See also== * Common area maintenance charges * Common land, also known as a Commons * Common law * The Common Law * Common Travel Area * Condominium * Curtilage * Kehrwoche * Loss factor (real estate) * Reserves for Common-Interest Developments ==References== Category:Real estate terminology Category:Real property law Category:Condominium ","title":"Common area"},{"id":"17297405","text":"John Casey (12 May 1820, Kilbehenny, County Limerick, Ireland – 3 January 1891, Dublin) was a respected Irish geometer.

It was named a National Blue Ribbon School in 1994-1996. ==History== In 1961, voters of Socorro held an election to determine the future of education in the area. That vote, by a tally of 63-0, resulted in the formation of the Socorro Independent School District. The district consisted of one school, Escontrias, that enrolled students through the eighth grade. It was not until March 1964 that a $500,000 bond was passed, enabling students of the area to attend high school in the Socorro area. Until then, students who wanted to attend high school went to either Clint High School or Ysleta High School. The eighth grade class of 1965 would be the first freshman class at the new high school, and one grade would be added each year until it became a four-year school. Socorro graduated its first class in May 1968. Rafael (Ralph) Olivas was the highest ranking male student, and Mary Solis was the highest ranking female student from this first class. Both received college scholarships for their accomplishments. Socorro High School opened in the fall of 1965, with A.D. Weir named as its first principal. Columbia blue, red, and white were chosen as the official school colors, and the bulldog was adopted as their mascot. A family who lived in the area actually donated their bulldog, \\"Homer\\", to the school to be used at special functions. As early as 1970, population growth began to create problems for Socorro High School. In 1971, it could not accommodate the increasing enrollment, and a split session was adopted. Half of the student body attended from 7 am until noon, and the other half from noon until 5 pm. By 1972, expansion of the school temporarily alleviated those problems, but the issue would continue for years. By 1977, enrollment grew to the point that a separate junior high school was required. This too, was a temporary solution to the burgeoning population in the area, and Socorro Junior High School would last only until the mid-1980s. Socorro Junior High would eventually be converted into a part of Socorro High School. In 1982, Bill Sybert was hired as superintendent of Socorro ISD. His major focus was to give the district an identity. His leadership created a \\"new face\\" for SISD. One of his big changes was the implementation of the K-8 concept. Junior high schools would no longer be built, but rather local schools would enroll students from kindergarten through eighth grade. This allowed the district to combine Socorro Junior High School with Socorro High, giving the high school the space it needed to become a state-of-the art school. Sybert embarked on a major remodeling program for SHS that not only included numerous academic facilities, but facilities for extracurricular activities as well. The result was a high school facility that took a back seat to none. Included in the expansion was a theater that could seat 1234 people, second only to the El Paso Civic Center in capacity, The Pit was the largest high school gymnasium in the city and second only to the Haskins Center, and the Socorro High School Library was the largest high school library in the state of Texas at the time.http://schools.sisd.net/soh/index.php?option=content&task;=category&sectionid;=1&id;=1&Itemid;=135 ==Extracurricular activities== ===Athletics=== All SISD high schools offer the following athletic programs: baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track, volleyball and wrestling. The school has a continuing rivalry with Montwood in football, where both teams play for \\"The Helmet\\", which has a side representing each school. This rivalry has produced some exciting games, usually occurring near the end of the sport's season. The Socorro football team made the playoffs in 1990, 1991, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2002. They won district championships in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998. The current head football coach and athletic coordinator is Mike Ferrell. Past head coaches of Socorro include Ricky Barraza, Glen Myers, Craig Ritchie, Jim Carson and John Parchman. The Socorro baseball team won the 5A State Championship in 2009.

The game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was released in March 2009 to coincide with WrestleMania XXV. The game was developed by Yuke's and published by THQ, the same developer and publisher for the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw video game series. The WWE logo featured in the game was a slight modification of the pre-1990 WWF logo. Unlike all other WWE Smackdown vs Raw games released, this game was not ported over to the PlayStation 2 or Wii. ==Gameplay== ===Match gameplay=== A recreation of the main event at WrestleMania 3 featuring Andre (left) and Hogan (right). The game features a new grapple-based combo fighting system. To differentiate itself from the SmackDown series, Legends of WrestleMania focuses more on arcade-style gameplay (similar to WWF WrestleFest) with only the D-pad (or left analog stick) and the four face buttons needed on the gamepad. During play, the player's HUD features a health bar and a number between one and three. After successful chains of attacks, the number increases with more devastating moves now available. After completing the third level of moves, the wrestler's finishing move can then be performed. Continuous chains of moves are performed by pressing a button allocated by the screen before the player's opponent can. If the opponent beats the player at this, then the move is blocked and the chain is broken. Each wrestler has five taunts, which will either increase his health meter or his speed, among others. In addition, when a wrestler is being pinned, a meter displays that determines how likely it is for the opponent to kick out of the pin. Unlike the WWE SmackDown games, a submission meter is the only indication to specific damaged body parts, as opposed to a body model located in the HUD. Managers play a significant part of the game, and interfere on behalf of their clients. Features similar to the SmackDown series such as create-a-legend mode and online gameplay are also featured in the game. There are many new moves created for this game, along with most moves that appeared in Smackdown vs. Raw 2009. Most moves were used for SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. A new mode featured is the WrestleMania Tour where classic WrestleMania matches can be recreated with classic WWE footage included to introduce the bout. The game also includes a feature to import characters from WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 (except for; Big Daddy V, Chuck Palumbo, Elijah Burke, Lance Cade, Paul London, and Trevor Murdoch). === Game modes === The game features a WrestleMania Tour mode consisting of three options: Relive, Rewrite, and Redefine. In Relive, the player can play as a legend that won a match over a certain wrestler. Rewrite allows the player to play as the loser of a certain historic match in order to \\"rewrite\\" history. The player in this mode can watch a recap of the history of certain wrestlers, a recap of their feud, and a recap of their match at WrestleMania. In this mode, the player must complete certain objectives, besides winning the match. In Redefine, the player chooses any wrestler to play and the ability to change the match type. A Movie Theater is available to watch all unlocked match clips. The match types are Single, Tag Team, Triple Threat, Steel Cage, Ladder, Submission, Iron Man, Handicap, Hell in a Cell, and Royal Rumble. Another game mode in WWE Legends of WrestleMania is the Legend Killer mode. The mode features six tiers, with four tiers having ten legends waiting to challenge the player, and the two others will have all the Legends from the game and a tier list for the Superstars from WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 respectively. This mode is used to enhance the player's Create-a-Legend attributes. Also featured is a Hall of Fame Mode, allowing players to view what they have unlocked. ==Roster== The game featured 38 playable characters by default, and 4 non-playable managers. Players could extend the roster by choosing the \\"Import WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009\\" option on the main menu. This would import most of the male characters from SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 into the game. Unlockable characters would only be available if they had been previously unlocked in SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, however, female and downloadable content characters could not be imported. Each imported character had a unique moves set designed specifically for the WWE Legends of WrestleMania game. These moves sets became available automatically in \\"Create- A-Moves-Set\\" mode. This function required SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 to be loaded onto the console's internal memory. However, once imported, the characters remained permanently unlocked in WWE Legends of WrestleMania. Players did not need to retain the SvR09 game files on the internal memory in order to retain the SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 characters. Big Daddy V, Chuck Palumbo, Elijah Burke, Hornswoggle, Lance Cade, Masked Man, Paul London, Tony and Trevor Murdoch could not be imported. Players could also create their own custom characters in \\"Create-A-WWE-Legend\\" mode. Alternatively, they could also import user-created characters from SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 save files. If the \\"Import WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009\\" function had been used, it made most entrance animations, videos and theme music from SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 available in the \\"Create-An-Entrance\\" modes. ==Reception== WWE Legends of WrestleMania received \\"average\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Some critics praised the game's focus on nostalgia from the earlier days of the event. Other reviewers, such as GameSpot and IGN, criticized the game for being repetitive, lacking in replay value, being overly simplistic, and how wrestler models were beefed up to look too \\"action figure\\" like. ==See also== *Legends of Wrestling (series) - wrestling game series exclusively featuring professional wrestling legends * WWE 2K14 - an entry in the WWE 2K series that also allows players to reenact various WrestleMania moments ==References== == External links == * Category:2009 video games Category:IOS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:THQ games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:WrestleMania video games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Yuke's games Category:Professional wrestling games ","title":"WWE Legends of WrestleMania"},{"id":"17297591","text":"Mleh may refer to: * Mleh, Prince of Armenia (before 1120 – 1170) * Melias (died 934), Byzantine general, founder of the theme of Lykandos ","title":"Mleh"},{"id":"17297622","text":"Dagmar Maalstad (3 April 1902 - 27 June 2000) was a Norwegian politician for the Conservative Party.

The \\"Marching Song\\" has been described as \\"a powerful early statement of black pride, militancy, and desire for full equality, revealing the aspirations of black soldiers for Reconstruction as well as anticipating the spirit of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\\"Walls, \\"Marching Song,\\" Arkansas Historical Quarterly (Winter 2007), 401–402. The song's lyrics are attributed to the regiment's white officer, Captain Lindley Miller. An almost identical song, \\"The Valiant Soldiers,\\" is attributed to Sojourner Truth in post-Civil War editions of her Narrative. Recent scholarship supports Miller as the original author, or at least compiler, of the song.Walls, \\"Marching Song,\\" AHQ, 401–421. Song of the First of Arkansas, 1864 ==History== Although Congress had passed a confiscation act and a militia act in July 1862, permitting freed slaves to serve in the Union Army, President Abraham Lincoln was initially reluctant to enlist blacks as soldiers. Lincoln announced in September of 1862 that effective January 1, 1863, all slaves in Confederate territory would be free.Cornish, The Sable Arm, pp. 29–111McPherson, The Negro's Civil War, pp. 161–239. Beginning in 1863, recruitment of black soldiers proceeded with Lincoln's approval. The First Arkansas Volunteer Infantry Regiment (African Descent) began recruiting among former slaves in Helena, Arkansas following Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1863, and was officially established on May 1. In June the regiment saw action at Mound Plantation, Mississippi, and at Goodrich's Landing, Louisiana, where the unit remained through January 1864. The unit then moved to Haines Bluff near Vicksburg, Mississippi until May 1864.Walls, \\"Marching Song,\\" AHQ, p. 403. The Union Army standardized the varied names of colored regiments as \\"United States Colored Troops\\" (U.S.C.T.), and the First Arkansas became the \\"46th Regiment, United States Colored Infantry\\" on May 11, 1864.Cornish, The Sable Arm, p. 131. Lindley Miller was the son of Jacob W. Miller, who served as a U.S. Senator of the Whig Party from New Jersey between 1841 and 1853. His mother was the former Mary Louisa Macculloch, daughter of wealthy Morristown, New Jersey engineer and businessman George P. Macculloch, who designed and built the Morris Canal. Lindley Miller was admitted to the bar in 1855, and established a successful law practice in New York City. Even as a young man, he was a noted orator and poet. After President Lincoln's proclamation of war in April 1861, he enlisted as a private in the 7th Regiment, New York State Militia, known as the \\"Silk Stocking Regiment\\" for its elite membership. He married Anne Huntington Tracy of Manhattan in May 1862. In August 1863, Anne Miller died after childbirth, at age 24, and their infant child died a week later. Heartbroken, Lindley Miller sought to become an officer with a colored regiment. He received a commission as captain in the First Arkansas Volunteer Infantry Regiment (African Descent) in November 1863.Walls, \\"Marching Song,\\" AHQ, pp. 405–406. Captain Miller first mentions the \\"Marching Song\\" in a letter from Vicksburg to his mother in Morristown, dated January 20, 1864. \\"I wrote a song for them to the tune of 'John Brown' the other day, which the whole Regiment sings. I sent a copy of it to Anthony\\" (Lindley's brother-in- law, Anthony Quinton Keasbey, U.S. Attorney for New Jersey from 1861 to 1868, married to Lindley's older sister, Edwina). Keasbey sent the song to the National Anti-Slavery Standard, where it appeared in the February 27, 1864 issue.Walls, \\"Marching Song,\\" AHQ, pp. 415–417. Recognized for his excellent service, Miller was promoted to Major and assigned to a Missouri regiment, but never took up his new commission. On sick leave at his home, Miller died on June 30, 1864, at age 30, from a fever he had acquired during his service with the First Arkansas.Walls, \\"Marching Song,\\" AHQ, pp. 405–406. The \\"Marching Song of the First Arkansas Colored Regiment\\" is known today through the song sheet issued by the Supervisory Committee for Recruiting Colored Regiments in Philadelphia. The \\"Song of the First of Arkansas,\\" written in dialect, was one of several broadsides issued by the Committee for recruitment purposes. The broadside had this brief introduction: \\"The following song was written by Captain Lindley Miller, of the First Arkansas Colored Regiment. Captain Miller says the 'boys' sing the song on dress parade with an effect which can hardly be described, and he adds that 'while it is not very conservative, it will do to fight with.' Captain Miller is a son of the late ex-Senator Miller, of New Jersey.\\"Walls, \\"Marching Song,\\" AHQ, pp. 408–409. The song was also included in a collection of Union Army songs published in New York in 1864.Songs of the Soldiers, arranged and edited by Frank Moore (New York: George P. Putnam, 1864), pp. 206–208; Moore's introductory Note is dated April 1864. Irwin Silber, editor of Sing Out! from 1951 to 1967, introduced the song to a mid-20th-century audience in his Songs of the Civil War, published in 1960 in conjunction with the Civil War Centennial observance from 1961 to 1965. Silber thought it likely that the song represented a collaboration between Miller and his troops. Silber edited the song to standard English and titled it \\"Marching Song of the First Arkansas (Negro) Regiment.\\"Silber, Songs of the Civil War, pp. 12, 26. ==Score== \\"Marching Song\\" follows the tune of \\"John Brown's Body\\" and \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\": \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" melody beginning ==Lyrics== ==Interpretation== The black soldiers, in exuberant spirits, brag in the first three stanzas that they will show the rebels they are formidable fighters. They fight for the law, which offers equal treatment, as well as the Union. As soldiers, the third stanza says, they strike out for a new life, leaving behind \\"hoeing cotton\\" and \\"hoeing corn.\\" The most powerful challenge to the mores of the antebellum South is presented in the fourth stanza, where the black soldiers demand social equality, and more: \\"They will have to bow their foreheads to their colored kith and kin.\\" White Southerners will have to acknowledge their actual blood relations among the former slaves. A heavy debt is owed: \\"They will have to pay us wages, the wages of their sin\\" (as Romans notes, the \\"wages of sin is death\\"). The black soldiers demand reparations, or threaten retaliation: \\"They will have to give us house-room, or the roof shall tumble in!\\" In stanzas five and six, slavery has been abolished forever by the Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln is described as \\"Father Abraham,\\" a title that associates the President with the Old Testament patriarch, emphasizing the religious sanction to the abolition of slavery. The song is a powerful summary of the hopes and dreams of the black soldiers. Years later, a Civil War veteran told Norman B. Wood \\"he once heard a black regiment sing it just before a battle and they made the welkin [heavens] ring, and inspired all who heard it.\\"Wood, The White Side of a Black Subject, pp. 247–248. ==Recordings== Soon after Silber's book appeared, two recordings were issued based on his version, one by Pete Seeger and Bill MacAdoo on the album Songs of the Civil War, released by Folkways Records in 1960. Tennessee Ernie Ford recorded the second on the album Tennessee Ernie Ford Sings Civil War Songs of the North, released by Capitol Records in 1961. The Seeger-MacAdoo folk song version includes three verses, and Ford's gospel quartet version includes four. Both recordings skipped the controversial fourth stanza. Seeger and MacAdoo's version is now a Smithsonian Folkways recording, and Ford's version is available as Bear Family Records BCD 16635 AS. Keith and Rusty McNeil also recorded a three-stanza version of the \\"Marching Song\\" in their three-CD set of Civil War Songs. The song is in their self-published Civil War Songbook.Riverside, CA: WEM Records, 1999, pp. 68–69. Sparky and Rhonda Rucker included four verses from the \\"Marching Song\\" in a medley titled \\"Glory Hallelujah Suite\\" on The Blue and the Grey in Black and White, released by Flying Fish Records in 1993. The bluegrass album Songs of the Civil War Era, self-published in November 2005 by ShoreGrass, contains a recording of the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" in which the first and second stanzas of the Marching Song are included. Sweet Honey in the Rock recorded Truth's song in 1993 on their 20th anniversary album, Still on the Journey. Bernice Johnson Reagon, Sweet Honey's founder, renamed the song \\"Sojourner's Battle Hymn.\\"See Reagon, If You Don't Go, Don't Hinder Me, pp. 118–120. Truth's biographers Erlene Stetson and Linda David describe the song as \\"rousing, brashly defiant, irreverent and joyous,\\" and characterized Sweet Honey's version as \\"stirringly performed.\\"Stetson and David, Glorying in Tribulation, p. 141. In 2006 the Sojourner Truth Institute and Heritage Battle Creek produced a CD, Am I Not a Man and a Brother? Songs of Freedom North and South, with talented local singers and musicians from Battle Creek, Michigan, including a rendition of \\"The Valiant Soldiers\\" by Carolyn Ballard. In the opera Appomattox by Philip Glass, the chorus sings a variation of the tune in Act One. ==Sojourner Truth's version== Sojourner Truth's version of the song, \\"The Valiant Soldiers,\\" which appears in the 1878, 1881, and 1884 editions of her Narrative, is almost identical to Silber's edition of the \\"Marching Song,\\" containing stanzas one through five plus stanza seven. Only the first line of the first stanza is different: \\"We are the valiant soldiers who've 'listed for the war.\\" Stanzas six and eight are found only in the \\"Marching Song.\\" Truth's carte de visite In the post-Civil War editions of Truth's Narrative, \\"The Valiant Soldiers\\" is introduced by this sentence by Francis Titus: \\"The following song, written for the first Michigan Regiment of colored soldiers, was composed by Sojourner Truth during the war, and was sung by her in Detroit and Washington.\\"Narrative of Sojourner Truth, Oxford University Press, 1991, p. 126. As she was unable to read or write, Truth dictated her original autobiography to her friend Olive Gilbert. The Narrative of Sojourner Truth was published in Boston in 1850 by William Lloyd Garrison's printer on credit, and was sold by Truth at her public lectures. She had become a powerful and popular speaker on such reform topics as abolitionism, women's suffrage and temperance, often including songs in her presentations. In 1860 Truth moved from Northampton, Massachusetts to Battle Creek, Michigan. Truth continued to travel and lecture during the Civil War, her fame as a speaker promoted by Harriet Beecher Stowe's article in the April 1863 Atlantic Monthly, romanticizing Truth as the \\"Libyan Sibyl.\\" To support herself, Truth sold her carte de visite at lectures in addition to sheets of her favorite songs and copies of her Narrative. Sometime around Thanksgiving 1863, Truth collected food in Battle Creek and delivered it to the First Michigan Colored Infantry, which was being organized that fall at Camp Ward in Detroit. Truth biographers Carleton MabeeMabee, Sojourner Truth, pp. 116–117. and Nell Irvin PainterPainter, Sojourner Truth, pp. 183–184. report she sang \\"The Valiant Soldiers\\" either on this occasion or during another visit to the soldiers in February 1864, although they have not cited any contemporary sources that verify this. Neither the story about Truth's visit in the Detroit Advertiser and Tribune of November 24, 1863 nor Truth's letters of that period make any mention of her singing \\"The Valiant Soldiers.\\"Walls, \\"Marching Song,\\" AHQ, 417–418. Truth is first linked to the song in 1878, fourteen years after Miller's version was published in the National Anti-Slavery Standard. Truth's Michigan friend Frances Titus edited an expanded edition of Truth's Narrative by adding a section of letters and articles Truth had collected in the scrapbooks she called her \\"Book of Life.\\" The first edition, published in Boston in 1875, did not contain \\"The Valiant Soldiers.\\" Later editions printed in Battle Creek in 1878, 1881, and 1884 have the song inserted on a blank page between the original \\"Narrative\\" and the \\"Book of Life\\" sections.Walls, \\"Marching Song,\\" AHQ, 411. Titus's note that the song was composed for the First Michigan Regiment appears to be one more of the minor inaccuracies she introduced into her editions of the Narrative.For other examples, see Painter, Sojourner Truth, pp. 258–264. There is no question that Truth sang the song; Painter cites a newspaper account of Truth singing a variation of \\"The Valiant Soldiers\\" in 1879 to the black settlers in Kansas known as Exodusters.Painter, Exodusters, p. 247. But there is no evidence Truth composed the lyrics before Lindley Miller's \\"Marching Song\\" was published and widely distributed. ==Notes== ==References== *Cornish, Dudley Taylor, The Sable Arm: Negro Troops in the Union Army, 1861–1895. 1956; New York: W.

It was released on March 6, 2001 by Red Hill Records. The album primarily incorporates Christian rock and contemporary Christian music elements with lyrical themes of childhood, adolescence, and Hudson's faith in God. Before its release, Red Hill went bankrupt, preventing it from marketing and promoting the album, which subsequently sold about 200 copies and received mixed reviews. ==Composition== Katy Hudson saw Hudson exploring Christian rock and contemporary Christian music (CCM). Amongst what was described as an alternative direction were prominent influences of pop rock. During an interview for her official website at the time, Hudson cited artists Jonatha Brooke, Jennifer Knapp, Diana Krall, and Fiona Apple as her musical influences. \\"Trust in Me\\", \\"Naturally\\", and \\"My Own Monster\\" were said to capture \\"loneliness, fear and doubt often ascribed to teens\\". The first features \\"haunting\\" strings with \\"electronica effects\\" and \\"solid rock roots\\". An aggressive track, \\"Piercing\\" depicts the infatuation people have with expendable things. In \\"Piercing\\", Hudson sings: \\"Lord, help me see the reality / That all I'll ever need is You\\". \\"Last Call\\" was written by Hudson while reading the book Last Call for Help: Changing North America One Teen at a Time, written by Dawson McAllister. Musically, it sees Hudson going into a more jazz-oriented sound. Hudson described \\"Growing Pains\\" as an anthem for children and adolescents, explaining that society shares a misconstructed image of them, often viewing them as individuals that do not believe in or do not know much about God. \\"Faith Won't Fail\\" was inspired by faith always sufficing in Bible situations and chapters; and Hudson commented on \\"Search Me\\": \\"I was struggling with the fact that I would have the huge responsibility of how others would be affected through what I was doing or saying on stage. I don't want to put on some kind of front that everything is good when it's not. I wanted to keep it real, but still give people hope.\\" The record closes with \\"When There's Nothing Left\\", which has been described as a \\"crisp and clean 'love note' to God\\". The album was described as eschewing bubblegum pop and evoking Christian pop songstresses Rachel Lampa and Jaci Velasquez. == Promotion == To promote the album, Hudson went on a tour, the Strangely Normal Tour, with Phil Joel, Earthsuit, and V*Enna and later embarked on 46 solo performances throughout the United States. The song \\"Trust in Me\\" spent two weeks on the Radio & Records Christian Rock chart, peaking at number 17. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width: 900px;\\" ! colspan=4  Solo performance dates - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" ! style=\\"width:20%;\\"  Date ! style=\\"width:20%;\\"  City ! style=\\"width:20%;\\"  State ! style=\\"width:60%;\\" Venue - bgcolor=\\"#DDDDDD\\"  colspan=4 align=center  North America - September 6, 2001 Sherman align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"6\\"  Texas Austin College Auditorium - September 7, 2001 San Antonio University United Methodist Church - September 8, 2001 Abilene Hardin–Simmons University - September 9, 2001 Austin Westlake Bible Church - September 11, 2001 Wichita Falls The Wichita Theater - September 13, 2001 Dallas The Door - September 14, 2001 Norman  Oklahoma Common Ground CoffeeHouse - September 15, 2001 Houston align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"3\\"  Texas 1st Baptist Church-Metro Worship - September 16, 2001 Bryan VFW Wall - September 19, 2001 Lubbock Indiana Avenue Baptist Church - September 21, 2001 Bartlesville  Oklahoma Bartlesville Weslyan College - September 22, 2001 Shiloam Springs  rowspan=\\"5\\"  Arkansas JBU Cathedral of the Ozarks - September 23, 2001 Jonesboro First Baptist Church - September 26, 2001 Arkadelphia Ouchita Baptist University - September 28, 2001 Grove City Grove City College (Crawford Auditorium) - September 29, 2001 Grantham Messiah College (Brewbaker Auditorium) - October 3, 2001 Malibu  California Pepperdine University - October 6, 2001 Deerfield  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Illinois Trinity College - October 7, 2001 Bolingbrook Westbrook Christian Church - October 9, 2001 Upland  Indiana Taylor University - October 11, 2001 Toledo  Ohio University of Toledo - October 12, 2001 Dubuque  Iowa Emmaus Bible College Auditorium - October 13, 2001 Wilmore  Kentucky Asbury College - October 14, 2001 align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Nashville rowspan=\\"2\\"  Tennessee align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Belcourt Theater - October 15, 2001 - October 16, 2001 Lafayette  Indiana University Church at Purdue University - October 18, 2001 Bloomington  Illinois Sherwood Oaks Christian - October 20, 2001 Grand Rapids  Michigan  align=\\"center\\" Ground Floor, Res Life Church - October 21, 2001 Milwaukee  Wisconsin Crossroads Presbyterian - October 22, 2001 New Brighton  Minnesota O'Shaughnessy Education Center - October 23, 2001 Sioux Falls  South Dakota University of Sioux Falls - October 25, 2001 Colorado Springs rowspan=\\"4\\"  Colorado Vanguard Church - October 26, 2001 Boulder Flat Irons Theater - October 27, 2001 Denver Regis University Auditorium - October 28, 2001 Buena Vista Mountain Heights Baptist - October 31, 2001 Hattiesburg  Mississippi William Carey College (Smith Auditorium) - November 1, 2001 Gainesville rowspan=\\"4\\"  Florida Florida Theater - November 2, 2001 Tallahassee Lawton Chiles Auditorium - November 4, 2001 Orlando Wesley Foundation - November 9, 2001 West Palm Palm Beach Atlantic College - November 11, 2001 Clemson  South Carolina Clemson University - November 12, 2001 Montgomery rowspan=\\"2\\"  Alabama The Train Shed - November 13, 2001 Auburn Auburn University - November 16, 2001 Columbia  South Carolina Shandon Baptist Church - November 17, 2001 Elon  North Carolina 1st United Methodist Church of Elon - November 18, 2001 Harrisonburg  Virginia Court Square Theater } ==Release and reception== Katy Hudson was released on March 6, 2001. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic awarded the record three stars out of five, stating that with the album, Hudson had \\"betray[ed] a heavy, heavy debt to Alanis Morissette\\". Erlewine described the record's overall sound as \\"the kind of assaultive, over-produced Wall of Sound that some CCM rockers do in order to prove they're contemporary\\". Christianity Today writer Russ Breimeier was positive about Katy Hudson, highlighting Hudson's songwriting style for being \\"insightful and well matched to the emotional power\\" of Hudson's music. He further deemed Hudson a \\"young talent\\" and expected to hear more from her in the next year. Similarly, Tony Cummings from Cross Rhythms also considered Hudson to be a \\"vocal talent\\", recommending readers to listen to the album. The Phantom Tollbooth's Andy Argyrakis stated that Hudson having been reared in church had \\"paid off\\", and noted that \\"Although a mere pop lightweight, it's hard to ignore Hudson's sincerity and lyrical maturity.\\" DEP from Billboard, also calling Hudson a talent, classified the record as \\"textured modern-rock collection that is equal parts grit and vulnerability\\" and \\"impressive\\". The album was a commercial failure for bankrupted Red Hill Records, only selling between 100 and 200 copies. ==Musical change== Katy Hudson is the only Christian music-influenced album by Hudson, who subsequently adopted Katy Perry as her stage name. After her popularity increased, previously sold copies of Katy Hudson have become a sought-after item amongst her fans. ==Track listing== Credits extracted from Katy Hudson liner notes. == Personnel == Adapted from Katy Hudson liner notes. * Katy Hudson – lead vocals (1–10), background vocals (2, 7, 8) * Tommy Collier – production (2, 3), acoustic guitars (1), guitars (3), keyboards (2, 3), loops (2, 3) * Otto Price – production (1, 7, 8), synthesizers (1, 7, 8), bass (1, 2, 4–10), loops (2), programming (1, 7, 8), B-3 (1, 8), additional guitars (7,8) * Scott Faircloff – piano (2), keyboards (2, 3), wurlitzer (3) * David Browning – production (4–6, 9, 10), keyboards and programming (4–6, 9, 10), B-3 (7), piano (8), string arrangements (5, 9, 10) * Chris Graffagnino – guitars (4-6, 9, 10) * Barry Graul – electric guitars/12-str (1), guitars (7,8) * Tony Morra – drums (2–6, 9, 10) * Scott Williamson – drums (7, 8) * Greg Herrington – drums (1), additional drums (7) * Matt Pierson – bass (3) * Jeffrey Scot Wills – saxophone (4) * Otto Price, III – wah guitar (8) * David McMullan – brass (7) * Kim Palsma – woodwinds (1, 8) * David Davidson – violin (1, 7) * Kristin Wilkinson – viola (1, 7) * John Catchings – cello (1, 7) * Mark Stuart – background vocals (1) * Stacy Tiernan – background vocals (3) ==References== ==External links== * Book Last Call for Help: Changing North America One Teen at a Time on Amazon.ca, which is referenced on the Composition section regarding the album's song \\"Last Call\\". * Book Katy Perry - A Biography on Amazon.com, which is referenced in the Opening, Release & Reception and Musical Change sections regarding the album's sales, and commercial failure for Red Hill Records.

After the war, he became a member of the Breton nationalist political movement Breiz Atao. He was one of the founders in 1923 of the artistic movement Seiz Breur, along with Jeanne Malivel and René-Yves Creston. His aim was to revitalise Breton sacred art: crosses, votive objects and traditional crafts. He also designed and supported pottery, ceramics, embroidery and cabinetmaking. Between 1924 and 1935, he was an architect in Perros-Guirec, where he developed a successful practice building holiday villas. In 1929 he joined with Xavier de Langlais to found An Droellen, a workshop of Breton Christian art. The duo worked closely together on a number of projects, including the college chapel of St. Joseph in Lannion. The workshop included among its members Mlle Ménard (glazier), Madame Planiol (restoration of priestly vestments) and Jules-Charles Le Bozec (sculptor). In the late 1930s Bouillé created the Chapel of Koat-Keo in Scrignac (Finistère), built at the initiative of his friend Abbot Jean-Marie Perrot, founder of the Breton Catholic youth organization Bleun-Brug, which promoted traditional Breton culture. The chapel is seen as a significant attempt to create a distinctive modern Breton sacred architecture.Ministry of Culture, Merimée. Monuments historiques: Chapelle de Koat-Keo During the World War II, Perrot and Breun-Blug were suspected of collaborationist activity. In 1941, Bouillé was made director of Bleun-Brug and sat on the Advisory Committee of Brittany, as its representative. The Committee was seen by resistance activists as part of the collaborationist régime. At this time he advocated a radical plan to build a new Breton capital city to be called \\"Brittia\\", which would be a \\"Celtic Brasilia\\" on the shores of Lake Guerlédan.Hervé Le Boterf, La Bretagne dans la guerre, Volume 3, p. 320 Due to his association with Perrot and the committee, he was interned after the Liberation of France. He died in 1945, as a result of his internment. In Brittany, at least nine streets bear his name.Les Noms qui ont fait l'histoire de Bretagne, Coop Breizh et Institut culturel de Bretagne, 1997 ==Major buildings== *1933: holiday home, known as Kelenn, 18 chemin de Quo-Vadis, subdivision of Tourony-plage at Tégastel *1936-1937: Chapelle de l'Institution Saint-Joseph (in fact Saint-Joseph college) in Lannion *1937: Chapel Koat-Keo at Scrignac, created for the Abbot Perrot, with sculptures by Jules-Charles Le Bozec.

If the grand jury determines that there is enough evidence to justify the bringing of charges, then the defendant is indicted. In the federal system, a case must always be brought before a grand jury for indictment if it is punishable by death or more than one year in prison;https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/Rule7.htm some states, however, do not require indictment. ==Petit juries== Once charges have been brought, the case is then brought before a petit jury, (or what is commonly recognized as the normal courtroom jury of six to twelve members), or is tried by a judge alone, if the defense requests it. Any petit jury is selected from a pool by the prosecution and defense. After both sides have presented their cases and made closing arguments, the judge gives the jury legal instructions; the jury then adjourns to deliberate in private. The jury generally must unanimously agree on a verdict of guilty or not guilty; however, the Supreme Court has upheld non unanimous jury verdicts, so long as the jury is larger than 6 people. In 1972, the Court upheld convictions in Apodaca v. Oregon https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1970/1970_69_5046 and Johnson v. Louisiana https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1970/1970_69_5035 where Oregon and Louisiana convicted Petitioners on 10-to-2 and 9-to-3 verdicts respectively. In 1979, the Court ruled in Burch v. Louisiana that where a jury was made of 6 people, the verdict must be unanimous.https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1978/1978_78_90 ==Presentation of evidence== The prosecution gives an opening statement that summarizes its general arguments. The defense can then present its opening statement or may opt to wait until the prosecution has finished presenting its complete case. The prosecution presents its case first. This is done by calling witnesses to give testimony and by presenting physical evidence that will prove the defendant is guilty of the crime. Witnesses are people who can give testimony that will help prove the guilt of the defendant. They may have actually seen events related to the crime, may have relevant information about the defendant, or may be able to give expert testimony concerning the evidence or have other important information. After the prosecution finishes, it is the time for the defense to address the court. The defense may start by asking the judge to dismiss the case for lack of evidence. If the judge agrees the evidence is insufficient to prove the defendant committed the crime without a reasonable doubt, the case will be dismissed and the defendant will be free of the charges. Usually, the judge does not dismiss the case. At this time, the defense will give its opening statement if it has not already done so. The defense then proceeds to present its case by calling witnesses and submitting evidence that will prove the defendant did not commit the crime. All witnesses may be cross-examined by the opposing side while testifying. Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the defendant is not required to be a witness in his own defense. If he does not testify, the jury can not hold this against him. Also under the Fifth Amendment, a witness has the right not to incriminate himself. This means the witness is not required to answer any question if doing so would incriminate himself. After the defense finishes presenting its case, each side gives a closing statement summarizing the evidence that supports its position of either guilt or innocence. The closing statements are given in the same order, with the defense going last. Then the deliberation phase of the trial begins. ==Verdict== ===Burden of proof=== The burden of proof is on the prosecution in a criminal trial. This means the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime. As the defense does not have this burden, it must only prove that it is reasonably possible that the defendant did not commit the crime. The defense does not have to prove the defendant definitely did not commit the crime, only that it is possible he did not do it. ===Deliberation=== Once the prosecution and defense present their cases, the judge will give the case to the jury. First the judge will instruct the jury about any legal rules that may affect their decision. The judge then sends the jury to the jury room to deliberate about whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charges. During the trial the jury is not allowed to read about the case or discuss it with anyone even each other. Sometimes juries are sequestered or kept together away from their homes and any media coverage of the trial. Once deliberation begins the jurors are allowed to talk to each other. They are to remain together, except overnight, until they either reach a decision or determine they cannot reach a decision. In the later occurrence, the jury is said to be deadlocked and is called a hung jury. If the jury decides, this is called the verdict. They inform the judge and return to the courtroom where the verdict is read. The judge may either accept the verdict or overrule it. It is rare for the verdict to be overruled. This happens when the judge thinks the verdict is unlawful. Often this is because the jury does not follow the legal instructions. It can also happen if the judge thinks the jury interpreted the evidence in a manner that was not legal. Once the verdict is determined, the trial moves to the punishment phase. This can simply be the judge issuing the punishment sentence or, in more serious cases, can involve a separate hearing. ==Sentencing== If a defendant is found guilty, sentencing follows, often at a separate hearing after the prosecution, defense, and court have developed information based on which the judge will craft a sentence. The United States Sentencing Commission has promulgated guidance on what restitution and prison terms should be assessed for different crimes. In capital cases, a separate \\"penalty phase\\" occurs, in which the jury determines whether to recommend that the death penalty should be imposed. As with the determination of guilt phase, the burden is on the prosecution to prove its case, and the defendant is entitled to take the stand in his or her own defense, and may call witnesses and present evidence. ==Appeals== After sentencing, the case enters the post conviction phase. Usually the defendant begins serving the sentence immediately after the sentence is issued. The defendant may appeal the outcome of his trial to a higher court. American appellate courts do not retry the case. These courts only examine the record of the proceedings of the lower court to determine if errors were made that require a new trial, resentencing, or a complete dismissal of the charges. The prosecution may not appeal after an acquittal, although it may appeal under limited circumstances before the verdict is rendered. The prosecution may also appeal the sentence itself. Increasingly, there is also a recognition that collateral consequences of criminal charges may result from the sentence that are not explicitly part of the sentence itself. ==See also== *Criminal procedure ==References== Category:United States procedural law ","title":"United States criminal procedure"},{"id":"17297847","text":"Old Tjikko Old Tjikko is a 9,550 year-old Norway spruce, located on Fulufjället Mountain of Dalarna province in Sweden. Old Tjikko originally gained fame as the \\"world's oldest tree.\\" Old Tjikko is, however, a clonal tree that has regenerated new trunks, branches and roots over millennia rather than an individual tree of great age. Old Tjikko is recognized as the oldest living Picea abies and the third oldest known clonal tree. The age of the tree was determined by carbon dating of genetically matched plant material collected from under the tree, as dendrochronology would cause damage. The trunk itself is estimated to be only a few hundred years old, but the plant has survived for much longer due to a process known as layering (when a branch comes in contact with the ground, it sprouts a new root), or vegetative cloning (when the trunk dies but the root system is still alive, it may sprout a new trunk). ==Discovery and details== Example of stunted tree exhibiting a krummholz formation The root system of Old Tjikko is estimated to be years old, making it the world's oldest known Norway spruce. It stands tall and is located on Fulufjället Mountain of Dalarna province in Sweden. For thousands of years, the tree appeared in a stunted shrub formation (also known as a krummholz formation) due to the harsh extremes of the environment in which it lives. During the warming of the 20th century, the tree sprouted into a normal tree formation. The man who discovered the tree, Leif Kullman (Professor of Physical Geography at Umeå University), attributed this growth spurt to global warming and gave the tree its nickname \\"Old Tjikko\\" after his late dog. The tree has survived for so long due to vegetative cloning. The visible tree is relatively young, but it is part of an older root system that dates back thousands of years. The trunk of the tree may die and regrow multiple times, but the tree's root system remains intact and in turn sprouts another trunk. The trunk may only live for about 600 years, and when one trunk dies another eventually grows back in its place. Also, each winter, heavy snow may push the tree's low-lying branches to ground level, where they take root and survive to grow again the next year in a process known as layering. Layering occurs when a tree's branch comes in contact with the earth, and new roots sprout from the contact point. Other trees, such as coast redwoods and western redcedars are known to reproduce by layering. The tree's age was determined by carbon-14 dating of the root system, which found roots dating back to 375, 5,660, 9,000, and 9,550 years. Carbon dating is not accurate enough to pin down the exact year the tree sprouted from seed; but, given the estimated age, the tree is supposed to have sprouted around 7550 BC. For comparison, the invention of writing (and thus, the beginning of recorded history) did not occur until around 4000 BC. Researchers have found a cluster of around 20 spruce trees in the same area, all over 8,000 years old. The estimated age of Old Tjikko is close to the maximum possible for this area, as the last ice age's receding Fenno-Scandian ice sheet only released the Fulufjället Mountain around 10,000 years ago. Nature conservancy authorities considered putting a fence around the tree to protect it from possible vandals or trophy hunters. ==Access== A guided tour, pre-booked only, takes tourists to the tree in summer. == See also == * List of oldest trees * List of superlative trees in Sweden ==References== ==External links== Category:Individual spruce trees Category:Tourist attractions in Dalarna County Category:Individual trees in Sweden Category:Oldest trees ","title":"Old Tjikko"},{"id":"17297864","text":"Christian Holm (1783–1855) was a Norwegian politician.

Abiotic patterns, such as the ripple formations in sand dunes or the oscillating wave patterns of the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction emerge after thousands of particles interact millions of times. On the other hand, individuals in biological groups may be arranged non-randomly due to selfish behavior, dominance interactions, or cooperative behavior. W. D. Hamilton (1971) proposed that in a non-related \\"herd\\" of animals, spatial organization is likely a result of the selfish interests of individuals trying to acquire food or avoid predation. On the other hand, spatial arrangements have also been observed among highly related members of eusocial groups, suggesting that the arrangement of individuals may provide some advantage for the group. ==Spatial organization in eusocial insects== Spatial patterns exhibited by ants (Temnothorax rugatulus) can be determined after each individual is painted with a distinguishing mark. Individuals in a social insect colony can be spatially organized, or arranged non-randomly inside the nest. These miniature territories, or spatial fidelity zones have been described in honey bees (Apis mellifera), ants (Odontomachus brunneus; Temnothorax albipennis; Pheidole dentata), and paper wasps (Polistes dominulus, Ropalidia revolutionalis). While residing in these zones, workers perform the task appropriate to the area they reside. For example, individuals that remain in the center of an ant nest are more likely to feed larvae, whereas individuals found at the periphery of the nest are more likely to forage. E. O. Wilson proposed that by remaining in small, non-random areas inside the nest, the distance an individual moves between tasks may be minimized, and overall colony efficiency would increase. ===Spatial organization in the nest=== ====\\"Foraging-for-work\\"==== There are a variety of ways in which individuals can divide space inside a nest. According to the “foraging-for-work” hypothesis, adult workers begin performing tasks in the area of the nest where they emerged, and gradually move towards the periphery of the nest as demands to perform particular tasks change. This hypothesis is based on two observations: \\"(1) that there is spatial structure in the layout of tasks in social insect colonies and (2) that workers first become adults in or around the center of the nest\\". Individuals can remain in an area for an extended period of time, as long as tasks need to be performed there. Over time, an individual's zone may shift as tasks are accomplished and workers search for other areas where tasks need to be performed. Honey bees, for example, begin their adult life caring for brood located in the area near where they emerged (i.e. nurse bees). Eventually, workers move away from the brood rearing area and begin to perform other tasks, such as food storage, guarding, or foraging. ====Dominance hierarchy==== The dominant paper wasp (Polistes flavus) remains in the center of the nest while subordinate wasps are often at the edge or off the nest. Space inside the nest may also be divided as a result of dominance interactions. For example, in paper wasp colonies, a single inseminated queen may found (initiate) a colony after waking up from hibernation (overwintering). However, it is common in many species that multiple inseminated females join these foundresses instead of founding their own nest. When multiple inseminated females found a colony together, the colony grows quickly, yet only one individual will become the primary egg-layer. Through a series of dominance interactions, the most aggressive wasp will emerge as the dominant individual and will become the primary egg-layer for the group (the prime role for ensuring your genes are passed on to subsequent generations), whereas the remaining subordinate wasps will perform other tasks, such as nest construction or foraging. There is evidence that these dominance interactions affect the spatial zones individuals occupy as well. In paper wasps (Ropalidia revolutionalis), as well as in the ant species Odontomachus brunneus, dominant individuals are more likely to reside in the central areas of the nest, where they take care of brood, while the subordinate individuals are pushed towards the edge, where they are more likely to forage. It is unknown whether division of space or establishment of dominance occurs first and if the other is a result of it. ===Spatial organization outside the nest=== Bumble bees, Bombus impatiens individually marked with plastic number tags There is also evidence that foragers, which are the insects that leave the nest to collect the valuable resources for the developing colony, can divide space outside the nest. Makino & Sakai showed that bumble bee foragers maintain foraging zones in flower patches, which means that bees consistently return to the same areas within a patch and there is little overlap between individuals. These zones can expand and contract when neighboring foragers are removed or introduced, respectively. By dividing foraging patches into miniature ‘foraging territories’, individuals can maximize the number of flowers visited with minimal interruptions or competition between foragers. These ‘foraging territories’ divided among individuals from the same colony are the result of self-organization among the foragers; that is, there is no lead forager dictating where the bees will forage. Instead, the maintenance of these foraging zones is due to simple rules followed by each individual forager. Studies to determine these “rules” are an important area of research in computer science, basic biology, behavioral ecology, and mathematic modeling. ===Spatial organization as an emergent property of a self-organized system=== The self-organization observed in foraging territories is a microcosm for the self-organization seen in the entire colony. Spatial organization observed across social insect colonies can be considered an emergent property of a self-organized complex system. It is self-organized because there is no leader dictating where each individual will reside, nor which task an individual will perform once they get there. Instead, zones may be a by-product of division of labor, whereby individuals end up in a particular location for a period of time based on the task they perform, or dominance interactions, whereby dominant individuals are granted access to the most desirable places inside the nest. Spatial patterns exhibited by individuals of social insect colonies are not obvious, because it is difficult to observe and differentiate among individuals inside a nest cavity or flying across a foraging patch. However, when careful attention is given to the individual worker, the spatial organization of workers in the nest becomes apparent. ==See also== * Cellular automaton ==References== Category:Self-organization ","title":"Spatial organization"},{"id":"17297892","text":"First edition (publ. Diogenes) On Love and Death is an essay written by Patrick Süskind concerning the connection between \\"the two elemental forces of human existence.\\" ==Summary== Süskind begins by describing differing views of love, and then elaborates using a combination of personal anecdotes, brief biographies of historical figures such as Heinrich von Kleist, and mythological stories of love. The first example involves Süskind bearing witness to a couple having oral sex during a traffic jam. The second example centers around a dinner party attended by Süskind, during which a couple fawn over each other and ignore the rest of the dinner guests. The third example is an account of the German writer Thomas Mann and his infatuation with a young waiter named Franzl. Süskind then analyzes these examples in terms of Plato's philosophy. The first example is used to illustrate \\"animal love\\", the second used to illustrate \\"delusion\\" or \\"frenzy\\", and the third used to illustrate ideal, \\"Platonic love.\\" Süskind then proceeds to relate love and death. Kleist and Goethe occupy this section of the essays. Both Kleist and Goethe harbored suicidal thoughts stemming from their respective love lives. Süskind uses these stories as well as brief references to Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde to illustrate a central theme of the essays: an \\"erotic longing for death.\\" The final section of the essays is devoted to a comparison of two mythological accounts of love: the stories of Orpheus and Jesus Christ. Süskind likens the two figures to each other in that both ventured into the realm of death because of their love; however, Süskind is critical of Jesus for his almost political motives and his \\"distance and inhumanity\\", in the sense that he was completely immune to the frenzy of love. He praises Orpheus for his courage and selflessness. While Jesus could count on divine assistance, asserts Süskind, Orpheus ventured into Hades with only his prodigious skill as a musician and his desire to reclaim his beloved Eurydice. In addition, Süskind states that the story of Orpheus is more moving to readers because it is a story of failure. Whereas Jesus is \\"only a god\\", Orpheus is \\"a more complete human being.\\" ==Works referenced in the essays== *Phaedo *Symposium *Die Zauberflöte *Amphitryon *The Sorrows of Young Werther *Anna Karenina *Madame Bovary *Effi Briest *The Hour of our Death *Hymns to Night *Fleurs du Mal *Vollendung/Selige Sehnsucht *Das Tagebuch *Tristan und Isolde ==References== Süskind, Patrick On Love and Death, The Rookery Press, Tracy Carns Ltd.

Since the US Constitution is the supreme law of the land, all sentences in the US must conform to the requirements of the Constitution, which sets basic mandates while leaving the bulk of policy- making up to the states. Despite the continued growth of federal criminal law, the vast majority of criminal sentencing takes place in state and local courts. Except for death penalty cases (which are exceptionally rare), juries generally have little involvement in sentencing, which is typically left to the discretion of the presiding judge. Sentences are typically pronounced by the judge in a separate hearing, after the jury (or other finder of fact) has issued findings of fact and a guilty verdict, and in some cases after the probation department has carried out a pre-sentence investigation. The structure and jurisdiction of courts within a U.S. state are typically governed by state law, as are sentences and sentencing guidelines and regimes. There is enormous substantive and procedural difference between the criminal laws of the fifty states and the various federal territories and enclaves. Each state is very different from every other state in terms of sentencing, and even what acts are crimes: * Actions which might constitute a crime in one state would not necessarily constitute a crime in another state, or they might constitute a crime of a different severity. A 15-year-old and a 17-year-old having consensual sexual intercourse might constitute a crime in one state but not another. The possession of cannabis, certain types of firearms, or exotic animals might be serious crimes in some states but be perfectly legal in other states. A burglary might be completed only upon entry into a locked house in one state, but upon entry into an attached carport in another. * States have different schemes for dividing up crimes by severity and these categories might have similar names across states, but different practical effects. For example, a \\"2nd degree felony\\" in Florida is a category of crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison with no minimum while a \\"2nd degree felony\\" in Texas is a category of crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison, with a mandatory minimum of 2 years incarceration. * Many states have adopted sentencing guidelines which incorporate various factors into a single formula that may or may not constrain the judge's sentencing discretion. The general purpose of these schemes is to produce uniform and fair sentencing within a jurisdiction. However, since views about the correct approach to criminal justice vary from state to state, these statutory schemes vary enormously. * Many states have mandatory sentencing statutes which remove the judge's discretion under certain circumstances. Mandatory sentencing schemes typically require minimum periods of incarceration for certain serious crimes and for individuals who have serious criminal records. The state typically has discretion to pursue or waive mandatory sentencing. The content of these mandatory sentencing statutes and the procedures required to bring them into play are different in each state. * Some states have parole or early release from incarceration, while others do not. Many states have forms of punishment that are less severe than incarceration (such as probation, time in a halfway house, community service, or house arrest with electronic monitoring), but the exact form of these punishments, as well as which people can be sentenced under such alternatives, varies from state to state. Some prisoners are given life sentences. In some states, a life sentence means life, without the possibility of parole. In other states, people with life sentences are eligible for parole. In some cases, the death penalty may be applicable; however, since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Ring v. Arizona, a recommendation of the trial jury is required to impose a sentence of death. *However, as one can be sentenced to life without parole, another way to be sentenced for life in prison is a minimum number of years spent in jail depending on the life expectancy of the prisoner. Thus the prisoner will then spend the rest of his or her life in prison. The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines prescribe a reduction of sentence time for most defendants who accept responsibility and plead guilty; further discounts are available to some defendants through fact bargaining, substantial assistance, and so on. Federal court statistics from 2003 show that the average sentence given for offenses resolved by guilty plea was 54.7 months, while the average sentence for offenses resolved by trial was 153.7 months.Bureau of Justice Statistics, Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics 70, 75 tbl. 5.3 (2003). The practice of giving much harsher sentences when a defendant chooses to exercise the right to a trial by jury of his peers has been controversial, as is seen as a personal act of anger by the judge over \\"wasting court time.\\" ==Indeterminate sentencing== In some states, a judge will sentence criminals to an indeterminate amount of time in prison for certain crimes. This period is often between 1 and 3 years (on the short end) and 5–50 years on the upper end. The legislature generally sets a short, mandatory minimum sentence that an offender must spend in prison (e.g. one-third of the minimum sentence, or one-third of the high end of a sentence). The parole board then sets the actual date of prison release, as well as the rules that the parolee must follow when released. During a long sentence, an offender can take full advantage of the programs that the prison has, including rehab for drug abuse or alcohol abuse, anger management, mental health, and so on, so when the offender completes the rehab or program he may be released upon request from authorities with a lower risk of recidivism. This process tries to combat the tendency of prisoners leaving incarceration after a long sentence to go back to offending in short order, without any attempt at correcting their ways. ==Determinate sentencing== Those given short sentences usually serve the full- time (do \\"day-for-day\\") as imposed by the judge, or might receive time off for good behavior, based on state or local rules and regulations. In the mid-1970s, most state and federal prisons moved from long term to short term sentencing. Over time, though, state and federal authorities have gradually migrated their philosophies back toward long-term sentences. Many states use a mixture of the two; e.g., some offenders may receive sentences reduced by several months due to rehabilitation, counseling, and other programs, as well as good time. ==Trends in sentencing law== Since the 1840s, many jurisdictions, including the federal courts, have adopted a practice of having a probation officer prepare a presentence investigation report to inform the court as to the defendant's characteristics, including his criminal record, if any. In the 1970s, the length of incarceration had increased in response to the rising of crime rates in the United States. By the 1980s, state legislatures began to reduce judicial discretion in sentencing terms and conditions. This was especially true in cases of life imprisonment, which between 1992 and 2003 increased by 83% due to the implementation of three strikes laws. Short term sentencing, mandatory minimums, and guideline-based sentencing began to remove the human element from sentencing. They also required the judge to consider the severity of a crime in determining the length of an offender's sentence. ==Sentencing of killers== The United States does not have a specific guideline to sentencing murderers, including serial killers. When a killer is apprehended, he will be charged with murder, and if convicted can get life in prison or receive the death penalty, depending on in which state the murders took place. Generally speaking, each victim of a murder will merit a separate charge of murder against the offender, and as such, the killer could get a life sentence, a death sentence, or some other determinate or indeterminate sentence based upon the number of murders, the evidence presented, and any aggravating or mitigating circumstances present. Such a compounded sentence may be tailored to run consecutively, with one sentence beginning after completion of another, or concurrently, where all or most of several sentences is served together. Below are several examples of how a murderer may be sentenced, by state: ===Arizona=== In Arizona, a person is guilty of murder if an offender knowingly and intentionally causes the death of a person. The murder must be premeditated. If an individual is found guilty of murder, there are three possible sentences: 35 years to life, life without parole, or the death penalty. ===Florida=== In Florida, a person is guilty of first degree murder when it is perpetrated from a premeditated design to result in the death of a human being. Murder is categorized as a capital offense; if convicted, the offender will receive either the death penalty or life in prison without parole. A unanimous vote of a twelve-person jury, is required to sentence a person to death if they are convicted of capital murder. ===Hawaii=== In Hawaii, a person is found guilty of second degree murder when they intentionally and knowingly cause the death of another person. If the person intentionally or knowingly kills more than one person, or kills a law enforcement officer, a judge, or a prosecutor in the line of, or as a result of, their duties, a witness to a crime, or a defendant to a corroborated crime, or if he hires another party to kill a certain individual, the person has met the criteria to be charged with first degree murder. The State of Hawaii has no death penalty. If they are found guilty, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment without parole. ===Louisiana=== Louisiana states that homicide in the first degree is killing of a human being with intent. There are other specific circumstances that may contribute, such as killing a police officer or a firefighter. Either of these offenses, or the killing of more than one person, is an automatic first degree charge. Louisiana provides for life imprisonment without parole or the death penalty for murder. ===Massachusetts=== In Massachusetts, first degree murder is defined as killing a person with premeditated intent to kill. The only possible sentence for first degree murder is life in prison without parole as Massachusetts does not have the death penalty. Second-degree murder carries a mandatory life sentence in prison, but with the possibility of parole after 15 years, which is the standard minimum non-parole period in the state for second-degree murder and most other offenses. ===Michigan=== In Michigan, a person is found guilty of first degree murder when murder is perpetrated by means of poison, lying in wait, or any other willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing. In Michigan, first degree murder carries an automatic life sentence without parole. ===Nevada=== In Nevada, first degree murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, either expressed or implied. If a killer is found guilty with aggravating circumstances, such as killing someone via torture or killing a stranger with no apparent motive, they may receive either the death penalty or life without parole. ===Washington=== In the state of Washington, a person is found guilty of first degree murder when there is a premeditated intent to cause the death of another person. Murder in the first degree is a class A felony. If a person is convicted of first degree murder, he or she will receive a life sentence. If an aggravating circumstance exists in addition to first degree murder, the defendant can be charged with aggravated first-degree murder, which carries only two possible sentences: death or life without parole. Aggravating factors include the killing of a law enforcement officer, murder for hire, or murder committed during the course of kidnapping, rape, robbery, burglary, or arson, or for multiple murders. == Criminal Sentencing of Women == Throughout the history of the Criminal Justice System in the United States, women have been held responsible for only 20 percent of total crime. Despite only committing a small portion of crime, women in the United States remain overrepresented in the Criminal Justice System. The United States generates 30 percent of all incarcerated women in the world, despite only comprising five percent of the female population. As such, multiple studies have been conducted to analyze the differences in the crimes committed by men and women, as well as the sentencing of such offenders. Typically, women have been found to hold an advantage over men in sentencing; however, the degree of preferential treatment varies by the type of offense committed. In regard to property and drug offenses specifically, women are less likely than male offenders to receive a prison sentence. When female offenders do receive a prison sentence, research has found women receive shorter sentences than male offenders for the same offense. The level of preferential treatment shown to female offenders was lower when the offense was in violation of gender norms. Women who committed more \\"masculine crimes,\\" such as violent offenses or crimes against children, were not treated preferentially during sentencing. During his concurring opinion in Furman v. Georgia, Justice Thurgood Marshall stated, \\"There is also overwhelming evidence that the death penalty is employed against men and not women.\\":76 Within the scope of capital punishment, women are far less likely to receive a death sentence and even less likely to actually face execution. Between 1973 to 2012, women comprised only 2.1% of death sentences imposed at trial and merely 0.9% of persons executed. Women who are sentenced to death at trial are more likely to receive executive clemency than their male counterparts, despite their crime having more aggravating factors that may increase sentencing outcomes. In an attempt to explain the preferential treatment that is shown to female offenders in criminal sentencing, researchers have developed theories that concentrate on the differences between the treatment of each gender by society. A possible explanation for disproportionate sentencing is the chivalry thesis which states that gendered stereotypes influence sentencing outcomes as women are considered childlike, less threatening, less dangerous, and not responsible for their behaviors. This theory also maintains that men are traditionally inclined to minimize the suffering of women as a result of their paternalistic desire and this behavior has been incorporated into the justice system as it is a male-dominated field. Judges primarily explained sentencing differentials as a result of childcare responsibilities that would create a larger social cost if mothers were incarcerated, illustrating direct applications of the chivalry thesis. Others argue the disparity in sentencing is merely the result of human error as a result of the dynamics of judicial decision-making. The focal concerns theory reaffirms this belief as this theory states that the sentencing disparity is the result of a judge's inability to spend a large amount of time on a single case and the incomplete information given to them minimizes their ability to make an fully informed decision. As a result, judges may unknowingly rely on generalizations of personal biases to guide sentencing decisions. In an attempt to prevent preferential treatment to particular genders, races, ethnicities, or socio-economic classes, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines were enacted to create sentencing uniformity and equality. The enactment of these guidelines has since increased sentences given to women at trial; however, the disparity between male and female offenders persists as the internal biases influencing preferential sentencing have not been addressed. ==See also== *History of mandatory sentencing in the United States *History of United States Prison Systems *United States constitutional sentencing law *Federal Sentencing Guidelines *Taylor v.

At the beginning only girls were admitted, although the school accepted boys soon after. The first location of the school was in Piedras 55, in downtown Buenos Aires. The institution was later moved to the neighbourhood of Constitución, where children from many nationalities attended. The chapel moved to the streets of Belgrano and Perú where it still remains. In 1882, Scotsman Alexander Watson Hutton (considered the father of Argentine football), arrived to Buenos Aires after being hired by St. Andrew's as headmaster. Hutton encouraged the teaching of sports at the school, which conflicted with the position of the authorities of not considering sports as important as he did. Due to his disagreeing with the policies of the establishment, Hutton resigned one year later. After leaving St. Andrew's, Hutton founded his own institution, the Buenos Aires English High School, where he applied his ideas on the teaching of sports in Argentina.\\"Un poco de historia\\" – St. Andrew's official siteHistoria del Fútbol Amateur en la Argentina, by Jorge Iwanczuk.

His work on Proto-Basque focused mainly on between the 5th century BCE and the 1st century CE, just before and after initial contact with the Romans. The main method that he used was internal reconstruction since Basque has no known genetic relatives, preventing the use of the comparative method. By comparing variants of the same word in modern dialects and the changes that Latin loanwords had undergone, he deduced the ancestral forms and the rules for historical sound changes. His groundbreaking work, which culminated with the publication of his book Fonética histórica vasca (1961), was carried out mostly before the Aquitanian inscriptions were found, but they fully backed up Mitxelena's proposed Proto-Basque forms.Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 Since then, a number of other prominent linguists, such as Larry Trask, Alfonso Irigoien, Henri Gavel and most recently Joseba Lakarra, Joaquín Gorrotxategi and Ricardo Gómez, have made further contributions to the field. Some of them, such as Lakarra, have focused their attention on even older layers of the language (Pre-Proto- Basque) that preceded the Celtic invasion of Iberia. ==Vocabulary== Studying the behaviour of Latin and early Romance loanwords in Basque, Koldo Mitxelena discovered that Proto-Basque *n was lost between vowels and that Proto-Basque had no *m. Both changes are relatively unusual cross-linguistically, but /n/ was also partially deleted between vowels during the history of the nearby Gascon and Portuguese. {align=\\"center\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" !Proto-Basque !Modern Basque !English ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*ardano bgcolor=aliceblueardo bgcolor=honeydewwine ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*arrani bgcolor=alicebluearrain bgcolor=honeydewfish ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*bene bgcolor=alicebluemehe bgcolor=honeydewthin, slim ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*bini bgcolor=alicebluemihi bgcolor=honeydewtongue ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*egu-gaitz bgcolor=aliceblueekaitz bgcolor=honeydewstorm ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*eLana ~ *eNala bgcolor=aliceblueelai ~ enara bgcolor=honeydewbarn swallow ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*gaztana bgcolor=alicebluegazta bgcolor=honeydewcheese ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*ini bgcolor=aliceblueihi bgcolor=honeydewrush ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*organa bgcolor=aliceblueorga bgcolor=honeydewcart ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*sen-be bgcolor=aliceblueseme bgcolor=honeydewson ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*seni bgcolor=alicebluesehi bgcolor=honeydewservant ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*suni bgcolor=alicebluesuhi bgcolor=honeydewson-in-law ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*un-be bgcolor=aliceblueume bgcolor=honeydewyoung, baby ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*zani bgcolor=alicebluezain bgcolor=honeydewguard ----- bgcolor=whitesmoke*zini bgcolor=alicebluezii, zi bgcolor=honeydewacorn } One of the puzzles of Basque is the large number of words that begin with vowels in which the initial and second vowels are the same.

It is a follow-on development of air launches of experimental aircraft that began in the late 1940s. This method, when employed for orbital payload insertion, presents significant advantages over conventional vertical rocket launches, particularly because of the reduced mass, thrust and cost of the rocket. Air launching is also being developed for sub-orbital spaceflight. In 2004 the Ansari X Prize $10 Million purse was won by a team led by Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites, launching the SpaceShipOne from the purpose-built White Knight carrier aircraft. ==Advantages== The principal advantage of a rocket being launched by a high flying airplane is that it need not fly through the low, dense atmosphere, the drag of which requires a considerable amount of extra work and thus mass of propellant. Higher densities at lower altitudes result in larger drag forces acting on the vehicle. In addition, thrust is lost due to over-expansion of the exhaust at high ambient pressure and under-expansion at low ambient pressure; a fixed nozzle geometry cannot provide optimal exhaust expansion over the full range of ambient pressure, and represents a compromise solution. Rockets launched from high altitude can be optimized for lower ambient pressure, thus achieving greater thrust over the entire operating regime. Propellant is conserved because the air-breathing carrier aircraft lifts the rocket to altitude much more efficiently. Airplane engines do not require on-board storage of an oxidizer and they can use the surrounding air to produce thrust, for example with a turbofan. This allows the launch system to conserve a significant amount of mass that would otherwise be reserved for fuel, reducing the overall size. A larger fraction of the rocket mass can then include payload, reducing payload launch costs. It is also possible to make use of higher-impulse fuels precluded from surface launches due to their toxicity, such as those containing beryllium or fluorine. Air launch to orbit offers the potential for aircraft-like operations such as launch on demand, and is also less subject to launch-constraining weather. This allows the aircraft to fly around weather conditions as well as fly to better launch points, and to launch a payload into any orbital inclination at any time. Insurance costs are reduced as well, because launches occur well away from land, and there is no need for a launch pad or blockhouse. Air launch to orbit also works well as part of a combination launch system such as a reusable air-launched single stage to skyhook launch vehicle powered by a rocket or rocket/ramjet/scramjet engine. An additional benefit of air launch to orbit is a reduced delta V needed to achieve orbit. This results in a greater payload to fuel ratio which reduces the cost per unit mass to orbit. To further leverage the Delta V advantage, supersonic air launch to orbit has been proposed. ==Disadvantages== According to Aviation Week and Space Technology, air launch to orbit is limited by aircraft size. Additionally, airplanes may generate large lateral forces which could damage payloads.

He is the author of Bang!, a Wild West themed card game published by daVinci Editrice. == Biography== He has been fascinated by games since when he was 12 years old, and he wrote simple board games and word games for his schoolmates and relatives. In the same time he also showed interest in computers (years later he earned a degree in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome). In 1988 he published his first game: a shoot 'em up videogame for the Commodore 64 called Ciuffy (Systems Editoriale), created using the software SEUCK by Sensible Software. Starting from 1999 he wrote several reviews, games and articles for the magazine PowerKaos and the fanzine Un'Altra Cosa, along with a brief \\"Little Informal Dictionary of Computer Science\\" (Piccolo Dizionario Informale di Informatica). His topics included logic puzzles, original games and theoretic discussions about the meaning of the game and its role in the human society.Un'Altra Cosa no. 1-13, June 1999-April 2003, Novecentonovanta Before becoming a professional game designer, he acquired experience as freelance computer programmer and Privacy advisor for several companies in Italy. In 2000 he published Invader, a board game inspired by early 80s videogames like Space Invaders, on issues 69 and 70 of the magazine PowerKaos by Nexus Editrice. In 2002 he published with daVinci Editrice, which was born shortly before, the card game Bang!, created two years earlier. Sciarra decided to submit the game after the members of the local Chess Club (founded by Sciarra himself in 1998) were so addicted to the game that they preferred to play Bang! instead of Chess. The game was illustrated by Alessandro Pierangelini with Stefano De Fazi as Art Director: they were all born in Civitavecchia, too, as well as the daVinci Executive Director, Domenico Di Giorgio. Bang! hit the shelves in July 2002: without any marketing by daVinci, the game entirely sold the first run (2400 copies) in less than three months, instead of the three years estimated by the company. According to official figures by daVinci, the game sold more than 500,000 copies and is distributed in 14 countries over the world.Topics on the it.hobby.giochi newsgroup, which hosts many posts from Emiliano Sciarra. The 500,000 copies sold text is printed on the 4th Edition of the game box. In 2003 he won an Origins Award for Best Traditional Card Game; another Origins Award was assigned to Stefano De Fazi and Alessandro Pierangelini for Best Graphic Design of a Card Game or Expansion. The game won also in 2002 the Best of Show Award at the Lucca Comics and Games fair. He published several expansions for Bang!, including High Noon, Dodge City, Bang! - Face Off, and A Fistful of Cards. In 2010 he published the book L'Arte del Gioco (The art of play, Mursia) with an own definition of game suitable for game critic as well as the view of the game as a form of art.http://www.emilianosciarra.net/ENG/larte_del_gioco.html Apart from games, Emiliano Sciarra is also a skilled musician (he wrote the stage music for the local Live Pieces of Chess,Il Tempo, July 14, 1999 as well as stage music for shows and movies) and he also organizes and is invited to public speeches regarding traditional arts and sciences, videogames and ludology. == Publications == === Videogames=== * Ciuffy, Systems Editoriale (published on issue no. 19 of the magazine Software Club), 1988, for the Commodore 64. === Games === * Bang, daVinci Editrice, 2002.

The Telegarden was a fusion between old technology (agriculture) and new technology (the Internet). The notion of a physical garden that is operated by users online was appealing to Goldberg because \\"it was the most absurd\\". This new media art raised questions of legitimacy.

Constructed 1981–1982, the bridge was named in recognition of Akron's past All-America City Awards and is also locally known as the Y-Bridge. The bridge is 134 feet tall in its highest location. The bridge's predecessor, the 1922 North Hill Viaduct, was closed in 1977 after a long history of chunks of concrete falling from the bridge. The poem Under the Viaduct, 1932 from the Pulitzer Prize winning book of poems Thomas and Beulah by Rita Dove, referenced the North Hill Viaduct. Over its existence, the North Hill Viaduct had been the site of at least one suicide a year, though police records were not complete. At least two survived jumps in the 1930s. The replacement bridge has also been a magnet for suicides. From 1997 until December 3, 2009, 29 people committed suicide by jumping from the bridge. In 2009, it was announced that $1 million to $1.5 million would be spent to fence the bridge using federal economic stimulus funds. Fencing the bridge was controversial in Akron and the plan had previously failed to receive local support. Previous local attempts to fence the bridge failed in 1991, 1993, 2000 and 2006. The project was expected to be completed by September 2010 but was stopped for the winter of 2010–2011. The project was finally completed in late December 2011 at a total cost of around $8.7 million.

The Ganguts were the first class of Russian dreadnoughts. She was named after the Russian victory over Charles XII of Sweden in the Battle of Poltava in 1709. She was completed during the winter of 1914–1915, but was not ready for combat until mid-1915. Her role was to defend the mouth of the Gulf of Finland against the Germans, who never tried to enter, so she spent her time training and providing cover for mine laying operations. She was laid up in 1918 for lack of trained crew and suffered a devastating fire the following year that almost gutted her. Many proposals were made to reconstruct or modernize her in different ways for the next twenty years, but none were carried out. While all this was being discussed she served as source of spare parts for her sister ships and was used as a barracks ship. She was finally struck from the Navy List in 1940 and scrapping began at a very leisurely rate. She was intentionally grounded in late 1941 to prevent her from being sunk in some inconvenient location by the Germans. She was refloated in 1944 and scrapped beginning in 1949. ==Design and description== Plan view of the Gangut class Poltava was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of , more than designed. Her displacement was at load, over more than her designed displacement of .McLaughlin, p. 207 Poltavas machinery was built by the Franco-Russian Works. Ten Parsons steam turbines drove the four propellers. The engine rooms were located between turrets three and four in three transverse compartments. The outer compartments each had a high-pressure ahead and reverse turbine for each wing propeller shaft. The central engine room had two each low-pressure ahead and astern turbines as well as two cruising turbines driving the two centre shafts. The engines had a total designed output of , but they produced during Poltavas full-speed trials on 21 November 1915 and gave a top speed of . Twenty-five Yarrow boilers provided steam to the engines at a designed working pressure of . Each boiler was fitted with Thornycroft oil sprayers for mixed oil/coal burning. They were arranged in two groups. The forward group consisted of two boiler rooms in front of the second turret, the foremost of which had three boilers while the second one had six. The rear group was between the second and third turrets and comprised two compartments, each with eight boilers. At full load she carried of coal and of fuel oil and that provided her a range of at a speed of .McLaughlin, pp. 208, 224–25 The main armament of the Ganguts consisted of a dozen 52-caliber Obukhovskii Pattern 1907 guns mounted in four triple turrets distributed the length of the ship. The Russians did not believe that superfiring turrets offered any advantage, discounting the value of axial fire and believing that superfiring turrets could not fire while over the lower turret because of muzzle blast problems. They also believed that distributing the turrets, and their associated magazines, over the length of the ship improved the survivability of the ship. Sixteen 50-caliber Pattern 1905 guns were mounted in casemates as the secondary battery intended to defend the ship against torpedo boats. The ships were completed with only a single 30-caliber Lender anti-aircraft (AA) gun mounted on the quarterdeck. Other AA guns were probably added during the course of World War I, but details are lacking.McLaughlin, pp. 220–21 Conway's says that four were added to the roofs of the end turrets during the war.Gardiner & Gray, p. 303 Four submerged torpedo tubes were mounted with three torpedoes for each tube. ==Service== Outfitting of Poltava in the Admiralty Shipyard, 1912 Armored Coastal Battery-30, Sevastopol Poltava's turret as seen in Voroshilov Battery museum, Russky Island, Vladivostok Poltava was built by the Admiralty Shipyard at Saint Petersburg. She was laid down on 16 June 1909 and launched on 23 July 1911.McLaughlin, p. 227 At the end of October 1914 she was struck by her sister which jammed her kedge anchor, damaged her hull and delayed her trials to late November 1914. She entered service on 30 December 1914 when she reached Helsinki and was assigned to the First Battleship Brigade of the Baltic Fleet. However, gunnery and torpedo trials had to be postponed until mid-1915 because of the thick winter ice. She was the only ship of the class to perform a full-power speed trial, which she did in November 1915. She played a passive part in World War I as her role was to prevent the Germans from breaking into the Gulf of Finland, something the Germans never even tried. She ran aground in June 1916, but suffered little damage. Her crew participated in the February Revolution of 1917. She, and most of the Baltic Fleet, evacuated Helsingfors between 12 and 17 March 1918 despite the winter ice in the Gulf of Finland. Due to a shortage of crew she was placed into long-term conservation at Petrograd in October 1918. On 24 November 1919 a fire broke out in her forward boiler room and gutted much of her interior. She was henceforth used as a source of spare parts for her sisters. Along with the Izmail she was considered for conversion to an aircraft carrier in 1924 for service in the Black Sea, but this proved to be too ambitious and expensive given the state of the Soviet economy shortly after the end of the Russian Civil War. A more modest goal was to restore her to her original configuration and the Baltic Works actually began work in 1925, but exhausted the allotted funds on 15 February 1926 by which time she was estimated to be 46.5% complete. On 7 January 1926 she was given the name Frunze, after the recently deceased Bolshevik military leader Mikhail Frunze. Subsequent plans that focused on reconstructing her as a modernized equivalent to her sisters or even as a battlecruiser, with one turret deleted to save weight, were considered, but finally abandoned on 23 January 1935 when all work was stopped. In 1934 two of her turrets were sent to reinforce the Vladivostok Fortress fortifications on Russky Island. Kliment Voroshilov approved one last plan to turn her into a floating battery, but the Baltic Works had no capacity to spare and this project was cancelled on 9 July 1939. During this period she was used as a barracks hulk while she was stripped for parts, until she was formally discarded 1 December 1940, after scrapping had already begun at a leisurely pace.McLaughlin, pp. 227, 348–54 After the German invasion she was towed to Kronstadt and run aground late July 1941 near the Leningrad Sea Canal. During the Siege of Leningrad her hull was used as a base for small ships. She raised on 31 May 1944, towed to Leningrad and scrapped beginning in 1949.McLaughlin, p. 354 After World War II two turrets and their guns were used to rebuild Coast Defence Battery 30 (Maksim Gor'kii I) in Sevastopol. It remained in service with the Soviet Navy through 1997. With her two other turrets remaining in Vladivostok, on Russky Island, Poltava is sometimes jokingly called \\"the world's longest battleship\\" in Russia. ==Notes== ==Footnotes== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== * World Battleships List * Brief history plus photogallery Category:Gangut-class battleships Category:World War I battleships of Russia Category:1911 ships Category:Ships built at Admiralty Shipyard ","title":"Russian battleship Poltava (1911)"},{"id":"17298697","text":"n2n is an open source Layer 2 over Layer 3 VPN app utilising peer-to-peer architecture for network membership and routing.

North High School (not to be confused with Northland, which opened in 1965 and remains open) suffered the same fate as Central only 3 years before, closing in 1979. == Athletics == ===Ohio High School Athletic Association team state championships=== * Baseball – 1929 * Golf – 1937 * Track and Field – 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930 ==Notable alumni== *George Bellows, American realist painter, known for his depictions of urban life in New York City *Howard Cassady, Heisman Trophy winner of 1955 for the Ohio State University; professional football player for the Detroit Lions, Cleveland Browns and Philadelphia Eagles and baseball coach for the Columbus Clippers. *Harold Cooper, Franklin County Commissioner, President of the Columbus Jets and the International League *Fred Cornell, author of Carmen Ohio *Bob Kline, former MLB player (Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Athletics, Washington Senators) *Dave Roberts, Major League Baseball pitcher *Dom Sigillo, American football player *Mose Solomon, the \\"Rabbi of Swat,\\" Major League Baseball player *Ernie Wheelwright, American football player and actor == Closing == Because of declining enrollment in the school district and deterioration of the building, Central was closed following the 1981–1982 school year in June 1982 and never opened again. == Teachers (film) == After its closure, Central High School was used as a shooting location for scenes in the 1984 satirical dark comedy-drama film Teachers. The movie depicted a fictional school, \\"John F. Kennedy High School,\\" where, as a key element of the storyline, students received passing grades even though they couldn't read. Columbus Public Schools rented the building to the filmmakers, but did not review the script or know at the time how the fictional school in the movie would be depicted. Although the fictional school depicted in Teachers wasn't set in Columbus, CPS still took the storyline of the movie as a discredit to the school district. == COSI == Columbus Public Schools sold the building to the City of Columbus for $15 million in 1988. In July 1994, Columbus City Council granted COSI Columbus a 28-year lease on the building. COSI remodeled portions of it for the new site of a museum. Most of the front of the school remains facing the river. The new addition sits on what was the football field of the school. On November 6, 1999 COSI Columbus moved into the old Central High School building. ==References== Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Defunct schools in Ohio Category:High schools in Columbus, Ohio Category:Public high schools in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Columbus, Ohio Category:1862 establishments in Ohio Category:Columbus Register properties ","title":"Central High School (Columbus, Ohio)"},{"id":"17298800","text":"The 4th (Quetta) Division was an infantry division of the British Indian Army.

She also made some music recordings beginning in 1906. In 1910, she played the leading role of Selene in W. S. Gilbert's last opera, Fallen Fairies and sang at the Royal Opera House the same year and thereafter. She played Princess Helena in A Waltz Dream at Daly's Theatre in 1911. After Evans married Scottish baritone Fraser Gange in 1917, the two frequently performed together in concert and on tour, moving to the United States in 1923. In 1975, at age 91, Evans gave her last performance. Living to the age of 98, she was one of the last surviving cast members of a W. S. Gilbert production. ==Biography== The birthplace of Amy Evans is variously given as YnyshirAmy Evans at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website, accessed 12 May 2008 or nearby Tonypandy, Wales.\\"A Promising Soprano of Fifteen\\", The Musical Times, 1 September 1899, accessed 7 October 2009 While not of upper-class descent, Evans came from a home less humble than accounts of her ancestry often suggest. The usual description of her father, Thomas Vaughan Evans, as a coal miner, although not altogether inaccurate, somewhat understates his standing; he was an official in the Naval Colliery Company. Moreover, Amy was the product of a musical household in which singing was valued, as her mother, Leah, and her grandmother both were active and recognised as church singers. Besides general studies at her local board school, Evans had some early singing lessons with Ivor Foster. In 1896, she began vocal studies with David Lloyd, organist and choirmaster of St. Andrew's Church in Tonypandy and a recognised pianist in South Wales. In recognition of Evans's musical promise, local benefactors inaugurated a fund to further her musical education. In 1899, at age 14, Evans won the soprano prize at the Welsh National Eisteddfod in Cardiff, Wales for a performance of \\"Hear ye, Israel\\" from Mendelssohn's Elijah. Presenting her with the award was the celebrated Welsh tenor Ben Davies, who described her as \\"a great natural singer\\" and foretold a stellar future for her, assuming \\"proper training\\". ===Early career=== Evans began a concert career, and The Times wrote of one of her recitals, \\"Miss Evans's clear, high soprano voice was admirably suited\\" to the songs.\\"Concerts\\", The Times, 1 July 1907, p. 12 The soprano's scanty documented recording career began in 1906, when she made a few cylinders for Edison Bell and began a series of vertical cut discs for Pathé. The latter included the first roughly complete recording of Gilbert and Sullivan's opera The Yeomen of the Guard, in which she sang the roles of Elsie and Kate.1907 Russell Hunting Co. Pinafore and the 1907 Pathé Yeomen (G&S; Discography) , accessed 12 May 2008 This early Savoyard association would prove prophetic: on 3 January 1910, Evans replaced Nancy McIntosh in the leading role of Selene in W. S. Gilbert's unsuccessful last opera, Fallen Fairies, with music by Edward German,\\"Savoy Theatre – Miss Amy Evans now\\", The Times, 6 January 1910, p. 11 which Charles Workman's company had premiered on 15 December 1909 at the Savoy Theatre in London. Although Evans received favourable notices, McIntosh's dismissal provoked an acrimonious dispute among Gilbert, German, and Workman. Gilbert forbade Workman ever again to appear in one of his works in the United Kingdom, and neither Gilbert nor German would write another work for the musical stage.Morrison, Robert. \\"Fallen Fairies: The Controversy Surrounding Gilbert's Last Opera\\" (G&S; Archive) , accessed 12 May 2008 The Musical Times wrote: :\\"The part of 'Selene', the fairy queen, in the Gilbert-German opera 'Fallen Fairies' is now being played with great success by Miss Amy Evans, a young singer who has made a name on the concert and Eisteddfod platforms in Wales, but who is new to the stage. She sings a new song, the words of which are by Sir William Gilbert and the music by Edward German. This song has been the subject, first of an injunction, and then of a mysterious law suit brought by Sir William against the Savoy management. It is now restored to the performance by mutual consent.\\"The Musical Times, 1 February 1910, p. 117 The Times noted, \\"She has a delicate but beautiful voice. Her high notes, both fortissimo and pianissimo are of very pure quality.... As an actress, she has a good deal to learn [but] there is... a kind of gentle sincerity that fits the part well\\". After further concert appearances, she was next at the Royal Opera House in Siegfried in at the end of April 1910 playing Waldvogel.\\"Music. Royal Opera\\", The Times, 29 April 1910, p. 13 Also in 1910, Thomas Edison's National Phonograph Company issued the last documented commercial recordings by Evans, a group of four-minute cylinders. In 1911, Evans played Princess Helena opposite Lily Elsie in a revival of A Waltz Dream at Daly's Theatre.Information about postcard photo of Evans in A Waltz Dream (About Postcards), accessed 12 May 2008 Thereafter, she returned to her concert career, although she had brief associations with Covent Garden and the Philadelphia-Chicago Grand Opera Company in the years leading up to World War I.Fagan, P.

From that point forward, while Evans continued to sing solo engagements, such as her participation in the premiere of the Delius Requiem on 23 March 1922, she frequently performed together with her husband in concert, as when the couple undertook a 187-performance tour of Australia from March to December 1920 and a tour of the British provinces in 1921 and 1922. In 1922, Herman Klein from The Musical Times wrote, \\"Mrs. Amy Evans, Mr. Fraser Gange and Mr. Harold Samuel were heard together with the band of the Grenadier Guards under Lt G.F. Miller, at a charity concert at Queens Hall, and it is an opportunity to praise Miss Evans as one of the best of our sopranos. She allies sonorous tone with a ringing delivery and her voice is even throughout its range.\\" ===Later years=== Evans and Gange continued performing together after moving to the United States in 1923 and enjoyed success in major concert venues, such as Town Hall in New York City. Indeed, within four months of their arrival in New York, the couple on 5 March 1924 sang a public joint recital there at the Lotus Club.\\"Fraser Gange Career Chronology, U. S. Career, 1924–1932\\" (P. E. Fagan), accessed 12 May 2008 They again toured Australia and New Zealand during a six-month period in 1928. Around that time, Evans made her last, and only electric, recordings, none released, for Columbia Records. On 27 March 1932, Evans sang in Bach's Mass in B minor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Serge Koussevitzky, together with Gange, Margarete Matzenauer and Richard Crooks. This was Gange's last appearance with the orchestra, with which he had formed a regular association. Evans also pursued her solo career in the United States. For instance, on 9 March 1930, she was the first woman to sing at the Harvard Club of New York in New York. In 1949, Evans and Gange moved from New York to Baltimore, Maryland, where Gange, who by now had developed a successful academic career, taught full-time at the Peabody Conservatory. In 1975, a 91-year-old Evans gave her last documented performance, when she sang before the Welsh Women's Clubs of America, although by that time she was undoubtedly long retired.\\"Fraser Gange Career Chronology, Teaching 1932–1962\\" (P. E. Fagan), accessed 12 May 2008 When she died at age 98 in Baltimore, Evans was one of the last surviving cast members of a W. S.

She was the last surviving cast member who performed under the personal direction of Gilbert. See Stone, David. Ernestine Gauthier at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. ==Recordings== Few recordings of Evans are known, more than half being of duets or ensembles rather than solos. Aside from a small label's reissue of the Yeomen set described below, none has appeared on compact disc.Partial Evans discography, including details about catalogue and matrix numbers (P. E. Fagan), accessed 12 May 2008 The first Evans recordings were cylinders issued by Edison Bell as part of its Welsh series in 1906. The titles included the following: *Y Deryn Pur *R.S. Hughes: Llam y Cariadau *Joseph Parry: Hywel a Blodwen (duet with John Roberts) Evans and Lily Elsie in A Waltz Dream In the same year, and carrying on into 1907, Evans recorded six individual center-start disk record sides for Pathé. The only solo was \\"Angels Ever Bright and Fair\\" from Handel's Theodora. Another recording was the trio from Gounod's Faust with tenor Alfred Heather and baritone Bantock Pierpoint. The rest were duets with baritone Francis Ludlow: *Lionel Monckton: A Country Girl—\\"Boy and Girl\\" and The Cingalee—\\"You and I\\" *André Messager: Véronique—\\"The Donkey Duet\\" and \\"Swing Song\\" The second year of that association with Pathé included her participation as Elsie Maynard and Kate in the first nearly complete recording of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Yeomen of the Guard. Other cast members were Bantock Pierpoint, Ben Ivor, Francis Ludlow, and Emily Foxcroft; like Evans, all but Ivor assumed multiple roles.

Evans returned to the studio, and to cylinders, once more in 1910, when she recorded four solo numbers for Edison on four-minute cylinders: Thomas Moore's \\"The Last Rose of Summer\\", Guy d'Hardelot's \\"The Dawn\\", James Lyman Molloy's \\"The Kerry Dance\\", and Hermann Löhr's \\"I Wish I Were a Tiny Bird.\\" No further recording sessions involving Evans are known in the acoustic era, although at some unknown time she recorded at least one cylinder for Edison in the earlier two-minute format: \\"Within a Mile of Edinboro Town\\" by James Hook.Title information from Edison cylinder 13979 In August and November 1926 and January 1927, Evans made recordings for Columbia using the new electric recording technology. None of them saw release. According to Evans, the masters were destroyed when the truck in which they were travelling overturned, but in approximately 2001 a private collector found three test pressings from the series. In all her earlier recordings aside from the Yeomen set, her accompaniments, as was common practice at the time, would have been by anonymous studio musicians, but information on the labels may suggest the identity of her piano accompanist in the test pressings. Each is inscribed by hand with the name Bergh, probably a reference to Arthur Bergh, then an active studio accompanist for Columbia who accompanied Fraser Gange in some of his recordings.Information about recorded Evans songs, including information about Bergh (P.

On March 1, 1912, the Ohio General Assembly created the State Insurance Fund and in 1913, made coverage by employers mandatory. On April 28, 1913, Lemuel C.

It was revealed in early 2005, in part by a Toledo, Ohio, newspaper The Blade that the OBWC had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in high risk or unconventional investment vehicles run by people closely connected to the Ohio Republican Party who had made large campaign contributions to many senior Republican party officials. Most notably, a rare coin investment fund has attracted particular scrutiny after it was reported that two coins worth more than $300,000 had been lost. Further investigation then revealed that coins worth $10–$12 million were missing and that only $13 million of the original $50 million invested could be accounted for. Thomas Noe, a Republican Party fundraiser and activist was charged with running a criminal enterprise, the theft of $13 million from the fund, and of keeping a second set of books to cover for it. ===Private equity investments=== In the aftermath of the Coingate scandal, the OBWC determined to reduce its exposure to investments perceived as \\"alternative\\" or \\"high risk\\" which included an $400 million portfolio of over 60 private equity and venture capital investment funds. A sale of the portfolio was reported in 2007. However, as part of that sale process, OBWC engaged Ennis Knupp to conduct a thorough valuation of its alternative investment holdings. The Columbus Dispatch subsequently made a request under the Freedom of Information Act to receive the Ennis Knupp valuation report, which included confidential materials that the various private equity firms objected to OBWC disclosing. The various private equity firms settled a lawsuit with the Columbus Dispatch allowing a partial disclosure, however the generally secretive private equity industry followed the outcome closely.Ohio BWC to release investment info (Crain's Cleveland Business, 2005).MEMBER ALERT: OHIO AND CALIFORNIA FOIA ACTION(National Venture Capital Associatiation, 2006). ===Subsequent events=== In the years following the Coingate scandal, OBWC has replaced its senior management and investment teams and has been scrutinized heavily by the new Democratic administration in Ohio.

The report follows a decision from Judge Richard McMonagle of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas that the Ohio BWC violated two state statutes by charging the class excessive premiums. During the trial, the BWC conceded that the rates it charged non-group employers from 2001 to 2009 were excessive, according to case summary.

He supported Arsenal and coached the Fern Atron and Riley Tomkinson football ==Club career== ===Tottenham Hotspur=== Born in Forest Gate, England, Piercy started his career at Tottenham Hotspur and after progressing through the youth ranks and reserves, he was called up to the first team by Manager George Graham in 1999. Shortly after, Piercy made his Tottenham Hotspur debut on 13 October 1999, making his first start and played 74 minutes before substituted, in a 3–1 win over Crewe Alexandra. Three days later, on 16 October 1999, Piercy made his league debut for the club, coming on as a substitute in the second half for goalscorer Chris Armstrong, in a 1–0 win over Derby County. Piercy went on to make four appearances later in the 1999–00 season. While at the Tottenham Hotspur, Piercy appeared in England U18 and England U20. On 23 August 2002, however, Piercy was released by the club, with his first team opportunities were increasingly slim in recent years. ===Brighton & Hove Albion=== After leaving Tottenham Hotspur, Piercy joined Division One side Brighton & Hove Albion on 20 September 2002 after impressing the club's management at the trial and signed a one-year contract with them. Piercy was previously linked with the club before and was on the verge of joining in March, but fell through. Piercy made his Brighton & Hove Albion debut the next day (on 21 September 2002), where he played 78 minutes, in a 1–0 win over Rotherham United. However, in his next appearance against Ipswich Town in the League Cup, Piercy suffered a leg injury that kept him out for months. It wasn't until on 10 December 2002 when he made his return from the first team, coming on as a later substitute, in a 1–1 draw against Ipswich Town.

Piercy then scored a brace on 26 December 2003, in a 4–0 win over Wycombe Wanderers. However, injuries restricted his appearances much further Despite this, Piercy scored again later in the season: one in the league against Blackpool. Piercy then helped the club reach the play-offs and converted the penalty successfully to help the club win 5–4 in the penalty shoot-out and the club eventually promoted to the Championship next season after beating Bristol City 1–0 in the Second Division play-off final. At the end of the 2003–04 season, Piercy was offered a three-month contract by Manager Mark McGhee, explaining that: \\"they need change in attitude\\" to play in Division One. Despite the contract length, he signed a contract with them until October on 11 June 2004. The following season saw Piercy making two appearances: both on 3 November 2004 and 6 November 2004 against Derby County and Crewe Alexandra respectively. However, months at the club, Piercy announced his retirement at 25 on 9 November 2004 after a series of injuries plagued again.

The book was originally written in French and was translated into English and Persian as well as other languages, and was published posthumously in 1980. ==Themes== The book is Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's personal account of his reign and accomplishments, as well as his perspective on issues related to the Iranian Revolution and Western foreign policy toward Iran. He places some of the blame for the wrongdoings of the SAVAK as well as the failures of various democratic and social reforms (particularly through the White Revolution) upon Amir Abbas Hoveyda and his administration. In the book, the Shah wrote: \\"The lesson of the wickedness and immorality of international power-politics was burnt 'yes, very literally burnt' into my mind and heart. The main lesson I learnt was that when you are weak you have got to be very patient. You have got to accept humiliation. You have got to take the worst kind of insults. But in your inner heart you have got to love your country, have faith in its people and believe in their destiny as well as yours. If you do so, there is always a little ray of hope left which kindles in your conscience and inspires you to make the best of the worst possible circumstances and save whatever little you can of your land and its inheritance. That is the key to human survival amidst overwhelming difficulties.\\" ==Reactions== According to Ervand Abrahamian the book reads like the \\"ramblings of a paranoid\\". Abrahamian mentions some of Pahlavi's claims in support of his criticism of the book: > He claims [...] the British had \\"a hand\\" in the creation and growth of the > Tudeh Party. They had plotted with the Tudeh and the Fada'iyan-e Islam to > assassinate him in 1949, but had been forestalled then as well as at other > times by divine intervention. They had also secretly helped Mosadeq to \\"clip > his [royal] wings\\" and impede his ambitious modernization programs. \\"We > always suspected\\" he writes, \\"that [Mossadeq] was a British agent, a > suspicion his further posturing as an anti-British nationalist did not > diminish.\\" The British, together with the oil companies and \\"reactionary > clerics\\" had engineered the Islamic Revolution in retaliation for his > championing of OPEC and the Palestinian cause.

The novel is the fourth \\"Book of Ember\\" and was released on August 26, 2008. The fourth book picks up where The People of Sparks left off, during the Emberites' first winter above ground. Lina and Doon find a mysterious book that alludes to a mysterious device that was left outside Ember. An advance copy was given out to attendees of the San Diego Comic-Con 2008 who visited the Random House booth. == Plot == The story begins with the Builders discussing what the Emberites should do when they are released from the city. It is decided that a recent invention (which is later shown to be a diamond-like gadget) will be stored alongside a guide providing information regarding its use. However, these items are left undiscovered when the Emberites escape. Nine months after Ember and Sparks have reached a truce, a roamer comes into town with a mysterious book, on the front of which is printed \\"For the People of Ember\\". Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow obtain the book via barter but soon learn it contains only eight pages, as the trader used the rest to light campfires. Unable to make sense of the book's remaining contents, Lina and Doon decide to return to Ember to investigate. When they arrive, they discover that a family has taken over the darkened city. The Troggs — Washton, Kanza, Minny, Yorick and an adopted boy, Tim, whom they have named \\"Scawgo\\" — believe they own Ember and have renamed it Darkhold. They capture Doon, but he manages to communicate with Lina and she goes back to Sparks for help. Meanwhile, Lizzie Bisco (from Ember), Torren Crane and Kenny Parton (both from Sparks) attempt to locate Lina and Doon but don't succeed, prompting another, larger search party to go looking for them. While Doon is with the Troggs, they show him a diamond they found just outside Ember, but Scawgo gives Doon the diamond and Doon escapes. In the process, he also breaks the pipe connecting the generator to the waterwheel that created power for Ember, thereby stopping Ember's lights and cutting off the city's water supply for good, making it so the Trogg family will have to leave Ember since they relied on the intermittent power-supply to pipe water to them. When Doon finds Lina, a pack of hungry wolves is threatening her. Doon throws the diamond at the wolves to frighten them away, the diamond shatters and he twists his ankle in the process. Lina treats his wound and takes him to the place where the book and the diamond were discovered. There, they uncover shelves filled with hundreds upon hundreds of diamonds, and Lina and Doon realize that the devices are solar-powered sources of electricity. Ultimately, the people of Sparks and the former Emberites help them retrieve the diamonds and other items left behind in Ember, enough to ensure both groups will survive the coming winter. Before returning to the Earth's surface, Lina goes to collect the drawings of her \\"dream city\\" that she sketched at her former home in Ember, but she does not find them, so she then goes to City Hall and stands on top of the building as she did in the first book to say \\"Goodbye, Ember — forever.\\" Later, the Troggs arrive in Sparks and decide to settle there after learning why Ember was abandoned in the first place. Tim reveals that he found Doon's insect book and Lina's drawings and offers to give them back. Lizzie takes an interest in Tim Troggs (abandoning her earlier hope of becoming Doon's girlfriend), while Lina gets a horse named Fleet and becomes a messenger like she was in Ember. The last chapter reveals that Lina and Doon eventually fall in love and have children together. Many years later, after new cities have been built using solar power, one of their descendants views the now-fragile pictures drawn by Lina as a girl in Ember and notes how strongly they resemble a world she didn't live to see but nonetheless helped create. The story then goes back to the summer after the expedition to Ember and has the reader imagine Torren flying an airplane to find a spacecraft flying through space. == References == == External links == * Jeanne DuPrau's official website Category:2008 American novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:American young adult novels Category:The City of Ember Category:American post-apocalyptic novels Category:2008 science fiction novels Category:Sequel novels ","title":"The Diamond of Darkhold"},{"id":"17299267","text":"Coralli is a surname.

The building is seeking Gold LEED certification. The building became the headquarters of Morton Salt in December 2016. The anchor tenant is the law firm McDermott Will & Emery, which occupies of office space, and it moved in to River Point in March 2017. Mead Johnson also relocated its headquarters from suburban Glenview to the building. ==Location== The land on which this tower stands is known as River Point because it lies at the point where the North and South branches of the Chicago River form. It is between Canal Street and the Chicago River, and north of another skyscraper, 150 North Riverside, completed a few months later in 2017, which is also built on air rights over the railroad tracks leading into Union Station to the south of both properties. As required by the city of Chicago, the building also includes a public park and a landscaped riverwalk that is open to the public. To accommodate the land required for the public park and river walk it is built over a set of active railroad tracks. ==Reception== The building's design reflects its location well, where the two branches of the Chicago River begin, with critic Blair Kamin noting \\"its exuberant curves\\" and how it reflects the river, like the impressive building across the river from it, 333 Wacker Drive. It was the first new downtown skyscraper to open in seven years, due to the Great Recession. Kamin points out how the structure of this building is affected by the once-surface railroad tracks and the CTA Blue Line subway tunnel running beneath it, requiring a tilt in some support columns. That tilt results in \\"the building's most distinctive feature: the tall parabolic arch at its base\\". Kamin concludes that the site demanded, and this building delivered \\"a memorable statement\\". ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in Chicago ==References== ==External links== *Skyscraperpage *Hines *Chicago River Point Category:Skyscrapers in Chicago Category:Office buildings completed in 2017 Category:Hines Interests Limited Partnership ","title":"River Point"},{"id":"17299433","text":"Hafsa Sultan (; 1478 – March 1534) was the wife of Selim I and the first valide sultan of the Ottoman Empire as the mother of Suleiman the Magnificent. During the period between her son's enthronement in 1520 and her death in 1534, she was one of the most influential persons in the Ottoman Empire.Pietro Bragadin, Venetian Republic's ambassador in the early years of Suleiman the Magnificent's reign notes \\"a very beautiful woman of 48, for whom the sultan bears great reverence and love...\\" ==Origins== The traditional view holding that Hafsa Sultan was the daughter of Meñli I Giray (1445–1515), the khan of the Crimean Tatars for much of the period between 1466 and 1515, resting on seventeenth century western authors accounts, has been challenged in favor of a Christian slave origin based on Ottoman documentary evidence.Encyclopedia of Islam vol. IX (1997), s.v. Suleyman p.833 Several historians still follow the traditional view though, including Brian Glyn Williams. Reşat Kasaba mentions the marriage between Selim I and Hafsa Sultan as the \\"last marriage between an Ottoman sultan and a member of a neighboring Muslim royal family\\". Esin Atıl, however, states that whilst some historians state that she was the daughter of Giray, others have mentioned that the Crimean princess named \\"Ayse\\" was another one of Selim I's wives and that \\"Hafsa\\" may have been of slave origin. Ilya Zaytsev claims that \\"Ayshe (daughter of Mengli-Giray I)\\" first married Şehzade Mehmed, the governor of Kefe, and that she later married his brother Selim I; consequently, her marriage into the Ottoman dynasty was one of two noted instances of wedlock between the Girays and the Ottomans (the other being the marriage of Selim I's daughter to Saadet-Giray). Alan W. Fisher, Leslie Peirce, and Feridun Emecen all see Hafsa as of slave origin and not the daughter of the Crimean Khan. * * * ==Life== The külliye built on the orders of Hafsa Sultan in Manisa. It is part of the adjoining Sultan Mosque Having resided in the city of Manisa in western Turkey with her son, Suleiman, who administered the surrounding region between 1513 and 1520 (the town functioned as one of the traditional residences for Ottoman crown princes (şehzade) in apprenticeship for future power), Hafsa Sultan initiated the Manisa's \\"Mesir Festival\\", a local tradition continued today. She also had a large complex built in the city consisting of a mosque known as the Sultan Mosque, a primary school, a college, and a hospice. She was also the first Ottoman imperial women who held title \\"sultan\\" after her given name, replacing title \\"hatun\\". This usage reflected the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as \\"family prerogative\\". Consequently, the title valide hatun (title for living mother of the reigning Ottoman sultan before 16th century) also turned into valide sultan, making Hafsa the first valide sultan. Her era signalled the shifting status of the sultan's mother and her increased share in power. She was also the first harem woman confirmed to have a kira - Strongilah.

The mausoleum was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 1884, a reconstruction effort started in the 1900s (decade) having been left discontinued, and her tomb today is much simpler than it was built originally. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1534 deaths Category:Valide sultan Category:Queen mothers Category:Wives of Ottoman Sultans Category:15th-century people of the Ottoman Empire Category:16th-century Ottoman royalty Category:Suleiman the Magnificent ","title":"Hafsa Sultan"},{"id":"17299452","text":"Susannah Breslin is a journalist and writer.

It follows the May–December romance between a vivacious young coed and a middle- aged professional who is unhappy in his marriage. New Line Cinema gave the film a limited theatrical release in the United States on 21 December 1979. The film was scheduled for release by Cult Epics in May 2015 on DVD and Blu- ray. ==Plot== While in Florence on business, Roman landscape architect Giulio Marengo meets an alluring college student, Francesca, and spends the night with her. She is the foster daughter of an agriculturist named Bartolo who has looked after her since the death of her mother, Flora. Later, a friend of Giulio's sees Francesca in a restaurant and implies that she might be Giulio's daughter. It is a possibility since Giulio had been going out with Flora the year before Francesca was born. Shocked by the idea, Giulio tries to cool his relationship with Francesca. Meanwhile, he is distracted by the revelation that his unmarried daughter Alexandra, who is about the same age as Francesca, is pregnant. Giulio tries unsuccessfully to get to the truth of his alleged paternity, and finally decides to tell Francesca the reason for his conflicting behavior. She flatly dismisses the insinuation, however, saying she regards Bartolo as her only true father. She then accompanies Giulio on an uninhibited holiday in Madrid, where Alexandra has gone to try to sort things out with her lover. Upon returning to Florence, Giulio must get back to Rome to attend to his business affairs, but that night, Francesca insists they see the movie Vampyr together, and he falls asleep. Upon waking up, she is nowhere to be seen, indicating that their love affair has run its course. ==Cast== * Marcello Mastroianni as Giulio Marengo * Nastassja Kinski as Francesca * Francisco Rabal as Lorenzo * Mónica Randall as Luisa Marengo * Ania Pieroni as Cecilia * Barbara De Rossi as Alexandra Marengo * José María Caffarel as Bartolo * Giuliana Calandra as Teresa * Maria Pia Attanasio as Countess Archi * Raimondo Penne as Notary * Claudio Aliotti * Massimo Bonetti as the Horse Trainer * Mario Cecchi as the Gardener * Adriana Falco as Giulio's secretary * Rodolfo Bigotti ==Production== Director Alberto Lattuada shot scenes for the film at various locations in and around Florence, including the Piazza San Giovanni, the Piazza San Marco, and the Boboli Gardens. The opening title sequence was shot on the grounds of Villa La Pietra. The musical score was composed by Ennio Morricone, who previously collaborated with the director on Matchless. A soundtrack album was released in 1978 by Cinevox, and again on 14 July 1995 by Prometheus Records. The soundtrack is notable for its inclusion of the love theme \\"Amore per Amore\\", as well as the two disco tracks \\"Dance On\\" and \\"Spazio 1999\\". ==Reception== This film received positive reviews, especially for Nastassja Kinski's performance. According to the American poster for this film, Bruce Williamson of Playboy called it \\"A truly sexy film\\". Time magazine also praised Kinski's performance saying, \\"Kinski is simply ravishing, genuinely sexy and high-spirited without being painfully aggressive about it.\\" Conversely, Janet Maslin of The New York Times called the film \\"dangerously smarmy at times—dangerous because its cheapness undermines Mr. Mastroianni's essentially serious performance, which is the backbone of the movie. The film works best when the story seems to generate its sexual encounters spontaneously. But there are too many times when the plot looks like a pretext for stringing together amorous interludes.\\" Because Kinski was just 17 years old at the time, her many nude scenes created controversy. She has since disapproved of the nudity in the film on a number of occasions. Recalling the film in a 1981 interview with People, Kinski said, \\"There was no one prepared to say, 'She shouldn't do that. There is no point.' No one to protect me. I was just a young girl, in Italy. It was stupid.\\" In 2001, Kinski reiterated her dissatisfaction with her performance: \\"Let's put it this way, if that was my daughter, I wouldn't allow that. I wouldn't allow certain people to say certain things or to try certain things.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:1970s romantic drama films Category:1978 films Category:1970s erotic drama films Category:Erotic romance films Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone Category:Films directed by Alberto Lattuada Category:Films set in Florence Category:Incest in film Category:Italian romantic drama films Category:Italian erotic drama films Category:Italian films Category:Italian-language films Category:Spanish romantic drama films Category:Spanish erotic drama films Category:Spanish films Category:1978 drama films ","title":"Stay as You Are"},{"id":"17299478","text":"Indeterminacy in literature is a situation in which components of a text require the reader to make their own decisions about the text's meaning. (Baldick 2008) This can occur if the text's ending does not provide full closure and there are still questions to be answered, or when \\"the language is such that the author’s original intention is not known\\". Baldick further describes the concept as \\"a principle of uncertainty invoked to deny the existence of any final or determinate meaning that could bring to an end the play of meaning between the elements of a text\\". Therefore, indeterminacy is the belief that it is not possible to decide entirely what a word means when used in a certain circumstance, so the meaning of the whole text must remain open to interpretation. ==Indeterminacy is not ambiguity== In literature, indeterminacy is sometimes confused with the idea of ambiguity, as the two are very alike. However, as opposed to ambiguity, indeterminacy is \\"applied by its practitioners not only to literature but also to the interpretation of texts\\". (Encyclopædia Britannica 2011, p. 1 of 1) Nevertheless, the presence of indeterminacy does not mean that decisions about meaning cannot be made at all, but only that there will be no final official judgement or approval on any individual interpretation. (Baldick 2008) Furthermore, the presence of indeterminacy does not result in all interpretations being of equal legitimacy; instead it indicates that all meanings drawn from an indeterminate text are \\"partial and provisional, and that what we write about it itself as a text, is open to further interpretation\\". ==Indeterminacy and the reader's imagination== A slightly different approach to indeterminacy is the idea that the reader's \\"concretization is left to a large extent to... imagination\\". (Stanzel 1988, p. 116) This becomes clear when comparing narrative fiction; which is commonly indeterminate, to film; the very nature of which often precludes indeterminacy. Stanzel quotes John Fowles in regards to the indeterminacy of narrative as an advantage. \\"There are hundreds of things a novel can do that a cinema can never do. The cinema can’t digress, above all it can’t exclude... you’ve got to have a certain chair, certain clothes, certain decor. In a novel... you don’t have to “set up” the whole screen. The delight of writing novels is what you can leave out on each page, in each sentence\\". Furthermore, McHale (1992, p. 36) highlights the \\"partial indeterminacy, the 'gappiness' of fictional objects, including fictional characters\\", by pointing out that no depiction of a fictional character or object could ever be as absolute as what actual human beings consider themselves and their objects to be. \\"It is always as if a beam of light were illuminating a part of a region, the remainder of which disappears in an indeterminate cloud\\". (McHale 1992, p. 36) ==Deconstruction theory== This literary meaning of indeterminacy is often associated with deconstruction, the post-structuralist theory propounded by Jacques Derrida, and is best described as \\"a philosophically sceptical approach to the possibility of coherent meaning in language\\". (Baldick 2008, p. 1 of 1) However, Royle (1995, p. 46) quotes Derrida as saying \\"I do not believe I have ever spoken of 'indeterminacy', whether in regard to 'meaning' or anything else... deconstruction should never lead either to relativism or to any sort of indeterminism\\". ==Indeterminacy theory== According to indeterminacy theory, all texts can have the \\"multiplicity of possible interpretations of given textual elements, because the author’s meaning or intent may be unclear, or distorted by pop culture\\". So, indeterminacy is not always purposeful. However, while some indeterminacy in literary fiction is permanent; the gap will never be filled or closed; other areas of indeterminacy are temporary, and deliberately planted by the author with the intention of leaving a gap that the reader themself can fill, by the \\"process of realizing or concretising the text\\".

It was on the mainland, west of Manteo near present-day Manns Harbor. The marshy land where Buffalo City once stood, near U.S. 64, is now part of the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge. The town's history lasted approximately 80 years from the 1870s to 1950s, but at one time Buffalo City's population of 3,000 in the early 20th century made it the largest community in Dare County. A hotel, post office, schoolhouse, general store, of railroad track and rows of homes once stood on the now-abandoned area. Today, the only remnants of the ghost town include a road sign, rusted rails and building debris now overgrown with weeds. ==History== ===Founding and logging industry=== Founded shortly after the Civil War by the Buffalo Timber Company, Buffalo City was constructed on the north side of Milltail Creek by African-American laborers and more than 200 Russian immigrants. Many of these immigrants stayed and worked at the new logging town and composed half of the town’s population. The area surrounding Milltail Creek was harvested for juniper, cypress, and pine trees and became the largest logging operation in Northeastern North Carolina. Lumbers were paid 50 cents each day, although money was in the form of company-made aluminum pieces that were only good in Buffalo City. All purchases at the general store were made with this money. Given the locale's status as a company town, Buffalo City was never formally incorporated and had no formal law enforcement. Such authority as there was came from the timber company officials in their roles as officers in the corporation owning the private property upon which the town stood. Sawmill in Buffalo City, North Carolina, c. 1909 On October 11, 1889, the first post office was opened in Buffalo City. According to National Archive records, Charles A. Whallou delivered the mail to citizens of the town. Over the next decade, the forests surrounding Buffalo City were heavily depleted. The Buffalo Timber Company closed their operations and the post office was shut down in 1903. In 1907, the Dare Company purchased the forest and resumed logging operations. The post office was reopened on February 29, 1908. The town’s name was changed to Daresville, although the post office and citizens still used the Buffalo City title. The town's logging industry prospered throughout the 1910s and early 1920s. There were approximately of railroad tracks built throughout the logging area. Mules carried felled trees from lumber camps to the nearest railroad track. Freight cars then carried the wood to a transfer station at Milltail Creek and the barges took the lumber to sawmills in Elizabeth City. ===Moonshine industry and town’s decline=== In 1920, Prohibition laws were passed in the United States and moonshine became a popular way for Buffalo City citizens to make extra money. When logging camps at Buffalo City began to close in the 1920s, moonshine became the primary revenue source for citizens. Almost every family in Buffalo City operated a still. Speakeasies throughout the eastern United States sold moonshine made in Buffalo City. The liquor was made deep in the woods and transported by the same methods as logging: by mules and boats. A 30-foot (9.1 m) boat named the Hattie Creef sailed down Milltail Creek and across the Albemarle Sound to Elizabeth City, where the liquor was sold. The boat returned with large amounts of sugar, an ingredient in making moonshine. Federal prohibition enforcers, called \\"revenuers\\", began to crack down on Buffalo City’s moonshine industry. Several men in the town were sentenced to jail. When prohibition ended in 1933, Buffalo City’s economy was severely affected. With the loss of moonshine revenue, citizens began focusing on the logging industry once again. Most good timber had already been felled, but the sawmill continued to operate for the next two decades. Outbreaks of cholera, typhoid, smallpox and the flu swept throughout the community in the 1940s. The combination of these diseases and lack of work resulted in Buffalo City’s population declining to 100 people. The sawmill closed in the early 1950s and the town was abandoned. The Richmond Cedar Works company bought the surrounding land, but eventually sold it to Prulean Farms, a subsidiary of Prudential Financial. During the 1970s, Prulean Farms ran an agricultural operation on the land surrounding the abandoned town. In 1984, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service acquired the land and formed the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, a haven for black bears and the endangered red wolf. ==Town layout== Loggers and train in Buffalo City Buffalo City centered around its main street, Buffalo City Road, a 10-foot (3 m) dirt road that stretched from East Lake to Milltail Creek. Three roads, approximately 150 ft (46 m) in length, ran perpendicular to the main street and a fourth curved around the north side of the town. Because of the soft ground on which the town was constructed, the streets were covered with sheets of wood and sawdust to prevent citizens' sinking into the mud. The buildings were constructed of wood that could not be sold by the lumber company. Homes were painted either red or white. Red homes were occupied by white workers and homes painted white were used for blacks and immigrants. A railroad track was constructed on Buffalo City Road that brought the lumber from logging camps deep in the forest. Buffalo City did not have a police station or elected officials, and so a stockade was built in the center of town. ==See also== * History of North Carolina * List of ghost towns in the United States ==References== ==Further reading== * Logs & Moonshine: Tales of Buffalo City, NC, by Suzanne Tate, Nags Head Art Inc., 2000, ==External links== * WRAL report on Buffalo City Category:Ghost towns in North Carolina Category:Logging communities in the United States Category:Populated places established in the 1870s Category:Populated places disestablished in the 1950s Category:Prohibition in the United States Category:Unincorporated communities in Dare County, North Carolina Category:Unincorporated communities in North Carolina ","title":"Buffalo City, North Carolina"},{"id":"17299574","text":"Leandro Remondini (; 17 November 1917 – 9 January 1979) was an Italian association football player and manager, who played as a midfielder or as a defender. ==Club career== Born in Verona, Remondini was a defensive midfielder, who capable of covering any midfield role for his teams and who could also play as a full-back.

He was the son of botanist Georg Engelmann (1809-1884). In 1867 Engelmann graduated from Washington University in St. Louis, and from 1867 until 1873, he studied medicine in Europe (Berlin, Tübingen, Vienna and Paris). In Tübingen he studied under Felix von Niemeyer (1820-1871) and Victor von Bruns (1812-1883), and in Berlin he had as instructors: Bernhard von Langenbeck (1810-1887), Rudolf Virchow (1821-1903) and Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs (1819-1885). During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), he participated as a volunteer surgeon. In 1873 he returned to St. Louis, subsequently becoming a professor of gynecology at the St. Louis Post-Graduate School of Medicine. Here he attained the chair of diseases of women and operative midwifery. Engelmann was a founding member of the American Gynecological Society. In 1895 he relocated to Boston, and later died in Nashua, New Hampshire on November 16, 1903. Among his written works was an 1882 treatise on the birthing practices of indigenous and primitive people titled Labor among primitive peoples. The treatise publicised the childbirth positions amongst primitive cultures to the Western world. They frequently use squatting, standing, kneeling and all fours positions, often in a sequence.Engelmann, G.

The compound has the formula P(C6H4SO3Na)3. This white microcrystalline solid is an unusual example of a water-soluble phosphine. Its complex with rhodium is used in the industrial production of butyraldehyde. ==Synthesis== Tppts is synthesized by sulfonation of triphenylphosphine. The sulfonation occurs at one meta-position of each of the three phenyl rings. The sulfonation agent is oleum, a solution of sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid. The resulting trisulfonic acid is then treated with triisooctylamine and sodium hydroxide. Immediately upon dissolving in the reaction medium, the phosphine is protonated. It is the phosphonium salt that undergoes the sulfonation: :HP(C6H5)3+ \\\\+ 3 SO3 → [HP(C6H4SO3H)3]+ :[HP(C6H4SO3H)3]+ \\\\+ 4 N(C8H17)3 → [HN(C8H17)3]3[P(C6H4SO3)3] + [HN(C8H17)3]+ :[HN(C8H17)3]3[P(C6H4SO3)3] + 3 NaOH → P(C6H4SO3Na)3 \\\\+ 3 N(C8H17)3 \\\\+ 3 H2O As a Lewis base, tppts is stronger than triphenylphosphine. ==Uses in hydroformylation== Complexes of tppts are very soluble in water, which is the basis of its industrial application. Tppts-based rhodium catalysts were introduced in 1984 for a two-phase hydroformylation of propene by Ruhrchemie. Hydroformylation, also known as oxo synthesis, is the reaction of an alkene with carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Traditionally, hydroformylation is catalyzed by rhodium and cobalt complexes in nonaqueous solution.Boy Cornils, Richard W.

Since 1999, the school has been located on Tester Road. Formerly, it was located on Main Street in downtown Monroe. ==Mascot== Monroe High School's mascot is \\"Benny the Bearcat\\". The term \\"Bearcat\\" was originally the nickname of the amateur turned semiprofessional boxer. Dode \\"Bearcat\\" Bercot. In the 1920s and 30s, this boxer from Monroe fought in over 100 main event fights and won 42 by knockout. However, before turning pro, Bercot's career was cut short after an opponent put a thumb in Bercot's eye, leaving him partially blinded for life. He was given the nickname \\"Bearcat\\" because he was said to be strong as a bear and fast as a cat. The school colors are orange and black. ==Activities== The school boasts a wide variety of extracurricular activities. Students participate in everything from academic quiz competitions to leadership and community service organizations. Examples of these are the academic quiz competition teams, Hi-Q and Knowledge Bowl, and the community service-based Key Club. Monroe High Schools' Hi-Q team is a perennial powerhouse and in recent years has consistently made the semifinal and/or final round of the state competition. In 2011, Monroe's Hi-Q team won the Washington State Championship and participated in the National Championship. The most well- known and largest club at Monroe is DECA. The Monroe High School DECA Chapter was the third largest DECA chapter in the United States during the 1990s. DECA is a national marketing club and Monroe sends multiple students to the Washington State (SCDC) and National (ICDC) competitions every year. Monroe DECA has also proven to be a large part of the high school's community service efforts, having helped fund and maintain the Monroe Miracle League Field. Each year, Monroe DECA students serve as base-buddies for the players in the Miracle League games. The band program at the school has flourished under the direction of Ms. Lisa Ray. Ms. Ray conducts the Jazz Band, the Percussion Ensemble, the Concert Band, the Symphonic Band, and the Wind Ensemble. The Pep Band is known as a vital part of all the varsity home football games and both girls' and boys' home basketball games. Recently, the Pep Band received a 'Best in Category' for their participation in a parade in Leavenworth. The other bands are highly decorated, having received golds and silvers in the recent Heritage festivals, as well as the 'Spirit of Anaheim' and 'Spirit of Seattle' awards for exemplary behavior and attitude at the festivals. Student athletics have always been a large part of the Monroe High School culture, with many of the school's championship wins occurring in the 1980s and 90s. The school entered a lull in the late 1990s and most of the 2000s. During those years, track and field (under Coach David Brekke) and wrestling were the school's most consistent programs, sending between two and five competitors to state competitions each year. However, various sports teams have begun to strengthen their respective programs and Monroe is slowly returning to winning form. Of particular note are the boys' and girls' basketball, girls' volleyball, girls' softball, and boys' football teams.

The circus was originally a one- ring affair, but by 1925 it had grown to three rings. Despite now traveling to many cities, the Detroit affair is still the largest. In 1996, it ran for 17 days with 40 performances making it not only the oldest Shrine Circus, but also the most attended. The most famous venue to host the circus is the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California, where the Southern California Shrine Circus takes place. By the 1920s Shrine Circuses were being conducted throughout the country, and each year additional Shrine Centers introduced circuses to their communities. The first Shrine Circus each year is usually in Flint, Michigan, each January. The circus then travels to at least one city per week through November. The last performances are usually being held Thanksgiving week in Evansville, Indiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana.

The Black Sheep is the title of the English translation by Donald Adamson published by Penguin Classics. It tells the story of the Bridau family, trying to regain their lost inheritance after a series of mishaps. Though for years an overlooked work in Balzac's canon, it has gained popularity and respect in recent years. The Guardian listed The Black Sheep 12 on its list of the 100 Greatest Novels of All Time. ==Plot summary== The action of the novel is divided between Paris and Issoudun. Agathe Rouget, who was born in Issoudun, was sent by her father, Doctor Rouget to be raised by her maternal relatives, the Descoings in Paris. Doctor Rouget suspects (wrongly) that he is not her true father. In Paris, she marries a man named Bridau, and they have two sons, Philippe, and Joseph. Monsieur Bridau dies relatively young, Philippe, who is the eldest and his mother's favourite, becomes a soldier in Napoleon's armies, and Joseph becomes an artist. Philippe, the elder son is shown to be a courageous soldier, but is also a heavy drinker and gambler. He resigns from the army after the Bourbon Restoration out of loyalty to Napoleon. Joseph is a dedicated artist, and the more loyal son, but his mother does not understand his artistic vocation. After leaving the army Philippe took part in the failed Champ d'Asile settlement in Texas. On returning to France he is unemployed, and lives with his mother and Madame Descoings, and becomes a financial drain on them, especially due to his hard drinking and gambling lifestyle. Philippe becomes estranged from his mother and brother after stealing money from Madame Descoings. Philippe is soon afterwards arrested for his involvement in an anti-government conspiracy. Meanwhile, in Issoudun, Agathe's elder brother Jean-Jacques takes in an ex-soldier named Max Gilet as a boarder. Max is suspected of being his illegitimate half brother. Max and Jean-Jacques' servant Flore Brazier work together to control Jean-Jacques. Max leads a group of young men who call themselves \\"The Knights of Idleness\\" who frequently play practical jokes around the town. Two of these are against a Spanish immigrant named Fario, destroying his cart and his grain, and therefore ruining his business. It is now that Joseph and his mother travel to Issoudun to try to persuade Jean-Jacques to give Agathe money to help cover Philippe's legal costs. They stay with their friends the Hochons. Jean-Jacques and Max only give them some old paintings, but only Joseph recognises their value. Joseph tells of his luck to the Hochons, not realising that their grandsons are friends of Max. Afterwards when Max discovers the value of the paintings he coerces Joseph into returning them. Then one night whilst Max is out walking, he is stabbed by Fario. As Max is recovering he decides to blame Joseph for the stabbing. Joseph is arrested, but later cleared and released, and he and his mother return to Paris. In the meantime, Philippe has been convicted for his plotting. However, he cooperates with authorities and gets a light sentence of five years Police supervision in Autun. Philippe gets his lawyer to change the location to Issoudun in order to claim his mother's inheritance for himself. He challenges Max to a duel with swords, and kills him in the duel. He then takes control of Jean-Jacques and his household, forcing Flore to become Jean-Jacques' wife. Philippe marries Flore after the death of Jean- Jacques. Flore dies soon afterwards. The book hints that both of these deaths are arranged by Philippe but is not explicit about the means. Through his connexions, Philippe has now obtained the title Comte de Brambourg. Philippe's attempted marriage to a rich man's daughter falls through when his friends disclose his past to her father. An attempt by Joseph to reconcile Philippe and their mother before her death fails. Philippe's fortunes take a turn for the worse after some unsuccessful speculation, and he rejoins the army to take part in the war in Algeria where he is killed in action, so that in the end Joseph, now a successful artist, inherits the family fortune. ==Explanation of title== \\"La Rabouilleuse\\" is the nickname of Flore Brazier used behind her back by the people of Issoudun. Max takes offence when some of his friends use it in conversation. Adamson translates the term as \\"the Fisherwoman\\". The nickname is a reference to the job that she did as a young girl when helping her uncle to fish for crayfish, by stirring up (to \\"rabouiller\\") the streamlets. This was before she became a servant to the Rouget household. The English title of the book therefore moves the focus from her to the Bridau brothers.Adamson, Donald. Translator's Introduction, The Black Sheep, Penguin Classics, 1970 ==Adaptations== In 1903, Emile Fabre adapted the story to a play with the same name, itself later adapted to two movies called Honor of the Family (in 1912 and 1931). The book was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 as its Classic Serial on Sunday 17 August and Sunday 24 August 2008, with actor Geoffrey Whitehead as the narrator. The French film The Opportunists (1960) is also based on this novel. ==Footnotes== ==Bibliography== * Balzac, Honoré de. La Rabouilleuse. 1842. * Adamson, Donald.

She was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Chawasha was laid down in April 1944 by the Charleston Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company of Charleston, South Carolina; launched on 15 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. R.H. Grantham; and commissioned at Charleston Navy Yard on 6 February 1945, Lieutenant Howard K. Smith in command. ==Service history== Following shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay, Chawasha sailed to Philadelphia, departing 24 March on a long and arduous towing job, bringing two dump scows through the Panama Canal and across the Pacific to Samar, P.I., which she reached 16 June. Her stay was brief, departing almost immediately for Ulithi Atoll to join logistic support group TG 30.8, arriving 27 June. Chawasha then spent the next two months assisting the Third Fleet in its series of pounding raids against the Japanese homeland. On 8 July, broke down at sea, and Chawasha towed her to Saipan. The fleet tug rejoined TG 30.8 on 15 July for replenishment and courier service, evading a severe typhoon from 10-15 August. Chawasha was at sea off the Japanese coast when hostilities ended, and put into Tokyo Bay 5 September. Over the next four months she cleared wrecked Japanese shipping from the dock areas at Yokosuka, Yokohama, Wakayama, and Kobe. Chawasha continued to aid occupation activities in the Far East until 19 February 1946, when she cleared Kobe for Samar. Here, she took ARD-18 in tow for Pearl Harbor, where she assumed another tow for Balboa. Sailing singly, she arrived in San Diego on 4 June, and entered preinactivation availability and overhaul. Chawasha was placed out of commission in reserve at San Pedro on 30 September 1946. Chawasha was transferred to the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet on 25 October 1962 and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1963. She remained in Suisun Bay until 14 August 1978, when she was returned to the navy to be used as a target in a fleet training exercise. In November 1978, she was towed to Subic Bay, Philippines, along with the former USS Sciota (ATA-205), where both were to be stored prior to their sinking. The actual date of her sinking is unknown, but it is probable that Chawasha was disposed of in a fleet training exercise in late 1978 or early 1979.

Ice rafting is the transport of various materials by ice. Various objects deposited on ice may eventually become embedded in the ice. When the ice melts after a certain amount of drifting, these objects are deposited onto the bottom of the water body, e.g., onto a river bed or an ocean floor. These deposits are called ice rafted debris (IRD) or ice rafted deposits. Ice rafting was a primary mechanism of sediment transport during glacial episodes of the Pleistocene when sea levels were very low and much of the land was covered by large masses (sheets) of ice. The rafting of various size sediments into deeper ocean waters by icebergs became a rather important process. Ice rafting is still a process occurring today, although its impact is significantly less and much harder to gauge. The melting of large icebergs deposits sediment of various sizes, usually referred to as glacial marine sediment, onto the shelf and deeper marine areas. Ice rafting may be used for analysis of ice drift pattern by matching the rafted sediment with its origin. Ice rafting must also be taken into an account in archaeology and as a possible cause of displacement of archaeological artifacts. ==See also== * Bond event * Glacial debris * Drift station, a facility built on an ice floe * Dropstone * Swallow float * Glacial erratic ==References== ==Further reading== * * Alexei Rudoy.

The series combines CGI animation for mecha and traditional cel animation for characters. Despite high-quality animation and an emphasis on futuristic vehicles traditional to Anderson productions (such as Thunderbirds), the series was not warmly received in Japan. Series availability in other countries has been limited. ==Plot== By the year 2104, the nations of Earth have finally achieved world peace. However, that peace is threatened by a new worldwide terrorist organization called Black Orchid. To counter this threat, the United Nations has created a military peacekeeping force called Storm Force. Each Storm Force unit (8 total) acts independently, operating primarily from a large twin-hulled submarine. As the series opens, a new elite unit is formed called Storm Force 9, which is assigned a special mission; code-named \\"Firestorm.\\" Early in the series, the Firestorm team discover Black Orchid is secretly a front for a worldwide invasion of space aliens who can disguise themselves as humans. The aliens have developed a drug which will turn humans into their mindless slaves, and they plot to put the drug into the Earth's water supply. Each episode focuses strongly on futuristic vehicles (mecha). The Firestorm team operate primarily from a huge twin-hulled submarine, called the Ocean Storm. This submarine features a detachable jet aircraft called the Tornado, making it similar to SkyDiver from Gerry Anderson's 1970-71 series UFO. Visually, the Tornado resembles Thunderbird 2 from Anderson's 1965-66 series Thunderbirds. While Thunderbird 2 carried a variety of pods containing smaller vehicles, the Tornado carries a group of smaller vehicles at all times, including two jet fighters, a futuristic tank and several boats. ==Characters== ===Storm Force 2=== *Inuma (イヌマ): SF2 captain, and friend of Drew McAllister.

Programming development is guided by child psychology experts and is designed to encourage a child's skills development, such as counting, vocabulary and color recognition. The BabyFirst logo in the corner changes colors to indicate the skills a segment is intended to develop. Late-night programming is intended to lull viewers to sleep. There are also 41 BabyFirst apps for mobile devices. An app available to AT&T; U-verse viewers allows children to draw on a mobile device and have the drawing appear on the television screen. Some experts argue that exposing children to television at such an early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost touch with the realities of raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming is intended to be watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way. ==References== ==External links== * , official website * , First Media company website Category:Television networks in the United States Category:Preschool education television networks Category:Children's television networks in the United States Category:Children's television networks in Canada Category:Television channels and stations established in 2003 Category:Early childhood education Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"BabyFirst"},{"id":"17300668","text":"Eden Foods, Inc., (also known as Eden Organic) is an organic food company based in Clinton, Michigan. It is best known for its Edensoy line of organic soy milk,Dun & Bradstreet report on Eden, via Google Finance and its line of organic Japanese foods and condiments. The company claims to be the oldest independent organic food producer in the United States, and the largest supplier of organic dry grocery items.about Eden Foods Eden was founded in 1969 as a co-op grocery store in Ann Arbor, Michigan to continue the operations of a defunct macrobiotic food buying club. Originally incorporated as a nonprofit, it became a for-profit company in 1970. In 1972, the company began importing Japanese foods such as miso and soy sauce for both the retail and commercial markets. Many of Eden's Japanese foods are still sourced in Japan. Most of Eden Food's products are organic, most are certified kosher, and most are vegan, except for their katsuo (Japanese fish flakes). Many of Eden's prepared foods are also gluten-free, and have therefore been recommended for those on a gluten-free or gluten-free casein-free (GFCF) diet.The GFCF Diet: Side dishes == Products == ===Soy milk=== In 1997, an independent test by The New York Times looking for traces of GMOs in 11 soy and corn-based products found Eden's milk to be the only product that tested clean, a finding that Eden Foods attributed to their extensive certification and testing program.Eden Foods' organic soy milk passes the media test for GMOs - The Organic & Non-GMO Report ===Soy sauce=== In 2001, Eden shoyu soy sauce was rated highest for flavor by Cook's Illustrated in a comparison of 12 brands. In 2007, Eden's tamari was rated best out of seven brands tested in a comparison conducted by the San Francisco Chronicle for its \\"Taster's Choice\\" column.SFGate.com - \\"Top tamari balances sweet and salty\\" ===Extra virgin olive oil=== In 1999, Prevention Magazine rated Eden's \\"Extra Virgin Spanish Olive Oil\\" highest in flavor and protective nutrients out of the 22 brands of extra virgin olive oil studied.Eden Foods press release ===Canned food=== Eden uses BPA-free enamel-lined cans for most of its products (the only exception being tomato-based foods),Eco Childs Play:Canned Food and BPA and was subsequently recommended by the Center for Science in the Public Interest as a safer option for canned food.Report from Center for Science in the Public Interest on BPA In a 2005 study, Eden's canned refried beans were rated best in nutritional value among commercial refried beans by Men's Health Magazine.125 Top Foods for Men ==Controversy== ===Infant formula charges=== In 1988 CEO Michael Potter was charged and later served 30 days in jail on misdemeanor charges for misrepresenting Edensoy soy milk as an infant formula. The suit was brought after a Canadian infant developed a rare eye and bone disorder as a result of vitamin deficiency from being fed the product. The child's physician later reported the patient to have \\"completely recovered\\". ===Employee healthcare=== In March 2013, Eden Foods filed suit against the Obama administration seeking an exemption from the mandate to cover contraception for its employees under the Affordable Care Act. According to the company's CEO Michael Potter, providing access to any form of contraceptives would violate his beliefs as a Catholic. (This stance against all types of birth control differs from Hobby Lobby's refusal to cover several types of contraception.) Eden Foods lost its suit in both the District Court and the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals (Eden v. Sebelius), and appealed to the Supreme Court. The Burwell v. Hobby Lobby decision by the US Supreme Court on 30 June 2014 overrules the lower courts. The next day, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, Eden Foods v.

The line connects with the Nagoya Line and Yokkaichi Asunarou Railway Utsube Line at Kintetsu- Yokkaichi Station. ==History== ===Yokkaichi Railway=== The Yunoyama Line was originally conceived and built by ) in the 1910s. It was constructed with the purposes of providing access in the city of Yokkaichi and providing tourists access to the Yunoyama area. The line was completed in 1913 and in 1916 an extension from the line's origin, (at that time called Suwa Station and located slightly to the east), to JR was added. However, this extension had a relatively short life as part of the Yunoyama Line as it was sold to Ise Electric Railway (Iseden) in 1927, who used it for the extension of their main line from Yokkaichi to . This made Suwa Station, a hub between three private railways and the biggest station in Yokkaichi, the origin again. Steam engines originally ran on the tracks; in the 1920s the line was electrified, following a trend of many railways in the area. Ownership of the line has shifted. Yokkaichi Railway created the line. It was absorbed by Mie Railway (Santetsu) in 1931, who built and operated the nearby Utsube Line which also originated from Suwa Station at that time. Then in 1944, Santetsu, with six other companies, merged to form Mie Transport (Sanco). Twenty years later, the railway department of Sanco split off to become a separate company called Mie Electric Railway (Sanden). This organization was short-lived as it was bought up by railway giant Kinki Nippon Railway (Kintetsu) the following year, and thus in 1965 the line came under its current name and ownership. ===Renovation=== In 1954 the beginning of the route received a significant re- routing at the hands of Sanco, the owner. The Nagoya Line suffered from many sharp curves on its way through Yokkaichi to Suwa Station. Kintetsu developed a plan to straighten the line as well as enlarge Suwa Station, which would be moved about a kilometer to the west. Construction began in 1952 and took a few years to be completed. In accordance with this plan, Sanco altered its own Yokkaichi-area railways in 1956 to use the new location of Suwa Station, which was renamed to Kintetsu-Yokkaichi Station. From Nakagawara Station, the track that ran to the old Suwa Station was closed and a new track was built to Kintetsu-Yokkaichi. After this new section was completed, the Yunoyama Line originated from the part of Kintetsu-Yokkaichi Station where the Utsube Line still originates today; the two lines had the same track gauge at that time and connected directly with each other. About 10 years later, in 1964, when Sanden took over the railway, more improvements were carried out even though Sanden only owned the line for about one year. Yokkaichi Railway constructed the line with an especially narrow gauge of . In the interest of direct connection with the Kintetsu Nagoya Line, the technical specs of the line were altered to match those of the Nagoya Line; the Yunoyama Line gauge was widened to and the voltage was increased to 1500 V. These changes severed the direct connection with the Utsube Line, however, direct connection with the Nagoya Line, a major railway trunk line, was seen as more beneficial. When Kintetsu acquired the line the following year, it was relatively painless to tie the two lines together and it soon began offering limited express service directly from in Osaka and to Yunoyama, aimed at attracting tourists to the onsen and nearby Mount Gozaisho. This service was offered for over 30 years but was ceased in 1998 due to insufficient ridership. Limited express trains that originated at Kintetsu-Yokkaichi continued to run the length of the Yunoyama Line for a few more years, but this service was ended in 2004. The Yunoyama Line is notable because it is the only one of Kintetsu's many small branch lines to have offered limited express service. ===Timeline=== *June 1, 1913 – Kawashimamura (now Ise-Kawashima) ~ Yunoyama (now Yunoyama-Onsen) section opened by Yokkaichi Railway. *September 24, 1913 – Suwa (now Kintetsu- Yokkaichi) ~ Kawashimamura section opens. *March 3, 1916 – Yokkaichi (Kokutetsu) ~ Suwa section opens. *November 1, 1921 – Entire line electrified. *November 29, 1927 – Yokkaichi – Suwa section closes.

The Art Deco tower was designed by architect L. Murray Dixon and opened as the Grossinger Beach Hotel. It was the first air-conditioned hotel on Miami Beach., p. 42. The hotel was used by the U.S. Army during World War II to accommodate high- ranking officers. The property re-opened in 1946 as the Ritz Plaza. In 1989, the hotel was purchased by Ignacio Contreras and Manuel Llerandi and restored to its Art Deco roots, reopening in February 1990. The hotel became a member of the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Historic Hotels of America in 1991. The Ritz Plaza was sold to developer Sam Nazarian in 2004 and closed for reconstruction as a luxury boutique hotel. The work took much longer than anticipated, and the hotel did not reopen until May 2012, as the SLS South Beach. ==References== Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1939 Category:Art Deco architecture in Florida Category:Skyscraper hotels in Miami Beach, Florida Category:1939 establishments in Florida ","title":"SLS South Beach Hotel"},{"id":"17300909","text":"Judith Henry (born 1942) is a New York-based artist that creates multimedia art works exploring the duality of interior versus public self. Henry often repurposes documentary materials (such as newspapers, telephone books, and film reels) in poignant explorations of identity. She also uses snapshot photography to document the variety and sameness inherent in human life. Her urge to speak through others, splicing dialogue and imagery, probes the gaps between what we say and how we appear, ultimately pointing to the slippery status of identity, evincing her desire to gather the tangible materials of a life. ==Early life and education== Henry received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Carnegie-Mellon University. ==Career== Pages of Freud (1971), Henry crosshatches lines onto page after page of Freud’s writings, signaling her persistent doubts about the therapeutic potential of language. She continues mining this vein in both Telephone Book Series (1973) and Male and Female (1982, 2009). In her artist’s book, Who's Who (1977), she frames newspaper photos of beloved and forgotten faces within the confines of a generic human profile. In Who I Saw in New York (1970-2000,) her street photographs, as a book and as an installation, aggregate thousands of portraits in an attempt to tease out patterns in human experience. In “Overheard”, a project started in the 1970s that has been ongoing for more than thirty years, Henry combines photographs she takes on the street with fragments of conversation she overhears in public places. She has created six artist’s books combining her street photography with overheard text. Henry has exhibited thousands of quotes and photographs in installations at Bergdorf Goodman (Overheard in New York) and at Neiman Marcus (Overheard in Los Angeles). True Stories Videos (2008-2011), a disconcerting mix of biography and fiction, in which anonymous storytellers recall their youth over dense collages of childhood photos, home videos and stock footage. Rebirth (2012), a collage series made by layering fragments of celebrity faces onto obituary photos. These hybrid portraits obscure their subjects and speak to collective experiences of uncertainty and disappearance. Girls, Girls, Girls (2012) a photo-based series in which she restates high school senior yearbook portraits in an ambiguous gesture of shared identity. Me As Her (2014) A series of black and white photographs continuing Henry's long standing practice of remaining hidden/masked within her work. She reimagines herself behind masks of significant and accomplished women who have died. The Artist is Hiding (2014-2015) A series of photographs depicting Henry wearing a different mask for each corresponding painting. Casting Call(2015-2018) A series of 300 small sculptures contracted from detritus derived from her studio. Henry designed Crumpled Paper Stationary as part of Wooster Enterprises (1976–79), a collaborative, conceptual business she began with artist Jaime Davidovich. Using their own original designs and additional prototypes by George Maciunas, Davidovich and Henry sold small paper products—greeting cards, writing pads, confetti, and other paper goods—to large and small stores throughout the United States. Their intent was to bring conceptual art into a truly commercial arena. After Wooster Enterprises failed, The Museum of Modern Art continued to produce Henry’s crumpled paper stationary. For years, it was one of the Museum store’s best selling items. ===Books=== * 2000 \\"Overheard at the Museum\\", Universe Publishers * 2001 \\"Overheard at the Bookstore\\", Universe Publishers * 2001 \\"Overheard While Shopping\\", Universe Publishers * 2001 \\"Overheard in Love\\", Universe Publishers * 2002 \\"Overheard on the Way to MOMAQueens'' * 2006 \\"Overheard in America\\", Atria Books ===Exhibitions=== * 2018 Casting Call, January, BravinLee Programs, New York, NY * 2017 Alternate Lives, Judith Henry and Morton Bartlett, National Arts Club, New York, NY * 2016 Me as Her, Visual Arts Center of New Jersey, NJ * 2015 Solo exhibition, BravinLee Programs, New York, NY * 2014 Women Choose Women Again, Visual Arts center of New Jersey, Summit, NJ * 2012 Davis Orton Gallery, Hudson, NY * 2012 Churner and Churner, Wooster Enterprises Exhibition, New York, NY * 2011 0.00156 acres Gallery, September, Brooklyn * 2010 National Academy Invitational Exhibition, New York * 2008 Festival de Cine International de Barcelona, Berta Bornstein * 2008 San Francisco Short Film Festival, Berta Bornstein * 2008 Technocracy, Carnegie Mellon University, Regina Gouger Miller Gallery, The Southern Express, Pittsburgh, PA * 2008 Philadelphia Independent Film Festival, Berta Bornstein * 2008 Ace Film Festival, The Southern Express, New York, NY * 2005 Artsumer Gallery, Statement in the Art, Istanbul, Turkey * 2003 Reading Between the Lines, 147 Wooster Arts Space, New York, NY * 2002 Barbara Kraków Gallery, Boston, MA * 2001 Emily Davis Gallery, University of Akron, Akron, OH * 1996 25th Year Retrospective, Douglass College, New Brunswick, NJ * 1996 Tartessos Gallery, Barcelona, Spain * 1992 Bound & Unbound, New York, NY * 1989 Graphic Design in America, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN * 1988 Alternating Currents, Alternative Museum, New York, NY * 1986 White Columns Presents Video, White Columns, New York, NY * 1985 Video Festival, A.I.R.

He is a Prop for London Irish and has previously played for Australian club New South Wales Waratahs and the French club Bordeaux. He also plays for Australia's Wallabies in international matches. Kepu made his international debut for Australia in 2008 and has been a regular in match-day squads ever since, having played over 100 tests for Australia since his debut. Kepu is the most-capped Prop to ever play for the Wallabies is also one of the most-capped rugby players in history. ==Early life == Kepu was born in Sydney, Australia, to Tongan parents, but his family relocated to Auckland while he was still a youngster. He began playing rugby with Tamaki Rugby Football Club Under 7s and attended school in the suburb of Glen Innes in Auckland. Kepu captained the Wesley College first XV from the number eight position in 2004 before switching to the front row with the New Zealand under-19s in 2005. He represented New Zealand at under 17, 19 and 21 levels. ==Rugby Union Career == Between 2005 and 2007, Kepu was a member of the wider training group for the Chiefs, and was a stand out player for Counties Manukau in the Air New Zealand Cup in 2006. A broken collarbone ruined his 2007 season and saw him end the year without a Super 14 contract. Kepu moved to back Sydney at the age of 21 to play for the NSW Waratahs. He made his Super Rugby debut against the Highlanders in Dunedin, playing as the starting loosehead after Wallabies prop was ruled out due to a head knock. In June 2008, Kepu played for Australia A in the 2008 Pacific Nations Cup. He was selected for the Wallabies on the 2008 and 2009 Spring tours, and made his test debut for Australia on 8 November 2008, against Italy at Padova. He gained two more tests caps from the bench on those tours but then had to bide his time for more than a year before making another test appearance. Kepu had a strong season at the Waratahs in 2011 with 13 Super Rugby appearances, including 12 starts. In the 2011 Tri Nations Series, Kepu became the first choice loosehead prop for the Wallabies after Benn Robinson was ruled out of the entire campaign due to a knee injury. He started in all four tests and cemented his position. Australia won the 2011 Tri Nations cup. Kepu was a key player for Australia at the 2011 Rugby World Cup, starting in six out of seven matches that the Wallabies played in the tournament. In March 2013, he re-signed with Australian Rugby to commit to the Wallabies and Waratahs for a further two years. Kepu has also been playing at tighthead prop rather than loosehead for the Wallabies since then. Kepu's re- signing saw him go on to start in all three knockout rounds of the 2015 Rugby World Cup, but his ill-discipline was one of the unfortunate highlights of the final against New Zealand, on 31 October 2015, which Australia lost 17-34. Kepu's third Super Rugby try against the Chiefs in Round 15 of 2017 was well received by the press. After an excellent 2017 season and being one of the best-performing Wallabies of the year, Kepu unfortunately, during his 90th test, ended the season in disappointment, being red-carded against Scotland on 25 November 2017. Kepu was red-carded against Scotland in the 39th minute of the test for shoulder-charging Scottish flanker Hamish Watson's head, with Australia leading 12-10 against Scotland at the time. Australia failed to perform well with Kepu off the field, losing 53-24 to Scotland. Kepu became the second Wallaby to be sent off in the current decade, with teammate Tevita Kuridrani being sent off in 2013. In October 2018, Kepu became the first prop to make 100 appearances for Australia, appearing against New Zealand in an eventual 37-20 loss. On Monday 6 May 2019, it was announced that he had signed for London Irish in the Gallagher Premiership. == References == Category:1986 births Category:Australian rugby union players Category:Australian people of Tongan descent Category:Australia international rugby union players Category:New Zealand rugby union players Category:New South Wales Waratahs players Category:Counties Manukau Steelers players Category:Rugby union props Category:Australian emigrants to New Zealand Category:Rugby union players from Sydney Category:Living people Category:Union Bordeaux Bègles players Category:Australian expatriate rugby union players Category:Australian expatriate sportspeople in France Category:Expatriate rugby union players in France ","title":"Sekope Kepu"},{"id":"17300983","text":"Arctostaphylos pallida, commonly known as Pallid Manzanita, Oakland Hills Manzanita, and Alameda Manzanita, is an upright Manzanita shrub from the Ericaceae, or heath family. It is endemic to the eastern San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California. ==Description== Arctostaphylos pallida grows to around in height. The branches on the shrub are reddish or grayish (more reddish) and they have twigs that tend to be bristly. The ovate to triangular leaves are bristly, strongly overlapping and clasping. They are 1.0 to long and 0.8 to wide. The dense, white flowers are urn-shaped and 0.2 to long. The flowering period is from November to March. A. pallida commonly co-occurs with another manzanita species, Brittle Leaf Manzanita (Arctostaphylos tomentosa ssp. crustacea), but the latter is a burl-forming species with spreading leaves. A. pallida does not form burls. == Distribution == The species is found from in elevation, primarily on thin soils composed of chert and shale. The plants are found in manzanita chaparral habitat of the montane chaparral and woodlands ecosystem, and is frequently surrounded by oak woodlands and other chaparral shrubs. ;Endemism Arctostaphylos pallida is known from approximately 13 populations in Alameda and Contra Costa counties.The Nature Conservancy The two largest populations, which are owned by the East Bay Regional Park District, are located at Huckleberry Ridge—Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties and at Sobrante Ridge Regional Park in Contra Costa County. Several other small, natural and planted populations occur in Alameda and Contra Costa counties. The two largest groups occupy an area of approximately . These two populations are found in maritime sage and chaparral, a habitat with mesic soil conditions and a maritime influence. Many smaller populations occur in coastal scrub.Pallid Manzanita species account from the Sacramento Fish & Wildlife Office === Threats === The primary threats to the species are the effects of fire suppression, and shading and competition from native plants, and introduced and invasive species. To a lesser extent, the species is threatened by fungal infection, herbicide spraying, hybridization, construction of roads, and the ongoing effects of habitat fragmentation and loss. This is a federally listed threatened species. It was listed as an endangered species by the California Department of Fish and Game in November 1997.

Sylvor has designed more the sixty carousels worldwide including Bryant Park in New York City, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Singapore and other parts of the United States. == Early life == Sylvor was raised in the Bronx and grew up on the corner of 165th Street and Jerome Avenue, which is located near Yankee Stadium. He and his father, a sign painter, would vacation in the Rockaways every year. Each year Sylvor would ask to ride a carousel which they would pass near Marine Park Bridge on the way to their vacation. Sylvor's father, who he described as always in a hurry to get to their vacation destination, always refused to stop for the carousel ride. Sylvor later told the New York Times in a 2002 interview why his father never stopped, \\"He was a man on a mission to get to the Rockaways.\\" Sylvor graduated from William Howard Taft High School in the South Bronx and then enlisted in the United States Army. While he was stationed as an Army private at the Schofield Barracks in Hawaii during the 1950s. A lieutenant asked the privates in attention if any of them were artists. Sylvor was selected from the group because he said was the only man who actually had his paint brushes with him, which was a lie. Truthfully, Sylvor was an untrained artist who did not have brushes with him. He had to sneak off the base to buy some from civilian stores. However, Sylvor successfully managed to decorate the officers' club for a party and was soon commissioned for a series of other Army painting jobs around the base. == Carousels == Sylvor went on to receive his degree from the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1958. He founded a window display and decorating business, called Fabricon, following his graduation. His business was successful and he was hired to design displays for a number of well known clients including Bloomingdale's, Henri Bendel and the Vatican Pavilion of the 1964 New York World's Fair in Queens. He joined the National Carousel Association around the same time period as the 1964 World's Fair and began traveling to NCA conventions around the country. He initially had little experience building carousels and had to hire outside experts to help with construction. However, the carousels soon gave his business more work than window designing. Sylvor built all of his carousels in the Fabricon factory in East New York, Brooklyn. He kept an inventory of approximately 100 horses and what the carousel industry calls \\"menagerie creatures\\" at the factory. He specialized in unusual animals for his carousels, such as frogs or birds. His favorite figures are called \\"jumpers,\\" which are carousel animals which move up and down. He retired from the full-time business in 2005. == Death == Marvin Sylvor died of kidney failure in Miami, on April 9, 2008, at the age of 75. He was survived by his wife, Julia, son, Chris, daughter, Aimee and two grandchildren. == Incomplete list of locations of Marvin Sylvor carousels == *Bryant Park, Manhattan *Riverbank State Park, Manhattan *Forest Park, Queens, New York *Chicago, Illinois *Detroit, Michigan *Nashville, Tennessee *La Paz, Bolivia *São Paulo, Brazil *Auckland, New Zealand *Riyadh, Saudi Arabia *Singapore == References == == External links == * Gothamist: Marvin Sylvor, Famed Carousel Designer, Dies at 75 * Brooklyn Daily Eagle: Brooklyn-Based Designer Of Carousel Horses Dies * Le Carrousel in Bryant Park * National Carousel Association Category:2008 deaths Category:Carousel designers Category:Pratt Institute alumni Category:American designers Category:People from the Bronx Category:Place of birth missing Category:1933 births Category:Deaths from kidney failure ","title":"Marvin Sylvor"},{"id":"17301131","text":"Polypure is a Norwegian company that manufactures and markets monodisperse PEG (polyethylene glycol) derivatives for applications in nanotechnology, biotechnology and in pharmaceutical sciences. Its headquarters are located in the Oslo Innovation Center,Hovedside - Forskningsparken Oslo, Norway. The company has been in operation since 1999. The compounds are produced using a proprietary purification technology called Sample Displacement Chromatography (SDC).US Patent number: 6245238 The technique exploits the correlation between molecular weight and binding strength of PEG species. That is, individual PEG molecules bind to the matrix within a chromatography column at differing affinity depending on their molecular weight. Because of this property, when PEG is applied to the top of a chromatography column, strong binding species take possession of the first binding positions available and thereby force weaker binders to follow the liquid flow down the column to the next vacant positions. This results in the spatial separation of PEG species within the column according to affinity and thereby molecular weight.

He is most credited for the creation of modern disposable diapers and the Pampers brand, production improvements for Ivory soap and Duncan Hines cake mix, and the production concept for Pringles. Within P&G; he is regarded as the most productive technologist in the company's history. Therefore, when the company formed an honorary society for their engineers, it was named the Victor Mills Society. Victor Mills in the Navy Victor Mills, trekking with his grandson in Guatemala, 1973 Mills was born in Milford, Nebraska, to a family of farmers, preachers and mule-team drivers. He served in the United States Navy during World War I, aboard the battleship Missouri. He worked his way up from the black gang to being a welder. At the end of the war he took discharge at Honolulu, Hawaii and lived as a beachcomber and welder on the island of Molokai. There he met his future wife, Grace Riggs, a missionary from Eddyville, Iowa; she insisted that he return to the mainland and get an education. He graduated from the University of Washington in 1926 with a degree in chemical engineering. He was hired by Procter & Gamble right out of college and moved to the Cincinnati, Ohio headquarters of the company. His first major innovation was converting soap production from a batch process—basically cooking in large cauldrons—to a continuous stream operation, which cut production time for Ivory soap from seven days to just a few hours. During the 1930s he built a large home on Hilltop Lane in the Cincinnati suburb of Wyoming, Ohio, where he and Grace raised their only child, daughter Maile. He then applied ideas from soap chemistry to improve the production of cake mixes and peanut butter, among other products. During World War II he was involved with the production of synthetic rubber with Waldo Semon, the inventor of vinyl, who was his mentor at the University of Washington in the early 1920s. After the war, Mills headed up the Exploratory Development Department of P&G;, responsible for finding new lines of product for the company. In that capacity, he conceived and led the development of Pampers during the 1950s. It was the world's first widely marketed disposable diaper, and currently P&G;'s largest brand by sales revenue. His last project was to oversee the development of Pringles. This potato snack is made using a slurry of potatoes, flour and flavorings which is pressed and dried into its distinctive shape: the process owes a lot to Mills' earlier work producing soap flakes. He retired to Tucson, Arizona in 1961 and spent his time on his hobbies. He had an extensive garden of cactus and other plants of his adopted Sonoran Desert region. He traveled the world, both on cruise ships with his wife, and on hiking expeditions. At one time he was the oldest man on record to have climbed Mount Rainier, and likewise Point Lenana on Mount Kenya. He died at his home in 1997, at the age of 100. ==See also== *Marion Donovan ==References== Category:1897 births Category:1997 deaths Category:University of Washington College of Engineering alumni Category:People from Seward County, Nebraska Category:American centenarians Category:Diapers ","title":"Victor Mills"},{"id":"17301255","text":"Zambia, officially known as the Republic of Zambia (), is a landlocked country in Southern Africa.

This so-called war was not a conflict between nations; it was a war of ideas fought by like-minded people against British forces. Participants in the conflict were members of a secret association known as the Hunter's Lodge, formed in the United States in sympathy with the 1837 Rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada. The organization arose in Vermont among Lower Canadian refugees (the eastern division or Frères chasseurs) and spread westward under the influence of Dr Charles Duncombe and Donald McLeod, leaders of the short-lived Canadian Refugee Relief Association, and Scotland native William Lyon Mackenzie, drawing in support from several different locations in North America and Europe. The Republic of Canada was also short-lived. After a heavy bombardment by the British on Navy Island, where the republic had been established, Mackenzie and his force of Canadian militia retreated to Buffalo, New York, where they were captured by the U.S. Army. On charges of violating the neutrality between the United States and the British Empire, they were sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. This brought to an end what the British viewed as an inconsequential and unsupported colonial rebellion. The organizations were made up of grass-roots armed militants whose goal was to overthrow British rule in Canada. Their dispersal involved the largest deployment of U.S. troops against their own citizens since the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794. == Mackenzie's 'Republic of Canada' == While the initial rebellion in Upper Canada ended quickly with the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern, many of the rebels (including rebel leader William Lyon Mackenzie) fled to the United States. Mackenzie established a short-lived \\"Republic of Canada\\" on Navy Island in the Niagara River, but withdrew from armed conflict soon thereafter. Even before the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern, a large meeting in Buffalo, New York met on December 5, 1837 and appointed a committee of 13 to organize support for the rebels. On December 11, Mackenzie arrived in Buffalo where he was met by Thomas Jefferson Sutherland, who was to become the major organizer of Patriot support for Mackenzie at Navy Island. Sutherland convinced Rensselaer van Rensselaer to become commander in chief of the Patriot forces. Van Rensselaer was a West Point graduate who had fought with Bolivar in South America. == Navy Island (December 13, 1837) == On December 14 they proceeded to Navy Island in the Niagara River but initially found only 24 men to accompany them. Navy Island lay in Canadian waters and hence did not implicate the United States in the military actions. The encampment was to launch an attack in support of the Duncombe uprising in the London District. Here, Mackenzie declared the provisional government of the Republic of Canada. of government land was offered to each volunteer. Over the month of December, large supportive meetings were held in towns along the border, including Burlington, Albany, Rochester, Buffalo, Cleveland and Detroit and aid was promised. By the end of the month, up to 500 volunteers had joined Mackenzie on the island. However, with the failure of Duncombe's revolt, the main purpose of seizing Navy Island disappeared and it was evacuated on January 14, 1838, ending the short-lived republic. == Caroline affair (December 29, 1837) == The Destruction of the Caroline by George Tattersall The steamship Caroline, captained by Gilman Appleby, carried supplies between Buffalo and Mackenzie's encampment on Navy Island. On December 29, Colonel Sir Allan MacNab and Captain Andrew Drew of the Royal Navy crossed the international boundary and seized Caroline, chased off the crew, set her afire, and cast her adrift over Niagara Falls, after killing one black American named Amos Durfee. The incident sparked an international outcry. The case was finally disposed of by U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster and Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton, in the course of their negotiations leading to the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842. This case is a basis for the principle of the preemptive strike.Kenneth R. Stevens, Border diplomacy: the Caroline and McLeod affairs in Anglo-American-Canadian relations, 1837-1842 (University Alabama Press, 1989). == Schooner Anne and Bois Blanc Island (January 8, 1838) == Thomas Jefferson Sutherland was sent by the rebellion leaders on Navy Island in the Niagara River to raise a force in Detroit in December 1837. Sutherland arrived to find that Henry S. Handy and Dr Edward A. Theller had already held public meetings and organized an invasion force. Handy was in Toronto in the fall of 1837 where he met Marshall Bidwell and learned of the rebellion from him. Handy and his brother-in-law Judge Orange Butler, then of the Michigan House of Representatives, joined G. M. Dufort of Montreal in travelling to Detroit where they formed a \\"war council\\" of influential citizens. Men came to Detroit from as far away as Illinois and Kentucky to join the movement.\\"The Patriot War of 1837–1838: Locofocoism With a Gun? \\", Andrew Bonthius, Labour/Le Travail, No. 52, Fall 2003 On January 5, 1838, the Detroit jail was raided and the Patriots seized the 450 muskets which had been stored there. The Patriots were reported to have stolen another 200 weapons from the unsecured office of the U.S. marshal in Detroit, perhaps with his help. The Patriot War, Robert B. Ross, 1890, The Detroit Evening News and the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society James M. Wilson was appointed major- general; Elijah Jackson Roberts as brigadier-general of the first brigade; Dr Edward Alexander Theller as brigadier-general of the first brigade of Irish and French troops to be raised. Sutherland and General E. J. Roberts disagreed over who would lead the invasion force on the Schooner Anne against Fort Malden, Amherstberg, Upper Canada. Handy appointed Theller was to command the schooner Anne, while Sutherland would lead a flotilla to Bois Blanc Island opposite Amherstberg on the understanding he was under Roberts' command. But for some reason Sutherland stopped in American territory on Sugar Island, a little further out, instead. Anne attacked Fort Malden on January 9, but was beached and Theller taken prisoner and ultimately jailed in the citadel in Quebec City. Further attempts to attack Fort Malden were stymied by American troops. Michigan Governor Stevens T. Mason helped by leading a militia to thwart the Battle of Windsor. == Fighting Island (February 24, 1838) & Hickory Island (February 22, 1838) == A series of simultaneous attacks set for Washington's birthday (February 22) were next planned. On February 23 the steamboat Erie headed for Fighting Island, south of Detroit, carrying more than 400 troops from Cleveland under General Donald McLeod. They were poorly equipped as their arms were captured by the American authorities. The British troops crossed the ice and dispersed the Patriots on February 25. The British military announced their intention to pursue the Patriots into the United States but U.S. troops put a line of red flags on the ice in the river marking the border and were under orders to shoot any British troops that crossed it. The British did not cross the line and the U.S. captured some Patriots but soon released them. On February 22, General van Rensselaer and Daniel Heustis travelled to Hickory Island with less than 100 men to prevent arms from being seized under the Neutrality Act of 1794. They hoped that over 1000 men would follow and they would be able to capture Kingston, but the troops never arrived and the plan was abandoned. == Battle of Pelee Island (March 3, 1838) == Most of the men from the earlier expeditions now collected at Sandusky Bay, Ohio, and under the leadership of Captain George van Rensselaer (a relative of the General) and General Thomas Jefferson Sutherland, took Pelee Island in Lake Erie. However, their expected arms were again captured by the US authorities, leaving them with only 200 guns for all the men. They were attacked by the British and Van Rensselaer, along with 10 of his troops, were killed, with numerous others captured; 5 British soldiers were killed. The retreating Patriots were forced to surrender their arms by the US authorities and disbanded. At the end of this period, William Lyon Mackenzie was at odds with other Patriot leaders and soon was arrested for breach of the American Neutrality Laws. Thomas Jefferson Sutherland was captured by the British near Detroit and taken to jail in Toronto, where he was witness to the hanging of Samuel Lount, an organizer of the attack on Toronto. == Canadian Refugee Relief Association == In March 1838, a committee consisting of General Donald McLeod, William Lyon Mackenzie, Dr Charles Duncombe, Dr Alexander Mackenzie and a number of other Canadian refugees met at Lockport to form the \\"Canadian Refugee Relief Association.\\" Dr A. Mackenzie became the president, and General Donald McLeod the general organizer. This organization was loosely connected with the attack on the steamer Sir Robert Peel and the Short Hill raid. McLeod went on, with Duncombe, to form the Hunter's Lodges soon thereafter. == Burning of Sir Robert Peel (May 29, 1838) == On May 29, 1838 a band of Patriots disguised as Indians attacked the steamer Sir Robert Peel at Well's Island and burned it. The expedition was under the command of General Donald McLeod and William Johnston. == Short Hills Raid (June 21–23, 1838) == Twenty four largely Canadian men under the leadership of Colonel James Morreau assembled at Clark's Point near Lewiston, New York, on June 11, 1838 and crossed over the Niagara River. They hoped to provoke a general uprising of sympathizers in the Niagara area. They attacked troops stationed at a tavern in Short Hills on June 20. The Patriots were captured, including Morreau, Major Benjamin Wait, and Donald McLeod. == Henry S. Handy's 'Secret Order of the Sons of Liberty' == Henry S. Handy (1804–1846) was a lawyer, newspaper editor and military engineer. He was appointed to oversee the construction of the Chicago Harbour in 1833 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. After the failure of earlier efforts, in which US authorities had intervened, he organized lodges of the \\"Secret Order of the Sons of Liberty\\" along both sides of the Michigan border with Upper Canada. Handy, as \\"Commander-in-chief of the Patriot Army of the Northwest\\" planned for a revolutionary army of 20,000 to capture Windsor on the 4th of July. The organization soon merged into the Hunters' Lodges. == Formation of the Hunters' Lodge == The first Hunters' Lodge (Frères chasseurs) was formed in north Vermont by Dr. Robert Nelson early in the spring of 1838 and spread rapidly within Quebec. Early in the summer, Donald McLeod, a rebel Upper Canadian schoolmaster, and newspaper editor, was initiated in the \\"Brother Hunters\\" and informed them of the existence of Henry S. Handy's \\"Secret Order of the Sons of Liberty\\". They were distinct, yet again, from a third organization forming in Cleveland under Dr Charles Duncombe, who were planning an invasion of Upper Canada for the 4th of July. Under McLeod's influence, the Cleveland group adopted the form of the Hunters' Lodge. The Sons of Liberty disappeared after their failed raid on Windsor, and were absorbed into the Hunters' Lodge. === Lodge organization === The Hunters Lodges were modelled on Masonic lodges, and adopted similar secret signs, hierarchical orders, and rituals. The Grand Lodge was at Cleveland, where Duncombe was a tireless promoter. The four degrees of the Lodge were: Snowshoe, Beaver, Grand Hunter and Patriot Hunter. Soldiers without rank were of the first degree, commissioned officers of the second, field officers of the third, and the highest ranking commissioned officers of the fourth degree. === Convention & military organization === In September 1838, 160 delegates from the western Hunters' Lodges attended a secret, week-long \\"Patriot Congress\\" in Cleveland, Ohio. They appointed a provisional Canadian republican government that included: # President A.D. Smith, \\"chief justice of the peace at Cleveland\\" # Vice-President Colonel Nathan Williams, \\"a wholesale grocer\\" in Cleveland # Secretary of the Treasury Judge John Grant Jr, Oswego # Secretary of War Donald McLeod # Commander-in-chief of the \\"Patriot Army of the West,\\" Lucius V. Bierce, \\"an attorney at Akron.\\" # Commodore of the Patriot Navy on Lake Erie, Gilman Appleby, former captain of Caroline # Commodore of the Patriot Navy on Lake Ontario, Bill Johnston == Battle of the Windmill (November 13–18, 1838) == The Hunters Lodges in both the Eastern and Western Divisions agreed that they would launch a general invasion of the Canadas on November 1. The Eastern division began their attack on Quebec on November 3 under the direction of Grand Lodges in Montreal and St. Albans, Vermont. The Western division, under the general command of the \\"vice- president of the provisional government\\" of the Republic of Canada, Col. Nathan Williams of Cleveland, planned an attack at Detroit. However, \\"Major General\\" John Ward Birge convinced the eastern New York lodges to join him in an attack at Prescott, on the St Lawrence River instead. The leader of the attack was to be Nils Szoltevsky Von Schoultz, a Polish soldier who had been part of the Polish Rebellion. On November 11, four hundred men boarded the steamboat United States at Sackets Harbor, New York. Disagreements arose between Birge and Von Schoultz on the plan of attack, and Birge withdrew with 200 men to Ogdensburg for reinforcements that were never to appear. Von Schoultz and 150 men aboard Charlotte of Toronto reached Windmill Point near Prescott on November 12 where they set up camp. All supplies to Windmill Point were cut off by British and American troops and the Canadian Hunters who had come in support were forced to withdraw. The standoff that resulted ended November 16 when artillery was brought from Kingston. 137 prisoners were taken, and 80 were killed. The Patriot prisoners were defended by John A. Macdonald, a lawyer in Kingston who was to become Canada's first prime minister. == Battle of Windsor (December 4, 1838) == The final planned Hunter attack was the western assault, organized out of Cleveland, on Windsor, which had as its intention U.S. invaders driving inland to London, Upper Canada. A diversionary attack from Port Huron on Sarnia was also planned but it was aborted when a large contingent of British troops was deployed on its attack route. Five or six hundred men established a camp at Brest, south of Detroit. Lucius V. Bierce, in command of the camp, however contended there were not enough men for a successful attack. E. J. Roberts, an early Detroit organizer with Handy, pushed for the attack anyway. On December 3, the militants seized the steamboat Champlain, and the 135 men aboard landed north of Windsor at 2 am the next morning. Three detachments sortied under Cornelius Cunningham, William Putnam, and S. S. Coffinbury: Moving toward the village of Windsor, the Hunters encountered resistance from a detachment of militia stationed in a civilian store used as a guardhouse. Deciding to set fire to it to flush the defenders out, they went to the nearby house of a black Canadian named Mills to get the embers from his hearth fire. The Americans invited Mills to join their cause and, when he not only refused but exclaimed \\"three cheers for the Queen\\", they killed him. The guardhouse was destroyed by flames and the occupants taken prisoner, and Putnam's men continued on to Windsor where they set fire to the steamer Thames in retaliation for the destruction of Caroline. On their way they encountered Surgeon John Hume of the 32nd Foot, who, awakened by the alarm bells, was headed to Windsor to offer his services to the local militia. The Hunters killed Hume and mutilated his limbs with an axe before leaving the remains for the local hogs. The Patriots took positions at the Baby farm, which contained a large orchard. Only 20 militia were billeted at Windsor, a small town of around 300, while some miles further south at Sandwich and Amherstburg were the bulk of the 500 militia and regulars. At about 7 am, a 60-man company of Canadian militia from Sandwich successfully repelled the invasion before the regulars arrived and captured several patriots. The militia pushed the Patriots out of the orchard and pursued them through the town. The Patriots then fled in several directions, some returning to their steamer to free the 18 prisoners they had taken. Colonel John Prince arrived after the rout (9:30 am) and took command. Prince then moved his troops back to Sandwich, fearing another attack there. At 1:30 pm, a company of British regulars from the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot with a six- pound cannon and 20 mounted Indians arrived at Sandwich and continued north to Windsor. Prince decided to follow with his 400 militiamen. However, all of the Patriots had made their escape by this time, and only one of them was captured. Prince ordered that four prisoners be immediately shot without having been tried in court.Chronology of Events , The 1837 Rebellions, edunetconnect.com, Baxter Publications The British cannon fired some shots at Patriots fleeing in stolen canoes, hitting one in the arm. The U.S. steamer Erie carrying Detroit militia captured some of the Patriots but soon released them on U.S. soil. Total fatalities in the battle were 8 among the British forces and 25 among the Patriots. Bierce and Roberts escaped to Detroit, where they were joined by Dr. E. A. Theller, who had escaped imprisonment in Quebec. By December 4 the expected reinforcements arrived at Detroit, but the U.S. government prevented a second attack. At a large public meeting, the Patriot volunteers passed resolutions rebuking the US government for taking arms against its own people. The volunteer army dispersed, ending the Patriot War. == Aftermath and impact == === Transportation to Australia === 1837 Dower Map of Van Dieman's Land or Tasmania - Geographicus - Tazmania-dower-1837 In total, 93 Americans and 58 Patriot prisoners from Lower Canada were transported to Australia after being convicted in Montreal in late 1838 or early 1839. Almost all were taken on , leaving Quebec in September 1839 and arriving off Hobart, Van Diemen's Land, in February 1840. The Americans were disembarked at Hobart but the French-Canadians were taken to Sydney, New South Wales. They were interned near the present day suburb of Concord, giving rise to the names Canada Bay, French Bay and Exile Bay. The Lower Canadians were treated better than the Americans, liberated sooner and assisted in getting home. Of the 93 Americans, 14 died as a direct result of transportation and penal servitude. By the end of 1844, half of those in Van Diemen's Land had been granted pardons, nearly all were pardoned by 1848, but five remained in penal servitude until at least 1850. None of the convicts chose to stay in Van Diemen's Land after being pardoned.A Guide to researching your convict ancestorsMagazine article about monument to French prisoners, and their story Three former convicts, however, did eventually settle in Australia: Ira Polley (Polly), of Lyme, New York, left in 1844 and subsequently married and settled in the Illawarra region of New South Wales; Chauncey Bugby (now Buckby) married Elizabeth Hughes in 1846 and settled in Circular Head section of the northwest corner of Tasmania; and Hiram Sharp(e) of Salina in Onondaga County, New York, left in August 1846, married a Mary Black and settled in Kiama in New South Wales.Carter, John, Patriot Chronicles: Four Who Didn't Come Home.

Accessed March 8, 2015. === International relations === In geopolitical terms, the Rebellions and the Patriot War altered the landscape of relations between Britain and British colonial authorities, on one hand, and the American government on the other. Both nations were dedicated to a peace policy due to a budding financial crisis and to a sense of perceived disadvantage which both felt equally. Both were legitimately concerned about the disruption in relations which radical ideas might foment through further rebellion and raids (this was a greater worry to the British than the Americans). An unprecedented level of cooperation occurred in diplomatic and military circles. In the United States, in addition to dialogue, the administration of Martin Van Buren used its military forces and local authorities in the enforcement of a new Neutrality Act, encouraged the prosecution of filibusters, and actively deterred American citizens from subversive activities abroad. Thus the Patriot War contributed to the construction of more recent Anglo-American and Canada-U.S. relations; it also led, more immediately, to a backlash among citizens regarding the seeming overreach of federal authority.Patrick Lacroix, \\"Choosing Peace and Order: National Security and Sovereignty in a North American Borderland, 1837–42,\\" International History Review (On-line, October 6, 2015), DOI 10.1080/07075332.2015.1070892. The extended series of incidents comprising the Patriot War were finally settled by U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster and Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton, in the course of their negotiations leading to the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842. The U.S. Army constructed Fort Wayne in Detroit in 1842 after the conflict to counter the British presence at Fort Malden in Sandwich.Howard Jones, To the Webster-Ashburton Treaty: A Study in Anglo-American Relations, 1783-1843 (U of North Carolina Press, 1977). The U.S.-Canadian border remained mostly peaceful until the Fenian raids of 1866-1871. == References == == Further reading == * Bonthius, Andrew \\"The Patriot War of 1837–1838: Locofocoism With a Gun?\\" Labour/Le Travail 52 (2003): 9-43. * Duffy, John & H.

The district, which consists of the Barrington Town Hall, Leander R. Peck School and Prince's Hill Cemetery, is located on Prince's Hill near the center of Barrington. In 1728, Prince's Hill Cemetery was purchased and later expanded to its present size by 1898. The -story Barrington Town Hall was completed in 1888 and originally served as the seat of the town's government, library and high school. With the completion of the Leander R. Peck School in 1917, the high school moved into the adjacent building and the library used its space. The two-story Elizabethan Revival style Peck School is designed with a T-shaped plan and features a stairway to access the main entrance on the second story. The Peck School was later used by the fifth and sixth-grade elementary students before becoming the public library. Also located within the district is Wood's Pond. The Barrington Civic Center Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and serves as a historically significant example of civic and natural environment planning of the late nineteenth century. == Overview == Outline of the Barrington Civic Center boundary Located in Barrington, Rhode Island on County Road, the Barrington Civic Center Historic District includes the Barrington Town Hall, the Peck School, sports field and tennis court, Wood's pond and Prince's Hill Cemetery. The cemetery dates to the early 18th century, with stones dating from 1728. Bicknell's A History of Barrington, Rhode Island notes under April 7, 1886, that the town voted and approved an appropriation of $2000 for the land to build a town hall. The town hall was completed in 1888 and was originally used as the town's government offices, library and school. In 1917, the high school students transferred to the newly completed and adjacent Peck School. == Barrington Town Hall == Barrington Town Hall in 2014 The -story Barrington Town Hall was designed and constructed between 1887 and 1888 by Stone, Carpenter & Willson of Providence, Rhode Island with an appropriation of $15,000. The town hall was officially dedicated on December 12, 1888. Constructed on the north-south axis of a ridge Prince's Hill, the town hall's design was self-described as medieval by the architects. Morgan describes the town hall as having \\"three flank gable units of varying height and depth\\" and [it] has two circular towers on the front facade of varying height. Morgan notes that \\"[in the Town Hall,] institutional functions are given something of a domestic architectural character, for the building suggests an expansive house in a half-timbered manorial style.\\" The basement, first and portions of the second story of the Town Hall are constructed of fieldstone. Some of the stones are inscribed as memorials and one stone is claimed to have originated from Plymouth Rock. The second story, below the eaves, is half-timbered. The center of the building features planned irregularity with two large projecting dormer-gables, a chimney to the left of a projecting entrance porch. The southern gable, facing the front, also has two projecting dormers. The southern tower is topped by a copper weather vane with an elaborate three-mast ship. According to Morgan, the town hall was designed for multiple uses and this is evident from the plans and the exterior of the building. The largest section, the center section, serves as the government function and has municipal offices on the first floor. A stairwell to the right leads to the second floor, which functions as a town meeting room. A secondary entrance on the western facade accesses the northern section of the building, previously a library. The southern section of the building was previously a high school with separate entrances for boys and girls. The second floor of the southern section was used by the Antiquarian Society for meetings and its collections. In 1917, the original library was moved to the southern section following the completion of the Leander R. Peck School. Two additions to the town hall were made to expand the library. The two additions consisted of two parallel gable units that matched the original material and form of the town hall, the first addition was made in 1938 by Howe & Church and the second in 1963 by Michael Traficante. == School and library == The Leander R. Peck School was donated to the Town of Barrington by Sarah Gould Peck in memory of her husband, Leander Remington Peck. A committee was formed to oversee the project and construction began in the spring of 1916. It was designed by Martin & Hall of Providence, Rhode Island, and constructed by Wilmarth and Mackillop of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The two-story Elizabethan Revival school is made of red Barrington brick with Indiana limestone trim and topped with a gable roof. Designed with a T-shaped plan, the main entrance at the top of the \\"T\\" is accessed on a second-story terrace reached via a large double stairway. The flanks have large projecting gable pavilions which include offices for the principal and superintendent. The central hallway is in width and is lined with classrooms on the first floor and the second floor has an assembly room and two recitation rooms. The full basement of the school includes the gymnasium and locker rooms. The building was opened on September 14, 1917. Additions to the school were made in 1924 and 1935 on the east. In the 1970s, these additions were used as a cafeteria and stage. By 1976, the Peck School was used as an elementary school for fifth and sixth graders. Later the school was renamed and re-purposed as the Barrington Public Library. The Barrington Preservation Society uses the lower level as a museum and for the storage of records. == Prince's Hill Cemetery == This stone marker in Princes Hill Cemetery reads: \\"In memory of the Slaves and their Descendants who faithfully served Barrington Families.\\" Located in the northwest half of the historic district is the Prince's Hill Cemetery. According to Morgan, \\"[a]t a town meeting on January 18, 1728–29, a committee of Timothy Wadsworth, Lieutenant Peck, Zachariah Bicknell, and James Smith was empowered to purchase land on Prince's Hill from Ebenezer Allen to lay out a burying ground for the recently erected Congregational Church...\\" The earliest stones are located in the narrow northern end of the cemetery and date to 1728. The cemetery was first expanded on December 31, 1729, with the purchase of a half-acre for five pounds sterling. It would expand four more times by 1898 to encompass more than four acres. In 1849, the cemetery was fenced in and Morgan describes it as \\"presently exemplifies the \\"rural cemetery\\" tradition of the nineteenth century with meandering drives and natural landscape planting.\\" Markers of note include the Ward family marker, consisting of a \\"large rugged cross and an ethereal angel\\", a 1903 stone marker dedicated to the slaves of the Barrington families and a Classical Revival crypt dating to 1909. == Importance == According to the National Register of Historic Places, the Barrington Civic Center Historic District is significant as it represents the \\"historical concentration of public and governmental functions in the Prince's Hill area of Barrington... [and as] a unit, the cemetery, town hall and school, and Wood's Pond, epitomize the late nineteenth-century interest in a planned natural environment.\\" Barrington was transformed by a tripling of its population from 1840 to 1900, going from a rural to a suburban environment. From 1881, the development of the land was regulated by the Barrington Rural Improvement Society, and the historic district serves as evidence of its planning. Morgan notes that a train station just south of Prince's Hill influenced the decision for the construction of civic buildings. The historic district still \\"show[s] the imprint of early civic pride and planning\\". It was added to the register in 1976. == See also == * National Register of Historic Places listings in Bristol County, Rhode Island ==References== Category:Historic districts in Bristol County, Rhode Island Category:Barrington, Rhode Island Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island ","title":"Barrington Civic Center Historic District"},{"id":"17301457","text":"Mount Tutu Eco-Sanctuary in Bay of Plenty, North Island, New Zealand, between Tauranga and Rotorua, is a Mainland Island Sanctuary, protected by the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust Act 1977 since 1993.

She is the only child of Lynda and H. Guy Snyder\\"In-N-Out Executive's Death Ruled Accidental\\". LA Times. January 26, 2000. Retrieved May 3, 2011. and the only grandchild of Harry and Esther Snyder, who founded In-N-Out in 1948. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, in 2012, Snyder was the youngest American female billionaire.https://web.archive.org/web/20121214085457/http://topics.bloomberg.com/bloomberg- billionaires-index/ As the sole beneficiary of family trusts, she is currently In-N-Out's majority owner and ultimately received control of the company's stock in its entirety on her 35th birthday, becoming the sole owner.Patrick Kiger, In-N-Out's Burger Queen, Orange Coast, January 27, 2014. ==Early life== Snyder was born in Glendora, California, to Lynda Lou (née Wilson) and Harry Guy Snyder. She is of Dutch descent on her father's side. When she was 12, her parents separated and she moved with her mother to the small town of Shingletown, California, where she lived on a ranch and graduated from Redding Christian School, a private high school in Palo Cedro, California, that her parents helped found. Her parents eventually divorced in January 1997. She has two older half-sisters (Traci and Teri) through her mother. Traci is married to former In-N-Out President and current COO Mark Taylor. Snyder's uncle Rich died in 1993 in a plane crash, and her father died in 1999 from an accidental drug overdose. ==Career== On January 1, 2010, Snyder became the 6th President of In-N-Out, succeeding her brother-in-law, Mark Taylor, who was appointed the Chief Operating Officer of the company. She occupies the same position that her grandfather Harry (1948–1976), uncle Rich (1976–1993), father Guy (1993–1999), and grandmother Esther (1999–2006) previously held. Before Snyder became President of In-N-Out Burger, a taped message from her was broadcast to all company associates letting them know about the transition and the future of the company. Esther Snyder's signature was finally replaced with Lynsi Snyder's on associates' paychecks in 2009, three years after Esther Snyder's death. During 2006, Snyder and In-N-Out were embroiled in a bitter lawsuit with a former company executive, Rich Boyd. Boyd was fired for allegedly misusing company funds, but he claimed that Snyder, and then Vice-President Mark Taylor, were trying to oust the elderly Esther Snyder from the company. Both Lynsi Snyder and Mark Taylor denied the claims, and the lawsuit was settled out of court in May 2006. Snyder took ownership of her father's share of In-N-Out (50% of the company) on her 30th birthday, and inherited the balance of the company that was not already in trust for her when her grandmother Esther died. Snyder gained full control of the company when she turned 35. In February 2013, Snyder was ranked a billionaire for the first time by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, based on an In-N-Out valuation of $1.1 billion. That same year, she ranked #93 on Maxim's annual Hot 100 list. ==Philanthropy== Snyder funds Healing Hearts & Nations (HHN), a non-profit corporation that builds training centers in Africa and India and trains local community leaders for the purpose of providing different forms of counseling to the underprivileged local population. She is also actively involved with the In-N-Out Burger Foundation, which supports abused and neglected children. ==Personal life== ===Marriages and children=== Snyder has been married four times and has four children. Her husbands have been: # Jeremiah Seawell (2000–2003): Seawell was a local boy from Redding, California, who was Snyder's high school sweetheart. They married shortly after her 18th birthday, in summer 2000, and moved back to her hometown of Glendora. The couple separated within two years and eventually divorced in 2003. # Richard Martinez (2004–2011): Snyder then married former In-N-Out employee Richard Martinez. In November 2006, Snyder gave birth to fraternal twins (one boy, one girl). Snyder filed for divorce in September 2010, and this was finalized in late 2011. # Val Torres Jr. (2011–2014): In 2010, while still married to Martinez, Snyder began dating Torres, a race car driver. On July 15, 2011, Snyder gave birth to their son. Her divorce from Martinez was finalized later in 2011. Shortly after, she married Torres in a small ceremony. Snyder filed for divorce from Torres in 2013; the marriage officially ended the following year. # Sean Ellingson (July 5, 2014 – present): In May 2014, Snyder became engaged to another ex-In-N-Out employee, Sean Ellingson, a native of La Verne, California. They married on July 5 of that year in Malibu, California, and had a small ceremony in her hometown of Glendora. She gave birth to their son, her fourth child, in late 2014. Ellingson is the older brother of actor Evan Ellingson. ===Religion=== Snyder is a devout Evangelical Christian, and has spoken several times about her faith. In 2015, her testimonial was featured on I Am Second. In it, she spoke about the many deaths within her family and her previous failed marriages and how her faith helped her cope with these misfortunes. ===Drag racing and residence=== Like her father, Snyder is an avid drag racing fan and member of the NHRA. She regularly competes in drag racing events. In 2015, she was featured on an episode of Jay Leno's Garage, where she showed off a modified '41 Willys that was previously owned by her late father. In August 2012, Snyder reportedly purchased a 7-bedroom, 16-bathroom mansion with of interior space in Bradbury, California, from Texas Rangers third baseman Adrián Beltré for a sum in excess of US$17 million. Snyder has stated that she works primarily out of the Baldwin Park office, home of In-N-Out University and formerly company headquarters, rather than the Irvine corporate headquarters because it is closer to her Bradbury home. ===Reclusivity and kidnapping attempts=== Snyder has frequently been called reclusive and media-shy, due to her long-time penchant for declining nearly all interview requests and rarely appearing at public events. However, in recent years she has become more open to the media, participating in profiles with the Orange County Register, Orange Coast, and CBS News. In her January 2014 interview with Orange Coast, Snyder said that she has been the target of at least two kidnapping attempts. In the wake of these attempts, she has deliberately kept herself out of the public eye for the safety of her family, she said. The first purported kidnapping attempt occurred when she was still a high school student in Shingletown; the second took place several years later in Baldwin Park, near the local In-N-Out distribution center. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Healing Hearts & Nations website Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:American billionaires Category:American corporate directors Category:American food industry businesspeople Category:American people of Canadian descent Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:American philanthropists Category:American Protestants Category:American women business executives Category:Businesspeople from Los Angeles Category:California Republicans Category:Female billionaires Category:Female dragster drivers Category:People from Glendora, California Category:People from Bradbury, California Category:People from Shasta County, California Category:Snyder family ","title":"Lynsi Snyder"},{"id":"17301520","text":" RMS Empress of Scotland, originally SS Kaiserin Auguste Victoria, was an ocean liner built in 1905–1906 by Vulcan AG shipyard in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland) for the Hamburg America Line. The ship regularly sailed between Hamburg and New York City until the outbreak of war in Europe in 1914. At the end of hostilities, re-flagged as USS Kaiserin Auguste Victoria, she transported American troops from Europe to the United States. For a brief time Cunard sailed the re-flagged ship between Liverpool and New York. The ship was refitted for Canadian Pacific Steamships (CP) and in 1921, she was renamed Empress of Scotland—the first of two CP ships to bear that name.The second was built for CP as and was re-named in 1942 because of Japan's military actions in December 1941. The vessel ended service in 1930 and was sold for scrap. During the demolition of the ship, the vessel caught fire, broke in two and sank. The hulls were raised and scrapped. ==Service history== SS Kaiserin Auguste Victoria was built by AG Vulcan Stettin in Stettin on the Baltic in 1905–1906. The new ship was ordered by the expanding Hamburg America Line. At 24,000 plus tons she was the largest passenger liner in the world from 1905 to 1907 until the advent of Cunard's . When the keel was laid down as \\"Ship #264,\\" this vessel was intended to be named SS Europa; she was to have been a sister ship to SS Amerika which was being built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast during the same period. At the time of her launching on 29 August 1905, her only peer in size was the slightly smaller Amerika which had been launched days earlier. SS Kaiserin Auguste Victoria sailed under a German flag for eight years. German Empress Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein permitted the vessel to be named after her and participated in the launching ceremonies.Michael, Paul. (2001). Hermann Broch, Visionary in Exile: The 2001 Yale Symposium, p. 134 n2. The 24,581-ton vessel had a length of , and her beam was . She had two funnels, four masts, twin propellers, and an average speed of . The ocean liner provided accommodation for 472 first-class passengers and for 174 second class passengers. There was room for 212 third- class passengers and for 1,608 fourth-class passengers.Ship List: Description of Empress of Canada SS Kaiserin Auguste Victoria left Hamburg on 10 May 1906 on her maiden voyage to Dover, Cherbourg, and New York under the command of Captain Hans Ruser. Thereafter, she regularly sailed the route between Hamburg and New York. In 1910 the ship was to be used in experiments for the world's first ship-to-shore airplane flights by pilot John McCurdy. A special platform was built on Kaiserin Auguste Victoria to provide a runway for McCurdy's plane. McCurdy abandoned the attempt when rival pilot Eugene Ely flew from the deck of off Hampton Roads, Virginia in 1910. Kaiserin Auguste Victoria then returned to sailing on her regular schedule. A similar experiment using airplanes launched at sea to carry mail was carried out on twenty years later. In June 1914, Kaiserin August Victoria made her last voyage under a German flag, sailing from Hamburg to Southampton, Cherbourg, and New York, and returning to Hamburg. ===World War I=== USS Kaiserin Auguste Victoria was commissioned in the US Navy as a troop transport after World War I, but the better part of her service history was in trans-Atlantic passenger service. During World War I, Kaiserin Auguste Victoria stayed in the port of Hamburg starting in August 1914. In March 1919, she was surrendered to Britain. The ship was chartered by the United States Shipping Board, and USS Kaiserin Auguste Victoria carried American troops from France to the United States. The ship made five crossings bringing troops home from the war.U.S. Department of the Navy: Naval Historical Center ===Post war=== On 14 February 1920, the ship was decommissioned by the United States Navy and chartered to Cunard. SS Kaiserin Auguste Victoria sailed between Liverpool and New York although her time with Cunard would be very short. On 13 May 1921, the ship was sold to Canadian Pacific and was renamed Empress of Scotland. The ship was refitted to carry 459 first-class passengers, 478 second-class passengers, and 960 third- class passengers; it was converted to fuel oil at the same time. On 22 January 1922, Empress of Scotland embarked on her first voyage from Southampton to New York. On 22 April 1922, she made her second trans-Atlantic voyage, sailing the Southampton-Cherbourg-Quebec route. On 14 June 1922 she transferred to the Hamburg-Southampton-Cherbourg-Quebec service. In 1923, she was involved in a collision with SS Bonus at Hamburg. In 1926, Empress was refitted again, this time with accommodations for first-class, second-class, tourist-class, and third-class passengers. In 1927, another refit resulted in first-class, tourist-class, and third-class accommodations. On 11 October 1930, Empress of Scotland made her last voyage from Southampton to Cherbourg and Quebec. When the new came into service, Empress of Scotland was sold for scrap. She was gutted by a fire at the shipbreaker's yard at Blyth on 10 December 1930. She broke in two and sank. Later the breaker's yard raised the pieces, and the full scrapping of the hulks was completed by 1933. ==See also== * List of ocean liners * List of ships in British Columbia ==Notes== ==References== * Michael, Paul.

Jimenez was a member of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) paramilitary group which demobilized between 2005 and 2007. Jimenez ordered the assassination of numerous people in the region of the Santander and North Santander specially in the city of Barrancabermeja where his organization confronted and defeated the National Liberation Army (ELN) for the control of the territory. Jimenez was the commander in chief of the Central Bolívar Bloc of the AUC. El Universal: Lista extradición de ‘Macaco’ ==Drug lord and paramilitary leader== Jimenez was first captured by Colombian authorities in January 2002 at El Dorado International Airport arriving in a flight from Venezuela. Jimenez was then wanted for homicide and concert to commit crimes. Colombian intelligence service Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad (DAS) classified Jimenez as third in command of the AUC and personal collaborator of Carlos Castaño. After being released from prison, Jimenez sought refuge in the southern region of the Department of Bolívar, where he began to control clandestine airstrips and cocaine laboratories. According to a report by the Colombian National Police, Jimenez also established similar cocaine complexes in Putumayo, Caqueta, Bajo Cauca Antioquia and the Catatumbo region. His main area of operation was the Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis region, where he laundered illegal drug trade money. The Colombian National Police also pointed Jimenez as the Chief of a \\"Charging Office\\" or \\"officina de cobro\\" Colombian slang term which refers to a criminal organizations' center of operations and which was related to the Norte del Valle Cartel. By 2002 Jimenez was considered one of the replacements of drug lord Luis Hernando Gómez Bustamante aka \\"Rasguño\\". ===Santa Fe de Ralito=== In 2006 the Colombian government brokered a deal with the AUC paramilitary groups and negotiated a peace accord in the village of Santa Fe de Ralito, Department of Córdoba, in northern Colombia. Most of the paramilitary leaders were concentrated in the area and Jimenez became a spokesman for the organization, along with Vicente Castaño. Two months after concentrating in Santa Fe de Ralito as a paramilitary leader, the Colombian National Police occupied his main campsites, including one known as \\"Villa Macaco\\"; a military and cocaine complex with a capacity to harbor some 250 men and had a satellite communication system. The Colombian police confiscated some 20 million Colombian pesos, weapons, 4,850 gallons of chemicals and two tons of solid chemicals for illegal drug processing were destroyed. Authorities also found an accounting book which detailed the money transactions of Jimenez. Jimenez demobilized with the Central Bolívar Bloc of the AUC in early 2005 and was jailed under the terms of the Law of Peace and Justice which pardoned time in jail if the paramilitary groups collaborated with authorities telling the truth about their crimes and economically \\"repairing\\" the victims or their families. The Central Bolívar Bloc of the AUC had at this time approximately six thousand men. El Pais (Colombia): El Presidente autorizó extradición de 'Macaco' ==Crime investigations== Jimenez has active processes in the United States and Colombia for money laundering, drug trafficking and support for terrorist organizations. In Colombia Jimenez also has an accusation resolution submitted by the Attorney General of Colombia National Unit for Human Rights as responsible for the assassination in February 2001 of the regional ombudsman Iván Ramírez Luciani and four other people. Another accusation was the assassination in Cúcuta of the director of the Free University of Colombia on February 12, 2001. El Colombiano: Macaco, uno de los negociadores de las Auc The Colombian National Police also accused Jimenez of being the mastermind behind the armed assault rescue operation of hitman Jorge Iván Laverde aka \\"El Iguano\\" extracted from a Police protected clinic in the city of Cúcuta. El Colombiano: Macaco, uno de los negociadores de las Auc ==Extradition to the United States== Colombian authorities proved that Jimenez remained active in the illegal drug trade while jailed under the terms of the Law of Peace and Justice. Fuerza Aérea Colombiana: \\"Macaco\\" aún delinquía desde Itagüí The government determined that Jimenez lost his benefits as paramilitary leader and decided to authorize his extradition to the United States. La Nacion (Colombia): TUTELA FRENA EXTRADICIÓN DE ‘MACACO’ A Colombian judicial instrument known as tutela was used then by the victims of the paramilitaries claiming that Jimenez had told very little the truth about their disappeared family members and conditioned the extradition if only Jimenez confessed his crimes and paid reparation. On April 10, 2008 the \\"tutela\\" defended by the Supreme Court of Colombia temporarily upheld the extradition of Jimenez while the government of Álvaro Uribe pressed for Jimenez prompt extradition. After Colombia's top judicial panel overturned the Supreme Court's decision on May 7, 2008, the Colombian government immediately put \\"Macaco\\" on a DEA plane to Washington. ==Trial in the United States== Jiménez first appeared before the Colombia State Court on May 7, 2008, almost immediately after being transferred from Bogotá. The Prosecution accused him of terrorism and conspiring to import cocaine into the United States. Jiménez appointed lawyers Rick Diaz from Miami and Donna Newman from New York City as his lawyers and pleaded not guilty. Macaco was refused bail, because of a \\"high risk of escape\\", despite arguments by the defense the accused could stay with relatives, currently living in the United States. The judge turned down the defendant's US$ 1 million bail offer. On June 14, 2010, the Center for Justice & Accountability along with the law firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati instituted a civil action in the Southern District of Florida against Macaco alleging torture, extrajudicial killing, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The case was brought under the Alien Tort Statute and the Torture Victim Protection Act. On November 9, 2011, Macaco was sentenced to 33 years in prison for Drug Trafficking and Narco-Terrorism. Following his cooperation with US authorities, leading them to several other arrests and extraditions, the former paramilitary chief was allowed to serve only 11 of his 33-year prison sentence. On July 20, 2019, Jiménez was arrested on conspiracy and dozens of homicide charges and subsequently extradited back to Colombia. ==References== ==External links== *treas.gov Carlos Mario Jimenez Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:People from Risaralda Department Category:Members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia Category:Warlords Category:Colombian drug traffickers Category:Colombian murderers Category:People extradited from Colombia to the United States ","title":"Carlos Mario Jiménez"},{"id":"17301603","text":"Rishi Bhat (born May 19, 1986) is an American former child actor and internet entrepreneur. ==Personal life== Bhat is of Indian descent.

Sorevnovaniya Island () is an uninhabited island in the southern region of the Kara Sea. This island is located in the Sorevnovaniya Bay, east of the Mikhailov Peninsula. The main island is roughly triangular. It has a length of 8 km, an average width of 3.5 km, and a small lake in its midst. This island lies very close to the coast of the Taymyr Peninsula; it is separated from it by a sound that is only 0.5 km in width. There are two smaller islands in Sorevnovaniya Island's immediate vicinity. The offshore island, Ostrov Yezh, is 1 km in length and is located 2 km to the west of its southwestern cape. The other is slightly larger and lies to the southeast of the main island's southern tip, within a small enclosed bay. These islands and the nearby coast are in the desolate tundra regions of Siberia. The sea surrounding the islands is covered with pack ice with some polynias in the long winter and the climate is harsh even in the summer. Sorevnovaniya Island belongs to the Krasnoyarsk Krai administrative division of the Russian Federation. It is also part of the Great Arctic State Nature Reserve – the largest nature reserve of Russia and one of the biggest in the world. ==History== The area around these islands was explored by Otto Sverdrup on ship Eklips in 1914 while he was searching for Brusilov and Rusanov. Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, the ill-fated members of Roald Amundsen's Northern expedition in 1919, were lost in the vastness of this bleak and uninhabited area, where survival is difficult. In 1921, a Soviet-Norwegian expedition looking for Tessem and Knutsen found the remains of a campfire with charred bones near this area. These were initially assumed to be the remains of one of the Norwegian men. Recent evidence, however, points out that this campfire had been probably left behind by the similarly ill-fated Rusanov expedition. ==References== *William Barr, The Last Journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, 1919 *Geographic data *Geographic and Geospatial Information *Nature Reserve Category:Islands of the Kara Sea Category:Islands of Krasnoyarsk Krai Category:Uninhabited islands of Russia ","title":"Sorevnovaniya Island"},{"id":"17301614","text":"Stormy Monday, also known as I'd Rather Drink Muddy Water, is the debut album of R&B; singer Lou Rawls, released in 1962 on Capitol Records.

This prevents recognition and destruction of self host cells, making it a type of negative selection or central tolerance. Central tolerance prevents B and T lymphocytes from reacting to self. Thus, clonal deletion can help protect individuals against autoimmunity. Clonal deletion is thought to be the most common type of negative selection. It is one method of immune tolerance. == Discovery and Function == A visual representation of the process of clonal deletion in the primary lymphoid organs Frank Macfarlane Burnet proposed autoreactive cells would be terminated before maturation in order to prevent further proliferation in his study in 1959. There are millions of B and T cells inside the body, both created within the bone marrow and the latter matures in the thymus, hence the T. Each of these lymphocytes express specificity to a particular epitope, or the part of an antigen to which B cell and T cell receptors recognize and bind. There is a large diversity of epitopes recognized and, as a result, it is possible for some B and T lymphocytes to develop with the ability to recognize self. B and T cells are presented with self antigen after developing receptors while they are still in the primary lymphoid organs. Those cells that demonstrate a high affinity for this self antigen are often subsequently deleted so they cannot create progeny, which helps protect the host against autoimmunity. Thus, the host develops a tolerance for this antigen, or a self tolerance. == Location == B and T lymphocytes are tested for their affinity for self MHC/peptide complexes before leaving the primary lymphoid organs and entering into the periphery. If they demonstrate high affinity for self-antigen, one method of preventing autoimmunity is through clonal deletion. This is where the lymphocyte would receive apoptotic signals from antigen-presenting cell (APCs). It is important to note that not all lymphocytes expressing high affinity for self-antigen undergo clonal deletion. B lymphocytes can also participate in light chain receptor editing, VH gene replacement, or be released and later undergo negative selection in the periphery. T lymphocytes can instead undergo clonal arrest, clonal anergy, and clonal editing. If autoreactive cells escape clonal deletion in either the thymus or the bone marrow, there are mechanisms in the periphery involving T regulatory cells to prevent the host from obtaining an autoimmune disease. However, for both B and T cells in the primary lymphoid organs, clonal deletion is the most common form of negative selection. === B Cells === B cells demonstrating high affinity for self cells can undergo clonal deletion within the bone marrow. This occurs after the functional B-cell receptor (BCR) is assembled. It is possible for B cells with high self affinity to go undeleted because they require activation signals and stimulation from autoreactive T cells. Such T cells are often removed via clonal deletion, leaving autoreactive B cells unstimulated and unactivated. These B cells do not pose a threat, even in the periphery, because they cannot be activated without an autoreactive T cell to stimulate them. === T Cells === Between 2% and 5% of T cells develop auto-reactive receptors. Most of these undergo negative selection by clonal deletion. ==== Thymic Cortex ==== T cells that show a high affinity for self MHC/peptide complexes can undergo clonal deletion in the thymus. Thymic dendritic cells and macrophages appear to be responsible for the apoptotic signals sent to autoreactive T cells in the thymic cortex. ==== Thymic Medulla ==== T cells also have the opportunity to undergo clonal deletion within the thymic medulla if they express high affinity for self MHC/peptide complexes. Positive selection occurs in the thymic cortex, which suggests it is possible for a cell to undergo positive selection within the cortex and then negative selection in the medulla via clonal deletion. Epithelial cells are responsible for clonal deletion within the medulla. These medullary epithelial cells express an autoimmune regulator (AIRE) which allows these cells to present proteins specific to other parts of the body to T lymphocytes. This helps eliminate autoreactive T cells that recognize a protein from a specific body part. == Complete vs. Incomplete Clonal Deletion == A visual representation of incomplete and complete clonal deletion Complete clonal deletion results in apoptosis of all B and T lymphocytes expressing high affinity for self antigen. Incomplete clonal deletion results in apoptosis of most autoreactive B and T lymphocytes. Complete clonal deletion can lead to opportunities for molecular mimicry, which has adverse effects for the host. Therefore, incomplete clonal deletion allows for a balance between the host’s ability to recognize foreign antigens and self antigens. == Methods of Exploitation == === Molecular Mimicry === Clonal deletion provides an incentive for microorganisms to develop epitopes similar to proteins found within the host. Because most autoresponsive cells undergo clonal deletion, this allows microorganisms with epitopes similar to host antigen to escape recognition and detection by T and B lymphocytes. However, if detected, this can lead to an autoimmune response because of the similarity of the epitopes on the microorganism and host antigen. Examples of this are seen in Streptococcus pyogenes and Borrelia burgdorferi. It is possible, but uncommon for molecular mimicry to lead to an autoimmune disease. === Superantigens === Superantigens are composed of viral or bacterial proteins and can hijack the clonal deletion process when expressed in the thymus because they resemble the T-cell receptor (TCR) interaction with self MHC/peptides. Thus, through this process, superantigens can effectively prevent maturation of cognate T cells. == References == ==External links== * Category:Immunology ","title":"Clonal deletion"},{"id":"17301726","text":"The Cono Este is one of the six areas that make up the Lima Metropolitan Area.

During drought and famine they frequently abandoned the land and moved to other places. Hence, the land ownership was not a permanent concept. They were taxed by the rulers of the day based on the number of the cattle and area of the land cultivated. After the famine of 1783, many cultivators abandoned the villages and migrated elsewhere, and some land was sold by the owners. Slowly prominent farmers came into the possession of large lands, and they acquired the status of proprietors of the village estate and were recorded as such during the settlement of 1840-41 by the British Raj. These estates came to be known as zamindari or pattidari tenures, most influential and the largest estate-holders among them in due time became zaildars and lambardars. The British even used them as a localised dispute ombudsman and gave these big zamindars some moral policing rights. During the settlement of 1840-41, the tenants were classified into three classes: (a) those who had held land continuously for many years at a fixed rent and were not liable to ejectment, (b) the tenants in bhaiachara (brotherhood) villages who paid rent at the same rate as the members of brotherhood and who so long as they paid this rate were never ejected, (c) and those who cultivated from year to year under fresh agreement. These tenancies were further classified during 1863 settlement and a definite status was fixed on different classes of tenants. The ordinary division into tenants with or without right of occupancy was adopted. Thus, the concept of the formal permanent ownership of the land came into being, and became a legalized and formally documented. ==India== === The Land Revenue System === Each estate is represented by one or more lambardars in its dealings with the government. Estates are grouped into patwar circles under the charge of a Patwari, while 15 to 20 circles form the charge of a Kanungo, whose duty is to supervise the work of Patwaris. An estate is the unit of land revenue administration for the collection of tax. Each estate is usually equal to a village. Each estate is individually assessed by a Patwari and its record of rights and register of fiscal and agricultural statistics maintained separately. All the proprietors are by law jointly responsible for payment of land revenue. === Land Reforms of India === After India's independence in 1947, government enacted several land reforms such as the assessment of permissible area in relation to a family instead of an individual, and reduced the permissible area to the set limit (e.g. to 7.25 hectares in Punjab) of land under assured irrigation capable of growing at least 1 crop in a year or 21.8 hectares in respect of any other land including banjar and land under orchards. In addition to legally capping the amount land holding by the government, the voluntary Bhoodan movement of 1950s and 60s also led to the donation of the land ownership from rich owners to the landless tenants. Government also undertook aggressive land consolidation and standardization of killa (agricultural plots of one acre each). ===Legal description=== In India, each state has its own land acts governing the system of Nambardari. Following acts are applicable to the states of Punjab, Haryana Himachal Pradesh Delhi Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh. ====The Land Holdings Tax Act, 1973 ==== Before the Land Holdings Tax Act, 1973, was enacted, the lambardar was paid pachhotra (commission) at the rate of 5 per cent of land revenue. In this act various levies were consolidated into land holdings tax and lambardars' share was fixed at 3 per cent of the new tax revenue. ==== Present remuneration ==== Presently, remuneration varies from state to state, some states pay no wages or commission, some pay an honorarium and while others pay nothing. Under the Digital India initiative, some states have taken to cutting delays in paying honorarium, set as percentage of the revenue collected from the respective estate, via the regular direct electronic transfer, the Government of Haryana is one such example.Nambardars to get honorarium in their accounts, The Tribune, 3 July 2017. In 2019, Government of Haryana raised the monthly honorarium for lambardars from INR1,500 to INR3,000.Hry govt to double monthly honorarium of Lambardars to Rs 3,000, Outlook megazine, 4 Feb 2019. ==Pakistan== ===Legal description=== The lambardari system in Pakistan is based on the pre-partition Indian land revenue system. After the 1947, both nations have made changes to the land revenue acts, leading to some differences in the practice and implementation, though the basic concept remains same. India has undertaken aggressive land reforms, capping the ceiling of the area of land holding, and distribution of the ownership of excess land above the ceiling limit to the cultivators tenants thus reducing the percentage of tenants by converting them into the permanent owners. These reforms are pending in Pakistan, leading to the landownership in limited hands. ====The West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 1967==== * Section 4 (28): Village Officer: person appointed under this Act whose duty is to collect, or to supervise the collection of, the revenue of an estate and include Kanungos, Patwaris, Service Centre Officials and Headmen (Lambardars). * Section 36: The Board of Revenue may, with the previous approval of Government, make rules to regulate the appointments, duties, emoluments, punishments, suspension and removal of Village Officers.http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/pbrev_act87_II.htm ====The West Pakistan Land Revenue Rules, 1968==== Rule 16. Number of headmen. # A sufficient number of headmen shall be appointed to every estate, and this number when once fixed shall not be increased except by or under the order of the Commissioner. # Except as provided in Rule 21, if an estate or a considerable portion thereof is owned by Government, the headmen may be appointed from among the tenants and in other estates he shall be appointed from among the land owners. # The lessee of an uncultivated or forest estate owned by Government shall, during the currency of his lease, be the headmen thereof. ===Feudals in the Senate === After the independence, unlike India, Pakistan did not undertake the land aggressive land reforms to transfer the land ownership from zamindars to cultivators. As a result, the majority of the agrarian land holding still remains in the hands of very few powerful zamindars, who now hold sway over the political power and refuse to reform the land ownership to continue their hold over wealth and power. Almost all elected leaders of the state have been from the landed and feudal gentry in many cases holding the title of lambardar. That has resulted in a feudal system perpetrating the Pakistan Senate and its elected representatives. Most Presidents and prime ministers also have been from feudal stock, with the exception of martial law administrators and generals, who led coups. Lambardar is semi hereditary status in Punjab, Pakistan. Zamindar with considerable land holdings and Hereditary status are usually serving as Lambardar.

It is officially classified as a Class 1 river by the Japanese government and is one of four Class 1 rivers that flow solely through Mie; it is the longest among these four. It is known to be especially pristine. In the government's annual water quality study, the Miya River has been rated the cleanest Class 1 river in the country five times since 2000. The river's source is on Mount Ōdaigahara in the town of Ōdai, Mie Prefecture, where it flows through the Ōsugi Valley. It then flows northeast-wards down the mountains and passes through a number of dams before reaching the tea fields of central Mie and finally passes through the city of Ise before reaching its delta and flowing into Ise Bay. The white rocks used in the Oshiraishi-mochi festival, an event held in honor of the periodic rebuilding of nearby Ise Grand Shrine, are taken from the Miya River's shores. ==Course== ;Mie Prefecture: :Ōdai • Taki • Taiki • Watarai • Tamaki • Ise ==Flooding== Some of the areas along the river's course, especially the Ōsugi Valley near the source, see a considerable amount of rain each year and thus it is very prone to flooding. Even with modern flood prevention, minor damage from flooding is still seen along parts of the river each year. Flooding from the river was so severe in the past that it was one of the first rivers in Japan to receive a floodbank during the Edo era. The magistrate in Yamada (modern Ise) during the Tokugawa Shogunate felt that the river needed to be controlled because of its proximity to Ise Grand Shrine, Japan's holiest shrine; he thus ordered work to be done along the river to alleviate the problem. These alterations, which were primarily done along the Yamada-side of the river, were effective in reducing flood damage on that side however increased flooding problems on the other side. Due to the changes made, a bridge across the river was not completed until the Meiji era. The only significant flooding in recent history was the result of typhoon #21 in 2004, in which six people died. These deaths occurred in the former village of Miyagawa, and this disaster was a prime factor behind the village being absorbed by the town of Ōdai soon after. ==Wildlife== The Miya River is home to over 90 different species of wildlife. There are fishing operations for some of the more prevalent ones, including eel (unagi), conger eel (anago), and sweetfish (ayu). ==Recreation== Cherry blossoms along the Miya River floodbank Other than fishing, the Miya River and its banks provides some recreational opportunities. Near the source, the river flows through the Ōsugi Valley, which is officially listed as one of the top three ravines in Japan for sight- seeing. Further down the river, there are some parks along the riverbanks. There are cherry blossom parks in both Watarai and Ise, with the one in Ise having the most sakura trees in all of Mie. Many people have cherry blossom viewing parties here during the blooming season in early April. A large fireworks show is held each July at the park in Ise as well.

In 1892, Nystrom had become a member of the general board of what was then called the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Association. She became its corresponding secretary in 1904, and then its treasurer. She continued in this position until 5 April 1905, when she was chosen by new president Martha H. Tingey as the second counselor in the organization. Nystrom was a counselor to Tingey until she was released on 15 July 1923 because of her move to Green River, Wyoming. She was succeeded in her position by Lucy Grant Cannon. Nystrom returned to live in Salt Lake City in 1929. Nystrom was a member of Susan B. Anthony's National Council of Women and was a delegate from Utah for to the suffragist organization's conventions in 1908 and 1909. ==Publications== *Nystrom, Mae Taylor \\"The Y.L.M.I.A. under President Elmina S.

The jail was built on the site of a previous jail house dating to 1792 and salvaged materials were used extensively in the new construction. The present Bristol County Jail consists of a by center hallway in a -story stone structure topped with a gable roof. The jail accommodated both the inmates and the jailer's family. The first floor is believed to have been the family's parlor, dining room and kitchen on the west side and the east side the jailer's reception room, office and storage room. The second floor housed the family's bedrooms and the inmates' cells, with low, medium and maximum security cells. The maximum security cells in the southeast portion of the jail had no heat, light or sanitary facilities and were enclosed by exterior stone walls and built atop thick floor timbers supported by solid brick wall and further supported by a fieldstone wall from the cellar. In 1859, a rectangular by two-story rear addition was added to common southeast wall of the jail. Made of cut granite blocks and topped with a flat roof, the addition added five cells on each of its two levels. The jail was discontinued by the State of Rhode Island in June 1957 and the Bristol Historical Society (later the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society) leased the property following a fire at the Rogers Free Library. The Bristol Historical Society removed partitions in the first floor and added new access points as part of its renovations, including the removal of the internal east chimney. However, the building retains much of its unaltered interior features, and the jail cells are used by the Society as a public exhibit. The Bristol County Jail was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and currently serves as the Historical Society headquarters. == Design == The current Bristol County Jail was constructed in 1828 to replace a previous jail erected on the same site in 1792. The new structure was a by -story stone structure topped with a gable roof. According to the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society the stone came from the ballast of Bristol ships. Material from the original jail was used in the new structure, including the clapboards which were split and reused as laths. The new jail and was constructed for a cost of $3,900. The front facade is five bays wide and faces north on Court Street. The facade originally featured a recessed Greek Revival entrance that was replaced with a newer door and extended by a Victorian hood. At the time of its National Register of Historic Places nomination in 1973, all the windows except one on the second story were changed from the twelve-over-eight and twelve-over twelve sashes to the two- over-two Victorian sash. In 1959, the Bristol Historical Society removed the internal east chimney on the first floor as part of renovations. The 1828 construction features a central hall with three rooms on the east and west sides of roughly symmetrical construction with chimneys at the intersection of the front and middle rooms. The first floor chimneys were flanked by doors allowing access to the other rooms and storage on the other side. The layout and usage of the jail is not known for certain, but it is believed that the rooms to the west were used by the jailer and his family. The first room as a parlor, the middle as the dining room and the rear room as the kitchen. As part of the renovations in 1959, the Society changed the parlor to a research room, the dining room into a library and added a door to the stairway from the kitchen. The front research room and library retain the original fireplaces, pine floorboards and closets, but the connecting passage between the two rooms were changed to a bathroom. The east side of the jail is believed to have been used by the jailer for his occupational duties, with the front room as a public reception room and the middle room as his office. The rear room in the back may have been used for record or other storage. After leasing the property, the Society removed the partitions in the rooms that separated the rooms from each other. The second floor is arranged differently from the first floor, with the rooms above the front parlor and reception room believed to have been the bedroom for the jailer and his family. The west room is described as \\"quite elegant in its simplicity with its original wainscot and cornice of run mouldings\\". The middle room may have been a low-security cell; evidence of this comes from the two windows which have iron bar markings in the granite sills. Also, the NRHP nomination states that the room, wide by long, may have been divided into two cells. The rear allows access to a small hallway and to the attic, but this was described as being a later modification. The east front bedroom is divided in two with a partition, giving the eastern side of the building four rooms on the second floor, with the two middle rooms being used as medium-security cells. The maximum security cells were located in the back of the building, in the south-east corner. These cells are constructed of wood and walled in by stone walls and iron doors. The maximum security cells had no heat, light or bathrooms; air was only able to flow into the room through a slit in the stone wall and a peep hole in the iron door. Underneath the cells were two courses of by timbers superimposed on top of one another. These timbers are believed to have been sourced from the original 1792 jail. The timbers are supported by a brick wall and by a fieldstone wall in the cellar. The exterior stone walls are thick on the front and west exterior, but are for the walls that support the maximum security cells. As part of the alterations made by the Society, the solid brick wall was removed and is now supported by steel beams. The third floor is a single, unparitioned room that was likely used for storage. The cellar of the jail has a chimney on the west that has several ovens, including a beehive oven, and was not partitioned except for the fieldstone foundation required to support the cells in the southeast corner. In 1859, a rectangular by two-story rear addition was added to the jail. Made of cut granite blocks and topped with a flat roof, the addition added five cells on each level and two hallways with a cast iron staircase on the left hand side. The addition was not in perfect alignment with the original common wall, and protrudes east. Access is gained from the original center hallway and heading outside to the additions' front door, a second access point from within the original building is a steel door on the common wall. The inside of the new cell block has a wood plank corridor and iron railings with tall windows, opposite the cells, that face south. == Bristol Historical and Preservation Society == Founded in 1936, the Bristol Historical Society is committed to saving, collecting, and promoting historical research and interest in southern New England, with a specific focus on the town of Bristol. Originally, the Bristol Historical Society was located in the Rogers Free Library, but a fire destroyed a part of the collections on July 27, 1957. The jail, which had been abandoned by the state in June of the same year, was selected by the Society as its new home and leased from the state. In 1972, the Bristol Historical Society was renamed to the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society to reflect its preservation interests. In 1973, the Society purchased the Bristol County Jail from the state. The Society restored the jail cells through a matching grant from the National Park Service and opened the cells as a public exhibit. == Importance == The Bristol County Jail was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The jail is significant as a relatively unaltered historic jail that was important to the 18th-century Bristol County. It is also significant in that it currently serves as the home of the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society. The Society also houses its library and collections in the jail and runs a small museum shop from the building. == See also == *National Register of Historic Places listings in Bristol County, Rhode Island *List of Registered Historic Places in Rhode Island ==References== ==External links== *Bristol Historical and Preservation Society Category:Jails on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island Category:Museums in Bristol County, Rhode Island Category:Government buildings completed in 1828 Category:Defunct prisons in Rhode Island Category:Prison museums in the United States Category:History museums in Rhode Island Category:Buildings and structures in Bristol, Rhode Island Category:Jails in Rhode Island Category:National Register of Historic Places in Bristol County, Rhode Island Category:Historic district contributing properties in Rhode Island Category:1828 establishments in Rhode Island ","title":"Bristol County Jail"},{"id":"17302098","text":"The Peugeot Type 36 was a new model from Peugeot made in 1901 and 1902.

It was established and is based in Dharamshala, India. The creation of this democratically elected body has been one of the major changes that the 14th Dalai Lama brought about in his efforts to introduce a democratic system of administration. Today, the parliament consists of 45 members: ten members each from Ü-Tsang, Kham, and Amdo, the three traditional provinces of Tibet; the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism and the traditional Bön faith elect two members each; four members are elected by Tibetans in the west: two from Europe, one from Australasia, one from North America and one from Canada. The Tibetan Parliament in Exile is headed by a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members amongst themselves. Any Tibetan who has reached the age of 25 has the right to contest elections to the parliament. The elections are held every five years and any Tibetan who has reached the age of 18 is entitled to vote. Sessions of the parliament are held twice every year, with an interval of six months between the sessions. When the parliament is not in session, there is a standing committee of eleven members: two members from each province, one member from each religious denomination. The members of the parliament undertake periodic tours to Tibetan settlements to make an assessment of people's overall conditions. On their return, they bring to the notice of the administration all the grievances and matters which need attention. The Tibetan Parliament in Exile also keeps in touch with people through local parliaments established in thirty-eight major Tibetan communities. The Charter provides for the establishment of a local parliament in communities having a population of at least 160. Local parliaments are scaled-down replicas of the Tibetan Parliament in Exile. They keep an eye on the activities of their respective settlement/welfare officers. They also make laws for their respective communities according to the latter's felt-needs. Laws passed by local parliaments must be implemented by their respective settlement/welfare officers. == Historical background == ===Background (before 1959)=== The Dalai Lama had, in fact, initiated the process of democratization in Tibet itself. In his autobiography \\"My Land and My People\\", he recalls how he appointed a Reforms Committee of eminent citizens to redress the inequalities prevailing in Tibet at the time; but the reforms were obstructed by the Chinese invasion. In his Foreword to the constitution for Tibet drafted in 1963, the Dalai Lama stated: \\"Even prior to my departure from Tibet in March 1959, I had come to the conclusion that in the changing circumstances of the modern world, the system of governance in Tibet must be modified and amended so as to allow the elected representatives of the people to play a more effective role in guiding and shaping the social and economic policies of the State. I also firmly believed that this could only be done through democratic institutions based on social and economic justice.\\" Before the Chinese occupation of Tibet, important decisions were taken by the Tsogdu (National Assembly), in which monks and other societal groups were represented along with the Kalons (Cabinet Minister) and other officials. Though, no direct elections were held, rather, members were selected as representatives of communities and trade groups. Thus, the Tsogdu was made up of the abbots of the three great monasteries and lay representatives of various classes and professions such as: artisans, tradesmen, soldiers and boatmen. Thus, the Tibetans had little or no experience of democratic governance when they came to India. However, one of the first pronouncements made by the Dalai Lama after arriving in India showed that he had already envisaged a process of democratization that would maintain close links with the land from which the Tibetans had been forced to flee. ===Establishment of the Commission of Tibetan People's Deputies=== In February 1960, at Bodh Gaya (where Lord Buddha achieved enlightenment), The Dalai Lama outlined a detailed program designed to introduce the exiled Tibetans about the practice of democratic. He advised them to set up an elected body with three exile representatives each from the three provinces and one each from the four religious schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Elections were duly held and the first elected representative body in Tibetan's history \\"The Commission of Tibetan People's Deputies (CTPD)\\" took oath on 2 September 1960. This historic date is observed by the Tibetan exile community as Tibetan Democracy Day. On 4 September 1960, The Dalai Lama explained to the elected members about the importance of fully functioning polity which should be rooted in traditional values but adapted to the widely accepted modern democratic system of governance. With this end in view, The Dalai Lama provided the agenda for the meeting. For the first time ever, a weeklong joint meeting of the elected Deputies and Cabinet Minister was held to discuss the positive aspects and the shortcomings of the existing Tibetan polity, the future course of action, the expansion of the existing departments of the Central Tibetan Administration and the appointment of civil servants. The members proposed a list of 29 names to administer the Councils for Religion, Home, Foreign Relations, and Education; the Office of Finance, Information and Security, as well as the Civil Service Commission. However, the Commission at that time had no secretariat and the facilities for its functioning were limited. The Deputies were engaged to various departments of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) to gain an experience, while the supervision of the infant administration was entrusted to The Dalai Lama and the Kalons. This practice was followed till the Fourth CTPD. The Deputies met twice each month to assess the situation and discuss important issues. The Deputies, members of the Kashag (Cabinet) and the administrative heads of the departments met as the National Working Committee once every six months to present reports and review activities. The Chairmanship was on the rotation basis among the members. ===1963 \\"Constitution\\"=== On 10 March 1961, the 2nd anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising Day, The Dalai Lama formulated a draft constitution of Tibet; he sought views from the people and their elected representatives to suggest amendments and for the improvement. On 10 October 1961, a synoptic version of a draft constitution was circulated among the Tibetan diaspora. Settlement Officer, the Deputies and the civil servants unanimously appreciated it and pledged to follow its provisions, which incorporated traditional Tibetan values within modern democratic norms. However, they expressed inability to accept the provisions which curtailed the powers of The Dalai Lama. Eventually, on 10 March 1963, The Dalai Lama promulgated a constitution consisting of 10 chapters and 77 articles. He also made structural changes to the governmental institutions and the appointment of civil servants. The term of the elected Assembly Deputies was set at three years. It was also decided that there should be an elected Chairman and a Vice Chairman of the Commission. On 8 February 1964, rules were also framed concerning the election and terms of office for a three Gharthue (Local Assembly Members) in the larger settlements. The members were to be a representative from each of the three provinces elected directly by the people to assist the Settlement Officer in overseeing development activities. For the Second and Third CTPD, the total strength of the elected representatives was increased from 13 to 17 with one additional seat reserved for a woman from each of the three provinces, while The Dalai Lama began nominating an eminent Tibetan as per the new constitution. In 1965, the role of the Deputies was enhanced when the commission was entrusted with the authority to abolish the traditional practice of appointing both monks and lay officials to each office, and to abolish the various hereditary titles and prerogatives. The CTPD restructured the rules of public service and framed new ranks and designations. By the end of the Third CTPD's term in 1969, the Deputies had been authorized to oversee the work of the CTA's departments. On 3 May 1966, a separate Commission house and secretariat was set up. The Commission meets twice a month, and the presentation of bi-annual report and reviewing the meeting of the National Working Committee continued. On 10 March 1970, the First Annual General Meeting (replacing the biannual meetings) was held in conjunction with the anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising Day. People's representatives, administrators at all levels and monastic representatives participated in this meeting. This practice was followed till 1981. The first photo exhibition to showcase the achievements of the Tibetan refugees in agriculture, animal husbandry, cottage industries and religious institution was also held alongside. The Deputies held their Commission sessions, scrutinized the work reports of the CTA departments and held the Kashag responsible for lapses in redressing public grievances. The Commission, thus, acted as a bridge between the people and the CTA.During the Fourth and Fifth CTPD, The Dalai Lama did not nominate any members in the Assembly; hence, the number of Deputies came down to 16. In 1972, a group of public- spirited Tibetans from Varanasi approached the administration with a ten-point memorandum and sought permission to visit the settlements to rouse the Tibetan public's support to their action plan for the cause of Tibet's freedom. The permission was granted and in July 1972, the preliminary convention of the Tibetan Freedom Movement was held. In order to strengthen their legitimizing bond with the CTA, all Tibetans above the age of six were obliged to pay at least one rupee per month as a form of voluntary contribution. For this purpose the Tibetan Freedom Movement sub-committee, known as Bhod Rawang Denpai Legul (BRDL) was set up in each Tibetan community across the world. This formalized the commitment of the entire exiled community to the democratic functioning of the CTA, including their participation and responsibility for it. The members of the Tibetan Freedom Movement sub- committees replaced the Gharthue. In 1973, during the Fifth CTPD, the Fourth Annual General Meeting was held in conjunction with the second photo exhibition. In the same year on 25 August, new rules for the recruitment, appointment and transfer of civil servants was framed and announced. Till the Fifth CTPD, the Election Commission adopted many different ways and means to elect the Deputies of the CTPD. In 1974, the election system was reviewed and positive elements from the Indian electoral system were incorporated. On 21 November 1974, a new set of electoral rules was put into the place; it includes the seats reservation for women in CTPD. Till 1975, the Kashag was fully responsible for the budget of the departments and there was no financial accountability to the CTPD. In 1975, new rules were framed regarding the control of the CTA's budget. It was decided that the income and expenditure of all the departments of the CTA should be approved and sanctioned during the annual meeting of the National Working Committee chaired by the Chairman of CTPD. In the same year, during the National Annual General Meeting, it was decided that the 2nd day of September should be commemorated annually as the founding day of Tibetan Democracy and declared a national holiday. In 1977, during the 8th Annual General Meeting, the 3rd Photo Exhibition of the Tibetan diaspora was held. In the same year, the budget session was held on 1 February for the coming financial year which starts from 1 April every year. On 5 October 1977, In addition to the four Tibetan Buddhist schools, followers of the Bon religion also came to have a separate Deputy, hence, the strength of Deputies were increased to 17 during the 6th and 7th CTPD. ===The Assembly of Tibetan People's Deputies and electoral reforms=== In 1979, the term of the Cabinet Ministers was fixed for 5 years, and The Dalai Lama was entrusted to appoint or dismiss any of the Cabinet Ministers. At the time of the 6th CTPD session, the Commission of Tibetan People's Deputies (CTPD) was renamed as the Assembly of Tibetan People's Deputies (ATPD). It was decided during the Annual General Meeting of 1981 that this meeting would now be held once every two years rather than annually. Building of the Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration, Dharamsala Since 1974, the Tibetan Youth Congress has been carrying out a persistent campaign, urging that the Deputies to the ATPD be elected by the combined electorate of all the three provinces. In 1981, the High-Level Standing Committee decided by a majority vote to hold the election to the 8th ATPD as petitioned by the Youth Congress and this was duly announced by the Election Commission. But the Do-toe public then protested that the existing system was adequate. As a result, the High-Level Standing Committee reviewed its decision and decided that a one-time voting would be held for the 8th ATPD and The Dalai Lama would then nominate the members from the primaries. The Dalai Lama reduced the number of provincial Deputies to two each from three provinces and one eminent Tibetan besides the 5 Deputies from the religious traditions, which brought the total strength to 12. As entrusted, The Dalai Lama selected all the members of the ATPD from the list determined by the primary election voting. In 1984, the Election Commission announced the election schedule for the 9th ATPD. Again, the Do-toe public demanded for the continuance of the previous system, therefore, on the advice of The Dalai Lama, a meeting was held under the auspices of the ATPD. The meeting was attended by representatives of the provinces, the Tibetan Youth Congress and new arrivals from Tibet. And it was decided that so long as a unanimous decision could not be reached, The Dalai Lama should appoint the ATPD members. Also it was decided on the meeting that the term of the ATPD be increased to five years, and on 8 July 1985 it was announced and extended the term of the 8th ATPD by two years to make it five. ===Towards an elected head of government=== The Dalai Lama nominated all the members of the 9th ATPD. That was an interim measure proposed during the National General Assembly and approved by the High Level Standing Committee that it should continue till common acceptable solution is found. The 9th ATPD lasted only for one year, as the election for the 10th ATPD was notified. On 3 September 1988, during The Dalai Lama's first audience to the 10th ATPD, The Dalai Lama stressed that he shall not hold any state responsibility when a new government is set up in future Tibet. He also said that the members of the ATPD should be elected by the people rather than him. He further added that Tibetans should be educated about democracy and be able to shoulder more responsibilities of the government. Again, on 6 May 1989, during the General Assembly, The Dalai Lama emphasized the need for more democratic reforms, including the election of a head of the government. He suggested setting up a constitution drafting committee for this purpose. The leaders and the people of Tibet felt that their inherent faith in The Dalai Lama was more democratic than any alternative arrangement that might be set up. On this basis, they pledged to undertake democratic reforms but pleaded The Dalai Lama not to withdraw from the leadership. The Dalai Lama once again advised the Kashag to continue discussions on possible reforms. In August 1989, the Kashag convened a conference of 230 participants comprised by members of the ATPD, government officials, NGOs and representatives of new arrivals from Tibet. Following it, the Kashag circulated a five-point discussion paper and called for feedback on it from Tibetans both in exile and in Tibet. The five points were: 1) Whether to have a Prime Minister in the existing government set up. 2) Whether the Ministers should be elected or appointed as before by The Dalai Lama. 3) Whether a political party system should be introduced for government formation. 4) Whether any change should be made in the number of ATPD members and their responsibilities. 5) What other democratic changes could be made. A total of 287 suggestions were received from Tibetans inside and outside of Tibet. Then, on 11 May 1990, a Special People's Congress was called, and on the basis of suggestion received, it was decided that the ministers shall continue to be appointed by The Dalai Lama; however, the elected ATPD members no longer required approval from The Dalai Lama. Also, on that day, the Kashag and the ATPD were declared dissolved. The Dalai Lama directed participants in the Special Congress to elect an interim Kashag, to hold office until the proclamation of a new charter. ===Interegnum=== The interregnum period was from 12 May 1990 to 28 May 1991. During this period, The Dalai Lama appointed a Constitution Review Committee with instructions to draft a democratic charter for the Tibetans in exile and also to review the existing draft constitution for future Tibet. The draft charter for the Tibetans in exile was to incorporate well defined provisions based on the realities of the situation in exile although The Dalai Lama agreed to be the head of the state and government owing to the prevailing circumstances. But he emphasized that when a truly democratic system is achieve in Tibetan society then The Dalai Lama would no longer hold any official responsibility or political designation. The charter drafting committee consulted a number of Tibetan and non-Tibetan experts and scholars and came out with a documents which reflected the above directives. The draft charter was based on: the draft constitution of 1963, the Five Point Peace Plan of 1987, The Dalai Lama's address to the European Parliament in 1988, and his addresses to the 10th ATPD in 1988, the 16th General Assembly in 1989, and the Special Congress in 1990. In the years that followed, the community in exile showed extreme reluctance to accept the Dalai Lama's directives suggesting limits on his powers. However, in 1990, thirty years after initiating the democratic process, the Dalai Lama announced a dramatic change, empowering the parliament to conform the established norms of democracy. The Dalai Lama address on 11 May 1990 to the Deputies attending the 10th session of the ATPD, and other eminent Tibetans, that he is renouncing the supreme authority vested in him to approve the members of the Assembly and to supervise its functioning. Further, The Dalai Lama went on to outline proposals for expanding the membership of the assembly, electing Kalons, who were not the members of the Assembly, for giving more representation to women, and on the advisability of setting up two Houses of the legislature. He spoke on the need for a judicial tribunal to look into the people's complaints and also on other requirements of a fully functioning democracy. The future administration was thus projected as a fully democratic government capable of shouldering greater responsibilities. ===Expanded Assembly and new Charter=== On 29 May 1991, the Dalai Lama addressed the 11th ATPD on the outcome of his epochal pronouncement of the previous year. The membership of the Assembly had risen from 12 to 46, which represented from all sections of the society. 10 members each from the three traditional provinces of Tibet, namely, U-Tsang, Do-toe and Do-mey; 2 each from the four Buddhist schools and Bon; 2 from Europe, 1 from North America, and 3 nominated by The Dalai Lama as being the head of the state. When the Charter was adopted on 14 June 1991, it provided that a candidate needed to win at least 70% of the Assembly votes to be declared elected as Kalon. When the Assembly failed to elect the required seven Kalons, The Dalai Lama was urged to nominate a list of not less than double the number of Kalons to be elected. The impractical provision was amended in 1993, so that seven candidates securing the highest number of votes would be declared elected as Kalons. A Supreme Justice Commission was set up as the apex tribunal for arbitrating civil cases within the Tibetan diaspora and for interpreting the Tibetan laws. Thus, the three pillars of democracy were firmly established, ensuring a fully functioning democratic polity, with a system check and balance and accountability system. An independent Audit Commission was set up to audit the accounts of all central and local offices. An independent Public Service Commission was set up to oversee the recruitment and maintain the records of all Tibetan public servants. To oversee the election of Kalons, members of the ATPD, Settlement Officers and Local Assembly, an independent Election Commission was set up. The Assembly approves and sanctions the budget of the Government in exile presented by the Finance Minister. Though members could propose cuts or seek to raises on the recurring budget expenses, the planned budget for social welfare activities are generally approved without much discussion. However, the Kalons remain accountable for the utilization of the funds. The Assembly was empowered to impeach the Kashag, the Supreme Justice Commissioners, and the heads of the three independent bodies: Audit, Public Service and Election by two-thirds majority; and under special circumstances, even The Dalai Lama could be impeached by a three-fourths majority vote of the Assembly. On 16 September 1998, The Dalai Lama proposed further reforms to the election of Kalons, citing dissatisfaction on his part in finding suitable candidates. He also said the existing process was inadequate and did not fulfill the norms of real democracy. He suggested that a Kalon Tripa be elected by the Assembly from a list of three nominees by him. The elected Kalon Tripa was then to nominate at least 14 candidates for the Assembly to vote on to elect his ministerial colleagues. The other option proposed was for the Kalons to be elected by an electorate consisting of the Assembly members, all civil servants above the rank of Deputy Secretary, members of the Local Assemblies, the Tibetan Freedom Movement Sub-Committee members and representatives of NGOs. The candidate with the maximum number of votes could be the Chief Kalon, or the elected Kalons could vote for Kalon Tripa among themselves. These proposals were thoroughly discussed in the Assembly and seek suggestions from the public. On 3 October 2000, The Dalai Lama approved the amendment of the Charter regarding the election of the Kalong Tripa and the other Kalons. Under it, the Assembly would elect the Kalon Tripa from a list of not less than two members provided by The Dalai Lama and the Kalon Tripa would nominate his ministerial colleagues, subject to approval or rejection by the Assembly by a simple majority vote. The Kalon Tripa could appoint a maximum of seven Kalon. However, sensing that the latest amendment may need to be further amended sooner or later, The Dalai Lama suggested that the Kalon Tripa be directly elected by the people. In his landmark address to the last session of the 12th ATPD, on 15 March 2001, he referred to the latest amendment and said that the process had brought the system closer to the essence of democracy. Accordingly, the Charter was amended to provide for direct election of the Kalon Tripa and for the Kalon Tripa to nominate candidates for the election of his ministerial colleagues. This was another significant milestone in the democratic reform of the Tibetan polity. ===Direct election=== The 13th ATPD formally began with the opening of its first session on 31 May 2001. The direct election of the Kalon Tripa, the Chief Executive of the Central Tibetan Administration, in 2001 was the most significant democratic development during its term. The Assembly approved far reaching policies of the Kashag on a negotiated solution to the Tibet issue, the new education policy, privatization of businesses, organic and natural farming policy in the settlements and better functioning of the Tibetan cooperatives, etc. The 12th Kashag brought in a new sense of accountability and transparency to the Assembly. The financial status of the Central Tibetan Administration was made public and the funds earmarked for social welfare were placed under complete control of the Assembly. In September 2003, The Dalai Lama pushed further reforms to give up the last vestiges of his administrative power. He suggested that he no longer make direct nominations to the Assembly, or directly appoint the heads of the three independent institutions of Audit, Public Service and Election Commission, or nominate the Supreme Justice Commissioners. The commissions were placed under a common head in view of their limited workload under the current situation. Regarding these, the Assembly amended the relevant articles of the Charter, leaving it open for The Dalai Lama to decide whether to nominate up to three eminent Tibetans to the Assembly. Selection committees were to be formed for the appointment of the Supreme Justice Commissioners and the heads of the three independent institutions. The five- year term of the 13th ATPD ended on 30 May 2006 and the 14th was constituted on 31 May 2006 till 30 May 2011. The 14th Assembly began with having no direct nominee from the Dalai Lama, so therefore, its strength became 43. Also the Assembly formally changed its name from Assembly of Tibetan People's Deputies (ATPD) to Tibetan Parliament in Exile (TPiE), and the Chairman's title to that of Speaker and Vice Chairman to Deputy Speaker. The 14th TPiE began with a constitutional crisis owing to its inability to elect a Speaker. Despite repeated polling, Do-Mey provincial representative Mr. Penpa Tsering and U-Tsang representative Mr. Karma Choephel kept getting identical number of votes. The impasse was finally resolved with guidance from Chief Election Commissioner, despite the absence of such provision in the Charter, it was suggested to share the speakership between the two candidates for two and half years each. The 14th TPiE took an important decision to allocate area/zonal responsibilities to the MPs for the purpose of ensuring the well-being of the Tibetan people residing in them. After touring their respective zones, they have to submit their reports to the TPiE's Standing Committee, which, after careful consideration, refer to the Kashag for action through the concerned Ministries and Departments. The most historic event took place when on 10 March 2011, during the 52nd Anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising Day, The Dalai Lama has announced about his retirement from the political position. He said, \\"During the forthcoming eleventh session of the fourteenth Tibetan Parliament in Exile, which begins on 14 March, I will formally propose that the necessary amendments be made to the Charter for Tibetans in Exile, reflecting my decision to devolve my formal authority to the elected leader.\\" \\"As early as the 1960s, I repeatedly stressed that Tibetans need a leader, elected freely by the Tibetan people, to whom I could devolve power. Now, we have clearly reached the time to put this into effect…. Since I made my intention clear I have received repeated and earnest requests both from within Tibet and outside, to continue to provide political leadership. My desire to devolve authority has nothing to do with a wish to shirk responsibility. It is to benefit Tibetans in the long run. It is not because I feel disheartened. Tibetans have placed such faith and trust in me that as one among them, so I am committed to playing my part in the just cause of Tibet. I trust that gradually people will come to understand my intention, will support my decision and accordingly let it take effect,\\" said The Dalai Lama. Following two days of debate in the Tibetan Parliament in Exile, the resolution was passed by a majority of 37 to 1, with five members being on leaves of absence. It asked the Dalai Lama to continue to be both the temporal and spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, saying his leadership was pre-eminently democratic and there was no better alternative to it. However, on 19 March 2011, The Dalai Lama had rejected a resolution passed by the exile Tibetan parliament and reiterated what he has stated in his letter to the parliament on 14 March 2011, to carry out the necessary constitutional and other sweeping amendments to effectuate it. Also on 25 May 2011, The Dalai Lama rejected a unanimous request from all the 418 delegates to the second Tibetan National General Meeting, held at Dharamsala from 21 to 24 May, that he remain a ceremonial head of the exile Tibetan administration. He did, however, agree to being enshrined as the protector and symbol of the Tibetan nation in a new Preamble and Article 1 of the Charter of Tibetans in Exile. The Dalai Lama wanted full democratization to be carried out while he was still available to help resolve any problems that may arise along the way, that the decision was a culmination of a reform process he had initiated back in Tibet before 1959, and he said many times that there is no room for kings and religious rulers in today's age of progress toward full democracy. Thus, without any option, the Tibetan Parliament in Exile reluctantly agreed to make necessary changes in the Charter. On 27 April 2011, the Chief Election Commissioner of the Central Tibetan Administration, Mr. Jamphel Choesang announces new members of the 15th TPiE and Dr. Lobsang Sangay as the Chief of the Cabinet (Kalon Tripa) of CTA in an election held on 20 March 2011, in exile Tibetan community all over the world. The term of the 15th TPiE is from the year 2011 to 2016. It consists of anywhere between 43 and 47 members, including: * two delegates from the Tibetan diaspora in Europe * two delegates from the Tibetan diaspora in North America (an amendment in September 2010 raised the number to two from one) * ten delegates from each one of the three traditional provinces of Tibet * two members each from the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism and the traditional Bon school Election to the parliament is open to all Tibetans who are at least 25 years old, and the minimum voting age is 18. There are no political parties in the elections. Sessions are held twice every year between six month intervals. A standing committee of 12 members is in place when the Parliament is not in session, consisting of two members from each traditional region, one member from each religious denomination, and one member who is directly nominated by the Dalai Lama. The parliament also helps with organization of local parliaments established in 38 major Tibetan communities. == Members of the 16th TPiE == { class = \\"\\" - bgcolor = \\"#EFEFEF\\" !

The land for the site was acquired for $4,400. The building was designed by Ammi B. Young and completed in 1858 for a cost of $22,135.75. The building roughly measures by and is constructed of deep red brick and has three arched openings on each of its sides and stories that are lined with sandstone moldings. The archways protrude from the side of the building and the center archway serves as the first floor with the adjacent archways housing large windows that are barred with iron. As it typical of the style, the second floor is more elaborate with a shallow balcony of iron supported by iron brackets and the paneling of the upper facade's surmounting entablature is elaborately decorative. The sides and rear are similar to the front facade, but include blind recesses and the molding is of a browner sandstone. The building was abandoned in 1962 and acquired by the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in 1964. The YMCA has an adjacent structure and used the building as an ante-space until 1990. Currently, the building is used as offices. The Bristol Customshouse and Post Office is historically significant as it is an example of the Italian palazzo mode of architecture. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. == Design == The land for the site was acquired on April 19, 1856 for $4,400 and constructed in 1857 for a cost of $22,135.75. Completed in 1858 from the design by Ammi B. Young, the Bristol Customshouse and Post Office is a two-story rectangular Italian palazzo style brick building that rests upon a raised granite base. The building is about by and is heated by steam. The front facade is made of deep red brick that has three large arched openings on both stories and a \\"greyish sandstone molding outlines the arches on both floors and caps the piers which separate the first-floor arches and a decisive molding of the same material forms a belt between the two stories.\\" The archways protrude from the side of the building and the center archway serves as the first floor with the adjacent archways housing large windows that are barred with iron. As it typical of the style, the second floor is more elaborate with a shallow balcony of iron supported by iron brackets and the paneling of the upper facade is \\"understated, but the surmounting entablature is heavy and elaborately decorated.\\" The cornice as the visual top of the building and conceals the low hipped roof that is only visible from a distance. The sides and rear are similar to the front facade, but include blind recesses and the molding is of a browner sandstone. Alterations to the building are evident in an old photograph, dated to circa 1860–1869, which shows pedimented dormers in the center of the roof, that is believed to have been an addition that has since been removed, but at an unknown time. According to Bristol, Rhode Island: The Bristol renaissance, a photo of the building dated to circa 1900 shows the pedimented dormers. A postcard that was postmarked in 1920 also shows the dormers and the adjacent YMCA building. Also present in the photograph are two chimneys on the front facade and it is evidenced that the side chimney probably arose near the front, however, only one chimney is extant in the rear. The two front chimneys were absent in a circa 1907–1913 post card. The rear chimney was described as \\"apparently altered\\" without future explanation in the National Register of Historic Places nomination. The 1971 nomination form noted that the then- current state of the building was in a state of neglect. After passing through the vestibule, the front area served as the postal sorting rooms, office and mail boxes. In this area, the original iron columns are visible between the wood panels of the clerks' windows. The tile floors were noted to be an alteration, but the second floor stair landing likely had its original tiling remain. The second floor was accessible via cast iron stairs with iron railings, that lead up the customs quarters that had a large room with \\"seven sets of iron-framed windows, with heavy iron sills and interior shutters\\". This room was described as \\"impressively large\\" because of its high ceilings and paneled door, the floor is made of hard wood and a \\"very plain marble fireplace is in one corner of the large room\\". The supports of the building stem from the cellar where granite piers support horizontal iron beams that hold up iron columns on the first floor. == Use == The Bristol Customshouse and Post Office was used as a Post Office and Customs House, as its name implies, until it was abandoned in 1962. Records show that $1,071.75 in repairs and $68.36 for \\"mechanical equipment\\" was spent by the United States government between July 1908 and June 1909. The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) acquired the building in 1964, the building was attached to a YMCA swimming pool structure and was used as an ante-space until 1990. It was remodeled and currently is used as offices. == Importance == The Bristol Customshouse and Post Office is historically significant as \\"an example of the rediscovery of the Italian palazzo mode of architecture after the long proliferation-of the Greek Revival.\\" Though Young designed dozens of building for the United States Department of the Treasury, he was a master of the Greek Revival style and his designs varied throughout the years during the popularization of subsequent styles. Young also designed the United States Customshouse in Providence, Rhode Island a year prior, but its design reflected a more \\"classical, academic theme\\" in a more Tuscan style. The Bristol Customshouse and Post Office \\"serves as an excellent example of a style that is little represented in a town which has fine buildings of other styles and periods, and is a reminder of what was once one of the most active seaports in the northeast\\". == See also == * National Register of Historic Places listings in Bristol County, Rhode Island ==References== Category:Government buildings completed in 1858 Category:Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island Category:Buildings and structures in Bristol, Rhode Island Category:Custom houses in the United States Category:Post office buildings in Rhode Island Category:National Register of Historic Places in Bristol County, Rhode Island Category:Historic district contributing properties in Rhode Island Category:Custom houses on the National Register of Historic Places ","title":"Bristol Customshouse and Post Office"},{"id":"17302148","text":"Jones House may refer to: ;in the United States (by state, then city) *William C.

Szilva was an active Roman Catholic. During the 1980s, he co-managed a successful private lottery named \\"Pot \`O' Gold\\" that provided funding for Ontario's Catholic schools. When the provincial government of Bill Davis extended full funding to Catholic education in 1984, Szilva helped wind down the lottery and re-establish it as a charity fund. Some have suggested that Davis's decision to fund Catholic schools was predicated, in part, on his government's desire to re-establish control over the lottery sector.

Self- published in 1976 and officially in 1989 due to political censorship. It tells the story of an old man who works as a paper crusher in Prague, using his job to save and amass astounding numbers of rare and banned books; he is an obsessive collector of knowledge. The book was translated into English by Michael Henry Heim. ==Plot summary== The entire story is narrated in the first person by the main character Hanta. Hanta is portrayed as a sort of recluse and hermit, albeit one with encyclopedic literary knowledge. Hanta uses metaphorical language and surreal descriptions, and much of the book is concerned with just his inner thoughts, as he recalls and meditates on the outlandish amounts of knowledge he has attained over the years. He brings up stories from his past and imagines the events of whimsical scenarios. He contemplates the messages of the vast numbers of intellectuals which he has studied. The novel is vibrant with symbolism. A simple but obscure plot is present, however. \\"Because when I read, I don't really read; I pop a beautiful sentence into my mouth and suck it like a fruit drop ....\\" \\"For thirty-five years now I've been in wastepaper, and it's my love story\\" says Hanta in the opening line of the book. He goes on to describe his methods for work, and for using his job to \\"save\\" incredible numbers of books for reading and storage in his home. The main theme of Too Loud a Solitude is of the permanence and intangibility of ideas which may, for a time, come to manifest themselves beautifully in the form of books and words. Another theme involves the conflict between Hanta's simple way of life and that of the new and ambitious socialist order. ==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations== A live action film adaptation was released in the Czech Republic in 1996, one year before Hrabal's death. In 2007 a stop-motion film was released, directed by Genevieve Anderson and starring Paul Giamatti in the role of Hanta. ==Trivia== *Hrabal's original name for the narrator was Adam, and there can be seen in the novel various parallels between Hanta and the biblical first man. *Hrabal penned Too Loud a Solitude late in life after a long bout with illness and forced temperance. He claimed that the book was what he had managed to live for. * After the novel's publication, Bohumil Hrabal suffered a fatal fall from the fifth floor of a hospital while feeding pigeons. Suicide from the fifth floor can be found in his stories and he wrote letters in which he admires certain people who had chosen that particular method to end their lives. ==See also== *Bohumil Hrabal *Czech Literature ==References== ==External links== *tooloudasolitude.com, a new feature film Category:1976 novels Category:Czech novels Category:Novels by Bohumil Hrabal Category:Novels set in Czechoslovakia Category:Novels set in the Czech Republic Category:20th-century Czech novels ","title":"Too Loud a Solitude"},{"id":"17302302","text":"Clyde Halemaumau \\"Kindy\\" Sproat (born November 21, 1930 in Honokane Iki, North Kohala, Hawaii - died December 15, 2008, Hawaii) was a Hawaiian falsetto musician.

Under the influence of the French water company Suez, however, the government decided to split the city's service area between the two companies. The government awarded Thames Water and Suez each a concession for one half of the city without competitive bidding. The contracts foresaw water charge increases that would allow the companies to earn a comfortable 22 percent rate of return. However, only two months after the contracts were signed, the Indonesian rupiah massively lost in value due to the East Asian financial crisis, and President Suharto was toppled. The concessions survived, but the government imposed a tariff freeze and the contracts had to be renegotiated to reduce their targets. In 2006 Suez sold half and Thames Water all its shares to Indonesian investors. The main targets of the concession were to increase service coverage from an initial 46 percent and to reduce water losses from 61 percent. The original target of the concessions was to reach 75 percent service coverage in 2008 and 100 percent at the end of the concession. They also aimed to reduce water losses to 25 percent by 2008 and 20 percent by the end of the concession. These targets were substantially loosened during the renegotiations: The new 2008 targets were 68 percent for service coverage and 42 percent for water losses. In 2008 service coverage reached only 64 percent and water losses were reduced to only 50 percent. During the same period, water tariffs increased threefold. This increase was partly due to increases in the cost of electricity and bulk water purchases which are passed through by the private companies to the customers. On 24 March 2015 the Central Jakarta District Court ruled the privatisation of Jakarta's water was illegal and ordered the return of the water system to public control. The court noted that the private operators were \\"negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta’s residents.” The private operators won an appeal in the Jakarta High Court. In October 2017, the Indonesian Supreme Court overturned the appeal and confirmed the District Court Ruling that the privatization of Jakarta's water was an illegal act. Service areas of the two private companies: Palyja serves Central, West and South Jakarta (Areas 1, 2 and 3), while Thames Water - later Aetra - serves East and North Jakarta (Areas 4 and 5). ==Background== To understand the context of water privatisation in Jakarta, it is useful to know the water use pattern of residents, in particular of the poor, the particular financial mechanism of the concessions in Jakarta, the various types of water resources and on which the city relies, and about other water-related challenges that are not directly related to privatisation such as floods, groundwater overexploitation and land subsidence. ===Water and the poor=== Slum residents in Jakarta. According to a household survey concerning water use that was carried out in 2005 among 110 poor households in various neighbourhoods, poor households typically rely on a variety of water sources, including foremost network water, vended water and groundwater. Network water and groundwater are usually bought from other households that have a connection or a well, or from public hydrants that are operated by private vendors. Use of different water sources varies over time depending on changes in quality, availability and pressure. Some households also collect rainwater. According to the survey, vendor water was 10 to 32 times more expensive than piped water and 43 percent of surveyed households spent more than 5 percent of their income for water. The poor indicated they were not so much concerned about the tariff charged by the private water companies, since it was much lower than the prices they had to pay to private vendors. They were much more concerned about the high connection fees to the network that were unaffordable for most of them. While wealthier residents use suction pumps and storage tanks to improve supply, poorer residents suffer more from low pressure and intermittent supply. Water vendors are not effectively regulated in terms of service quality and prices charged. Obtaining water from private wells or hydrants involves queuing of up to two hours and costs of 15,000 Rupiahs (US$1.66) per month and family. Bottled water was also frequently bought at a cost of up to 85,000 Rupiahs (US$9.44) per month and family. Water from wells is often polluted with bacteria and salty, with salt levels increasing in the Northern parts of the city closer to the coast. Groundwater in some areas has high iron content and needs to be filtered. According to the Jakarta Environmental Management Body 90 percent of groundwater was contaminated by metal, nitrate and e-coli in 2011. Boiling of water is frequent. Water from the public network, including at public hydrants, is sometimes only available for several hours per day and not always of good quality.Esther Gerlach and Alizar Anwar:Case Study 5:Jakarta, Indonesia, p. 110-121, in:R. Franceys and Esther Gerlach, Regulating water and sanitation for the poor, 2008 ===Financial arrangements and the concessions=== Under a concession contract, a private company operates, maintains and expands infrastructure owned by the government for a given period which is usually 20 to 30 years. The private operator is in charge of financing all the investments and collects tariff revenues from the customers on behalf of the government. In exchange for its services it is allowed to earn a rate of return, which is usually derived from the tariff revenues that are usually passed on to the private operator. However, the Jakarta concessions are based on an unusual financial arrangement. It consists of water tariffs collected by the private operators on behalf of the provincial government of Jakarta, which are separate from water charges paid by the government to the private operators.Nila Ardhianie and Irfan Zamzami:No Pro-poor Agenda in Jakarta Water Concession, Amrta Institute for Water Literacy and KRuHA - People's coalition for the rights to water, 21 October 2010 The original idea was that tariffs billed to customers would be higher than charges paid to the private operators. The resulting surplus would have allowed the government to pay back the debt owed to the central government resulting from international loans. These loans had been incurred to build up the city's water infrastructure in previous years, totalling a staggering 1.6 trillion Rupiahs (USD 400 million at the pre-crisis exchange rate). The charge to the private operators is a fixed amount of Rupiahs per m3, independently of whether the water users are in a poor or wealthy category. It was set in such a way that the private companies would earn a rate of return of 22 percent. This charging system was designed to provide an incentive to private operators to connect the poor despite their low revenue potential. However, today the authorities question the usefulness of this system since it creates a shortfall for the public sector. Water tariffs. Tariffs in Jakarta are differentiated between seven customer categories, with customers in the highest category paying 14 times more than those in the lowest category: * Category I is a highly preferential tariff for social institutions such as mosques and public hydrants (1% of all connections in 2003); * Category II includes a preferential tariff for very poor households as well as public hospitals (IIa, 12% of all connections) and poor households (IIb, 47%); * Category III includes a regular tariff for middle-income households and small businesses (IIIa, 20%) as well as upper middle-income households and government offices (IIIb, 15%); * Category IV is a high tariff designed to provide revenues to cross-subsidize users in the preferential tariff categories. It includes large hotels, highrise buildings, banks and factories (IVa, 5%) and the port (IVb, 1%). Thus 6% of the wealthier customers, using a much larger share of the total volume of water sold, subsidize 60% of the water users, using a much smaller share of the water sold, who are poor. In 2010 customers in Category IVa paid 9,880 Rupiahs (USD 1.00) per m3, while mostly poor customers in Category II paid only 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0,11) per m3. In 2006 the average water tariff in 2006 was about 6,000 Rupiahs (USD 0.62).Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body:The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008) (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 66-69 For comparison, the water charge was 7,020 Rupiahs (USD 0.73) in 2007. Deficit between water tariffs and water charges. There are two problems with this charging system: First, the water charge is indexed to inflation and is supposed to be automatically increased every six months, while water tariff increases have to be approved by the City Council. In the aftermath of the East Asian Crisis, the City Council froze the water tariff, thus creating a deficit for the government-owned Asset Holding Company Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya (PAM Jaya) as early as the second half of 1998. Second, the more poor people were connected the lower the average tariff collected would become because of the tariff structure. The public contract partner of the private companies, PAM Jaya, however, receives higher revenues from commercial customers and wealthier residential customers since these pay higher tariffs than the poor residential customers. The more poor people are connected by the private operators, the greater the deficit of the public holding company would become, since for each new poor customer it had to pay a charge to the private companies than was higher than the tariff paid by the customer. PAM Jaya thus actually discourages the private companies to connect the poor to the network by seeking a “balanced composition of connections” in order not to further increase the burden on the budget of the province of Jakarta. Indeed, between 1998 and 2004 only 25% of TPJ's new connections were in the two poorest categories, while 60% of existing customers in 2003 were in these categories. As a result of these factors, PAM Jaya has not fully paid the charges to the operators and has accumulated arrears to them. These arrears could reach Rupiahs 18.2 trillion (1.9bn USD) until the end of the contracts in 2022, if the water tariff remains frozen from 2007 until 2022. Financing. In 1998 Palyja secured USD 61 million in loans from the European Investment Bank and the Singapore-based Calyon Merchant Bank Asia. To repay these foreign-currency loans, the company sought local-currency funding. They issued a Rupiahs 650 billion bond on the Indonesian stock market in 2005. In 2007 the Asian Development Bank approved a Rupiahs 455 billion loan to Palyja. ADB did not require a government guarantee for its loan, which is a testimony to the creditworthiness of Palyja. The loan has been criticised for having been based on \\"careless assumptions\\", assuming unrealistic projections for future water sales. In 2008 Aetra followed the example of Palyja and also issued corporate bonds on the Indonesian stock market. ===Water resources=== Flooding. Flooding is a major problem affecting Jakarta. For example, the 2007 flood inundated more than 70 percent of the city and sent about 450,000 fleeing their homes. However, flood management is the responsibility of the government, not of the private water companies. Groundwater over-exploitation and land subsidence. Groundwater extraction in Jakarta by far exceeds groundwater recharge, leading to a falling groundwater table and land subsidence. Land subsidence was first identified when cracks were discovered in the Sarinah bridge in 1978. Land subsidence is also caused by the weight of increasingly high buildings. It varies by neighbourhoods. Between 1993 and 2005 the largest rate of land subsidence occurred in Central Jakarta at 2.40m, from 3.42m to 1.02m above sea level. In North Jakarta the decline was 57 cm, from 2.03m to 1.46m. In West Jakarta, East Jakarta and South Jakarta the decline was 2, 11 and 28 cm only respectively. However, the private companies do not extract groundwater, but purchase bulk surface water from far outside the city limits. Surface water used by the utilities. The private companies mostly buy raw water at a relatively low price from Perum Jasa Tirta II, a state-owned company that operates the West Tarum Canal system. The system provides 80 percent of the raw water supply for Jakarta. Its water comes from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River 70 km southeast of the city. According to a 2007 report by the Asian Development Bank, there was a risk for the water supply of Jakarta from inadequate maintenance and repair of the canal and associated pumping stations. The current water sources are insufficient to supply the growing city with its water needs and thus new water supply projects are being planned. Aetra gets its entire raw water from the West Tarum Canal, while Palyja complements low-price raw water from the West Tarum Canal by buying bulk treated water at higher prices from the Cisadane Treatment Plant owned by Tangerang District Water Works Enterprise 30 km southwest of Jakarta. Palyja also obtains water from the polluted Kali Krukut River in South Jakarta after passing through filtration wells and after treating it.Palyja:River Water Treatment in Jakarta Attracs Participants of SIWW, 7 July 2011, retrieved on 2 August 2012 Furthermore, in times of scarcity, water from the heavily polluted Ciliwung River is used for backup supply. ==History== ===Prelude (1993-1997)=== In 1993 the British water company Thames Water International set foot in Indonesia with the aim of gaining a concession contract for Jakarta. For this purpose it entered into an agreement with Sigit Harjojudanto, one of the sons of then President Suharto. Sigit's firm PT Kekar Pola Airindo – which had no experience in water supply - received 20 percent of shares in a joint venture with Thames Water. The French water company Lyonnaise des Eaux, now Suez Environnement, which had been active in Indonesia before, was afraid of being left behind. It already had a joint venture with the Salim Group of Anthony Salim, a crony of Suharto, for the production and distribution of industrial water in the Serang area of Jakarta since 1994. Together they created the joint venture PT Garuda Dipta Semesta (now called Palyja). Salim, not wanting to confront the President, was at first cautious. But when Lyonnaise des Eaux managed to convince the government to split up the Jakarta concession in two halves, each of which would be awarded without competition to one of the two groups, Salim acquiesced. In 1995 the government issued letters of invitation to Lyonnaise des Eaux and Thames Water International to begin negotiations for concessions. The two companies then completed feasibility studies in 1996. Negotiations took more than a year and were tedious. One issue was that the private companies requested to be paid in foreign currency, a request that was successfully opposed by the then Governor of Jakarta.Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body. The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008) (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 44-55 Apparently the World Bank had pressured the Indonesian government in the early 1990s to privatise water supply. However, the Second Jabotabek Urban Development Project, a major water project for Jakarta approved by the World Bank's board in 1990, included no conditions for privatisation.World Bank:Staff appraisal report, Second jabotabek urban development project, 10 May 1990 ===Concession award (1997)=== In June 1997 the two 25-year water concessions were awarded, becoming effective in February 1998. The subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, called PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (Palyja), was awarded the concession for the western part of the city while the subsidiary of Thames Water International, called Thames PAM Jaya (TPJ), was awarded the concession for the eastern part. The concessions aimed to achieve universal service coverage and a reduction of non-revenue water to 20 percent at the end of the concession period. To that end the concessions foresaw private investments of Rupiahs 1,520 billion during the first five years of the concession alone.Hamong Santono, Coordinator Koalisi Rakyat untuk Hak Atas Air (KRuHA)/Peoples Coalition for The Rights to Water, Indonesia:Current Situation of Jakarta Water Privatization, ca. 2005 This corresponded to USD 610 million at the exchange rate at signing before the financial crisis. However, after the devaluation of the Rupiah during the East Asian financial crisis the value of these investment commitments dropped to USD 160 million.Calculated based on exchange rates from www.oanda.com In the turmoil following the toppling of Suharto, most expatriates fled the country and the Director General of PAM Jaya moved to cancel the concession contracts. British and French executives and diplomats then convinced the central government to maintain the concessions, after the foreign companies separated themselves from their Indonesian partners tainted by their association with the former regime. The City Council, after having approved tariff increases of 15 percent in February 1998 despite the crisis, was soon faced with riots and froze the tariffs for the next three years. ===Renegotiations (2001-2004) and establishment of a regulator=== View of Jakarta. Due to the impact of the 1997 East Asian financial crisis the contracts were renegotiated through a \\"Restated Cooperative Agreement\\" signed in October 2001. The agreement also foresaw the creation of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB) as an \\"independent\\" regulator in charge of supervising the concessions and reviewing requests for tariff increases on behalf of the Governor of Jakarta and the Ministry of Public Works.Lanti, Achmad: A Regulatory Approach to the Jakarta Water Supply Concession Contracts, in: International Journal of Water Resources Development, Volume 22, Number 2, June 2006, pp. 255-276(22) Initially, PAM Jaya had the responsibility to monitor the performance of the two private companies on behalf of the city government in addition to being an asset holding company. By creating the regulatory body the regulatory function was to be clearly separated from the asset holding function, thus avoiding a possible perception of a conflict of interest. In April 2001 the City Council approved a tariff increase of 35 percent, while leaving tariffs in the two poorest consumer categories unchanged. After the signing of the new contract, lengthy negotiations began with the assistance of external advisors brought in with the support of the Asian Development Bank about the so-called \\"rate rebasing\\" for the period 2002-2007. During the negotiations, two other tariff increases were approved in April 2003 and January 2004, again leaving tariffs for the poorest unchanged. For the first time since 1998, in 2003 average water tariffs became higher than water charges, standing at 5,000 and 4,000 Rupiahs per cubic meter respectively. In July 2004 the City Council approved an automatic tariff adjustment (ATA) every six months over a five-year period to allow the provincial government to pay its arrears to the private operators. The water tariff adjustment formula foresaw that increases of the water charge would be fully passed on to consumers, in addition to any changes in the financial requirements of the asset holding company PAM Jaya and the regulatory body.Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body. The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008) (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 96-99 In 2004 a consumer group sued the concessionaires for providing poor services, based on a survey carried out by the Peoples Coalition for The Rights to Water (KRuHA). The lawyers of the utilities rejected the claims saying that the evidence presented was poor and that the survey to support the claims was not carried out by an independent agency.Jakarta Post ===Exit of Thames Water and freeze of water tariffs and charges (2006-2009)=== In January 2006 Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso and the City Council delayed a raise in water tariffs due to protests by city councillors.Jakarta Post:Governor bows to pressure; delays water charges increase, 5 January 2006 In the same year Suez Environnement reduced its share in the concession to 51 percent in a move that, according to the company, had been planned long before. The remaining shares were sold to PT Astratel Nusantara (30 percent), which is part of the Indonesian conglomerate Astra International, and Citigroup of the US (19 percent).Asian Development Bank:Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia: West Jakarta Water Supply Development Project, August 2007 Shortly afterwards Thames Water completely exited the Indonesian market by selling 95 percent of its share in TPJ to Acuatico, a consortium of Indonesia's ReCapital Advisors and Glendale Partners. While both mother companies of Acuatico had no operating experience in the water sector, Acuatico itself had provided water to commercial customers in Jakarta before. The new owners retained the management of TPJ, but the name of the TPJ was subsequently changed to PT Aetra Air Jakarta (Aetra). Governor Fauzi Bowo, who was elected as the successor of Governor Sutiyoso in 2007, froze the water tariffs, saying that the companies did not achieve their contractual targets.Andreas Lako and Nila Ardhianie:Jakarta Water Privatization: Financial Machination and the Impact to the Customer, KRuHA People's Coalition for the Right to Water, Amrta Institute for Water Literacy and Public Services International, 31 January 2010, p. 2 In 2008 performance targets were further reduced as part of the rate rebasing for the period 2008-2012. In 2009 water tariffs were also frozen. ===Renegotiations and exit of Suez (2011-2012)=== In 2011 the provincial parliament of Jakarta instructed PAM Jaya to begin negotiations with the two companies since it considered the contracts one-sided and disadvantageous to PAM Jaya. The negotiations reportedly stalled, and PAM Jaya director Maurits Napitupulu was removed in December 2011. The situation of Palyja was the subject of a letter from the CEO of GDF Suez, Gerald Mestrallet, to the Indonesian Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs, and were discussed at a meeting between then French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and the President of Indonesia in July 2011. The high level of these discussions suggest that the provincial government of Jakarta as the formal contractual partner is not the only interlocutor of the private companies in the negotiations. Meanwhile, voices including the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, the Jakarta Water Labor Union and many NGOs have called for the contracts to be terminated instead of engaging in negotiations, despite the threat of penalties for early termination estimated at 3.1 trillion Rupiahs (USD 347 million) to Palyja and 2.8 trillion Rupiahs (USD 313 million) to Aetra. In October 2012 Suez Environnement announced that it would sell its 51% share in Palyja to Manila Water, under the condition that the city council provided a letter of support.Global Water Intelligence:Suez to exit Jakarta water concession after 14 years, 18 October 2012 In June 2013 the city council and PAM Jaya, however, announced that they did not approve the sale, which was called off. The city instead announced its intention to buy the shares itself. ===Court case against privatization (since 2013)=== The Coalition of Jakarta Residents Opposing Water Privatization (KMMSAJ) initiated a petition against the private management of Jakarta's water supply with 588 signatories in 2011 and supported a similar petition in court by 12 people in 2013. On 24 March 2015 the Central Jakarta District Court ruled that the terms of the privatisation of Jakarta's water violated the common right to water guaranteed by Article 33 of the Constitution of Indonesia. The court also noted that the private operators were \\"negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta’s residents.” The government of Indonesia and the private operators lodged an appeal against the court decision. The concessions remained in place pending a final court decision. In February 2016, the appeal court reversed the district court decision on the ground that the claimants did not have standing to bring the claim. The claimants brought an appeal to the Supreme Court. ====Impact of privatisation==== The concession contracts included specific targets for service coverage, water production, water sales and non-revenue water. The contracts also foresaw that by the 2008, the tenth contract year, drinking water quality standards had to be met and that water supply had to be continuous at a pressure of 7.5 meters water column. Until 2004 both private operators succeeded to increase the share of the population with access to water and reduced water losses in line with the renegotiated contractual targets. After 2004 they further increased access and reduced water losses, but did not reach the targets any more. Overall, from 1998 to 2008 access to water increased from 46 to 64 percent (revised target: 68 percent) and water losses were reduced from 61 percent to 50 percent (revised target: 42 percent). After targets were reduced to more realistic levels in 2008, the operators were able to reach most of their new targets. ===Overall access=== Estimates of how access to piped water changed during the concession period vary considerably. According to the regulatory agency, access increased substantially. In the Palyja service area it almost doubled from 209,000 customers in 1998 to 399,000 customers in 2008, exceeding the renegotiated contractual target of 392,000. In the TPJ service area it increased less quickly during the same period from 278,000 to 380,000 customers, somewhat below the target of 403,000.Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body:The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008) (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 112-113 In relative terms, Palyja says that in its concession area access almost doubled from 34 percent in 1998 to 59 percent in 2007 and 64 percent in 2011. In the TPJ service area, access increased from about 57 percent in 1998 to about 67 percent in 2004, but stagnated afterwards.Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body:The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008) (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 121-122 However, the annual national socio-economic surveys (SUSENAS) of the National Statistical Agency BPS for the Special Capital City District (DKI) of Jakarta show a decline in the share of households with access to an improved water source from 59 percent in 1998 to 39 percent in 2008 and 28 percent in 2010. It remains unclear what could have caused such a massive decline, and substantial increases and decreases in the BPS figures from one year to the other cast a shadow of doubt on the reliability of these figures. ===Access by the poor=== The private companies have specifically attempted to improve the supply of clean drinking water to slum areas where house connections are difficult because residents do not own the land on which they live. However, these attempts have been fairly limited. For example, Palyja has installed so- called Master Meters, from which residents in communities can connect themselves with the assistance of NGOs such as Mercy Corps. As of 2012, however, there were only 3 Master Meters, one in Rawa Bebek and 2 in Jembatan Besi. The Master Meters provide cleaner water than water vendors at about half the costs to households, but the impact of the program is minimal because of its limited size. In addition, Palyja has built 47 water kiosks in or near slum areas where residents can obtain clean water. Piped connections were also expanded. One example is a project in Western Jakarta under which Palyja connected more than 5,000 poor households and was reimbursed through an output-based aid grant from the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid. As part of the project connection fees were reduced to USD 13, or less than one tenth of the usual fee. 75 percent of the subsidy was paid to PALYJA upon independent verification of the installation of a working connection and the remaining 25 percent after verification of three consecutive months of satisfactory service delivery. Another example is in Marunda where TPJ completely waived connection fees and even installed in-house connections for free for 1,600 households using a grant from Thames Water. It allowed the poorest households to pay the connection fee in 12 monthly instalments through the water bill. However, these efforts have been limited in part because there are disincentives to connect the poor even when they have a legal title to their land. These disincentives existed when the system was managed publicly and remain in place under private management: Revenues from poor customers are low, thus increasing the deficit of the entities in charge of service provision; the cost of connecting the poor in dense existing settlements is higher than connecting new middle-income settlements; and finally a \\"mafia\\" of water vendors and hydrant operators defends its monopoly of selling water to the poor at high prices, sometimes even through violent intimidation of customers, competing vendors, the police and city officials. ===Water sales=== The concession contracts included contractual targets to increase the volume of water sold. Water sales did increase substantially without any increase in bulk water supply, but still not as much as foreseen in the contracts. In the western half, the volume increased from 89 million m3 per year in 1998 to 130 in 2007 and 153 in 2011. In the eastern half it increased from about 90 million m3 per year to more than 140 in 2004. However, it then declined to about 120 in 2007, far below the contractual target. ===Service quality=== According to a survey by the regulatory body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. On average, customers received water 12 hours per day.Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body:The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008) (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 83 and 88-89 Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. One of the reasons is that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes. ===Water losses=== A boy takes a shower from what may be an illegal water connection, illustrating the complicated notion of \\"water losses\\" in a city characterised by widespread poverty. Water losses have been reduced, but much slower than foreseen in the concession contracts. In the eastern half, they have increased again between 2003 and 2007. According to Palyja, in its western half of the concession non- revenue water declined from 57 percent in 1998 to 47 percent in 2007 and 37 percent in 2012. According to data from the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body non-revenue water in the eastern half declined from 58 percent in 1998 to 44 percent in 2003, but then increased again to 52 percent. This compares unfavorably with the 2007 target of 34 percent.Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body:The First Ten Years of Implementation of the Jakarta Water Supply 25-Year Concession Agreement (1998-2008) (A Draft Translation), by Achmad Lanti, Firdaus Ali, Agus Kretarto, Riant Nugroho, Andi Zulfikar as Board Members of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body Period 2005-2008, 2009, p. 128-130 Water losses include illegal connections, some of which are used by the poor to serve their basic needs. ===Tariffs=== Tariff increases. Between 1998 and 2010 the water tariff increased threefold, from 375 to 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0.04 to USD 0.12) per m3 in the lowest category and from 5,200 to 14,650 Rupiahs (USD 0.58 to USD 1.63) in the highest category.The exchange rate, after the massive devaluation in 1997, was about the same in 2010 as in 1998 at about 9,000 Rupiahs per USD This far exceeded the growth of household income during the same period and thus increased the burden of water tariffs on all water consumers, including the poor. Affordability. According to a study by the Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, the share of the water bill in the income of a poor family (tariff Category II) was 2.8 percent. According to Palyja, the corresponding figure for 2009 in its service area was only 1.6 percent.Palyja: Affordability study (Power Point Presentation) Comparison with other cities. At an average of USD 0.70/m3 water tariffs were higher than in other Indonesian cities in 2005.Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body.

However, these profits are based on the assumption that the unpaid water charges billed to PAM Jaya will be fully paid to the operators. Actually, these charges are not being paid and writing off these unpaid bills, as it may become necessary, would significantly reduce the profits shown on the financial statements of the companies. ===Customer satisfaction=== The Regulatory Body for Water Services has conducted customer satisfaction surveys covering the entire service area since 2003. In 2007 the survey showed the following levels of satisfaction among respondents: 85 percent for water quality, 71 percent for continuity, 64 percent for pressure, but only 28 percent for responsiveness to complaints. Palyja has conducted its own annual customer satisfaction surveys in its service area through the opinion research institute Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) Indonesia since 2005. According to these figures, customer satisfaction increased from 57 percent in 2005 to 75 percent in 2011. According to a survey carried out by Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, more than 70% of customers were satisfied with water pressure, water quality, continuity of supply, meter reading and billing. However, less than half the customers that made a complaint were satisfied with the response to the complaint.Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia: Customer Satisfaction Survey 2008, Presentation by Palyja ==See also== * Water supply and sanitation in Indonesia * Water privatisation == References == ==External links== * Jakarta Water Supply Regulation Body * PAM JAYA, the asset holding company for water supply in Jakarta * Aetra, the water concessionnaire for East Jakarta * Palyja, the water concessionnaire for West Jakarta Category:Infrastructure in Indonesia Indonesia Category:Government of Indonesia Category:Economy of Indonesia Category:Water supply and sanitation in Indonesia Category:Privatization in Indonesia Category:Water supply in Jakarta ","title":"Water privatisation in Jakarta"},{"id":"17302375","text":"Till Kahrs is a recording artist, singer-songwriter, trainer, speaker, author, and business communication skills expert. ==His early life== Kahrs was born in Hamburg, Germany.

Married couples may separate as an initial step in the divorce process or to gain perspective on the marriage and determine if a divorce is warranted. Other couples may separate as an alternative to divorce for economic or religious reasons, for tax purposes, or to ensure continuing retirement and/or health insurance benefits for both spouses. A separation can be initiated informally, or there can be a legal separation with a formal separation agreement filed with the court. As for a divorce, the latter may include provisions for alimony, whether to have sole custody or shared parenting of any children, and the amount of child support. ==Separation to enhance a marriage== Although the emotional impact of separation is similar to that of divorce, some argue that a temporary separation may also occur to enhance the marriage as a tool to stay together. Some experts regard a six- month separation as good amount of time for a temporary separation, since it is long enough to set up a second household and gain perspective, but not long enough to seem permanent. ==Ground for divorce== A separation may be unilaterally decided by one of the spouses moving away.

They face each other in the 100 block of North Calvert Street, between East Lexington Street on the north and East Fayette Street on the south across from the Battle Monument Square (1815-1822), which held the original site of the first colonial era courthouse for Baltimore County (third county courthouse after previous locations / county seats in old Baltimore village on the Bush River and later Joppa) and Town, after moving the Baltimore County seat in 1767 to the burgeoning port town on the Patapsco River established in 1729-1730. The first courthouse in Baltimore Town was built in 1767 and also later housed briefly for a decade the new United States federal courts in the city, after the ratification and operation of the new Constitution in 1789. On July 28th, 1776/it was the site for the public reading of the Declaration of Independence, just previously approved by the Second Continental Congress on behalf of the Thirteen colonies, now United States of America, meeting at the old Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall) three weeks earlier in Philadelphia and read out loud to a gathering of Baltimore Town citizens. It was undercut in 1784 by local builder/contractor Leonard Harbaugh with a pair of arched stone/brick arched piers and raised stone foundation to permit extension of Calvert Street to the north by passing traffic underneath at a lower level. This town/county courts structure was torn down around 1800, leaving an empty small square for fifteen years. A second city / county courthouse of Georgian and Federal style architecture in red brick and limestone trim with a cupola was constructed to the west of old Courthouse Square (later renamed Battle Monument Square in honor of the monument raised for remembering local casualties from the British attack in September 1814 during the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812). It was sited on the southwest corner of North Calvert and facing north towards East Lexington Street, completed in 1805. This second City/County Courthouse (which also served the small federal district court and judges chambers for 15 years until 1820, when they were relocated into one wing of the huge massive H-shaped Merchants Exchange building capped with a low dome at South Gay and East Lombard Streets, designed and completed that year by famous British-American architect Benjamin Latrobe) was partially burned on 13th February 1835 during a spate of mysterious arson fires in the city during the bank riots that year, but it was soon repaired. An adjacent Egyptian style masonry building to the west along Saint Paul Street was constructed for a Records Office. It was razed around 1896 along with the other structures on the block to its south and west. A third and current courthouse, was built 1896–1900, on the entire city block west of the 1815-1822 Battle Monument. It is bounded by North Calvert Street on the east, East Lexington Street on the north, East Fayette Street on the south and St. Paul Street on the west. A small federal district courthouse and United States Post Office of white marble and limestone was constructed on the northwest corner of East Fayette and North Street (later renamed Guilford Avenue) in 1860 for the federal offices relocated from the one wing of the 1820 Merchants Exchange and was dedicated by 15th President James Buchanan and served only 29 years until 1889. Then it was replaced by a much larger structure with a clock tower and eight massive chimneys facing to the west on Calvert Street and the Battle Monument, occupying the rest of the entire block between Calvert, Lexington, North (Guilford) and Fayette Streets. That Federal courts and central city Post Office on Calvert Street was replaced after only forty years of use in 1932, during the administration of 31st President Herbert C. Hoover which served for the next four decades until replaced by the current Edward A. Garmatz U.S. Courthouse at West Lombard and South Hanover / Liberty Street/Hopkins Place structure adjacent to the 1960s era Charles Center downtown redevelopment project. The old Hoover era federal courts and post office was then transferred to the city by the federal government in 1977 for its use and renovated with being renamed Courthouse East. Today the two historic main structures of the Maryland state judicial system in the City of Baltimore are the Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. Courthouse of 1896-1900 and Courthouse East (the former Baltimore Post Office and U.S. Courthouse of 1932). Together they house the 30 judges of the 8th Judicial Circuit for the State of Maryland (Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore City). In addition to the criminal, civil and family (formerly orphans court) courts, these two courthouses also contain the Office of the State's Attorney for Baltimore City, the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the historic Baltimore City Bar Law Library, the City Sheriff's Office, the recently established Baltimore Courthouse and Law Museum (in the former Orphans Court chambers), the Pretrial Release Division of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, several pretrial detention lockups, jury assembly rooms, land records, court medical offices and Masters hearing rooms. ==History of area== What was the first federal courthouse in the city was constructed at what later became known as Battle Monument Square. Federal judges served on a circuit court basis, also holding court in other cities. The Battle Monument was designed by Maximilian Godefroy, (1765 – c. 1838), and built starting in 1815, on the first anniversary of the British attack on the city during the War of 1812. (It was completed in 1827, when sixth President John Quincy Adams, saluted the town as \\"The Monumental City\\".) ==Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. Courthouse== Washington Surrendering His Commission, mural by Edwin Blashfield, 1903 In 1894, 79 local and national architectural firms responded to a nationwide design competition under the Tarsney Act for the new federal district courthouse to be located at Baltimore City. This act required competition in the design of Federal buildings and was administered by the Office of the Supervising Architect of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Of the entries, a Beaux Arts–styled architecture of Roman and Greek Revival Courthouse was chosen that was proposed by the Baltimore firm of Wyatt and Nolting. The cornerstone for the Baltimore City Courthouse on the northeast corner facing Calvert and East Lexington Streets was laid in 1896; the building was dedicated at completion at a public ceremony on January 8, 1900. Concerns that courtrooms were too austere resulted in the addition of murals executed between 1902 and 1910 by a number of artists, including the 1904 Burning of the 'Peggy Stewart' by Charles Yardley Turner (citizens of Annapolis had burned the ship in reaction to the \\"Tea Act\\" by the British Parliament in 1774, symbolizing rising resistance). In 1903, Edwin Blashfield's mural depicting General George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army at Annapolis, Maryland on December 23, 1783 was unveiled in Courtroom 451. A bronze statue of Cecilius Calvert (1605–1675), the second Lord Baltimore and First Proprietor of the Province of Maryland was erected in 1908 on the steps outside the west entrance, facing Saint Paul Street; it was sponsored by the Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Maryland. It is the site of annual \\"Maryland Day\\" (March 25) ceremonies which continue inside in the ceremonial chambers. Because of changing court needs, a joint evaluation study of the structure was completed in 1946 by architect Otto Eugene Adams and Henry Adams, Inc., under the administration of Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.. The courthouse was expanded and renovated by 1950 to serve modern judicial needs (but the interior light courtyards were filled in to supply offices; there were other alterations characterized as ill-conceived).\\"Courthouse Plan Mapped, Renovation Program Recommended To Mayor,\\" Baltimore (Morning) Sun, November 6, 1946. In 1985, this federal courthouse was rededicated in honor of Baltimore's noted national civil rights leader, Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. (1911–1984). An assessment and renovation study of the Baltimore Courthouse was presented in 1989. It took until 2000 for funding and plans to accomplish substantial exterior improvements.\\"Shabby courthouse robs law of dignity;\\" \\"A slum: Baltimore's circuit courthouses need major repair, deep cleaning and renovation\\"; The Sun. Baltimore, Md.: March 13, 2000. p. 8.A. The study by architectural firm Richter Cornbrooks Gribble concluded that the building should be re-used, rather than abandoned in favor of new facilities; renovation proceeded under architect Kann & Associates. Despite criticism of the first renovation, the architects recognized that the 1950 reconfiguration of the courthouse \\"probably prevented it from being demolished altogether.\\" in the 1950s.Edward Gunts, \\"'Temple of justice' fraying Mitchell Courthouse deserves a better fate than deterioration;\\" ARCHITECTURE; The Sun (Baltimore, Md.): October 1, 2000. p. 6.E.

Eight Ionic columns, each weighing 35 tons and measuring 31 feet in height, support the base of the roof facing Calvert Street. These columns are seven feet taller than those surrounding the United States Capitol. Granite, quarried from Woodstock, Maryland, wraps the basement level and provides a solid base for the white marble-six story courthouse facade. ==Courthouse East (old United States Courthouse and General Post Office for Baltimore)== U.S. Post Office and Courthouse or \\"Courthouse East\\", is a historic combined post office and Federal courthouse located in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It occupies an entire city block and measures 238 feet, 2 inches east-west by 279 feet, 10 inches north-south. It is of steel frame construction with concrete floors and tile roof, basement of granite, and outer walls of white Indiana limestone. The structure is six stories in height and provided with basement and two sub- basements. It was completed in 1932 at the beginning of the Great Depression, during the term of 30th President Herbert Hoover and provided thousands of jobs for the City. The Old Post Office/Federal Courthouse features some classical ornamentation on a fairly simplified stone exterior. The Courthouse was transferred to the state in 1975 for its use in Baltimore following the relocation of the federal court functions to the new U.S. Courthouse (later named for local U.S. Rep. Edward Garmatz) at West Lombard and North Hanover streets, just south of the new Charles Center downtown redevelopment of the late 1950s-early 60's. In 1972, the main U.S. Post Office for the City was moved to large several-block sized structure at East Fayette, North Front Streets, east of the Jones Falls. The state renovation/restoration of what is now known as Baltimore City \\"Courthouse East\\" was completed by 1990. Hord Coplan Macht Inc. was the architect and interior designer for the adaptive reuse of the old Baltimore Post Office; the restoration contractor was Lake Falls Construction Inc.Martin Azola named \`Remodeler of the Year' (other awards included); by Edward Gunts (architecture reporter/critic), \\"The Sun\\", (Baltimore, Md.): December 2, 1990. p. 1.K. ===History=== Some notable federal district court cases held in this building include: *1934: Judge W. Calvin Chesnut became the first jurist to strike down a New Deal Act of Congress. *1948: Alger Hiss filed a libel suit against Whittaker Chambers *1968 and 1969: the Berrigans were indicted in this courthouse for destroying Federal records as a protest against the Vietnam War. *1973: Vice President Spiro T.

All eight A-League clubs competed and were drawn into two groups of four teams. The format of the cup was modified from previous editions, reducing the number of matches. A group stage with three regular rounds saw team play each other in their group once, with the winner of each group advancing to the final. The final was played on 6 August, the first mid- week final in the competition history. The shortened format allowed clubs to schedule other matches in the lead up to the start of the A-League, and was completed before the 2008 Summer Olympics in which Australia competed. Continuing from previous years, most Pre-Season Cup matches were played at venues in regional centres to expand the profile of the clubs and the league.

He is known in particular for Chado Ralph Rucci, a luxury clothing and accessories line. Rucci's clothing designs have appeared in a number of major exhibitions, and he has won some significant fashion-industry awards. He is the subject of a recent documentary, and he and his clothing have received positive critical response in the fashion press. == Life and career == Rucci was born and raised in Philadelphia, and holds a degree in philosophy from Temple University. At the age of 21, he moved to New York to study at the Fashion Institute of Technology and later trained under Halston and a Balenciaga patternmaker. He had his first formal show at New York's Westbury Hotel in 1981, but launched Chado Ralph Rucci over a decade later, in 1994, and began showing at New York Fashion Week in 1999. In 2002, Rucci became the first American designer in more than 60 years to be invited to show in Paris by the French Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture (the only other designer to be so honored was Mainbocher), and he showed his haute couture collections in Paris for the next five seasons. He has twice been nominated for the Council of Fashion Designers of America's Womenswear Designer of the Year Award. Rucci is also a painter, who has exhibited in art galleries throughout the U.S. His paintings, exhibited at the Serge Sorokko Gallery in San Francisco in December, 2012, were described by Architectural Digest as \\"enigmatic works... bearing sweeping brushstrokes that are collaged, here and there, with scraps of silken fabrics.\\" From the beginning of his career, Rucci was inspired by the style of such fashion icons as Elsa Peretti (for her \\"biomorphic nature\\") and Pauline de Rothschild (for \\"creating harmony out of disorder\\").Women's Wear Daily, U.S. 31 December 1985. Retrieved 7 February 2011. Rucci's influences also include the painters Cy Twombly, Franz Kline, Antoni Tàpies and Francis Bacon, sculptor Louise Nevelson, Japanese symbolism, and the designer James Galanos. Rucci's \\"individual mind\\" has been praised, as well as his \\"distinct point of view,\\" as The New York Times noted in a review on a 2007 Rucci exhibition at the Fashion Institute of Technology. In 2007, fashion historian Valerie Steele wrote The Art of Weightlessness, an illustrated monograph published by the Yale University Press on the occasion of Rucci's exhibition at the FIT Museum. In 2008, the documentary Ralph Rucci: A Designer and His House, narrated by Martha Stewart, premiered on the Sundance Channel. In 2011, Rucci was inducted into the Fashion Group International Walk of Fame. In December 2011, Bauer and Dean published Autobiography of a Fashion Designer: Ralph Rucci, with photographs by Baldomero Fernandez. In 2012, Rucci received an André Leon Talley Lifetime Achievement Award from the Savannah College of Art and Design. == Chado Ralph Rucci == Rucci launched the Chado Ralph Rucci line in 1994, \\"chado\\" coming from the Japanese tea ceremony noted for its attention to detail, exactitude, sense of austere style, and expertise on the part of the practitioner. According to Cathy Horyn of The New York Times, \\"Mr. Rucci’s clothes have a devotion to elegance that can feel as pitiless as a sermon on a hot summer day,\\" while Robin Givhan of The Washington Post wrote that \\"Rucci's clothes are aspirational in every sense of the word. They ooze luxury from 100 paces, yet they are not ostentatious. They look expensive because every seam is perfect, every button exactly placed, every skirt has just the right lift. No dress of his would dare wrinkle.\\" Rucci's gowns are included in the permanent collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, DeYoung Museum in San Francisco, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Phoenix Art Museum, the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Texas Fashion Collection in Denton, Texas, among others. == Museum exhibitions == *2003: Rucci's gown was included in \\"Goddess\\" exhibition at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, N.Y. *2004: Rucci's gown was included in \\"Goddess\\" exhibition at the Mode Museum in Antwerp, Belgium *2005: Rucci's designs were included in “Cut and Construction: The Foundations of Fashion” exhibition at the Pratt Institute in New York, N.Y. *2005: Chado Ralph Rucci was the subject of a retrospective exhibition at the Costume Institute of the Kent State University Museum in Kent, Ohio.Ralph Rucci Collection Takes the Stage at Kent State University Museum at Kent.edu *2005: a Chado Ralph Rucci garment was included in the \\"She's Like a Rainbow: Colors in Fashion\\" exhibition at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, N.Y. *2006: Rucci's designs were exhibited at a group show entitled \\"Breaking the Mode\\" at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, in Los Angeles, California.Breaking the Mode: Contemporary Fashion from the Permanent Collection at Los Angeles County Museum of Art. *2006: a Rucci gown was included in the \\"Glamour: Fashion, Film, Fantasy\\" exhibition at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, N.Y. *2006: Rucci's designs were included in the \\"Skin + Bones: Parallel Practices in Fashion and Architecture\\" exhibition at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, CaliforniaSkin + Bones: Parallel Practices in Fashion and Architecture at Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. *2007: a solo installation entitled \\"Ralph Rucci: The Art of Weightlessness\\" was mounted at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, N.Y. *2008: a retrospective solo exhibition opened at the Phoenix Art Museum in Phoenix, Arizona.

It has been used in reference to cuts in popular services such as national parks and libraries or to valued public employees such as teachers and firefighters. This is done to put pressure on the public and lawmakers to rescind budget cuts. The term can also refer to claims by lawmakers that a proposed budget cut would hinder \\"essential\\" government services (firefighters, police, education, etc.). Although intended to highlight the government's value to voters, it can also be aimed at lawmakers themselves. Faced with budget cuts in the 1970s, Amtrak announced plans to cease train routes in the home districts of several members of Congress. The term was first used after George Hartzog, the seventh director of the National Park Service, closed popular national parks such as the Washington Monument and Grand Canyon National Park for two days a week in 1969. In response to complaints, Congress eventually restored the funding. In 1972, Hartzog was fired by the Nixon administration, and this action is often incorrectly cited as a contributing factor.Sully, Nicole (2015) '\\"Washington Monument Syndrome\\": The Monument as Political Hostage in the United States of America', in Paul Hogben and Judith O’Callaghan (eds) Architecture, Institutions and Change, Proceedings of the 32nd Conference of the Society of Architectural Historians, Australia & New Zealand, Sydney, July 2015, Sydney: SAHANZ, pp. 663–74.

Independently, two other groups have described only modest nanomolar CB1 affinity for this compound (125nM and 18.4nM).

The site now lies entirely on the reservation of the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska. The area was once a village and burial site. == Excavations and Research == On July 12, 1804, during their expedition into the Louisiana Purchase, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark stopped along the Nemaha River. William Clark set out and noted several mounds in the area, the smaller mounds he inferred to be most likely trash pits and where homes had formerly been and the larger mounds to be burial mounds. Frederick H. Sterns, faculty the Peabody Museum of the Harvard University, led an excavation of the site in the year 1915. During his excavations, he noted several lodges in the valley of the Nemaha River and many more on the neighboring Missouri River Bluffs. E. E. Blackman led a three-week excavation of the site in the summer 1926. By this time, the site had been further disturbed by the use of farming. During this three-week period, several shards of pottery were excavated. These pottery shards were shell-tempered as opposed to shard tempered or stone pottery, which is more common to this area. Blackman stated that by identifying the pottery, archaeologists would be able to then identify the people that inhabited the area. W. Duncan Strong identified the area as a site of the Oneota. This was one of the furthest western sites of this tribe, who normally resided in areas such as Missouri. In 1935, Strong's theory of the Oneota was evaluated by T. A. Hill, who was a member of the staff at the Nebraska Historical Society. Hill oversaw a three-week excavation at the site and was assisted by George F. Lamb and a crew of archaeologists. In the three-week period, the group of archaeologists managed to excavate 153 pits, one housing area, seven burial sites, and several scattered test pit excavations. Lamb and his crew also found several projectile points that varied in color, gray, pink, white, and brown and were made of flint. Two different samples of burnt pottery were sent to the University of Wisconsin for radiocarbon dating. The sample of pottery dated to 1210 AD and 1350 AD. In 1939 the University of Nebraska Archaeological Survey excavated two pits. In the late 1950s George A. Agogino and a crew of excavators went out to the site to dig test pits. Agogino at the time of the excavation taught anthropology course and the University of Nebraska. The pits the crew dug were about 18 inches in depth and contained femurs, tibias, and fragments of skulls. The remains were found to belong to at least three different individuals. In 1965, the Nebraska State Historical Society sent a crew led by John Garrett and Wendell Frantz on a ten-week excavation of the area. During this time the crew excavated 30 pits, three burials, a house, and several other features such as hearths. == Oneota People == The Native American village was once inhabited by people of the Oneota tribe. The Leary Site in one of the further western sites of these people. The subsistence of the people of this site was partly horticulture and partly from hunting bison. The people of the village used many tools made of both stone and parts of animals. Scrapers and other tools were we most often used by women. The Nebraska State Historical Society excavated a mule deer antler that had been used as a scraper. == Artifacts Today == Many of the documents, research, and artifacts of the excavations of 1926, 1935, 1965, and 1979 are curated by the Archaeology Divisions of the Nebraska State Historical Society. All of the human remains excavated from burial sites in 1935 and 1965 have been repatriated. Many artifacts, from Sterns excavations in 1926, reside in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of Harvard University. Ceramics and other artifacts from the excavation in 1935 were given in part to the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology. == Historical Landmark Status == The Leary site was declared a National Historical Landmark in 1964.\\"National Register Information System\\".

They established as a university band in 1993, working as amateurs till 1995, when they started their professional career. At first the main aim of the band was to compose and share their authentic music and to obtain a distinctive style. In 2004 they recorded their first album “Gece Yolculari” as a production of EMI/Turkey and made a great success with their first single “Unut Beni”. In 2005 that song was demanded to be a theme in Hayat Bilgisi, one of the most popular TV series in Turkey and after it had appeared on TV, it aroused a great interest all over the country. With the success of their television appearance, the band embarked a tour thanks to which they managed to play in front of thousands of fans, especially performing at universities and cities in Turkey. The band took part in many projects in the frame of their social responsibilities and appeared one of these projects having been held for the survivors in tsunami disaster in South Asia “Hand in Hand for South Asia“ in 2005. They made music videos for the songs in the first album “Yaban Gülü” and “Ölüm de Var” and they were on lists for a long time. The video “Yaban Gülü” was broadcast on MTV Europe and aroused interest. In late 2005, they accorded TMC and in 2006 they released “Gece Yolculari 2” with Cem Özkan who was at the same time the producer of the first album. The first single of the second album was “Neredesin”. “Gece Yolculari” proved how the style of the band was stable and open to improve and with the success of this album Gece Yolculari was up on the lists and the agenda again. The second video of the album “Seninle Bir Dakika” won everybody’s approval with its sound and the harmonization. The third video “Hüzün” was up on the lists for months as an indicator of the band’s being permanent. People found the last video of this album “Gökler Agliyor” successful as a love ballad. During Gece Yolculari 2, the band went on a tour and met their fans and saw their success. Apart from the album, they got on in the music with the other projects. For instance, they made “BABEYLI” in association with Ramiz for a film by Ö. Faruk Sorak “SINAV” which criticised Turkish Education System. In addition, “Babeyli” was the first attempt of a 9/8 rap song in Turkey and an authentic rock-rap performance, it was also the first soundtrack of the band. The band made a march for Fenerbahçe’s 100th anniversary, they also composed Trabzonspor 40th March. They released their third album on February 14, 2008. The first single of this album is “Deger mi” by Aysel Gürel and Onno Tunç. On 1 January 2009 Gece Yolcuları members decided to carry on their music careers individually. Bülent Albayrak, Yasin Arslantürkoğlu and Murat Arslantürkoğlu left the group but Edis İlhan and Uğur Arslantürkoğlu decided to carry on with the same name.

Unusually for the genus Scadoxus its tubular blooms are pendant. It is sometimes grown as an ornamental plant in heated greenhouses. ==Description== Flowers Scadoxus cyrtanthiflorus is a herbaceous plant growing from a relatively long rhizome. The bases of the leaves (petioles) are tightly wrapped to form a pseudostem or false stem up to long. The blade of the leaf is elongated, lanceolate in shape. The flowers and leaves appear together. The flowers are borne in an umbel on a scape (leafless stem) long; the whole plant is up to tall. The flower bud begins growth inside the pseudostem but soon breaks through it to appear at the side. The bracts underneath the umbel soon wither. The umbel is made up of 10–25 individual flowers, each on a long pedicel (flower stalk). The flowers are directed downwards, unusually for the genus (only Scadoxus nutans shares this characteristic, but in this case the scape bends over). The colour of the flowers varies from a greenish tube, long, formed by the fused bases of the tepals, through white to salmon pink or scarlet at their long free tips. The filaments of the stamens are flattened and do not protrude from the flowers (another difference from most other species of Scadoxus). The fruit is a berry, across. ==Taxonomy== Scadoxus cyrtanthiflorus was first collected in 1895 by the South African botanist George F. Scott-Elliott. However, his specimen was poorly preserved and it was based on a later collection that Charles Henry Wright described and named the species as Haemanthus cyrtanthiflorus in 1906. The specific epithet cyrtanthiflorus means \\"flowers like Cyrtanthus\\". Scadoxus was originally separated from Haemanthus by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1838, when he moved Haemanthus multiflorus to Scadoxus multiflorus. This separation was ignored by most workers until 1976, when Scadoxus was again segregated from Haemanthus by Friis and Nordal. Haemanthus species are southern in distribution, form true bulbs and have 2n = 16 chromosomes, whereas Scadoxus species, such as S. cyrtanthiflorus, are found throughout tropical Africa, do not all form bulbs and have 2n = 18 chromosomes. ==Distribution and habitat== Scadoxus cyrtanthiflorus is endemic to the Rwenzori Mountains on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It grows at altitudes of between , but is mostly found at around . Plants normally grow in constantly moist, shady habitats in forest undergrowth, either in the ground in highly organic soils, as epiphytes on tree trunks or on rocks and boulders. ==Cultivation== In 2004, S. cyrtanthiflorus was said to be unknown in cultivation, although in 1928 it had received an RHS Award of Merit. In 2014, it was among those described as \\"becoming more widely grown.\\" In cultivation, S. cyrtanthiflorus is said to grow \\"well, if quite slowly, with most growth being in spring and autumn.\\" The recommended potting medium is a very open organic mix, as would be used for orchids. Pests are those of Scadoxus generally. ==Toxicity== The genus Scadoxus is known to have some strongly toxic species, containing poisonous alkaloids. These are lethal to animals, such as sheep and goats, that graze on the plants. Other species of Scadoxus have been used in parts of tropical Africa as components of arrow poisons and fishing poisons. ==References== ==External links== * Photos of Scadoxus cyrtanthiflorus in habitat Category:Amaryllidoideae Category:Flora of East Tropical Africa Category:Plants described in 1906 ","title":"Scadoxus cyrtanthiflorus"},{"id":"17303080","text":"Disa stairsii is a species of Disa of the family Orchidaceae that can be found growing with the giant heathers on the Rwenzori Mountains of mountains in East Tropical Africa as well as in the Congo in West-Central Tropical Africa.

Its converse is the inside lag, the amount of time it takes the policy authority to recognize that a situation calls for a policy response and to decide on that response and implement it. The outside lag can be a major problem, and must be taken into account in deciding what expansionary or contractionary policy actions to implement and, indeed, whether to implement any at all. ==Long lags== Suppose, for example, that the main thrust of a policy action's effects on the economy is expected to be felt 20 months after the policy action is taken. Then any action chosen to be implemented now would have to be in response not to the economic situation now, but rather the economic situation that is predicted to prevail 20 months from now; since economic prediction is very difficult, active use of monetary or fiscal policy could actually have a destabilizing effect, an example of the law of unintended consequences. ==Variable lags== In addition to the outside lag possibly being problematically long, it may also be variable: even though the last time a similar policy was implemented it hit the economy primarily after say 20 months, this time the outside lag may be only 10 months, or it may be 30 months. Again this could lead to the economy being stimulated when it needs to be cooled down, or vice versa. ==Distributed lags== Finally, the outside lag may be distributed through time: Perhaps, for example, one third of a policy action's effects will be felt during the first 10 months, one third during the next 10 months, and one third during the 10 months after that. Deciding what policy action if any to implement now is greatly complicated by the prospect of such a distributed effect. ==References== Category:Monetary policy ","title":"Outside lag"},{"id":"17303206","text":"Miya River may refer to: * Miya River (Mie), a major river in Mie Prefecture, Japan * Jinzū River, a major river in Gifu and Toyama prefectures that is often called the \\"Miya River\\" * Agano River, a river which flows from Fukushima Prefecture to Niigata Prefecture that is often called the \\"Miya River\\" ","title":"Miya River"},{"id":"17303214","text":"The is a major river that flows through central Mie Prefecture on the island of Honshū, Japan.

Her debut album Waves and the Both of Us was released on May 6, 2008. She grew up in Wall Township, New Jersey and started playing guitar and writing songs at the age of 14. She has released one full-length album and five EPs.\\"Charlotte Sometimes at SXSW\\". March 15, 2008. ELLEgirl. Retrieved July 12, 2008.https://www.facebook.com/iamLACES?ref=br_tf In 2014, Poland retired her stage name and started a new project called LACES. ==Biography== Poland was adopted by her parents, Hartson and Tracy Poland, as a baby. She was introduced to her birth mother at age 13. At age 14, Poland was diagnosed with condylar resorption, a rare disease causing her jaw to essentially break apart. Her condition impaired her ability to sing. By age 16, she had undergone surgery by having two ribs extracted to \\"rebuild her face.\\" She continues to have injections to treat her jaw. Raised in Wall Township, New Jersey, Poland attended Wall High School. Poland got her first stage name from the children's book, Charlotte Sometimes, written in 1969 by Penelope Farmer, about a boarding school student who finds herself transported more than 40 years into the past, into the place of another girl. ==Career== ===2006 – 2008: Career beginnings and Waves and the Both of Us=== Poland began her career playing in a five-piece band (J. Poland and The Pilots) in early 2006. The group performed around the New Brunswick, New Jersey area. They soon began playing shows in New York and graduated to larger venues, opening for artists associated with producer/songwriter, Alex Houton. Houton produced much of Poland's early work and co-wrote, produced and contributed guitar work to her major label debut. In 2008, Poland signed to Geffen Records and released Waves and the Both of Us under the stage name, Charlotte Sometimes. The album peaked at No. 145 on the Billboard 200 and No. 3 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. Poland performed at all venues on the 2008 Warped Tour, and the single \\"How I Could Just Kill A Man\\", whose title was inspired by the Cypress Hill song of the same name, was featured on the Warped Tour 2008 Tour Compilation. ===2010 – 2014: EPs and The Voice=== On May 14, 2010, Poland self-released a free EP entitled \\"Sideways.\\" Her second EP, The Wait, was released on iTunes August 18, 2011. In 2012, Poland was a contestant on Season 2 of NBC's The Voice. After having all four judges turn around in the blind audition round, she chose Blake Shelton as her coach. She was eliminated after the first live round. Later that year, Poland finished working on her third EP, Circus Head, which was initially made available to those who had donated to the album's PledgeMusic campaign. The lead single, \\"Brilliant, Broke and Beautiful,\\" was released on October 3, 2012, with the commercial release of the EP following on October 30, 2012. In 2013, Poland recorded her fourth (and first acoustic) Charlotte Sometimes EP entitled, \\"By Request.\\" The lead single, \\"Magic,\\" premiered on November 18, 2013, and the full album was released on March 4, 2014. ===2014 – 2016: LACES and BRZY=== In early 2014, Poland announced she had retired her Charlotte Sometimes stage name and would now be writing and recording music under her legal name for a new project, LACES. The first single under her new moniker, \\"Love Me Sober,\\" premiered on Billboard on March 5, 2015 and was released to retailers on March 16, 2015. \\"Love Me Sober\\" was produced by Dante Jones. A side project was announced in 2016 titled BRZY, featuring the members of District 76 and LACES.

He was the founding editor of the widely influential magazine Kalkandu; it published fiction, articles about state politics and Tamil cinema, and pages of factoids. It also had a vibrant 'Question and Answers' section, in which the editor's idiosyncrasy was promoted. Tamilvanan and his magazine were closely associated with the Dravidian socio-political movement, although he was a totally non-communal man. Tamilvanan's novels feature the detective hero Shankarlal, who travels the world solving crimes and battling criminals in countries around the world. Improbably, he is instantly recognized and mobbed by fans and admirers everywhere he goes. The novels often contain a good deal of factual information about the settings, which served to educate the Tamil audience about countries to which, at the time, relatively few Indians could obtain visas or afford to travel. In the books, Shankarlal frequently travels with his wife Indra and his servants, Kathrikai (the nickname means \\"eggplant\\", a reference to his fat belly and tuft of hair) and Manickam. The detective wore a black hat and sunglasses whenever pictured, and was famous for drinking great quantities of tea. Despite all the foreign settings and situations, Tamilvanan's language was pure Tamil, avoiding common English or Hindi loan words in favor of their Tamil equivalents. Nonetheless, all the hall-marks of a journalistic genius were visible in his work. Tamilvanan's original name was Lakshmanan Ramanathan Chettiar. Tamilvanan is considered a brilliant, original and progressive journalist well ahead of his time. His motto as a journalist was \\"Courage is the Savior\\" (in Tamil \\"Thunivee Thunai\\"). In his journal Kalkandu, he often substantiated his facts and statistics with authorities such as Encyclopædia Britannica and Guinness Book of World Records besides other scholarly works. In order to obtain more facts, details and statistics on any issue or matter, he often went into the references cited by authoritative works or compendia of information; and so much so, Tamilvanan was considered a journalistic genius well ahead of his time. One of the logos of his journal Kalkandu was a black hat and a pair of black glasses, and this was considered as his symbol. He always presented fascinating facts and always surprised the reader with his original and thought-provoking ideas. The publication house (MANIMEKALI PRASURAM) which was started by Tamilvanan is being run by his sons LENA TAMILVANAN and RAVI TAMILVANAN. His elder son Lena Tamilvanan continues to run his publishing business, and is a noted author and editor in his own right. He is also the editor of the weekly Kalkandu and is the sub-editor of the weekly magazine Kumudam. == Novels/serials == # Marmamanithan # Thimingila Theevu # Sankarlal Thupparigirar ==References== Category:Tamil-language writers Category:Indian male novelists Category:Writers from Chennai ","title":"Tamilvanan"},{"id":"17303256","text":"A standard operating environment (SOE) is a standard implementation of an operating system and its associated software. Associated names and concepts include: * Managed operating environment (MOE) * Consistent or common operating environment (COE) * Managed desktop environment (MDE) * Desktop managed services (DMS) * Standard desktop environment (SDE) * Standard desktop configuration (SDC) * Unmanaged operating environment (UOE) * \\"Standard image\\" Administrators typically implement SOE as a standard disk image for mass deployment to multiple computers in an organisation, to ultimately set security controls and increase the security posture of an environment. SOEs can include the base operating system, a custom configuration, standard applications used within an organisation, software updates and service packs. An SOE can apply to servers, desktops, laptops, thin clients, and mobile devices. The major advantage of an SOE in a business environment is the reduction in the cost and time taken to deploy, configure, maintain, support and manage computers. By standardising the hardware and software platforms used within an organization, an IT department or service provider can deploy new computers and correct problems with existing computers quickly. A standardized, repeatable and automated solution creates a known, expected and supportable environment. A standardised solution ensures maintaining known outcomes, with automation fostering speed, repeatability and standardization. The introduction of bring-your-own-device (BYOD) and the significant increase in employee-supplied devices has led many organisations to reconsider the use of an SOE. A number have implemented an unmanaged operating environment where users manage and maintain their own devices, subject to policies enforcing minimum standards. ==Examples== There are many Windows deployment guides and tools available from Microsoft and other vendors. Many businesses endeavor to build their own SOE solutions using the Microsoft Business Desktop Deployment (BDD) solution accelerator or Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT). However, some do not have the capability to build all features in one single SOE and their processes often include documented manual configuration steps. SOEs on Mac OS X, Linux, and other Unix/Unix-like systems can typically be made simply by creating and deploying disk images. This can be achieved using tools such as Disk Utility and dd. Whereas deploying a disk image originating from a system with non-identical hardware will often result in boot failure with Windows, the process is generally achievable on Unix systems with the caveat that the systems must be of the same computer architecture and drivers will need to be installed on the image for all the possible hardware configurations. Since Apple does not have third party computer manufacturers usually only hardware add-ons are a concern with respect to drivers. On Linux most hardware with kernel support can be auto-detected. Boot scripts can be used for automated post-deployment configuration. There are also a number of vendor-specific SOE systems for various Linux/Unix-like distributions. For Solaris the use of jumpstart scripts is more frequent to ease the automation of setting specific parameters for each system. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux this is typically done by using kickstart scripts, there are specific products to create and manage an SOE like Red Hat Network Satellite Server which avoid the disk space usage and maintenance difficulties of managing disk images. ==References== * impeltec SOE definition Category:System administration ","title":"Standard Operating Environment"},{"id":"17303257","text":"Angel Salvadore, also known by her codename Tempest, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. ==Publication history== Angel Salvadore first appeared in New X-Men #118 (November 2001), created by writer Grant Morrison and artist Ethan Van Sciver.

Beak leads the X-Men back to Magneto's stronghold, using the key nobody had bothered to take from him before he was attacked. Magneto/Xorn is swiftly defeated and decapitated by Wolverine. Later, Beak is made an honorary X-Man, and he, Angel, and their children lived in a home on the Xavier property. Beak is unhinged from time and joins the Exiles, ostensibly to prepare him for a future event during which several worlds will be threatened.

The disease is often characterized by hyphae growing in and around blood vessels and can be potentially life-threatening in diabetic or severely immunocompromised individuals. \\"Mucormycosis\\" and \\"zygomycosis\\" are sometimes used interchangeably.Staff Springfield News-Leader (June 10, 2011) \\"Aggressive fungus strikes Joplin tornado victims\\" Seattle PI, Hearst Communications Inc. However, zygomycota has been identified as polyphyletic, and is not included in modern fungal classification systems. Also, while zygomycosis includes Entomophthorales, mucormycosis excludes this group. ==Signs and symptoms== sporangia of Mucorales fungi. Mucormycosis frequently infects the sinuses, brain, or lungs. While infection of the oral cavity or brain are the most common forms of mucormycosis, the fungus can also infect other areas of the body such as the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and other organ systems. In rare cases, the maxilla may be affected by mucormycosis. The rich blood vessel supply of maxillofacial areas usually prevents fungal infections, although more virulent fungi, such as those responsible for mucormycosis, can often overcome this difficulty. There are several key signs which point towards mucormycosis. One such sign is fungal invasion into the blood vessels which results in the formation of blood clots and surrounding tissue death due to a loss of blood supply. If the disease involves the brain, then symptoms may include a one-sided headache behind the eyes, facial pain, fevers, nasal congestion that progresses to black discharge, and acute sinusitis along with eye swelling. Affected skin may appear relatively normal during the earliest stages of infection. This skin quickly becomes reddened and may be swollen before eventually turning black due to tissue death. Other forms of mucormycosis may involve the lungs, skin, or be widespread throughout the body; symptoms may also include difficulty breathing, and persistent cough. In cases of tissue death, symptoms include nausea and vomiting, coughing up blood, and abdominal pain. ==Risk factors== Predisposing factors for mucormycosis include HIV/AIDS, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, cancers such as lymphomas, kidney failure, organ transplant, long term corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy, cirrhosis energy malnutrition, and deferoxamine therapy. Despite this, however, there have been cases of mucormycosis reported with no apparent predisposing factors present. ==Diagnosis== As swabs of tissue or discharge are generally unreliable, the diagnosis of mucormycosis tends to be established with a biopsy specimen of the involved tissue. ==Treatment== If mucormycosis is suspected, amphotericin B therapy should be immediately administered due to the rapid spread and high mortality rate of the disease. Amphotericin B is usually administered for an additional 4–6 weeks after initial therapy begins to ensure eradication of the infection. Isavuconazole was recently FDA approved to treat invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis. After administration of either amphotericin B or posaconazole, surgical removal of the \\"fungus ball\\" is indicated. The disease must be monitored carefully for any signs of reemergence. Surgical therapy can be very drastic, and in some cases of disease involving the nasal cavity and the brain, removal of infected brain tissue may be required. In some cases surgery may be disfiguring because it may involve removal of the palate, nasal cavity, or eye structures. Surgery may be extended to more than one operation. It has been hypothesized that hyperbaric oxygen may be beneficial as an adjunctive therapy because higher oxygen pressure increases the ability of neutrophils to kill the organism. Treatment approach may be different particularly when the Conidiobolus do not respond to antifungal agents in antiretroviral therapy resistant AIDS patients. == Prognosis == In most cases, the prognosis of mucormycosis is poor and has varied mortality rates depending on its form and severity. In the rhinocerebral form, the mortality rate is between 30% and 70%, whereas disseminated mucormycosis presents with the highest mortality rate in an otherwise healthy patient, with a mortality rate of up to 90%. Patients with AIDS have a mortality rate of almost 100%. Possible complications of mucormycosis include the partial loss of neurological function, blindness and clotting of brain or lung vessels. ==Epidemiology== Mucormycosis is a very rare infection, and as such, it is hard to note histories of patients and incidence of the infection. However, one American oncology center revealed that mucormycosis was found in 0.7% of autopsies and roughly 20 patients per every 100,000 admissions to that center. In the United States, mucormycosis was most commonly found in rhinocerebral form, almost always with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis (e.g. DKA). In most cases the patient is immunocompromised, although rare cases have occurred in which the subject was not; these are usually due to a traumatic inoculation of fungal spores. Internationally, mucormycosis was found in 1% of patients with acute leukemia in an Italian review. ===Outbreaks=== Not every hospital in the USA is required to publicize details of infectious outbreaks which occur within their facilities. In 2014, details of a lethal mucormycosis outbreak which occurred in 2008 emerged after television and newspaper reports responded to an article in a pediatric medical journal. Contaminated hospital linen was found to be spreading the infection. A 2018 study found many freshly laundered hospital linens delivered to U.S. transplant hospitals were contaminated with Mucorales. A cluster of infections occurred in the wake of the 2011 Joplin tornado. As of July 19, a total of 18 suspected cases of cutaneous mucormycosis had been identified, of which 13 were confirmed. A confirmed case was defined as 1) necrotizing soft-tissue infection requiring antifungal treatment or surgical debridement in a person injured in the tornado, 2) with illness onset on or after May 22 and 3) positive fungal culture or histopathology and genetic sequencing consistent with a Mucormycete. No additional cases related to that outbreak have been reported since June 17. Ten patients required admission to an intensive-care unit, and five died.Williams, Timothy (June 10, 2011) Rare Infection Strikes Victims of a Tornado in Missouri. New York Times. Cutaneous mucormycosis has been reported after previous natural disasters; however, this is the first known cluster occurring after a tornado. None of the infections were found in persons cleaning up debris; instead it is believed transmission occurred through penetrating injuries inflicted by contaminated objects (e.g. splinters from a woodpile). == References == == External links == Category:Mycosis-related cutaneous conditions Category:Rare diseases Category:Rare infectious diseases ","title":"Mucormycosis"},{"id":"17303351","text":":This article is part of the history of rail transport by country series Map of railways of the Iberian peninsula (1921) The history of rail transport in Spain begins in the 19th century. In 1848, a railway line between Barcelona and Mataró was inaugurated,Significant events in the history of Spanish infrastructures and railways www.fomento.es although a line in Cuba (then a Spanish overseas province) connecting Havana and Bejucal had already opened in 1837. In 1852 the first narrow gauge line was built, in 1863 a line reached the Portuguese border. By 1864 the Madrid-Irun line had been opened, and the French border reached. In 1911 the first line to be electrified was the Gergal-Santa Fe line In 1941 RENFE was created. The last steam locomotive was withdrawn in 1975, in 1986 the maximum speed on the railways was raised to 160 km/h, and in 1992 the Madrid Seville high speed line opened, beginning the process of building a nationwide high speed network. == Development == railway network in 1906 Railway transport was first developed in Northern Europe during the 19th century, spurred not only by rapid economic growth, but also by landscapes favourable to railway construction. Economic difficulties and the presence of some of the most mountainous terrain in Europe ensured that railways arrived relatively late in Spain. The first line to be built in the Peninsula was a short link from Barcelona to Mataró opened in 1848, although by that date a line was already working in Cuba - then part of the Spanish empire. It was not until laws were passed in the 1850s making railway investment more attractive to foreign capital, that railway building on a large scale began. One major misfortune was the decision, taken at an early stage, that Spain's railways should be built to an unusual broad track gauge of , or six Castilian feet). Some believe that the choice of gauge was influenced by Spain's hostility to neighbouring France during the 1850s: it was believed that making the Spanish railway network incompatible with that of France would hinder any French invasion. Other sources state that that decision was taken to allow bigger engines that could have enough power to climb the steep passes in the second most mountainous country in Europe. As a result, Portuguese railways were also built to a broad gauge (roughly the same, , but rounded to a Portuguese unit). In 1955 Spain and Portugal decided to halve this difference of , and defined their gauge to be , called Iberian gauge. The decision for a national gauge came to be regretted by later generations, when international trade became more relevant, and it also made railway construction more expensive. Apart from the widespread broad-gauge lines, a large system of narrow gauge railways was built in the more mountainous parts of Spain, especially in the north coast of the country, where narrow gauge was the most adequate option. The main-line network was roughly complete by the 1870s. Because of Spain's (until recently) relative lack of economic development, the Spanish railway network never became as extensive as those of most other European countries. For instance, in terms of land area Spain is about 2.5 times the size of Great Britain but its railway network is about smaller. ==Civil War== During the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s the railway network was extensively damaged. Immediately after the war Francoist Spain nationalized the broad gauge network, and in 1941 RENFE was formed. Narrow gauge lines were nationalized in the 1950s, later being grouped to form FEVE. It took many years for the railway system to recover from the war; during the 1950s it was common to see intercity express trains hauled by 100-year-old steam locomotives on poor worn-out track. In spite of this, innovators like Goicoechea created advanced trains like the Talgo and the TER. Only with the Spanish transition to democracy in 1975, did the Spanish railway network begin to modernize and catch up with the rest of Europe. ==Kingdom of Spain== Tail end of a Talgo III train, designed in the late 1960s Following the decentralization of Spain after 1978, those narrow gauge lines which did not cross the limits of autonomous communities of Spain were taken out of the control of FEVE and transferred to the regional governments, which formed, amongst others, Eusko Trenbideak and Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya. Madrid (Madrid Metro), Barcelona, Valencia and Bilbao (Metro Bilbao) all have autonomous metro services. In 1986/7, many radial routes were closed: thousands of kilometres of passenger lines were axed. The Railway Sector Act of 2003 separated the management, maintenance and construction of rail infrastructure from train operation. The former is now the responsibility of a new public company, Administrador de Infrestructuras Ferroviarias (ADIF), while Renfe (full name: Renfe Operadora) owns the rolling stock and remains responsible for the planning, marketing and operation of passenger and freight services (though no longer with a legal monopoly). Spanish railways have been a target of sabotage and attacks by ETA, and once in the March 11, 2004 Madrid attacks by Islamist terrorists. ==High speed== High speed lines operating, under construction and planned. In recent years Spain's railways have received very heavy investment, much of it coming from the European Union. In 1992, a standard gauge high-speed rail line (AVE) was built between Madrid and Seville. In 2003, high-speed service was inaugurated on a new line from Madrid to Lleida and extended to Barcelona in 2008. The same year, the lines from Madrid to Valladolid and from Córdoba to Málaga were inaugurated. The Madrid- Barcelona line is being extended onwards via an international Perthus Tunnel beneath the Pyrenees to Perpignan where it will link up with the French TGV high-speed system. Although the LGV Perpignan-Figueres is finished on the French side, delays on the part of the French government in authorizing construction on its side of the border held up Spanish plans to some extent, and the Spanish side will not be finished until 2012. Further high-speed links are under construction from Seville to Cádiz, from Madrid to Valencia and to Lisbon. The Basque Y, also under construction, will link the three Basque cities. In June 2011, RENFE announced they will suppress the high-speed trains between Toledo and Cuenca/Albacete because of lack of passengers despite an investment of 3.5 billion euros.http://www.3cat24.cat/noticia/1264046/economia/Renfe-suprimeix-lAVE- Toledo-Albacete-Conca-per-manca-de-viatgers The average number of daily passengers was 9 between Toledo and Albacete and 6 between Toledo and Cuenca while the daily cost was 18 000 euros. These trains ran over existing high speed lines (the lines to Seville and Valencia) and so the lines remain open, but passengers travelling between the cities must now travel via Madrid. == Loading Gauge == === Width === Standard gauge was adopted in Spain partly in view of the desire to integrate with the rest of Europe, and the rest of Africa. If it uses the UIC loading gauge width of then there would be inconsistancy with the width of the futuristic African Integrated High Speed Railway Network. Spain UIC loading gauge 300px 300px Thus UIC width trains can happily work on OSShD platforms with a wider gap, but not the other way round. == See also == * Iberian gauge * Rail transport in Spain *RENFE ==References== ==External links== illustrated description of the railways of Spain and Portugal Spain Rail Transport History Rail ","title":"History of rail transport in Spain"},{"id":"17303387","text":"The Port of Peril is a science fiction novel by American writer Otis Adelbert Kline.

This is an attempt to explain the different patterns of self-organization in ants.Social insects and self-organization ==Ants as complex systems== Ant colonies are self-organized systems: complex collective behaviors arise as the product of interactions between many individuals each following a simple set of rules, not via top-down instruction from elite individuals or the queen. No one worker has universal knowledge of the colony's needs; individual workers react only to their local environment. Because of this, ants are a popular source of inspiration for design in software engineering, robotics, industrial design, and other fields involving many simple parts working together to perform complex tasks. The most popular current model of self-organization in ants and other social insects is the response threshold model. A threshold for a particular task is the amount of stimulus, such as a pheromone or interactions with other workers, necessary to cause the worker to perform the associated task. A higher threshold requires a stronger stimulus, and thus translates into less preference for performing a specific task. Different workers have different thresholds for different tasks, allowing certain workers to function as specialists that preferentially perform one or more tasks. Threshold levels can be affected by several factors: worker age, since workers frequently switch from within-nest work to outside-nest work with age;Moron D., Witek M., Woyciechowski M. Division of labour among workers with different life expectancy in the ant Myrmica scabrinodis (2008) Animal Behaviour, 75 (2) , pp. 345-350. size, since larger workers often perform different tasks, such as defense or seed processing; caste; health, since injuries can encourage young workers to switch to outside-nest work earlier; or be randomly distributed. As demand for a task increases, so does the proportion of workers whose thresholds are met; as demand decreases, fewer workers' thresholds are met and fewer workers are allocated to that task. In this way, simple individual rules allow for the regulation of work on a large scale in diverse settings. This system can also evolve in response to different environments and life history strategies, leading to the immense variation observed in ants. ==Bifurcation== This is an instant transition of the whole system to a new stable pattern when a threshold is reached. Bifurcation is also known as multi-stability in which many stable states are possible.Detrain, C., and J. L.

After receiving his education, he joined his father in managing the Freeman's Journal, the oldest nationalist newspaper in Ireland. When his father died in 1875, Gray took over proprietorship of the Journal, and his family's other newspaper properties such as the Belfast Morning News and the Dublin Evening Telegraph.G. B.

In 1868, Gray saved five people from drowning in a wrecked schooner at Killiney Bay, an action for which he received the Tayleur Fund Gold Medal for bravery from the Royal Humane Society. By coincidence, the rescue was witnessed by his future wife, Caroline Agnes Gray, whom he would meet shortly afterwards.Edmund Dwyer Gray Album, NUACHT Leabharlann Náisiúnta na hÉireann (National Library of Ireland NEWS), Spring 2005. Agnes was the daughter of Caroline Chisholm (an English humanitarian renowned for her work in female immigrant welfare in Australia), and although Gray was descended from a Protestant family, he converted to Catholicism to marry her. The wedding in London on 17 July 1869 was conducted by the Bishop of Northampton. The couple had one son, Edmund Dwyer-Gray, who would take over from his father as proprietor of his newspapers and would go on to become Premier of Tasmania. == Political career == From 1875 to 1883, Gray served as a member of the Dublin Corporation, and in 1880 served a term as Lord Mayor of Dublin. Unusually for an Irish nationalist politician, Gray was very much focussed on urban rather than rural affairs, and like his father was heavily involved in public health and water provision for Dublin. He also promoted reform in the municipal health system. Gray unsuccessfully ran for his father's seat of Kilkenny City at Westminster in the 1875 by-election that followed Sir John Gray's death. He won a later by-election in 1877, becoming a Member of Parliament representing Tipperary for the Home Rule League. At the 1880 general election, he won the seat of Carlow County. At the 1885 election, as a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he won representation of both Carlow and the new constituency of Dublin St Stephen's Green, and chose to represent the latter.

He played all or part of three seasons in Major League Baseball with the Kansas City Royals from 1977 to 1979, primarily as a left fielder. == Early life == Zdeb attended Maine South High School in Park Ridge, Illinois, where he played both baseball and football. A fullback, he signed a letter of intent to play football at the University of Missouri, with a promise that he would also be allowed to play baseball. However, when he was made the 4th round pick of the Kansas City Royals in the 1971 amateur draft, he chose to join the Royals organization instead. == Playing career == ===Early career=== In his first season of professional baseball, Zdeb was assigned to the rookie league Billings Mustangs, where he batted .184. He also spent 1972 in rookie ball with the Kingsport Royals, where he improved to a .319 batting average with 12 home runs. In 1973, he began the year at Waterloo in the Midwest League, where he hit .355, earning him a promotion to the high-A San Jose Bees, where he struggled, hitting .195. In 1974, Zdeb returned to San Jose. In his first full season there, he batted .295. Over the next two seasons, he continued to move up the ladder, playing at Double-A Jacksonville in 1975 and AAA Omaha in 1976. ==== \\"Long hair\\" confrontation ==== At some point, during minor league spring training, he showed up to camp with long hair, which was against team policy. Manager Joe Gordon refused to give him a uniform, so he approached general manager Lou Gorman, asking \\"Mr. Gorman, if I cut my hair, will I become a better ballplayer?\\" Gorman said he needed to cut it to properly represent the organization, and after initially refusing, he did so a couple days later. === Major leagues === ==== Rookie season: 1977 ==== After the 1976 season, the Royals traded their primary backup outfielder, Jim Wohlford, to the Milwaukee Brewers, opening up a spot for Zdeb. With the left-handed Dave Roberts on the mound for the Detroit Tigers on Opening Day, the right-handed hitting Zdeb wound up starting in left field in place of the left-handed hitting Tom Poquette. Zdeb went 1-for-4 with a run scored in his major league debut.Box score for Zdeb's MLB debut Zdeb and Poquette platooned over the rest of the season, and the rookie finished with what turned out to be a career high .297 batting average in 105 games. He also had career bests with 2 home runs and 23 RBI. In the 1977 American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees, Zdeb appeared in four of the five games, but failed to get a hit in nine at bats, although he did steal a base. ==== Remaining Royals career ==== In 1978, Zdeb saw his playing time reduced with the arrival of Willie Wilson, and even wound up back in the minors briefly. With three players sharing left field, Zdeb wound up appearing in just 60 games. His batting average fell to .252, without a home run and with just 11 RBI. With Wilson named the full-time starter in left field for the 1979 season, Zdeb found himself in strictly a reserve role to start the season. After 15 games in which he batted just .174, Zdeb was sent down to the minor leagues. However, he also struggled in Omaha, batting just .224, and was not given a September call-up. === Career ending === On January 15, 1980, Zdeb was traded to the Chicago White Sox for pitcher Eddie Bane. He finished his professional career that year, splitting the season between the White Sox Iowa Oaks affiliate and the Tidewater Tides in the New York Mets organization. His struggles at the plate continued, as he hit a combined .194, and after the season he was out of professional baseball. In between, Zdeb played winter ball with the Tigres de Aragua club of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League in the 1976-77 and 1977-78 seasons.Joe Zdeb – VPBL statistics. Pura Pelota.

In February 2007, he became Advisor to the Minister of Finance. After President Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi took office in April 2007, he appointed Waghef as Secretary-General of the Presidency, with the rank of minister, on 28 April 2007.\\"Nominations à la Présidence de la République\\", Agence Mauritanienne d'Information, 28 April 2007 .

Members of ADIL accounted for almost two-thirds of Waghef's government and held most of the key ministries. Four members of the government were from the two opposition parties which decided to participate. On 30 June 2008, 39 deputies in the National Assembly (out of a total of 95) filed a motion of censure against Waghef's government.\\"Le Parlement mauritanien menacé de dissolution\\", African Press Agency, 2 July 2008 .\\"Mauritanian government quits before voting on censure motion\\", AFP, 3 July 2008. Most of these deputies were from ADIL, although the RFD (the main opposition party) also declared its support for the censure motion. The deputies complained that Waghef's government had not presented a program and that too many positions in the government had been given to opposition parties and to figures who had served under President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya. 24 senators declared that they were in \\"unconditional solidarity\\" with the deputies who filed the censure motion.\\"Des membres du Sénat se déclarent solidaires des députés oeuvrant pour faire aboutir une motion de censure contre le gouvernement\\", AMI, 1 July 2008 . President Abdallahi, speaking on 2 July, called on the deputies to reconsider.\\"Le président de la république adresse un discours à la nation\\", AMI, 2 July 2008 . He said that the motion was surprising because it was initiated by deputies belonging to the party that headed the government, and also because the government's program had not even been presented yet. In addition, Abdallahi argued that Waghef's government was so new that there had not been enough time to properly evaluate its performance, and he warned that he might dissolve the National Assembly if the censure motion was adopted. Before the censure motion could be voted on, Waghef and his government resigned on 3 July in order \\"to preserve the cohesion of the majority which supports [Abdallahi's] programme\\"; he urged unity and dialogue among ADIL and the presidential majority. Waghef was reappointed by Abdallahi on the same day.

A new subsidiary, Tropicana Entertainment LLC, was created to hold the combined company's casinos. After losing control of its largest property, the Tropicana Atlantic City, the new company was quickly forced into bankruptcy in May 2008. While in bankruptcy, the Tropicana Las Vegas was split off as a separate entity. The rest of the company emerged from bankruptcy on March 8, 2010 as Tropicana Entertainment Inc., under the leadership of investor Carl Icahn. On the same day, it regained control of the Tropicana Atlantic City, which Icahn and other investors had bought for $200 million in canceled debt. In approving the transfer, the Casino Control Commission stressed that Tropicana was a \\"different company\\" than the company that had lost its license in 2007. In March 2011, Tropicana sold the Horizon Casino in Vicksburg to a partnership of Tangent Gaming and Great Southern Investment Group, who renamed it as the Grand Station Hotel and Casino. In 2012, the company closed the Jubilee casino and consolidated its operations into the Lighthouse Point casino, which was expanded and rebranded as the Trop Casino Greenville. In May 2013, Tropicana agreed to sell the River Palms for $7 million to M1 Gaming, owner of Boomtown Reno, but the sale never went through. In July 2014, Tropicana instead agreed to sell the River Palms for $6.75 million to the owners of Dotty's. In March 2014, it was announced that the company‘s lease to operate the Horizon Casino Resort had expired on March 31, 2014 and was not renewed.

He was born in Los Angeles, California. ==Early life== His mother, Frances (née Frances Mildred Fullman, also known as Fannie Fullman; 1899–1980), worked at the Hollywood neighborhood cinemas playing piano, accompanying silent movies. At the age of 8, Geller was presented with an alto saxophone, purchased from a local music store owner and music teacher who was also a family friend and had a used instrument for sale. Two years later he started playing the clarinet. Geller attended Dorsey High School in the southwestern part of Los Angeles and joined the school band which among others included the musicians Eric Dolphy and Vi Redd. At the age of 14, he heard Benny Carter perform at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles and was so impressed that he decided to pursue a career in music, specializing on the alto saxophone. Two years later, he had his first professional engagement in the band of jazz violinist Joe Venuti. A short time later he discovered the music of Charlie Parker, who became an important idol along with Benny Carter and Johnny Hodges. In 1949 Geller went to New York City for the first time, where he performed in the bands of Jack Fina, (with Paul Desmond also in the sax section), Claude Thornhill, Jerry Wald and Lucky Millinder. During this time he met pianist Lorraine Walsh in Los Angeles. Geller and Walsh got married in New York and she became an important musical partner, in addition to pursuing her own solo career. ==Career== After three years in New York, Geller joined the Billy May orchestra in 1952 and, following an engagement in Los Angeles, the Gellers returned there to live. Among the groups Geller worked and recorded with were Shorty Rogers, Maynard Ferguson, Bill Holman, Shelly Manne, Marty Paich, Barney Kessel, André Previn, Quincy Jones, Wardell Gray, Jack Sheldon and Chet Baker. Lorraine worked as the house pianist at the Lighthouse Jazz Club, and played with Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Jack Teagarden, Bill Holman and was the accompanist for the singer Kay Starr. Geller recorded three LPs as a leader for Emarcy plus some with Dinah Washington, Max Roach, Clifford Brown, Clark Terry, Maynard Ferguson and Kenny Drew. In 1955 he won the \\"New Star Award\\" from DownBeat magazine and achieved worldwide recognition through his recordings with Clifford Brown. Later Geller worked in the bands of Louie Bellson and Benny Goodman. Lorraine Geller died of an acute asthma attack in 1958. Deeply depressed, Herb Geller decided during a tour through Brazil with the Benny Goodman Orchestra not to return to the United States, but instead to stay in São Paulo for six weeks playing Bossa Nova music at a local club and then depart on a ship to Europe. ==Europe== Arriving in Paris, Geller played with Kenny Clarke, Kenny Drew, the French pianist Martial Solal, and Belgian guitarist René Thomas among others, and also toured with a French radio show, Musique Aux Champs-Elysées. In 1962 he was offered a job with the big band of the Radio in the American Sector (RIAS) station in Berlin. He accepted this engagement and performed there along with other Americans expatriates In Europe such as Benny Bailey, Joe Harris, and Nat Peck, as well as European musicians like Jerry van Rooyen, Ake Persson, and Francy Boland. In Berlin he met his second wife, Christine Rabsch. Geller stayed there for three years and then accepted a contract to play lead alto and also arrange for the big band of NDR in Hamburg. Here he was engaged for 28 years and made Hamburg his home. During this time the NDR big band developed from a post-war dance orchestra into a leading modern jazz ensemble. The endless list of participating musicians ranged from Don Byas, Joe Pass, Slide Hampton, Bill Evans, Red Mitchell, Art Farmer, Georgie Fame and Chet Baker to avant-garde musicians and rock/fusion, and included nearly all the big names of European jazz. During his work at NDR, Geller was also busy with other things, including his own productions and tours. During this time he also participated in recordings and worked with such famous artists as Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Peter Herbolzheimer, and George Gruntz among others. During his tenure at NDR, he also learned and performed on other woodwind instruments, including clarinet, flute, alto flute, bass flute, piccolo flute, oboe and English horn. On flute he played and recorded with Bill Evans and Brazilian guitarist Baden Powell. He also composed the music and lyrics to two musicals: Playing Jazz (a musical autobiography) and Jazzy Josie B. (based on the life of Josephine Baker). In 1996 the Senate of the Government of Hamburg gave him the title of \\"Professor\\". He taught at the Hochschule für Musik in Hamburg until his retirement. He continued teaching jazz improvisation and composition, occasionally doing seminars at various national and international institutes. He wrote a method of improvisation called \\"crossover\\" for Schott and Sons. Geller performed regularly in Germany and abroad as a soloist at festivals and clubs in various formations including some big bands as well as with such diverse artists as Knut Kiesewetter, Lennie Niehaus, Jiggs Whigham, Rolf Kühn, Slide Hampton, Buddy DeFranco, Lew Soloff, Charlie Mariano, Jan Lundgren and Roberto Magris. He was very proud of his friendship with Benny Carter, his adolescent hero, with whom he recorded and performed.

Google scientists made their VisualRank work public in a paper describing applying PageRank to Google image search at the International World Wide Web Conference in Beijing in 2008. . > We cast the image-ranking problem into the task of identifying \\"authority\\" > nodes on an inferred visual similarity graph and propose VisualRank to > analyze the visual link structures among images. The images found to be > \\"authorities\\" are chosen as those that answer the image-queries well. ==Methods== Both computer vision techniques and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) are used in the VisualRank algorithm. Consider an image search initiated by a text query. An existing search technique based on image metadata and surrounding text is used to retrieve the initial result candidates (PageRank), which along with other images in the index are clustered in a graph according to their similarity (which is precomputed). Centrality is then measured on the clustering, which will return the most canonical image(s) with respect to the query. The idea here is that agreement between users of the web about the image and its related concepts will result in those images being deemed more similar. VisualRank is defined iteratively by VR = S^* \\\\times VR, where S^* is the image similarity matrix. As matrices are used, eigenvector centrality will be the measure applied, with repeated multiplication of VR and S^* producing the eigenvector we're looking for. Clearly, the image similarity measure is crucial to the performance of VisualRank since it determines the underlying graph structure. The main VisualRank system begins with local feature vectors being extracted from images using scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). Local feature descriptors are used instead of color histograms as they allow similarity to be considered between images with potential rotation, scale, and perspective transformations. Locality-sensitive hashing is then applied to these feature vectors using the p-stable distribution scheme. In addition to this, LSH amplification using AND/OR constructions are applied. As part of the applied scheme, a Gaussian distribution is used under the \\\\ell_2 norm. ==References== ==External links== *New York Times article *Slashdot article Category:Internet search Category:Image processing ","title":"VisualRank"},{"id":"17303768","text":"Samoa Technologies (also known as Samoa Tech or STI) is a privately held diversified telecommunications, broadcasting and media, consulting, and aircraft leasing company located in the South Pacific and based in Pago Pago, American Samoa.

The missionary was formally invited by Fr. Michael Donoher, the former parish priest of Silang, Cavite. Fr. Michael believed that education is a good way of spreading the words of the Lord. When the people of Silang requested to the priest that they wanted to have a high school in their municipality after the Japanese invasion of the Philippines Fr. Michael convinced the nuns to run the first Catholic school in Silang. When the orphanage of the Infant Jesus in Tondo was destroyed, the orphanage transferred to Silang, Cavite by the invitation of the Parish Priest. With 100 orphans and five nuns they stayed at the old convent of Silang. The nuns were Mother Donatiana, Mother Leonce, Mother Adeltrude, Mother Estelle and Mother Damascene. The opening of the Infant Jesus Academy with first and second year high school was opened for both male and female students. In 1956, a building was constructed with four classrooms. It was followed by the second, third, and fourth buildings until it reached 34 classrooms, 3 counselling rooms, 2 laboratory rooms, 3 offices, a clinic, a faculty room, a chapel, 2 canteen and a library In the years 2005 to 2007, 2 fully air conditioned computer rooms were built, the so-called “little baguio” was transformed into a huge gymnasium that is being used for school activities and sports.

It was the last windmill working commercially by wind in Sussex, ceasing work by wind in 1969 when a stock broke. ==History== New Mill was built at Mount Ephraim, Framfield in the early 19th century. In 1855, it was moved to a site some ¼ mile (400 m) south west of its current position. The move was done by Samuel Medhurst, the Lewes millwright. In 1868, it was moved again to its current position, joining another windmill which became known as the Old Mill. Medhurst was also responsible for this move. The mill was working until 1969, when a stock broke. Milling continued by auxiliary power in an adjoining building until 1971. The mill is currently under restoration. In August 2014, concerns were raised about the condition of the mill, which is owned by brothers Brian and Geoff Newnham. Following inspection by a millwright in 2015, a crowdfunding appeal was launched to raise £3,000 for emergency repairs to the trestle. When the appeal closed on 8 June, £1,654 had been raised. The Mills Archive Trust also opened an appeal, allowing people to donate by cheque, with the added benefit of being able to increase their donations by 25% via Gift Aid. A total in excess of £7,000 was raised by the two appeals. Initial work to strengthen the trestle was scheduled to be completed in October 2015. ==Description== New Mill, 1967 New Mill is a post mill on a two-storey roundhouse. It had four patent sails carried on a cast iron windshaft and was winded by a tailpole-mounted fantail. When originally built, the fantail was roof-mounted, in a similar manner to that still to be seen at Hogg Hill, Icklesham. Medhurst fitted a five-bladed fantail, which was replaced in 1907 by an eight-bladed fantail of diameter by Neve of Heathfield. The mill originally drove two pairs of millstones, driven by a diameter head wheel and diameter tail wheel. Later, another pair was added to the breast, driven by a spur gear arrangement, the spur wheel being diameter. One pair of stones in the breast was removed in 1933. The body of New Mill is long and wide. The mill is high to the roof. The roundhouse is diameter and the main post is square. ==Millers== *William Kenward 1855 - *Mrs Kenward - 1882 *Jabez Ashdown 1882 - 1926 *John Newnham 1882 - *John Ashdown 1926 - 1937 *J B Newnham and Son 1937 - 1971 *Sidney Ashdown 1937 - 1971 References for above:- ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *Windmill World Page on New Mill ==Further reading== Online version Category:Windmills in East Sussex Category:Post mills in the United Kingdom Category:Grade II* listed buildings in East Sussex Category:Windmills completed in 1868 ","title":"New Mill, Cross in Hand"},{"id":"17303875","text":"Micaela Leonarda Antonia de Almonester Rojas y de la Ronde, Baroness de Pontalba (November 6, 1795\\"Jackson Square\\". Louisiana Historical Quarterly. Henry Renshaw.\\\\- April 20, 1874) was a wealthy New Orleans-born Creole aristocrat, businesswoman and real estate designer and developer who endures as one of the most recalled and dynamic personalities in the city's history, though she lived most of her life in Paris.Morales, Katy Frances (2005). La Madame et La Mademoiselle: Creole Women in Louisiana, 1718-1865, a thesis. Louisiana State University. On April 26, 1798, when Micaela was just years old, her Spanish father, Don Andrés Almonester y Rojas, died, leaving her his sole surviving heir. Micaela inherited a considerable fortune. Her estate was capably administered by her mother, Louise Denys de la Ronde, referenced as \\"a superbly competent businesswoman who had greatly increased the inheritance since Almonester's death.\\" New York Times: \\"A Spectacular Mess of a Marriage\\", by ANGELINE GOREAU; August 31, 1997. Following Micaela's marriage, in 1811, to her French cousin, Joseph-Xavier Célestin Delfau de Pontalba, she moved to France. The marriage was not successful and she became a virtual prisoner at the de Pontalba chateau near Senlis. Having failed, despite his concerted efforts over more than two decades, to gain possession of Micaela's entire inheritance, her father-in-law, Baron de Pontalba, eventually shot her four times at point-blank range with a pair of dueling pistols, and then committed suicide. She survived the attack, although her left breast and two of her fingers were mutilated by gunfire. Her husband, Cèlestin, succeeded his father as baron, and Micaela was thereafter styled Baroness de Pontalba. She eventually obtained a legal separation from her husband. Micaela was responsible for the design and construction of the famous Pontalba Buildings in Jackson Square, in the heart of the French Quarter. In 1855, she had built the Hôtel de Pontalba in Paris, where she lived until her death in 1874. Her life was worthy of an operatic plot, and eventually became one: Pontalba: a Louisiana Legacy, composed by Thea Musgrave. A play by Diana E.H. Shortes entitled The Baroness Undressed, and several novels, are also based on her dramatic life. ==Family== Micaela Leonarda Antonia Almonester was born November 6, 1795, in New Orleans, Louisiana, the eldest and only surviving child of Don Andres Almonester y Rojas and his aristocratic French wife, Louise Denys de la Ronde, a member of one of the most illustrious families in Louisiana.Arthur, Stanley C., Arthur, Stanley Clisby & de Kernion, George Campbell Huchet (1998). Old Families of Louisiana. Pelican Publishing. p.399 At the time of her birth, Louisiana was owned by Spain, though Spanish settlers were then greatly outnumbered by the colony's previous owners, who were mainly French. Don Andres, a native of Mairena del Alcor, Andalucia, Spain, was a wealthy notary and politician who amassed a fortune in real estate and land transfers from his power on the Cabildo, the Spanish governing council of New Orleans, and his contacts with the Spanish Crown.\\"Micaela Almonester Pontalba: the Baroness of Extremes\\". FrenchQuarter.com. Sally Reeves. Retrieved 2 March 2012 On 20 March 1787, he married Louise Denis de la Ronde (1758 - 1825), who was 30 years his junior. Despite that Christina Vella, in the introduction to her Pulitzer Prize-nominated biography, Intimate Enemies, describes Micaela's mother as \\"a poor French Creole, famed for marrying her father;\\" Louise was, in reality, a highly regarded beauty from a very wealthy family of no little import whose marriage had been arranged to extend a powerful alliance with Almonester. Louise was the eldest child of wealthy French-Canadian Naval Officer Pierre Denys de La Ronde (1726-1772), reassigned from Nouvelle-France to Nouvelle-Orleans by his Godfather, later French Louisiana Governor, Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial, and later distinguished in the French and Indian Wars. Through her father, Louise was the great-granddaughter of famed Judge and poet René-Louis Chartier de Lotbinière of Maison Lotbinière, a great-great niece of Simon-Pierre Denys de Bonaventure and, through his wife, Charlotte Denys de La Ronde, a great- niece of Claude de Ramezay. Louise's mother, Madeleine (Broutin) Denys de la Ronde, was the daughter of Ignace Francois Broutin, royal engineer, celebrated architect, and commandant of the French militia at Fort Natchez. Her only brother was wealthy plantation owner Pierre Denis de La Ronde (1762 - 1824), who would distinguish himself in the Battle of New Orleans, the Night Attack of which was then fought on his much-admired, if widely misnamed (Versailles, Louisiana), plantation, and beneath its equally misnamed allée of Southern live oaks. Prior to his death, her father had commissioned architect Gilberto Guillemard to design and construct the St. Louis Cathedral, the Presbytere and the Cabildo, all of which line one side of Place d'Armes. The original church and Cabildo had been destroyed in the Great New Orleans fire of 1788. Shortly afterwards, Micaela's mother, Louise, married Jean-Baptiste Castillon, the 25-year-old French Consul. The bride being seven years older than the groom was widely exaggerated, garnering much scorn from the local population, who showed their displeasure by conducting a riotous charivari that lasted for three days and nights, and featured effigies of her new bridegroom and dead husband in his coffin. The charivari was only called off once Louise had promised to donate the sum of $3,000 to the poor. Being the sole heiress to a considerable fortune, Micaela was the richest girl in the city.Arthur, Arthur & de Kernion, pp.28-29Arthur, Stanley Clisby (1936). Old New Orleans, a History of the Vieux Carré, Its Ancient and Historical Buildings. Westminster, Maryland: Heritage Books. p.81 Her younger sister, Andrea Antonia, had died in 1802 at the age of four. Micaela was educated, along with other Creole daughters of the French and Spanish elite, by the nuns at the old Ursuline Convent on la Rue Conde, now Chartres Street. She was an artistic and musical child who, by the age of 13, owned her own piano. At home she spoke French, although she knew Spanish, and later learned English. ==Marriage == In keeping with Creole tradition, a marriage was arranged for Micaela in 1811 when she was fifteen. Although Micaela was in love with an impoverished man, she had no choice but to accept the husband her mother had picked for her. He was her 20-year-old cousin, Joseph-Xavier Célestin Delfau de Pontalba, known as Célestin or \\"Tin-Tin\\", who although born in New Orleans, lived with his family in France. According to Micaela's biographer, Christina Vella, the de Pontalbas had made the proposition to her mother by letter, having regarded a matrimonial tie between the two families as a \\"business merger that would transfer the Almonester wealth into their hands\\". The prospective groom duly arrived in Louisiana with his mother, Jeanne Françoise le Breton des Chapelles Delfau de Pontalba, and after an acquaintance of just three weeks he and Micaela were married. The marriage was celebrated on 23 October 1811 at St. Louis Cathedral and attended by the most influential members of Creole society. Indicative of her high social rank amongst the Creole community, Micaela was given away at the wedding ceremony by nobleman and second cousin Bernard de Marigny, acting as a representative of Marshall Ney, the trusted military commander of Emperor Napoleon I.Arthur, Arthur & de Kernion, p.30 Father Antonio De Sedella officiated at the ceremony which was conducted in Spanish - a language Micaela's groom did not understand. In contrast to her mother's second marriage, the citizens of New Orleans strongly approved of this match, considered even more important a marriage than that of her mother to Don Almonaster, perhaps the most important marriage ever contracted in New Orleans between the Creole progeny of two illustrious families. Immediately upon her marriage, Micaela became a French citizen. Sometime after the wedding, Micaela and Célestin, accompanied by both their mothers, left Louisiana for France. They arrived in July 1812 and the couple took up residence with Célestin's family at Mont-l'Évêque, the moated, medieval de Pontalba chateau outside Senlis which was about 50 miles from Paris. Her mother, Louise Castillon, went to live in a rented house in Paris before she set about astutely buying up property in the city including a home on the Place Vendôme. She had become a widow for the second time in 1809 with the death of Jean Baptiste Castillon. At first the marriage was successful; Micaela became pregnant shortly after their arrival in France and eventually bore her husband a total of four sons and a daughter. To alleviate the boredom of country life, she converted a large room at the old chateau into a theatre where she put on plays. She put a lot of energy and enthusiasm into her project, ordering costumes for the performers and hiring local people for the minor roles and Parisian artists for the leading roles. She often performed onstage in the amateur theatrical productions which were attended by her friends from Paris. However, the constant interference of her eccentric father-in-law eventually turned the marriage into a disaster, exacerbated by Célestin's own weak character. Her father-in-law, Baron Joseph Delfau de Pontalba, who had served as an officer in the French and Spanish armies, was greedy and unstable, and over the years proceeded to make Micaela's life extremely unhappy and intolerable. The baron was already greatly disappointed with Micaela's dowry, appraising it to be much smaller than he felt that he had been led to expect. The $40,000 in cash plus jewelry that Micaela brought to Célestin as her dowry, which had been the sum agreed upon when the marriage contract was drawn up, represented only one-quarter of her Almonester inheritance; the remaining three-quarters was retained and grown larger by Louise. The old baron, intent upon seizing the vast Almonester fortune, had forced Micaela into signing a general Power of Attorney giving her husband control over her assets, rents, and capital, both dotal and as heir of her father's estate. In the early 1820s, to escape the tyranny of her father-in- law, Micaela persuaded Célestin to set up his own household in Paris, and the couple and their children moved into one of his father's homes on Rue du Houssaie, close to her mother's residence. The 1825 death of her mother left Micaela as the heir and manager of her parents' considerable estates, which now included numerous properties in Paris. The de Pontalbas furiously demanded that she sign over all of her New Orleans property to them, in exchange for her being allowed to assume control of her mother's Paris houses. In 1830, without her husband's permission, she went to New Orleans for an extended visit, in an effort to assert her land rights on American soil. Also taking the opportunity to travel, Madame de Pontalba stopped in Washington DC where President Andrew Jackson sent his carriage and secretary of state Martin Van Buren to bring her to the White House as his guest. The celebrated Battle of New Orleans, in which Jackson had defeated the invading British on 8 January 1815, had been fought on the grounds of the Chalmette Plantation, belonging to her Uncle Ignace Martin de Lino (1755 - 1815), which was also burned by invading forces (reputedly causing his death from a broken heart shortly after returning to his \\"treasured home\\" three weeks after the Battle).New Orleans Bar Association: Chalmette, by Ned Hémard; 2011, p. 3. The decisive Night Attack had also been fought next door, on the plantation grounds of his half- brother, Micaela's Uncle, Colonel Pierre Denys de La Ronde (1762 - 1824), which was also mostly ruined, having afterward been commandeered by the invading British as a field hospital.Creole families of New Orleans, by King, Grace Elizabeth; Macmillan; New York, USA; 1921; p. 315. Upon her return to France, the baron accused Micaela of deserting his son, Célestin; she then became a \\"virtual prisoner\\" of the de Pontalbas. In frustration, she took her children and returned to Paris, where she began a series of lawsuits to obtain a separation from Célestin; these initial attempts were not successful, due to the strict French marriage laws of the era. ===Shooting attack=== Micaela was shot with a pair of duelling pistols Micaela's attempts to protect her fortune and separate from Célestin so enraged Baron de Pontalba that he resorted to violence. On October 19, 1834, during one of her visits to the chateau, he stormed into her bedroom and shot Micaela four times in the chest at point- blank range with a pair of duelling pistols. After the first shot, she allegedly screamed out: \\"Don't! I'll give you everything\\". Whereupon he replied: \\"No, you are going to die\\" and shot her another three times in the chest, one bullet passing through the hand that she had instinctively put up to cover one of the gun's muzzles. Despite her injuries, Micaela made an attempt to escape her father-in-law and outside the door she fell into the arms of her maid who had rushed up the stairs upon hearing the first gunshot. With the armed baron still in pursuit, Micaela was dragged down the stairs to the drawing room where she fell to the floor, crying out, \\"Help me\\". Baron de Pontalba stood over her bleeding, unconscious body, yet he fired no more shots and returned to his study. She survived the shooting attack, despite multiple shot wounds. One of the bullets had crushed her hand; her left breast was disfigured and two of her fingers were mutilated. That evening, the baron committed suicide in his study by shooting himself in the head with the same dueling pistols. == Baroness de Pontalba & the Hôtel de Pontalba == As Célestin had succeeded to his father's barony upon the latter's suicide, Micaela was henceforth styled Baroness de Pontalba. After several more lawsuits, a civil law judge ordered the restitution of her property and Micaela was granted a legal separation from her husband, although they were never actually divorced. With some of the money her mother had willed her, she commissioned noted architect Louis Visconti to construct a mansion on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris which she used to host an endless, lavish succession of balls and soirées. Her mansion is known today as the Hôtel de Pontalba, and serves as official residence of the United States Ambassador to France. She was described as a \\"flamboyant, temperamental redhead\\", though portraits depict her with brown hair, blue-grey eyes, and pale skin; Christina Vella described her complexion as the \\"hue of stored muslin\\". She was not classically beautiful... she was intelligent and strong-willed, and attracted much admiration from the Parisians for her opulent parties. French Quarter noted historian Sally Reeves adds, \\"Contemporaries called her persistent, bright-eyed, intelligent, vivacious, prompt, shrewd and business like. Male historians characterized the Baroness as strong-willed, imperious, penurious, self-indulgent and vacillating, while her female biographer uncovered a life of affliction and resilience. Her portrait as a young wife shows a woman of grace and reflection; her photograph at an older age shows a hardened veteran with unmistakably masculine features,\\" a highly subjective opinion of a lady in her latter years, and of little to no historical import. == The Pontalba Buildings == One of the Pontalba Buildings Micaela had constructed in New Orleans' French Quarter In 1848 at the outbreak of revolution in France, Micaela and two of her sons, Alfred and Gaston, departed for New Orleans. There, she quickly became the leader of fashionable society, her salons drawing the city's most important and influential people. The wealthiest woman in New Orleans at the time,Ward, Martha (2004). Voodoo Queen: the spirited lives of Marie Laveau. University Press of Mississippi. p.39 her contemporaries regarded Micaela as having been shrewd, vivacious, and business-like. Seeing New Orleans for the first time after an absence of many years, Micaela had immediately noticed that the once-stylish French Quarter had become derelict and unsightly. The Place d'Armes, in the heart of the French Quarter, was little better than a slum; its parade ground muddy, and houses squalid and neglected. She owned most of the property in Place d'Armes as it formed part of her vast inheritance. Her assets there valued at $520,000, but despite being owner of the third most valuable property in the French Quarter, she made little profit from it as most of her tenants were slack in paying the rent. Micaela put her imagination to work and made energetic plans to remedy the situation. She ordered the houses to be demolished and hired the skilled building contractor Samuel Stewart to renovate the Place d'Armes. The following year after obtaining an agreement from the city for a 20-year tax exemption, she personally designed and commissioned the construction of the beautiful red-brick town houses forming two sides of Place d'Armes which are today known as the Pontalba Buildings. Their exteriors resembled the edifices in Paris' Place des Vosges. The construction of the Pontalba Buildings cost more than $300,000, and she was a constant visitor to the construction sites, often supervising the work on horseback. The cast-ironwork decorating the balconies were also her personal design and she had her initials \\"AP\\" carved into the center of each section. Micaela knew so much about the design and construction of buildings that historian Christina Vella described her as a \\"lay genius in architecture\\". At the time the buildings were row houses. Micaela and her sons occupied the house at number 5, St. Peter Street.Arthur, Stanley Clisby & Doré, Susan Cole (1990). Old New Orleans. p.124 When Swedish singer Jenny Lind visited New Orleans for a month in 1851, Micaela graciously allowed her the use of her own house along with a chef. Prior to her departure, Lind publicly expressed her gratitude to Micaela for the latter's lavish hospitality. Afterward, Micaela auctioned the furniture Lind had used. Micaela was also instrumental in the name change of Place d'Armes to Jackson Square; as well as the decision to convert it from a parade ground to a formal garden. She also helped finance the bronze equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson, featured prominently in the square, at whose side her uncle, Colonel Pierre Denys de La Ronde (1762 - 1824), had fought during the Battle of New Orleans, playing crucial roles in advising Jackson, and in rallying local support. It was alleged that when she was landscaping the garden, she threatened the mayor with a shotgun after he tried to prevent her from tearing down two rows of trees. Shortly after Jenny Lind's visit, she and her sons left New Orleans for good and went back to Paris where her eldest surviving son, Célestin, and his family resided. She spent the remainder of her life at her mansion on the Rue du Faubourg Saint- Honoré. When her estranged husband suffered a physical and mental breakdown she took him in and cared for him up until her own death.name=\\"vella310\\"> ==Death and legacy== Hôtel de Pontalba, Micaela's Paris mansion where she died in 1874 Micaela Almonester de Pontalba died at the Hôtel de Pontalba in Paris on April 20, 1874 at the age of seventy-eight. By this time she was already a legend in the city of her birth, as one of New Orleans' most dynamic personalities. Micaela left three surviving sons: Célestin (1815-1885), Alfred (1818-1877), and Gaston (1821-1875). Her first-born son, Joseph, and only daughter, Mathilde, had died as babies. Célestin and Alfred both married and had children whose descendants continue to reside in France into the 21st Century. Gaston, however, died unmarried.Arthur, Arthur & de Kernion, p.31 Micaela's husband, Célestin, died on 18 August 1878. He was buried beside her in the de Pontalba family tomb at Mont l'Évêque. Micaela is the subject of Thea Musgrave's 2003 opera, Pontalba which is based on Christina Vella's biography of Micaela, Intimate Enemies: The Two Worlds of the Baroness Pontalba. A play by Diana E.H. Shortes, entitled The Baroness Undressed, and many novels have been written about her dramatic life. ==Ancestry== ==See also== * 1850 House *Friends of the Cabildo's 1850 House website ==References == ==Bibliography== * * Category:1795 births Category:1874 deaths Category:Louisiana Creole people Category:Louisiana Creole people of Spanish descent Category:People of Colonial Spanish Louisiana Category:Businesspeople from New Orleans Category:American people of Spanish descent Category:American people of French descent Category:19th century in New Orleans Category:People in 19th-century Louisiana Category:19th-century American businesspeople Category:19th-century American businesswomen ","title":"Micaela Almonester, Baroness de Pontalba"},{"id":"17303914","text":"Walga Rock, also known as Walgahna Rock and Walganna Rock, is a granite monolith situated about west of Cue, Western Australia. It is one of the largest granite monoliths in Australia. Of profound cultural significance to Aboriginal people, the Wajarri elders are the acknowledged traditional owners. An extensive gallery of Aboriginal art exists within a cave in Walga Rock.http://www.australiaforeveryone.com.au/aborsites_wa.htm ==Painting== A painting of what appeared at first glance to be a sailing ship appears superimposed over some of the earlier works and underneath there are lines of writing that while resembling a Cyrillic or Arabic script have not been identified. While the Indigenous gallery is in itself remarkable, there has been a great deal of speculation about the painting, especially considering it is located from the coast. It has been argued that it was drawn by survivors of the heavily armed three-masted Dutch East India Company (, commonly abbreviated to VOC) ships or ; or that it represents a 'contact painting'http://wamuseum.com.au/collections/maritime/march/documents/No.%20216%20Indigenous%20depicts.pdf by Indigenous Australians who saw a ship on the coast and then moved inland. Those believing the images represents a VOC ship, are of the opinion the middle (or main) mast of the three shown in the Walga Rock/Walganha Rock image had broken and fallen overboard. Ratlines (to enable the crew to scale the rigging), and some stays (holding the masts vertical) are depicted and seven gunports are evident along the hull. ==A Steamship, not a VOC ship== It was not generally known until recent years that colonial-era steamers also carried sails and often used them more than their engines, especially when the wind was in the right direction, or they were short on coal. Few observers who are aware of that fact now doubt that the image is that of a steamship with the tall feature mid-ships being not a broken mast, but a long segmented funnel characteristic of the colonial era. The high poop deck of the VOC ships is also missing. A 19th century era sail (not the lateen-type sail seen on VOC ships) appears set on the mizzen (aftermost) mast of the Walga Rock ship. If this is correct, the bow is to the right of the image. To set a mizzen sail while at anchor in order to keep a vessel's head into the wind and ride more comfortably was a common practice and persists even to this day. is often seen at anchor with a mizzen set for example. In further casting doubt about a VOC ship necessarily being the inspiration for the Walga Rock image, false (painted), gunports were a common feature in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The barque wrecked on Rottnest Island in 1899 is shown in contemporary images with false gunports painted along its sides for example. Many steamers were similarly adorned. The similarities between the Walga Rock image and a flush-decked (without high poop or forecastle) 19th-century two- masted steamer with a long segmented funnel, with a mizzen sail up (to keep its head into the wind) and with false gun ports is compelling. ==SS Xantho?== Of the two-masted colonial steamships operating in the north-west of Australia, owned by the controversial pearler and pastoralist Charles Edward Broadhurst was of such import as the State's first coastal steamer (see following) it is a likely possibility as the inspiration for the Walga Rock painting. It is also possible that the Walga Rock 'gunports' may not be false at all, rather they are square or rectangular scuttles (port holes) that can be opened like a gunport. These often appeared on ferries designed to operate in sheltered waters and were opened for the comfort of its passengers when travelling in calm waters and when it got too hot below decks. When was built in 1848 as a ferry, reference was made in its contract to it being similar to the which is known to have rectangular ventilation ports. McCarthy, M., 2017., Xantho and the Broadhursts. Hesperian Press.pp 71-3. Research conducted by mid-west historian Stan Gratte, based on interviews conducted with 'old Cue residents' and local station identities the Morgan brothers, shows that the Walga Rock painting was produced around 1917 at the time when Sammy 'Malay' also known as Sammy Hassan is recorded as having arrived there from Shark Bay. Apparently a 'Malay' (the name generally but incorrectly describing indentured labourers who came to the north west from the islands north of Australia), Sammy Hassan remained camped at Sammy Well outstation on the north east end of Dirk Hartog Island before leaving the Bay to join Wajarri people at a well near Walga Rock.http://wamuseum.com.au/collections/maritime/march/DHI- site/other-01.html As Shark Bay legend has Sammy 'Malay' dying from a shark bite at his outcamp 'Sammy Well' Edwards, H.,1999. Shark Bay through Four Centuries. 1616-2000. A World Heritage Area. Shire of Shark Bay. p. 281. and anthropologist Esmée Webb disputes the Sammy 'Malay' connection, more research is required, however. Either way it is possible that Sammy Hassan was one of many hundreds of indentured 'Malay' pearl divers who were transported to north west Australia in the early 1870s. Of these, 140 boys aged between 12–14 were transported on the from Batavia, for example. Some were abandoned by Broadhurst at Geraldton when sank in 1872 and many others suffered a similar fate three years later in Shark Bay. While there are many examples of Indigenous art depicting vessels on the Western Australian coast, including others showing what appears to be the and possibly another steamer at Inthanoona Station east of Cossack, the Walga Rock painting is one of the most inland examples.Reynolds, R., Indernoona contact site: A Preliminary report of an engraving in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

Plastic pipe is a tubular section, or hollow cylinder, made of plastic. It is usually, but not necessarily, of circular cross-section, used mainly to convey substances which can flow—liquids and gases (fluids), slurries, powders and masses of small solids. It can also be used for structural applications; hollow pipes are far stiffer per unit weight than solid members. Plastic pipework is used for the conveyance of drinking water, waste water, chemicals, heating fluid and cooling fluids, foodstuffs, ultra-pure liquids, slurries, gases, compressed air, irrigation, plastic pressure pipe systems, and vacuum system applications. == Types == There are three basic types of plastic pipes: ===Solid wall pipe=== Extruded pipes consisting of one layer of a homogeneous matrix of thermoplastic material which is ready for use in a pipeline. ===Structured wall pipe=== Structured-wall pipes and fittings are products which have an optimized design with regard to material usage to achieve the physical, mechanical and performance requirements. Structured Wall Pipes are tailor made solutions of piping systems, for a variety of applications and in most cases developed in cooperation with users. ===Barrier pipe=== Pipe incorporating a flexible metallic layer as the middle of three bonded layers. Barrier pipe is used, for example, to provide additional protection for the contents passing through the pipe (particularly drinking water) from aggressive chemicals or other pollution when laid in ground contaminated by previous use. Most plastic pipe systems are made from thermoplastic materials. The production method involves melting the material, shaping and then cooling. Pipes are normally produced by extrusion. == Standards == Plastic pipe systems fulfil a variety of service requirements. Product standards for plastics pipe systems are prepared within the CEN/TC155 standards committee. These requirements are described in a set of European Product Standards for each application alongside their specific characteristics, for example: *Conveyance of drinking water: Hygienic requirements *Conveyance of gas: Highest Safety requirements *Plastic pipes for radiant heating and floor heating: Temperature resistance over decades *Sewer applications: High chemical resistance Plastic pipes are capable of fulfilling the specific requirement for each application. They do so over a long lifetime and with reliability and safety. The key success factor is achieved by maintaining consistently high quality levels. For plastic pipe products, these levels are defined by the different standards. Two aspects are fundamentally important for the performance of plastic pipes: flexibility and long lifetime. ==Materials used== * ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) * UPVC (unplasticized polyvinyl chloride) * CPVC (post chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) * PB-1 (polybutylene) * PP (polypropylene) * PE (polyethylene) of various densities, also abbreviated to LDPE, MDPE and HDPE (low, medium and high density polyethylene ; the medium density version is at times referred to as \\"black alkathene\\" in the UK) * PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) * PE-RT (polyethylene RT) * PEX (cross-linked polyethylene) ==Material characteristics== === HDPE (High-density polyethylene) === High-density polyethylene ===ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene)=== Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is used for the conveyance of potable water, slurries and chemicals. Most commonly used for DWV (drain- waste-vent) applications. It has a wide temperature range, from -40 °C to +60 °C. ABS is a thermoplastic material and was originally developed in the early 1950s for use in oil fields and the chemical industry. The variability of the material and its relative cost effectiveness has made it a popular engineering plastic. It can be tailored to a range of applications by modifying the ratio of the individual chemical components. They are used mainly in industrial applications where high impact strength and rigidity are essential. This material is also used in non-pressure piping systems for soil and waste. ===uPVC (unplasticized polyvinyl chloride)=== Unplasticized polyvinyl chloride pipe for underground water mains uPVC is a thermoplastic material derived from common salt and fossil fuels. The pipe material has the longest track record of all plastic materials. The first uPVC pipes were made in the 1930s. Beginning in the 1950s, uPVC pipes were used to replace corroded metal pipes and thus bring fresh drinking water to a growing rural and later urban population. uPVC pipes are certified safe for drinking water per NSF Standard 61 and used extensively for water distribution and transmission pipelines throughout North America and around the world. uPVC is allowed for waste lines in homes and is the most often used pipe for sanitary sewers. Further pressure and non-pressure applications in the field of sewers, soil and waste, gas (low pressure) and cable protection soon followed. The material's contribution to public health, hygiene and well-being has therefore been significant. Polyvinyl chloride or uPVC (unplasticized polyvinyl chloride) pipes are not well suited for hot water lines and have been restricted from inside water supply line use in the USA for homes since 2006. Code IRC P2904.5 uPVC Not listed. uPVC has high chemical resistance across its operating temperature range, with a broad band of operating pressures. Max operating temperature is reported at , and max working pressure: . Due to its long-term strength characteristics, high stiffness and cost effectiveness, uPVC systems account for a large proportion of plastic piping installations and some estimations put it that greater than of uPVC pipe are currently in service across applications. === CPVC (post chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) === CPVC is resistant to many acids, bases, salts, paraffinic hydrocarbons, halogens and alcohols. It is not resistant to solvents, aromatics and some chlorinated hydrocarbons. It can carry higher temperature liquids than uPVC with a max operating temperature reaching . Due to its greater temperature threshold and chemical resistance, CPVC is one of the main recommended material choices in residential, commercial, and industrial water and liquid transport. ===PB-1 (polybutylene) === PB-1 is used in pressure piping systems for hot and cold potable water, pre-insulated district heating networks, and surface heating and cooling systems. Key properties are weldability, temperature resistance, flexibility and high hydrostatic pressure resistance. One standard type, PB 125, has a minimum required strength (MRS) of 12.5 MPa. It also has low noise transmission, low linear thermal expansion, no corrosion and calcification. PB-1 piping systems are no longer sold in North America. Market share in Europe and Asia is small but steadily growing. In some markets, e.g. Kuwait, UK, Korea and Spain, PB-1 has a strong position. ===PP (polypropylene)=== Polypropylene is suitable for use with foodstuffs, potable and ultra pure waters, as well as within the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. PP is a thermoplastic polymer made from polypropylene. It was first invented in the 1950s and has been used for pipes since the 1970s. Due to the high impact resistance combined with good stiffness and high chemical resistance makes this material suitable for sewer applications. A good performance at operating temperature range from up to (continuous) makes this material suitable for in- house discharge systems for soil & waste. A special PP grade with high temperature behaviour up to (short-term) makes that material a good choice for in-house warm water supply . ===PE (polyethylene)=== Polyethylene Piping in Australia, made from HDPE material. Polyethylene has been successfully used for the safe conveyance of potable and waste water, hazardous waste, and compressed gases for many years. Two variants are HDPE Pipe (high-density polyethylene) and the more heat resistant PEX (cross-linked polyethylene, also XLPE). PE has been used for pipes since the early 1950s. PE pipes are made by extrusion in a variety of sizes dimensions. PE is lightweight, flexible and easy to weld. Its smooth interior finish ensures good flow characteristics. Continuous development of the material has enhanced its performance, leading to rapidly increasing usage by major water and gas utility companies throughout the world. The pipes are also used in lining and trench-less technologies, the so-called no-dig applications where the pipes are installed without digging trenches without any disruption above ground. Here the pipes may be used to line old pipe systems to reduce leakage and improve water quality. These solutions are therefore helping engineers to rehabilitate antiquated pipe systems. Excavation is minimal and the process is carried out quickly below ground. Also for PE pipe material, several studies demonstrated the long track record with expected lifetime of more than 50 years. Cross- linked polyethylene is commonly referred to as XLPE or PEX. It is a thermoplastic material that can be made in three different ways depending how the cross-linking of the polymer chains is being made. PEX was developed in the 1950s. It has been used for pipes in Europe since the early 1970s and has been gaining rapid popularity over the last few decades. Often supplied in coils, it is flexible and can therefore be led around structures without fittings. Its strength at temperatures ranging from below freezing up to almost boiling makes it an ideal pipe material for hot and cold water installations, radiator and under floor heating, de-icing and ceiling cooling applications ===PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride)=== PVDF, Polyvinylidene fluoride, is a fairly non-reactive, thermoplastic fluoropolymer with excellent chemical and thermal resistance for plastic pipework uses. PVDF resin is produced through polymerization of the vinylidene fluoride monomer. The PVDF resin is then used to make PVDF pipe as well as many other products. Industries and applications select PVDF pipe due to its inert, durable qualities. PVDF piping is used most in the chemical process industry due to its ability to plumb aggressive, corrosive solutions. PVDF pipe also sees common use in high purity applications, semi-conductor fabrication, electronics / electricity, pharmaceutical developments, and nuclear waste processing. PVDF piping specifications and performance characteristics approve PVDF pipe up to under pressurized system conditions. The pipe does not support fungus growth according to military test standard method 508, 81-0B. Dissimilar from other common thermoplastic pipes, (uPVC, CPVC, PE, PP), PVDF does not exhibit sensitivity to UV light or ozone oxidative damage, approving it for long term outdoor uses. === uPVC (unplasticized polyvinyl chloride) Variants === Based on the standard polyvinyl chloride material, three other variants are in use. One variant called OPVC, or PVCO,represents an important landmark in the history of plastic pipe technology. This molecular-oriented bi-axial high performance version combines higher strength with extra impact resistance. A ductile variant is the MPVC, polyvinyl chloride modified with acrylics or chlorinated PE. This more ductile material with high fracture resistance is used in higher-demand applications where resistance against cracking and stress corrosion is important. In several studies the long track record of uPVC pipes has been investigated. Recent investigations at the German KRV and the Dutch TNO have confirmed that uPVC water pressure pipes, when installed correctly have a useful life span of over 100 years. === PE RT === Polyethylene of raised temperature resistance or PE-RT expands the traditional properties of polyethylene. Enhanced strength at high temperatures are thus made possible through special molecular design and manufacturing process control. Its resistance to low or high temperatures makes PE-RT ideal for a broad range of hot and cold water pipe applications. == Characteristics == === Longevity of plastic piping systems === Plastic pipes have been used in service for over 50 years. The predicted lifetime of plastic piping systems exceeds 100 years. Several industry studies have demonstrated this prognosis. Plastic pipe materials have always been classified on the basis of long-term pressure testing. The measured failure times as a function of the stresses in the pipe wall has been demonstrated in so-called Regression Curves. An extrapolation based on measured failure times has been calculated to reach 50 years. The predicted failure stress at 50 years was taken as a basis for the classification. This value is called MRS, Minimum Required Stress, at 50 years. ===Pipe system failure=== Some reasons why plastic piping systems may fail are poor product bonding/gluing during installation and naturally- occurring physical damage, such as from tree root infiltration. === Flexibility === Plastic Pipes are classified by their ring stiffness. The preferred stiffness classes as described in several product standards are: SN2, SN4, SN8 and SN16, where SN is Nominal Stiffness (kN/m2). Stiffness of pipes is important if they are to withstand external loadings during installation. The higher the figure, the stiffer the pipe. After correct installation, pipe deflection remains limited but it will continue to some extent for a while. In relation to the soil in which it is embedded, the plastic pipe behaves in a 'flexible' way. This means that further deflection in time depends of the settlement of the soil around the pipe. Basically, the pipe follows the soil movement or settlement of the backfill, as technicians call it. This means that good installation of pipes will result in good soil settlement. Further deflection will remain limited. For flexible pipes, the soil loading is distributed and supported by the surrounding soil. Stresses and strains caused by the deflection of the pipe will occur within the pipe wall. However, the induced stresses will never exceed the allowed limit values. The thermoplastic behavior of the pipe material is such that the induced stresses are relaxing to a low level. It has to be noted that induced strains are far below the allowable levels. This flexible behaviour means that the pipe will not fail. It will exhibit only more deflection while keeping its function without breaking. However, rigid pipes by their very nature are not flexible and will not follow ground movements. They will bear all the ground loadings, whatever the soil settlement. This means that when a rigid pipe is subject to excessive loading, it will reach the limit for stress values more quickly and break. It can therefore be concluded that the flexibility of plastic pipes offers an extra dimension of safety. Buried Pipes need flexibility. ==Components of plastic pressure pipe systems== Pipes, fittings, valves, and accessories make up a plastic pressure pipe system. The range of pipe diameters for each pipe system does vary. However, the size ranges from and . Pipes are extruded and are generally available in: , , , and straight lengths and , , , and coils for LDPE and HDPE. Pipe fittings are moulded and come in many sizes: tee 90° equal (straight and reducing), tee 45°, cross equal, elbow 90° (straight and reducing), elbow 45°, short radius bend 90° socket/coupler (straight and reducing), union, end caps, reducing bush, and stub, full face, and blanking flanges. Valves are moulded and also come in many types: ball valves (also multiport valve), butterfly valves, spring-, ball-, and swing-check non-return valves, diaphragm valves, knife gate valve, globe valves and pressure relief/reduction valves. Accessories are solvents, cleaners, glues, clips, backing rings, and gaskets. ==See also== *HDPE Pipe * Pipe support * Piping * Reinforced thermoplastic pipe ==References* * *ISO Technical Committee TC 138 - Plastics pipes, fittings and valves for the transport of fluids *ASTM Plastics Pipe Standards *Plastics Pipe Institute (PPI) *Plastics Pipes and Fittings Association (PPFA) *The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association (TEPPFA) *Uni-Bell UPVC Pipe Association *PVC4Pipes (Global uPVC Pipe trade association) * http://www.teppfa.eu/why-use-plastic-pipe-systems/ *https://www.acu- tech.com.au/about-us/why-use-hdpe/ *Why use PVC Category:Piping Category:Plumbing Category:Pipe manufacture ","title":"Plastic pipework"},{"id":"17303965","text":"is a railway station on the Yunoyama Line in Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, Japan, operated by the private railway operator Kintetsu Railway.

After Henry Martyn, French is considered the second most important Christian missionary to the Middle East.Legacy of Henry Martyn Avril A. Powell, University of Lincoln (SOAS).\\"Thomas Valpy French, just mentioned as the first bishop of Lahore, was certainly one of these, whom Martyn's late nineteenth century biographer, George Smith, considered 'the missionary bishop who most resembled Martyn in character and service'. \\" ==Early life and education== Thomas Valpy French was born on New Year's Day in 1825, in Abbey, Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England, the son of Rev. Peter French and his wife, Penelope Arabella the daughter of the educationalist, Richard Valpy of Reading, Berkshire. Thomas' father was vicar of Holy Trinity Church for forty-seven years, and he grew up in the house, which was once part of the Benedictine Abbey, on the banks of the River Trent. French started his schooling at Reading Grammar School, and at age fourteen, he joined the Rugby School. In 1843, he won a scholarship to the University College, Oxford, where he was made a fellow in 1848. It was at Oxford that he first felt called to mission in India. ==Missionary career== On 16 April 1850 French joined the missionary service of Church Missionary Society, and was sent to Agra, India. He set sail to India on East Indian Queen on 11 September 1850 and reached Calcutta on 2 January 1851. Soon French headed off to Agra, where he was appointed for educational work. He founded the St. John's College at Agra, which formally opened in 1853, though he had started taking classes in small room with ten boys, while the college building was being built. The college was named as St. John's, after the college of another noted missionary, Henry Martyn (1781–1812) at Cambridge.St John's College, Cambridge He also learnt seven languages, including Hindustani, Punjabi, Urdu, Persian, Pashto and Arabic to properly administrate the school, as he also became school's first principal, and a post he held till the end of his seven-year stay at Agra. Later French married Miss Mary Anne Janson, whom he had met at Oxford, and one of his eight children, Ellen Penelope French (1854–1892), went on to marry Edmund Arbuthnott Knox, fourth Bishop of Manchester, (1903–1921).Chapter II His First Pioneer Work: The Agra College. 1861 saw French moving to the Punjab, where he started a new mission, which was the first in the area, though bad health forced him to leave for England by the end of 1862. He arrived back in Britain on 7 February 1863.Chapter III His Second Pioneer Work: The Frontier Mission. In 1877, on St. Thomas' Day at Westminster Abbey, London, French was appointed the first Anglican Bishop of a large new diocese of Lahore, which included, all of the Punjab and northwestern India, and remained so until 1887,Churches and Ministers: Home and Foreign EventsNew York Times, 13 January 1878.An Heroic Bishop Chapter VI.

French reached Muscat, on his final missionary work, on 8 February 1891 and became the first missionary to visit the region; he had just started setting up his work there, when his health started failing, and having been cared for by Portuguese Catholics he died on 14 May 1891 in Muscat, Oman and was buried in a Christian cemetery.Chapter XI. The First Divinity Colleges Beginnings in India By Eugene Stock, D.C.L. 1912. French himself illustrated throughout his career the importance of Beginnings. He was five times a pioneer. He founded the College at Agra; he started a new Mission on the Afghan Frontier; he established the Divinity College; he was the first Bishop of Lahore; he laid down his life in the attempt to penetrate the closed doors of Arabia. His remains lie under the cliffs of that hitherto almost inaccessible Mohammedan preserve. ==Legacy== In 2007, Rowan Douglas Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, hailed French as a personal hero. Williams again wrote of French in his 2016 book Being Disciples, saying of him that although he \\"seems to have made no converts\\" during his final years in the Middle East, he was not there primarily to make converts but out of \\"the desire to be where Jesus was ... to be in the company of Jesus Christ\\". ==References== ==Further reading== * The Life and correspondence of Thomas Valpy French, first bishop of Lahore by Herbert Alfred Birks. 2 vols, London, J.

He studied medicine in Brno. Having been arrested by the Gestapo in November 1939, he was briefly imprisoned at Brno's Špilberk Castle and subsequently deported to the Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg Nazi concentration camp. As a doctor he was active at the ear, nose and throat (otolaryngology) clinics in Brno, Hradec Králové, and the Central Military Hospital in Prague. He was named associate professor (1951) and full professor (1965) of Charles University in Prague. Ervín Černý lived in Prague but visited Podomí several times every year. He died on July 30, 2001 after a traffic accident. ==Medicine== Ervín Černý devoted himself mainly to the surgical treatment of ear, nose and throat health conditions. He delivered hundreds of lectures in and outside his homeland, and published 194 scientific papers, including an Atlas of Ear Surgery and Atlas of Throat Surgery, with his own illustrations. He was the honorary member of many Czechoslovak and international scientific organizations and his many international awards included the Czech Medical Society's Jan Evangelista Purkyně Prize, on the occasion of his 85th birthday. ==Historical geography== Ervín Černý was also a prominent scientist in the field of historical geography. Over 40 years of scientific endeavour in this field he explored a territory of over 600 square kilometres of his native Drahany Upland (Drahanská vrchovina) to discover 62 decayed medieval settlements including their forest areas.Černý, Ervín. Výsledky výzkumu zaniklých středověkých osad a jejich plužin: historicko- geografická studie v regionu Drahanské vrchoviny. 1st edition. Brno: Muzejní a vlastivědná společnost, 1992, 143 p. Vlastivědná knihovna moravská, vol. 74. . He published more than 70 scientific papers in this field, and six of them were released in book form. He dedicated his book of epical poems, Zelený barvínek, to his native region. He spent many years painstakingly collecting information about the history of his native village. In 1999 he presented Podomí with his detailed Chronicle to mark 650 years of the municipality. ==Barvínek== In 1997, Černý greeted an initiative of several citizens of the microregion (comprising the communities of Podomí, Krásensko, Ruprechtov and Senetářov) and helped to establish a civic association for the advancement of extracurricular education of children and young people. He was delighted by the proposal to call the new association “Barvínek” as a token of appreciation by his fellow citizens. “Barvínek” stood in good stead to Černý in the reclamation of a local well, and worked to edit the Podomí Chronicles and to organize an exhibition on his life and scientific as well as artistic endeavours. Together, they published the book \\"The Drahany Upland\\" and staked out an educational hiking trail of the same name (with five information desks). Barvínek activists helped Černý in his late years with the archeological research of decayed settlements and organized his lectures and public meetings. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:2001 deaths Category:People from Vyškov District Category:Czech scientists Category:Czech otolaryngologists Category:Czech archaeologists Category:20th-century archaeologists Category:20th-century surgeons ","title":"Ervín Černý"},{"id":"17304085","text":"is a railway station on the Yunoyama Line in Komono, Mie Prefecture, Japan, operated by the private railway operator Kintetsu Railway.

These artists use the aforementioned technologies in conjunction with video and computer games, surveillance cameras, wireless phones, hand-held computers, Apache Web server, Hypertext Markup Language and Global Positioning System devices (GPS).Tribe p.7 The Dada and Pop art movements greatly influence new media artists and provide a foundation from which to borrow and reinvent conceptual and aesthetic ideas.Tribe p.8 ==Examples and influences== Pop art and Dada influence the conceptual and aesthetic roots of New Media art. (Tribe2007 p. 7) The photomontage and readymade occur multiple times throughout various New Media works. In the genres of corporate parody and hacktivism, influences from Pop artists play a highly influential role for New Media artists. Claes Oldenburg designed in a collaborative effort the Second American Revolution monument for Yale's school of architecture in the 1960s. A caterpillar tractor of painted steel, aluminum, and fiberglass tip which subverts the warlike reference by casting a large tube of lipstick in place of a missile, in protest of the Vietnam War.Stockstad2005, p. 1104 both humor and critical approach were used to drive home a definitive anti-war statement and sentiment. New Media artists approach differs in that the audience must interact and come to find their own conclusion. The message is straightforward but arriving there requires thought and investigation into the deeper message. An example of this is seen in CarnivorePE, a parody of FBI surveillance activity. CarnivorePE was designed by the Radical Software Group, founded by Alexander R. Galloway in 2000 with a team of artists. What comes into question is whether the use of technologically sophisticated devices on everyday citizens is reasonable, and what is the rationale behind the practice. CarnivorePE was in response to a digital wiretapping software called Carnivore which the FBI used to surveil internet traffic in the 1990s. Agents could listen into chat room conversations and emails. The software uses an open source tool called a packet sniffer to listen in on the network on which it was installed. This detects the packets of data that make up emails sent and received, text and images posted online and websites browsed by individuals on the network. The data harvested is then used to develop clients: which is raw material for artistic interfaces. These clients are produced by New Media artists who then used an animated Flash interface to create brightly hued translucent circles to represent each active user. Each is represented with a different color; deep green, for example, represents someone using AOL.Tribe2007,p.78 The intent of these artists is to observe the utilitarian definition of surveillance, examine the use of it, and then to construct an artistic spectacle which demonstrates perhaps that wiretapping on ordinary citizens can be a spectacle in of itself. Software is then transformed into a colorful work of art with moving images and a powerful message. Pop artists' main goal was to expose the power of commercial culture, while both embracing and parodying popular culture.Stockstad2005, p1104 In contrast to Pop art, New Media artists can employ a level of absurdity or purposeless.Tribe 2007, p.38 The debate is open between artists using technologies for producing amazing effects and those who consider that new media are new means to convey meaning and a form of social engagement. This is clearly expressed in certain form of hacking or what the artist and theorist Maurice Benayoun calls Critical Fusion,Benayoun-Dump2011, p315 a critical approach of the \\"fusion of fiction and reality\\", built to unveil social and political issues at stake in the physical world. Critical Fusion is, according to Maurice Benayoun, a branch of Open Media Art.Benayoun2011 Vuk Ćosić, a Slovenian artist trained in archaeology, is among the pioneering New Media artists.ASCII History of Moving Images, 1999 He also coined the term net art. For his piece, he uses ASCII characters to construct images. It is not a new practice for artists prior to the 90s to construct images using this method, and these images can be made manually or by using software that converts images into ASCII characters. Cosic then incorporates the use of films and television programs to convert these images into animation with a retro-futuristic aesthetic. ==History== Vera Molnár a pioneer in computer art used geometric and mathematical abstraction to aid her artistic expression. In 1968 she began working with a computer to create images with the aid of a computer and terminals like a plotter and a cathode-ray tube screen. Early works of computer art include (Des)orders (1969). Manfred Mohr influenced by German philosopher Max Bense and French composer Pierre Barbaud, created hypercubes founded on a constructivist, algorithmic aesthetic. In 1969 he used a computer to superimpose multiple rules and found that this was the only way possible to superimpose multiple rules without losing track of the general concept. This strategy made the information become deeply buried and a certain participation is demanded from the viewer. Each work is based in a subset of a defined structure, ranging from cubes to 6-dimensional hypercubes.(Popper2007, p.68) ==See also== * List of new media artists * New media * New media art * New Media Consortium ==Footnotes== ==References== *Tribe, Mark.

He was a Labor member of the Australian House of Representatives for Barton from 1922 until 1925, when he was narrowly defeated by Nationalist Thomas Ley. McDonald was challenging the election result in court when he mysteriously disappeared in 1926. It is widely suspected that Ley, who later died in an insane asylum in England after committing murder and had several other rivals die in mysterious circumstances, was responsible for McDonald's disappearance. ==Early life== Frederick McDonald was born in Grafton, New South Wales, and studied at the Sydney Teachers' College and the University of Sydney before becoming a teacher. He had been teaching at Hurstville Superior Public School for thirteen years at the time of his election; among his previous postings was at Wellington. McDonald was president of both the New South Wales Teachers Federation (which he had been involved in founding) and the Assistant Teachers' Association, and had been credited with gaining the Teachers' Federation access to the Industrial Court. McDonald was president of his local branch of the Labor Party and president of Labor's electorate council for the Lang seat. He was narrowly defeated as a Labor candidate at the 1920 state election. In the 1922 federal election, McDonald contested the new seat of Barton for Labor, defeating the Nationalist member for the abolished seat of Illawarra, Hector Lamond. McDonald married Mrs. I. B. Burnett at Scots Church in Melbourne in April 1924. ==Political career== McDonald was involved an extremely contentious race for re-election at the 1925 federal election, when he was challenged by Nationalist candidate and former state minister Thomas Ley. During the campaign, Ley lambasted McDonald for his alleged links to communists. On the day before the election, 13 November 1925, McDonald alleged that the year before, Ley had tried to bribe him into not recontesting Barton. Ley ferociously denied the allegations, and on election day issued a writ against McDonald claiming £15,000 for defamation. Ley won the election by 1,090 votes, and McDonald acknowledged the defeat, stating \\"the Labor movement is ruled by its heart and not its head; had it been ruled by its head there would be a different story to tell\\". In January 1926, McDonald challenged the election result in the Court of Disputed Returns on the basis of the bribery allegations. In March 1926, it was reported that he and Ley had agreed on a legal settlement wherein McDonald issued an apology for the bribery allegations and they both stated their intention to withdraw their respective lawsuits. However, it has been suggested that McDonald subsequently \\"had a fit of remorse\\" and refused to withdraw the petition. ==Disappearance== On 15 April 1926 McDonald vanished on his way to a meeting with New South Wales Premier Jack Lang, in which he was to have discussed a proposal to have the election result declared void. He was last seen at 2.30pm by his wife outside Challis House in Martin Place when he left for the appointment with Lang, but never arrived. Despite the March announcement, McDonald's Court of Disputed Returns litigation had not been formally withdrawn, and when the matter went to court on 23 April, his solicitor denied knowledge of the settlement and sought an adjournment in the hope that McDonald would be found alive; however, the matter was struck out on the basis of the March announcement. Despite an extensive search, neither McDonald's body nor his attaché case were ever found.Australian Dictionary of Biography: Thomas John Ley. Retrieved 19 June 2015 Initial reports suggested that McDonald was suffering from \\"nervous trouble\\" at the time at the time of his disappearance. However, Ley was later deemed insane after committing murder in England, and was committed to Broadmoor Hospital, where he died. It is now widely suspected that Ley may have been responsible for McDonald's disappearance, and several other suspicious deaths of his political and personal opponents. ==See also== * List of people who disappeared ==References== Category:1872 births Category:1920s missing person cases Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Date of death unknown Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Barton ","title":"Frederick McDonald"},{"id":"17304137","text":"The Liberal Foundation (Fondazione Liberal), since 2009 called Liberal-Popular Foundation (Fondazione Liberal-Popolare), was a foundation led by Ferdinando Adornato that represented the conservative, liberal, secular and Catholic wing of the Union of the Centre.Folino e’ il nuovo coordinatore regionale dei giovani circoli della Fondazione Liberal The foundation was organized on the territory through the Liberal Clubs (Circoli Liberal). ==History== It was founded in 1995 by Ferdinando Adornato and Ernesto Galli della Loggia, as a liberal-democratic inspiration foundation that bridged between the left opposition (formed by the Democratic Party of the Left) and that of the Centre (composed by the Italian People's Party), to build a new alternative to the Centre-right coalition of Silvio Berlusconi. The first steering committee included: Ferdinando Adornato, Antonio Baldassarre, Augusto Antonio Barbera, Rodolfo Brancoli, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Franco Debenedetti, Diego Della Valle, Ernesto Galli della Loggia, Alfio Marchini, Mino Martinazzoli, Vittorio Merloni, Angelo Panebianco, Sergio Romano, Cesare Romiti, Giorgio Rumi and Marco Tronchetti Provera.

In 1998 Galli della Loggia left «Liberal» and the foundation, at the behest of its president Adornato, gradually approached the centre-right coalition, up to the adhesion of the same Adornato to Forza Italia.

He has been detained since April 17, 2012 after arriving at Tan Son Nhat airport in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. On April 28, 2012, Vietnam's state media reported the pro-democracy activist has been arrested and accused of organizing \\"terrorism\\" activities. Previously, Dr Quan was arrested in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam on a trip on November 17, 2007 for preparing pro-democracy flyers. During that first trip, he brought in a Vietnamese translation of the book From Dictatorship to Democracy about nonviolent resistance. He stood trial in Vietnam on May 13, 2008 on charges of \\"terrorism\\" and was sentenced to 6 months in prison. He was eventually released on May 17, 2008 and returned to his home in Elk Grove, California to his wife and two teenage sons. In 2012, he was re-arrested on another trip to Vietnam, and held in prison for 9 months. Following intense US pressure, he was deported on January 30, 2013. == Background == Nguyen Quoc Quan is a former high school math teacher in Kien Giang, Vietnam. He escaped from Vietnam on a fishing boat in 1981, ending up in the United States where he earned a doctorate degree in mathematics from North Carolina State University. He has also practiced software engineering. He is a long-time democracy activist, a devotee of Martin Luther King Jr. and member of senior leadership committee of Viet Tan. == 2007 arrest == Vietnamese pro-democracy rally demanding for the release of Nguyen Quoc Quan Nguyen Quoc Quan entered Vietnam on November 15, 2007 on a bicycle through the Cambodian border. On November 17, 2007 along with two other Viet Tan members (Truong Van Ba, a Hawaiian restaurant owner, and Frenchwoman Nguyen Thi Thanh Van, a contributor to Viet Tan's Radio Chan Troi Moi radio show) he was arrested in the southern suburb of Ho Chi Minh City. At the time, they were leading a \\"democracy seminar\\" and preparing pro-democracy pamphlets, when 20 security officers raided the house. Also arrested in the same group were Vietnamese citizens Nguyen The Vu, Nguyen Trong Khiem, Nguyen Viet Trung and Thai journalist Somsak Khunmi. The two-page pamphlet titled \\"Non-Violent Struggle: The Approach To Overcome Dictatorship\\" (translated from Vietnamese) and protesters to \\"faithfully maintain the discipline of non-violence.\\" The arrests were not officially confirmed by the Vietnamese government until November 22, 2007. During the press briefing, officials declined to state which laws the detained individuals have broken, nor released any information about Nguyen Quoc Quan, whose whereabouts remained unknown for almost a week. At the beginning, state- controlled media in Vietnam acknowledged jailing only some, but not all activists. The website of the newspaper Sai Gon Giai Phong originally showed an image of US national Nguyen Quoc Quan wearing prison garb, but hours later replaced it with a manipulated image of him wearing a white shirt. Subsequent articles also listed his nationality as \\"unknown\\". Authorities in Vietnam have attempted to link the arrest of these Viet Tan members to two Vietnamese Americans who reportedly attempted to smuggle firearms into the country six days after the original arrests. However, Viet Tan has firmly denied any association with those individuals. === International response === The arrest was condemned by organizations and individuals worldwide including Reporters Without Borders and Human Rights Watch. In a letter to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, US representatives Loretta Sanchez, Zoe Lofgren, and Neil Abercrombie wrote \\"Not only do we ask you to work to return these United States citizens to the United States, but we ask you to convey to the government of Vietnam that the arbitrary detention of United States citizens is unacceptable.\\" Coinciding with Human Rights Day on December 10, 2008, 11 members of the United States congress wrote a joint letter to the prime minister of Vietnam inquiring why the group of people are being detained in Vietnam and when they will be returned to their families in the United States. === Appeal for release === In response to the detention, California-based Viet Tan organized an international campaign under the name of Free Them Now that included a petition demanding for an immediate release. The petition collected more than 18,000 signatures. In addition, an international lobbying campaign was undertaken to rally support of Western government officials behind this issue, including many elected officials from the United States, Norway, France and Australia. The broad support of this campaign by many officials is credited for his eventual release. On January 7, 2008 55 members of the California assembly signed a letter to the president of the Vietnam stating the \\"arbitrary detention of these individuals is unacceptable\\" and requested their immediate release. On March 12, 2008, chairman of Viet Tan, Do Hoang Diem, appeared before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs along with Nguyen Quoc Quan's wife to appeal to lawmakers to confront the issue. The next day, U.S. Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) sponsored and introduced a house resolution condemning the detention of Dr. Nguyen Quoc Quan, and calls for a removal of permanent normal trade relations status with Vietnam until Dr. Nguyen is released. Co-sponsors of the bill include U.S. representatives Steven Chabot (R-OH), Thomas Davis (R-VA), Bob Filner (D-CA), Nicholas Lampson (D-TX), Daniel Lungren (R-CA), Michael McNulty (D-NY), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) and Frank Wolf (R-VA). Angela P. Aggeler, secretary for press and cultural affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi, said \\"U.S. officials both here in Vietnam and in Washington have repeatedly called for the release of any individual for peacefully expressing his or her views and we have urged them to release Dr. Quan and that he be allowed to return to the United States as swiftly as possible,\\" === Detention === During Nguyen Quoc Quan's detention in Vietnam along with Thai citizen Somsak Khumni and Vietnamese businessman Nguyen The Vu, the U.S. consulate was allowed to visit him only once per month. Family visits were prohibited altogether. His wife was first granted a visa to visit him in January 2008, though the Vietnamese consulate revoked the visa one week prior her scheduled trip. She was able to talk to him only after his release 6 months later. === Trial and sentence === Democracy activist visits with US Congressman Mike Honda in 2008, after his release from prison in Vietnam Nguyen Quoc Quan along with the other two remaining detainees, Nguyen The Vu, and Somsak Kunmi stood trial in Vietnam on May 13, 2008. Officials from the U.S. consulate attended the behind-the-doors trial. Nguyen Quoc Quan was sentenced to six months in prison, but since he has already served that time, was released on May 17, 2008. Nguyen The Vu was released immediately, and Somsak Kunmi will server another three months before he will be released. Other than the sentences, the preceding judge would not release any further detail of the trial. Following the sentencing, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Hanoi said in a statement: \\"We welcome his release and return to the United States. We remain disappointed by the decision of the Government of Vietnam to charge Dr. Quan with 'terrorism.' We are not aware of any information that would support charges of 'terrorism'. We object to the detention and prosecution of any individual for peacefully expressing his or her own views.\\" Michael Orona, The US State Department deputy director overseeing human rights, said that Quan \\"should not have been arrested in the first place.\\" When Dr. Quan returned to United States on May 17, 2008, he was greeted by a group of cheering supporters, including Sacramento assemblyman Dave Jones. == 2012 arrest == On April 17, 2012, Dr. Quan was at the Tan Son Nhat airport, when he called his wife and told her that he will call again shortly when he arrives at the hotel. Shortly after the phone call, he was then arrested at the airport in Ho Chi Minh City. Government officials did not confirm his arrest until five days later. He was detained on charges of terrorism and for planning to \\"instigate a demonstration\\" during the anniversary of the Fall of Saigon. The charges were later changed to subversion of the state. He is being detained for at least four months. According to his wife, he was planning to visit his younger sister and \\"talk about democracy and the rule of law\\". The U.S. consulate in Vietnam has confirmed that he has been arrested, but no formal charges have been filed and has not been granted a lawyer. Since his arrest, the US consulate was able to visit him only once. === International response === Upon his 2012 arrest, Viet Tan released a statement that the Vietnamese government's accusation of 'terrorism' against Quan is \\"completely fabricated and has no basis.\\" The Wall Street Journal, in its April 30 editorial, notes that the Vietnamese government holds a radically different definition of \\"terrorism,\\" citing the authorities recent arrests of American citizens for crimes that aren't crimes in any normal country. Six members of the U.S. Congress signed a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and urged the State Department to call for Dr. Quan's immediate release on grounds that the Vietnamese government is \\"abusing its vague national security provisions as the pretext to arrest and detain individuals who peacefully advocate for religious and political freedom.\\" Luke Simpkins, a Member of the Australian Parliament, has stated that the accusations by the Vietnamese government against Dr Quan are \\"completely fabricated and have no basis\\". === Appeal for release === On April 14, 2012, his wife Mai Huong Ngo went before a House of Representative panel to appeal for help in releasing her husband. She specifically requested the help of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Australian Member of Parliament Luke Simpkins also called for unconditional and immediate release of Dr Quan and all other voices of conscience. On May 17, US House Representatives Frank Wolf, Dan Lungren, Zoe Lofgren, Loretta Sanchez and Bob Filner co-signed a letter addressed urging U.S. Ambassador David Shear to \\"work to secure (Nguyen’s) immediate release so he can be reunited with his wife and two sons.\\" On January 11, 2013 as the trial date was announced, US representatives Zoe Lofgren, Loretta Sanchez, Hang Johnson and Gerry Connolly repeated writing a letter to David Shear, US ambassador to Vietnam, asking him to take \\"immediate actions to secure the release of Dr. Nguyen Quoc Quan.\\" === 2013 release === His trial was set for January 22, 2013. However, prior to the trial was to take place, it was postponed with no explanation. If charged, he could face up a ten years in prison. Following intense US diplomatic pressure, he was released, deported on January 30, 2013. He was reunited with his family after arriving in Los Angeles Airport on January 30, 2013. == See also == * Human rights in Vietnam * Viet Tan * Lê Quốc Quân * Do Hoang Diem * Duy Hoang * Hong Vo ==References== == External links == * Viet Tan Official website, English Portal * Free Them Now campaign * US House Resolution condemning the detention of Dr. Nguyen Quoc Quan * Free My Husband, Online Petition to the US Congress asking for their help in releasing him * Democracy Activist, Portrait Nguyen Quoc Quan by Gianluca Costantini Category:Vietnamese democracy activists Category:Living people Category:Victims of human rights abuses Category:Vietnamese dissidents Category:Political repression in Vietnam Category:Politics of Vietnam Category:Prisoners and detainees of Vietnam Category:Việt Tân politicians Category:American people imprisoned abroad Category:1954 births Category:People from Elk Grove, California ","title":"Nguyen Quoc Quan"},{"id":"17304227","text":"Savvas may refer to: *Savvas (given name) *Savvas (surname) *Ayios Savvas, Nicosia, a neighbourhood and parish of Nicosia, Cyprus * Savvas Learning, the new name of the company formerly known as Pearson K-12 Learning ==See also== *Sabbas *Savva (disambiguation) ","title":"Savvas"},{"id":"17304239","text":"James Thomas Tully (1877 - 15 October 1962) was an Australian politician.

Tully was also a vice-president of the St George Rugby League Club. He was previously an unsuccessful candidate at the 1917 state election, 1919 federal election and 1922 state election. In 1928, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Labor member for Barton, defeating incumbent Nationalist Thomas Ley, and was re-elected in 1929. He retained the seat until 1931, when he was challenged in the wake of the 1931 Labor split by both the United Australia Party's Albert Lane and Lang Labor's John Eldridge, the member for Martin. Lane won the seat, making it the only time in Australian history that two sitting members have been simultaneously defeated for the same seat.

Galasso reportedly began her business in the early 1970s as a way to pay for college. She purchased individual packs of cards—primarily Topps—and built sets for sale, which was unusual for that time. (The first verifiable complete sets sold were in the 1974 J.C. Penney catalog.) Galasso eventually opened a shop around 1975 on Bay Ridge Parkway and later relocated to 6305 10th Avenue in Brooklyn, New York. At one point, Galasso claimed in her catalogs and shipping labels to be the \\"World's Largest Hobby Card Dealer.\\" Galasso printed some cards in partnerships with Topps and The Card Memorabilia Associates, Ltd. (TCMA) and eventually printed some independent card sets as well. One well known set of cards, called \\"Galasso Glossy Greats,\\" was issued over a period of eight years between 1974 and 1984. At the time, most baseball card cards from companies such as Topps were not issued in set form. Galasso assembled sets herself and sold them to individuals via mail order. Each 45-card series of Galasso Glossy Greats were issued as a promotion. Customers who bought a complete set of baseball cards received one of the 45-card sets for free. Note that none of the cards are actually glossy. Following is a description of each set: * Series 1: This series was issued in 1977 and depicts stars of the 1950s (Ted Williams, Stan Musial, Mickey Mantle, and more). The cards in this series were numbered 1–45. * Series 2: This series was issued in 1979 and depicts stars of the 1930s (Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Lefty Grove, and more). The cards in this series are numbered 46–90. * Series 3: This series was issued in 1980 and depicts stars of the 1920s (Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Lefty Grove, and more). The cards in this series are numbered 91–135. * Series 4: This series was issued in 1981 and depicts stars of the 1910s (Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson, Nap Lajoie, and more). The cards in this series are numbered 136–180. * Series 5: This series was issued in 1983 and depicts stars of the 1933 All-Star Game, which is the first-ever Major League Baseball game, played July 6, 1933, at Comiskey Park in Chicago. The cards in this series are numbered 181-225. * Series 6: This series was issued in 1984 and depicts stars who achieved a variety of feats. The cards in this set are numbered 226–270. This set is much more difficult to purchase as a complete set. The first five series are readily found at card shows and on auction sites.

The original 1 1/2-story house, now the west end, was built in 1771. It has a stone exterior chimney on the west end. Now one large room, it may originally have been arranged as a hall-parlor plan; it formerly had a door between the two south windows and a straight stair with winders in the northeast corner. About 1812 the house was enlarged by the addition of a free-standing second room to the east of the first building. Either soon or immediately, the space between the two buildings was enclosed to form a central passage, with two shed rooms on the north side, and the stair was rebuilt approximately in its original location, but opening into the passage. There is no visible interior woodwork from the 1771 period; the entire interior is finished with vernacular Federal woodwork. Although both main chimneys are built of stone, doubled shouldered, and with later brick stacks, the stonework of the east chimney consists of larger and finer cut stone, suggesting a later construction date than the west chimney. The northeast shed room is heated by a fireplace with an exterior chimney. To the east, between the two chimneys, is a pair of lighted pent closets with early shelving. The southeast room has a door to the exterior sheltered by a shed porch with thick turned early 19th century columns. The side door, typical of North Carolina vernacular design, suggests that the exterior kitchen was to the east of the main house. Between the unheated northwest shed room, which opens only into the southwest room, and the passage is a lighted closet with a built-in beaufat consisting of glazed doors over drawers over a lower cupboard section. There is a similar beaufat, with arch-top lights, in the large southwest room. The closet opens only into the passage. The three principal rooms have flat paneled wainscot; the passage wainscot is a double range of panels with the stiles \\"breaking joint\\" like brickwork. All doors in the house are raised paneled on the \\"good\\" side and flat paneled on the back and are hung on their original butt hinges. In the garret, the stair rises into an unheated central space the width of the passage below. To the east and west are heated chambers with simple transitional Georgian / Federal chimney pieces. The central space is lighted by one dormer window on the north wall. This gabled dormer was reconstructed in the 1970s within the original framed opening. The reconstruction is probably inaccurate; the original probably had a shed roof. The chambers are lighted only by pairs of casement windows with their original hinges on either side of the chimneys. In the 1970s the house retained all of its Federal period interior paint colors. The passage and southeast room had dark olive green trim with doors grain-painted as yellow pine; the southwest room had white trim, light blue plaster, and grain-painted pine doors; the pent closets had blue trim and shelves with white-painted wood sheathed walls; the passage closet beaufat was blue with the glazed doors painted red; the northeast room had white trim; the garret chambers had green trim; the center room in the garret had blue trim, with white-painted wood sheathing above the wainscot and a balustrade with a red newel and yellow square pickets. In the yard in the 1970s, a late 19th-century kitchen survived northwest of the house. It had been moved in the 20th century from a position southeast of the house and its chimney demolished. Northwest of the house, an early unlined well was embellished in the 1970s by an early 19th-century combination well shelter and storage building which formerly stood on the original site of the 1775 Lane-Bennett house near Macedonia in Wake County. In the early 1970s, other interesting features on the place included, west of the house, the original roadbed of the Oxford-Smithfield Stage Road; the \\"cook's house\\" (now collapsed/demolished), a late 19th-century replacement of an earlier stone chimneyed structure which burned; a 19th-century packhouse; a late 19th- century outhouse; and a crude 20th-century shelter for an automobile. In September 1985, the Rogers-Whitaker-Haywood House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==See also== * List of Registered Historic Places in North Carolina ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Houses completed in 1771 Category:Federal architecture in North Carolina Category:Houses in Wake County, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Wake County, North Carolina ","title":"Rogers-Whitaker-Haywood House"},{"id":"17304322","text":"Hot Type was a Canadian television series, which aired weekly on CBC Newsworld.\\"TV camera smiles on Evan Solomon\\".

He was a Nationalist Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Balmain from 1922 to 1927 and a United Australia Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1931 to 1940. Lane was born in Windsor, New South Wales and moved to Sydney at seventeen, where he became an accountant. He was actively involved in the Methodist church, was a keen temperance campaigner, and helped found and was a long-term council member of the New South Wales Home for Incurables. The 1916 liquor referendum which introduced six o'clock closing of pubs in New South Wales was reportedly \\"largely due to his efforts\\" as a temperance campaigner. In 1917 he contested the federal election as the unsuccessful Nationalist candidate for the safe Labor seat of Dalley. In 1922 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as one of four members for the seat of Balmain, representing the Nationalist Party of Australia. The seat was abolished in 1927, and Lane contested the new single-member seat of Leichhardt, but was defeated. Lane contested the 1931 federal election as the United Australia Party candidate for Barton, creating history by defeating both the incumbent member for Barton, James Tully, and the member for Martin, John Eldridge, who, as a member of the Lang Labor breakaway party, was attempting to transfer to Barton. Lane held the seat until 1940, when he was defeated by future Labor leader H. V. Evatt. In December 1941, he was hit by a car in Double Bay and broke both his legs. Lane died at his home at Bexley in December 1950 and was cremated at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium. ==References== Category:Nationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:United Australia Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Barton Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:1873 births Category:1950 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Council ","title":"Albert Lane (politician)"},{"id":"17304357","text":"Edward Norman Bane (born March 22, 1952) is a former professional baseball pitcher and executive, who played from 1973 to 1976 for the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball (MLB). ==Career== Bane attended Arizona State University, where he pitched on the school's baseball team.

The SIM-5 is designed to imitate the H&K; MP5. The SIM-5 uses iron sights, like its real counterparts, though it may be hard to use with paintball goggles on. The SIM-5 achieved to give the MilSim look that low-end markers would have difficulties matching without extensive modifying. This includes the safety design, receiver shape, cocking handle, and stock installation. The SIM-5 also features the quick barrel removal. As it only requires only one pin to be pulled out before the whole barrel can be removed, thoroughly cleaning the barrel is a lot easier on the field. Though the downside is that this special design is that the barrel cannot have a thread, and makes it harder to get an aftermarket barrel upgrades. Unlike most markers though, Ariakon has incorporated a high-quality barrel as a standard, so barrel upgrades will not be necessary. Ariakon has designed the SIM-5 to be lightweight, and most parts are made of aluminum and plastic. It has been complained about the foregrip, upper receiver, and stock being plastic, are easily broken under harsh conditions, but Ariakon seems to have fixed the fragile stock. ==SIM-5 Pro Elite== The SIM-5 Pro Elites are upgraded with a red/green dot sight and a sight rail, a mock silencer, a retractable stock, and a tactical flash light. ==Features and specifications== * Semi-Automatic\\"Owner's Manual Specifications\\"Ariakon.com \\"Official Website Specifications\\"Ariakon.com * Adjustable Sights for Windage & Elevation * Air-Through MP5 Style Magazine * MP5 Style Cocking Lever * Quick Field Stripping Pins * MP5 Style Safety * Double Stack Blow-back operation * Barrel Length: 9 in (229 mm) * Overall Length: 29 in (73.7 cm) * Caliber: 0.68 inches (17.3 mm) * Weight: 4.14 lb (1.9 kg) * Power: CO2, Compressed Air, or Nitrogen ==See also== *Scenario paintball *Ariakon Overlord ==References== ==External links== * Ariakon SIM-5 Basic Official Site * Ariakon SIM-5 Pro Elite Official Site * Ariakon Forum Category:Paintball markers ","title":"Ariakon SIM-5"},{"id":"17304476","text":"The Heartsfield–Perry Farm is a historic home and farm located at Rolesville, Wake County, North Carolina, a satellite town of the state capital Raleigh.

On Christmas Eve in the year of 1940, Rudy Horn was given three apples from his father. It was then that his father had encouraged him to start juggling them. He continued with this talent since this day on. Two laters after he was given these apples from his father, he gave his first performance in the WIntergarden. In the next five years that followed the war, he entertained the troops from the United States that were located in Germany. Since the currency in Germany was basically worthless at the time, he would work for cigarettes and chocolate that he would barter for food. One of the stunts that he was known for other than juggling is that he would be able to stack up teacups and their saucers on his head from kicking them up from his foot. He also had the skill of continuously bouncing seven balls off of a drum. In the year of 1949, Horn had joined the Circus Krone. Once he joined the circus, he was able to obtain a unicycle that he learned how to ride within a week. Once he incorporated the unicycle into his teacup act, he became even more popular. He traveled to America to perform in Las Vegas, Reno, Chicago, and San Francisco, but eventually in the year of 1955 he went back to Germany.The German government awarded Rudy Horn the Bundesverdienstkreuz, which is a high achievement award.

While banned, the organization continues to receive financial support from Sikh extremists based in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/canada-lists-babbar-khalsa-sikh- youth-federation-terror-outfits-1408833-2018-12-13 == History and activities == In 1984, the All India Sikh Students Federation (AISSF) started the ISYF in the United Kingdom as an international branch. The 1985 bombing of Air India Flight 182 off Ireland, the deadliest aircraft terror attack until the September 11, 2001 attacks, and the attempted bombing of Air India Flight 301, were allegedly carried out by Sikh extremists. Inderjit Singh Reyat, a member of the ISYF, was found guilty of manslaughter for making the bombs and had to spend more than 20 years in prison at Canada, and is the only individual convicted in these attacks as of 9 Feb 2009. ISYF members have engaged in terrorist attacks, assassinations, and bombings against both Indian figures and moderate Sikhs opposing them. The organisation has also collaborated and associated with other Sikh terrorist organisations, including Babbar Khalsa, the Khalistan Liberation Force, and Khalistan Commando Force. Lord Bassam of Brighton, then Home Office minister, stated that ISYF members working from the UK had committed \\"assassinations, bombings and kidnappings\\" and were a \\"threat to national security.\\" In 2001 it was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the British government for its attacks. == Leadership == Jasbir Singh Rode was the nephew of Bhindranwale and member of fundamentalist Sikh organisation Damdami Taksal. After Operation Bluestar while in Pakistan Rode used the Sikh shrines at Pakistan to make anti-India speeches and provoked the audience to attack the Indian diplomats who were present. Rode then arrived in the United Kingdom in August 1984. On 23 September 1984, at a meeting in Walsall, The formation of International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF) was announced by Harpal Singh and Jasbir Singh Rode. The group had a 51-member panel headed by Pargat Singh.. But, by December 1984, Rode was expelled from the UK for publicly advocating violent methods in support of the Khalistan movement. Rode Then flew around seeking asylum, and was arrested in Manila by the Indian authorities in a chase across Thailand and Philippines. He was imprisoned for two years in India. Upon his release, he moderated, now advocating pursuing constitutional changes within Indian framework. This mode disappointed many of his followers and created a rift in the UK branches roughly along north/south lines: the northern branches known as ISYF (Rode) followed Rode's moderate stance while the southern branches instead followed Dr. Sohan Singh. The current leader of ISYF, Lakhbir Singh Rode, is sought for trial in India. He is wanted in cases of arms smuggling, conspiracy to attack government leaders in New Delhi and spreading religious hatred in Punjab. Per Indian sources, he is currently living in Lahore, Pakistan. ==Foreign support== There are allegations made by sources from the Indian based website the South Asian Terrorism portal that the ISYF has been supported by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence organisation. == Bannings == ===United Kingdom=== In February 2001, the United Kingdom banned twenty-one groups, including the ISYF, under the Terrorism Act 2000. The ISYF was removed from the list of proscribed groups in March 2016 \\"following receipt of an application to deproscribe the organisation\\". In a separate legal challenge by the leadership of the Sikh Federation (UK), including Bhai Amrik Singh, the Home Secretary confirmed on 14 December 2015 that she would be recommending to Parliament that the ban on the International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF) should be removed (this was removed in March 2016).

The Vancouver Sun reported in February 2008 that Singhs were campaigning to have both the Babbar Khalsa and International Sikh Youth Federation delisted as terrorist organisations. The article went on to state that the Public Safety Minister had never been approached by anyone lobbying to delist the banned groups and said, \\"the decision to list organisations such as Babbar Khalsa, Babbar Khalsa International and the International Sikh Youth Federation as terrorist entities under the Criminal Code is intended to protect Canada and Canadians from terrorism\\". ===USA=== The ISYF was added to the US Treasury Department terrorism list on June 27, 2002. In April 2004, the United States added four organisations, including the ISYF, to its terror list, allowing the US to deny entry (and to deport) any of its members. == See also == * Sikh extremism ==References== ==External links== Category:1984 establishments in India Category:Designated terrorist organizations associated with Sikhism Category:Organisations designated as terrorist by India Category:Organisations designated as terrorist by the European Union Category:Youth organizations established in 1984 Category:Organizations designated as terrorist in Asia Category:Khalistan movement Category:Sikh terrorism Category:Organisations designated as terrorist by Japan Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by the United States Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by Canada ","title":"International Sikh Youth Federation"},{"id":"17304695","text":"Apollodorus is an impact crater on Mercury. Its unusual appearance, with radiating dark troughs, led to a nickname of \\"the Spider\\" by scientists before its official name was decided. Apollodorus is located near the center of Pantheon Fossae, which is a system of radial grabens situated in the inner part of the Caloris basin. The floor, rim and walls of Apollodorus expose a low reflectance material (LRM) excavated during the impact from beneath the light volcanic plains, which cover the central part of the Caloris. It is not currently known whether it played a role in the fossae's formation or if its location is merely a coincidence, although no graben appears to cut the crater rim, and the dark impact ejecta partially covers grabens, suggesting that Apollodorus postdates Pantheon Fossae. In addition, the crater is slightly (by about 40 km) offset from the exact center of the Pantheon Fossae. Apollodorus of Damascus is credited as the architect of the Pantheon in Rome. ==Views== Apollodorus crater EN0233264093M.jpgMESSENGER image at high sun angle, showing the northern crater and possible hollows Apollodorus crater MESSENGER NAC mosaic.jpgMosaic of MESSENGER images ==References== Category:Impact craters on Mercury ","title":"Apollodorus (crater)"},{"id":"17304736","text":"Pyramiding may refer to: * Pyramiding, a deformity in turtle shells * Pyramiding, a practice in using performance-enhancing substances * Pyramiding (tax evasion), a practice where an employer intentionally fails to remit payroll taxes to the appropriate taxation authority ","title":"Pyramiding"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:R}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},H={class:"card-container"};function I(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",H,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const F=d(B,[["render",I]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/32.md","filePath":"drive/32.md"}'),D={name:"drive/32.md"},N=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(F)]))}});export{L as __pageData,N as default};
